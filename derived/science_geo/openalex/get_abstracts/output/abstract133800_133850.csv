Withdrawal of amino acids from the nutrient medium of CHO-IR cells results in a rapid deactivation of p70 S6 kinase and dephosphorylation of eIF-4E BP1, which become unresponsive to all agonists. Readdition of the amino acid mixture quickly restores the phosphorylation and responsiveness of p70 and eIF-4E BP1 to insulin. Increasing the ambient amino acids to twice that usually employed increases basal p70 activity to the maximal level otherwise attained in the presence of insulin and abrogates further stimulation by insulin. Withdrawal of most individual amino acids also inhibits p70, although with differing potency. Amino acid withdrawal from CHO-IR cells does not significantly alter insulin stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphotyrosine-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, c-Akt/protein kinase B activity, or mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. The selective inhibition of p70 and eIF-4E BP1 phosphorylation by amino acid withdrawal resembles the response to rapamycin, which prevents p70 reactivation by amino acids, indicating that mTOR is required for the response to amino acids. A p70 deletion mutant, p70Δ2–46/ΔCT104, that is resistant to inhibition by rapamycin (but sensitive to wortmannin) is also resistant to inhibition by amino acid withdrawal, indicating that amino acid sufficiency and mTOR signal to p70 through a common effector, which could be mTOR itself, or an mTOR-controlled downstream element, such as a protein phosphatase.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Brief starvation engenders a decrease in protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle, which is rapidly reversed on refeeding (1Preedy V.R. Garlick P.J. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The contribution of the nutrients themselves to the regulation of protein synthesis as compared with the concomitant hormonal responses has been the object of considerable study. Insulin, e.g., is well known to stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle; however, much evidence indicates that a major portion of the increase in the skeletal muscle protein synthesis in vivo seen on refeeding is independent of changes in insulin and perhaps attributable to the nutrients themselves (2Svanberg E. Zachrisson H. Ohlsson C. Iresjo B.-M. Lundholm K.G. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 33: E614-E620Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in vivo it is difficult to isolate the contributions of amino acids and other nutrients from those of insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and other regulators whose availability in vivo is altered by nutrients. Mammalian cells in culture exhibit an inhibition of overall protein synthesis with depletion of medium amino acids, which is quantitatively substantial, but rapidly reversible (3Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As with short term fastingin vivo (4Kelly F.J. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6677-6683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), amino acid withdrawal in vitro is characterized by a loss of polysomes and an increase in monomeric ribosomes pointing to a block in peptide chain initiation (5Scorsone K.A. Panniers R. Rowlands A.G. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). As regards the mechanism of translational inhibition, attention focused initially on the role of eIF-2α phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α at Ser-51 enhances its affinity for eIF-2B, resulting in sequestration of this critical, low abundance guanyl nucleotide exchange factor, and thereby inhibiting regeneration of the eIF-2/GTP necessary to bind Met-tRNAi (7Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1994; 1220: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the depletion of amino acids leads to the activation of the eIF-2α kinase known as GCN2, presumably through the accumulation of uncharged tRNA (9Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The occurrence of increased eIF-2α phosphorylation has been well documented in a variety of mammalian cells deprived of amino acids, and in CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; D-PBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; BP, binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum; PKB, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol. lines that contain mutant aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (reviewed in Ref. 3Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 718-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recently, the eIF-4F complex has emerged as an important site of translational control (reviewed in Ref. 10Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). This complex contains the scaffold protein eIF-4G, which binds eIF-4E, the m7GTP-cap binding protein, eIF-4A, an RNA helicase and the RNA-binding protein eIF-4B. The eIF-4E component binds the 5′ mRNA cap; 4A/4B then unwind the secondary structure in the 5′-untranslated segment, thereby enabling the 40 S-Met-tRNAi complex, aided by eIF-3, to efficiently scan the mRNA 5′-untranslated segment to the AUG start site. Both the assembly and activity of the 4F complex are regulated by phosphorylation. In mammalian cells, eIF-4E, -4B, and -4G are each phosphorylated in vivo in a manner that correlates positively with overall translational rate. The regulation of eIF-4E has been characterized most extensively (10Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E, predominantly at Ser-209 (11Joshi B. Cai A.-L. Keiper B.D. Minich W.B. Mendez R.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-270Google Scholar), or stress (13Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and is accompanied by a 3-fold increase in 4E affinity for mRNA (14Minich W.B. Balastra M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition, the availability of 4E for incorporation into the 4F complex is independently regulated through the PHAS/4E-BP polypeptides. PHAS1 was purified as a heat-and acid-soluble polypeptide that exhibited rapid and multiple phosphorylation in vivo in response to insulin and mitogens (15Hu C. Pang S. Kong Z. Vellaca M. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and was independently isolated as an eIF-4E-binding protein by interaction cloning (16Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). The 4E-BP1/PHAS1 polypeptide binds to 4E in a manner that is competitive with 4G (17Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar); thus, the insulin/mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, which inhibits 4E-BP binding to 4E (16Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donze O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 18Lin T.A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), makes 4E available for incorporation into the 4F complex. Although 4E and 4E-BPs are coordinately regulated by insulin and mitogens, examples of discordant regulation are common (13Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,19Feigenblum D. Schneider R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5450-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that the phosphorylation of the two polypeptides is independently mediated. Evidence from in vivo models points to an important role for the 4E-BPs in translational regulation by nutrients. Thus, the phosphorylation of 4E-BPs in mouse skeletal muscle is diminished by starvation and restored by refeeding. Concomitantly, the association of 4E with 4E-BP1 increases with starvation and diminishes with refeeding whereas the association of 4E with 4G, as expected responds in the reciprocal manner (20Svanberg E. Jefferson L.S. Lundholm K. Kimball S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: E841-E847Google Scholar). As regards the relative importance of insulinversus nutrients in the control of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, it is notable that the changes in phosphorylation of 4E-BP in response to fasting and feeding remain intact in NOD and ob/ob mice (20Svanberg E. Jefferson L.S. Lundholm K. Kimball S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: E841-E847Google Scholar), diabetic models who fail to show any change in insulin concentration in response to these dietary maneuvers (2Svanberg E. Zachrisson H. Ohlsson C. Iresjo B.-M. Lundholm K.G. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 33: E614-E620Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eIF-4E is not altered by fasting and refeeding; however, the phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase responds to fasting and refeeding in parallel to 4E-BP1 (20Svanberg E. Jefferson L.S. Lundholm K. Kimball S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: E841-E847Google Scholar). The p70 S6 kinase participates in translational control in a manner quite distinct from eIF-4F. This insulin/mitogen-activated protein kinase, whose major known substrate is the 40 S ribosomal subunit protein S6 (21Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), is critical for the translation of a subclass of mRNAs whose 5′-untranslated region contains a short oligopyrimidine sequence immediately after the 5′ cap (22Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 23Jefferies H.B. Furmagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B.

A. 1994; 91: 81-11477Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite their quite different roles in translational control, it appears that the phosphorylation of both 4E-BP and p70 S6 kinase, but not eIF-4E, is coordinately controlled not only by insulin and mitogens, but independently by nutrients, as reflected in vivo by the responses to fasting and feeding (20Svanberg E. Jefferson L.S. Lundholm K. Kimball S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: E841-E847Google Scholar). Another response shared by 4E-BPs (25Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N.

Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), but not by eIF-4E, is a susceptibility to dephosphorylationin vivo in response to the macrolide immunosuppressant, rapamycin. This effect of rapamycin is mediated indirectly, through the ability of rapamycin, in complex with FKBP12 to bind to the mTOR kinase and inhibit its activity (30Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Mutant mTORs that are unable to bind rapamycin/FKBP12 can protect p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 from rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation (30Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 31Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Recently, mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly in vitro, at sites corresponding to those phosphorylated in vivo during insulin stimulation (58Moser B.A. Dennis P.B. Pullen N.

Nevertheless, the kinase activity of mTOR is not altered by insulin treatment prior to extraction (at least as measured after mTOR immunoprecipitation, Refs. 31Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T.

Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) and the physiologic regulators of the TOR kinase are not known. TORs are 280-kDa polypeptides whose kinase domain is most closely related to the checkpoint control kinases, ATM, TEL1, MEC1, and the DNA protein kinase (33Keith C.T. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 270: 50-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, loss-of-function mutations in both TOR genes, or treatment with rapamycin, each cause a profound inhibition of overall translational initiation and elicit a phenotype characteristic of starved cells entering G0, the stationary phase (34Barbet N.C. Schneider V. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The biochemical steps through which the TORs regulate translation in yeast are not known (35Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); however, they appear to participate in a nutrient-sensing pathway that controls protein phosphatase activity (37DiComo C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The possibility that mTOR might participate in nutrient-sensing in mammalian cells was raised by the observation that hepatocytes incubated in the absence of amino acids exhibit a selective decrease in the phosphorylation of S6, that is rapidly reversed by addition of amino acids but blocked by rapamycin (38Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). These findings imply that amino acids, independent of insulin or mitogens, can regulate the activity of the p70 S6 kinase through an mTOR-dependent mechanism. We therefore set out to characterize the pathways that regulate the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase and eIF-4E BP1 in response to amino acid sufficiency, mTOR and receptor tyrosine kinases. Our results provide evidence that amino acids and mTOR signal to the translational apparatus through convergent pathways distinct from those controlled by the insulin receptor.

For the starvation of amino acids, cells were first incubated in DMEM (293) or Ham's F-12 (CHO-IR) medium without FCS for 16 h, washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS, containing 0.1 g/liter CaCl2) and incubated in the same buffer for the times indicated for up to 2 h. Readdition of amino acids involved changing the medium to D-PBS containing individual amino acids or a mixture of amino acids as indicated. The concentration of each amino acids designated as 1× is as follows (in mg/liter): l-Arg, 84; l-Cys, 48;l-Glu, 584; l-His, 42; l-Ile, 105;l-Leu, 105; l-Lys, 146; l-Met, 30;l-Phe, 66; l-Thr, 95; l-Trp, 16;l-Tyr,72; l-Val, 94. A mixture of all these amino acids, each at this concentration is designated as the “1× amino acid mixture”. Transient transfection was performed by lipofection method using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (31Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T. Andrabi K. Weng Q.-P. Kasuga M. Nishimoto I. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26457-26463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Cell treatments were terminated by removal of the medium, followed by one wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and freezing in liquid nitrogen; cells were stored at −80 °C until lysis. Cells were lysed in ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH = 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin), and the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. Supernatants immunoblotted for endogenous ERKs were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and blotted with phosphospecific or nonspecific antibody against ERKs. To detect eIF-4E BP1, the supernatants were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min (31Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kozlowski M.T. Sugimoto T.

The heat-stable proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody for detection of recombinant FLAG-eIF-4E BP1 or with anti-eIF-4E BP1 antiserum for detection of endogenous eIF-4E BP1. p70 S6 kinase activity was determined by immunocomplex assay by using 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrate (42Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity coimmunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) was determined as described previously (43Endeman G. Yonezawa K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 396-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). c-Akt/PKB kinase activity was measured by immunocomplex assay using myelin basic protein as substrate. CHO-IR cells transfected with HA-c-Akt/PKB were lysed in ice-cold buffer A and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with the buffer composed of 20 mm Tris (pH = 7.4) and 1 mm DTT. The kinase reaction was started by adding the reaction mixture (50 mm Tris (pH = 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm ATP, 1 μm protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) peptide, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml myelin basic protein, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane, and analyzed by autoradiography. Withdrawal of amino acids from the medium leads to a rapid, reversible deactivation of the p70 S6 kinase and partial dephosphorylation of eIF-4E BP1. This response was observed in the three cell types examined: CHO-IR, HEK293, and Swiss 3T3 cells. As regards p70, the already low activity of endogenous p70 in serum-deprived CHO-IR cells (henceforth called the “basal” activity) declines further during the 2 h following amino acid withdrawal, and the ability of insulin to stimulate activity is virtually abolished (Fig. 1, Aand B). This inhibition of p70 activity is fully reversible; reintroduction of the mixture of amino acids at the concentrations used in DMEM (a concentration henceforth called 1× (see “Experimental Procedures”), and used as a reference level for all responses examined), restores both basal and insulin/serum-stimulated p70 kinase activity within 30 min (Figs. 1 (A and B) and 2). A similar response is seen in 293 cells, examining either endogenous p70 (Fig. 1 D) or transiently expressed recombinant p70α1 (Fig. 1 C and6 A). The decline in p70 activity that occurs after withdrawal of amino acids is not due solely to the loss of insulin/serum stimulation, because the p70 activity in insulin/serum-deprived cells also diminishes greatly. This is best appreciated in 293 cells, where the basal activity of p70 is 30–60% of the maximally stimulated activity (Fig. 1 D); amino acid withdrawal, after a slight lag, results in a marked decrease in the already high basal p70 activity that is reversible on readdition of amino acids (Figs. 1 D and 6 A). The changes in p70 activity are specific for amino acid withdrawal and addition; omission and reintroduction of glucose or the vitamins found in DMEM do not alter p70 activity. The ability of p70 to be activated by serum or insulin is fully restored by concentrations of amino acids far below those that maximally increase basal activity (Fig. 2). In CHO-IR cells, full restoration of the response to insulin and serum is evident after readdition of the complete amino acid mixture at 0.25× concentration, and the absolute magnitude of p70 activity after addition of insulin/serum is not altered as the concentration of the amino acid mixture is raised to 2×. In contrast, the basal activity of p70 rises progressively as the concentration of the amino acid mixture is raised, so that at the 2× concentration, p70 kinase activity is near maximal and shows little or no further increase on addition of insulin. The response of p70 to 10% undialyzed serum parallels the response to insulin, allowing for the amino acid content of the serum itself (Fig.2). The effects of medium amino acids on the activity of p70 are due to overall amino acid sufficiency, although the effects of individual amino acids are not equal (Table I). Thus, little or no restoration of p70 activity occurs with readdition of any single amino acid. Readdition of a complete mixture of amino acids at 1×, but lacking single amino acids provides the most informative data (Table I). This removal of Arg or Leu is most inhibitory (70–90%), Lys or Tyr omission next in potency (approximately 30–50% inhibition), whereas Cys or Glu omission are well tolerated, and His, Iso Met, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val omission give moderate, variable inhibition under the conditions examined. Despite the potent inhibition caused by Arg or Leu omission, readdition of either individually does not stimulate p70 activity at all, and the two together enable only slight reactivation.Figure 6A, effect of amino acid withdrawal on the S6 kinase activity of p70 wild type and p70 Δ2–46/ΔCT104. HEK293 cells, transfected with cDNA encoding either with Flag-p70α1 wild type (dashed line) or Flag-p70 (Δ2–46/ΔCT104) (solid line) were incubated in DMEM lacking serum for 16 h, followed by addition of 10% FCS. Twenty minutes thereafter, the cells were transferred to D-PBS for the times indicated, prior to extraction. After incubation in D-PBS for 60 min, one set of plates were transferred to D-PBS containing 1× amino acids for 30 min prior to extraction. Flag-tagged polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. The kinase activity of recombinant Flag p70 wild type or Flag p70 Δ2–46/ΔCT104 was measured by immune complex assay.

HEK293 cells, transfected with cDNA encoding either HA-tagged p70 wild type or HA-tagged p70Δ2–46/ΔCT104 were deprived of FCS, and 16 h later, reexposed to 10% FCS. Ten minutes later, rapamycin (200 ng/ml) was added, and the cells were extracted thereafter at the times indicated.

Two additional TRAIL receptors, TRID/DcR1 and DcR2, lack functional death domains and function as decoy receptors for TRAIL. We have identified a fifth TRAIL receptor, namely osteoprotegerin (OPG), a secreted tumor necrosis factor receptor homologue that inhibits osteoclastogenesis and increases bone density in vivo. OPG-Fc binds TRAIL with an affinity of 3.0 nm, which is slightly weaker than the interaction of TRID-Fc or DR5-Fc with TRAIL. OPG inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Conversely, TRAIL blocks the anti-osteoclastogenic activity of OPG. These data suggest potential cross-regulatory mechanisms by OPG and TRAIL.

Three of the ligands, FasL, TNFα, and TRAIL/Apo-2L, which are type II transmembrane proteins, exhibit potent cytotoxic activity, inducing apoptosis of susceptible cells within hours (2Pitti R.M.

The existence of decoy receptors for TRAIL helps explain the absence of massive apoptosis in cells and tissues that express both TRAIL and one of its cytotoxic receptors (7Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.-F. Yu G.-l. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). However, in tissues lacking the decoy receptor, another mechanism must exist to prevent TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted TNF receptor family member that increases bone density and causes splenomegaly when overexpressed in transgenic mice (14Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliot R. Colombero A. Tan H.-L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M.

OPG inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro, suggesting that increased bone density results from decreased numbers of mature osteoclasts. It has been suggested that OPG may neutralize a TNF-related ligand that promotes osteoclast differentiation or bind a membrane-anchored TNF-related ligand that regulates osteoclastogenesis via reverse signaling (14Simonet W.S.

To identify interactions between novel TNF ligand and receptor family members, we screened a panel of receptor-Fc fusion proteins for binding to TRAIL and have identified a novel interaction between OPG and TRAIL. We demonstrate that OPG binds to TRAIL in vitro and can block TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Conversely, TRAIL appears to block OPG-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis in vitro. These results suggest that OPG and TRAIL may function to inhibit each other.

Soluble TRAIL-Flag was purified from 30 liters of conditioned medium from a Chinese hamster ovary stable transfectant by sequential chromatography on hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad, type I Macro Prep), Q-Sepharose, Mono Q, and Superdex 200 (Amersham). TRAIL-Flag eluted at ∼90 kDa, slightly larger than expected for a trimer, but appeared to be predominantly trimeric by analytical ultracentrifugation analysis. 2P. Hensley, unpublished data. Polyclonal antibodies to TRAIL were raised in rabbits by injection of TRAIL (amino acids 41–281) that contained an epitope tag and hexa-histidine tag at its N terminus. The tagged TRAIL protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies using the pAS expression system (24Shatzman A.R. Rosenberg M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), solubilized in guanidine HCl, and purified by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. TRAIL-Flag (250 ng) was added to 2 μg of receptor-Fc in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween in RPMI 1640) and incubated for 2 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham, 30 μl of a 75% slurry) was added and incubated for 1 h on ice. Complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with binding buffer, electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western analysis with an anti-TRAIL polyclonal antiserum. For binding reactions with full-length TRAIL, the entire TRAIL coding region was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into pCDN (23Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.-L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M.

HEK293 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 10 μg of pCDN-TRAIL or pCDN alone using lipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, regular growth medium was replaced with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After a 1-h starvation, 1.5 mCi of translabel [35S]Met,Cys (ICN) was added to transfected cells along with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 6 h. Cells were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and lysed in 1 ml of STET (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were precleared with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham). 50 μl of the precleared lysate was used in receptor precipitation with 2 μg of OPG-Fc as described above. Binding volumes were increased to 1 ml, and the binding reaction proceeded overnight at 4 °C. Competition was achieved with 2 μg of unlabeled TRAIL-Flag. Complexes were captured with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B, washed twice in binding buffer, and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were fixed for 30 min, incubated with Enlighten (Amersham) for 30 min, and dried before autoradiography. ELISAs were performed according to standard techniques (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunlon 4 (Dynatech Laboratories) plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) (2 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in 0.05 m bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6. After washing and blocking with 0.5% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline, TRAIL-Flag (2 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) was bound for 1 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of OPG-Fc or DR5-Fc (1 μg/ml to 5 ng/ml, 100 μl/well) were added after washing and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The Fc fusions were detected with a biotinylated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates) (1/2000 dilution, 100 μl/well), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotechnology Associates) (1/4000 dilution, 100 μl/well), and ABTS peroxidase substrate (100 μl/well, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). The plates were read at 405 nm on a UV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). For competition assays, serial dilutions of OPG or DR5 without Fc domains (50 μg/ml to 30 ng/ml, 100 μl/well) were added to the plate for 1 h at room temperature before the addition of OPG-Fc (10 μg/ml, 10 μl/well). The association and dissociation rates of the interaction of TRAIL with captured receptor fusion proteins were determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 1000 (BIAcore Inc.). The capture surface was a protein A (Pierce) modified CM5 sensor chip (26O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Peck K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The sensor surface was equilibrated with a buffer of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.005% Tween 20, pH 7.4, and analyses were performed at 30 μl/min at 25 °C. The receptor-Fc fusion protein was diluted into the above buffer to 1 μg/ml, and a 20 μl injection was passed over the capture surface, followed by a 150-μl injection of the TRAIL-Flag. After the association phase, 500 s of dissociation data was collected. The surface was regenerated after each cycle. Sets of 3–4 analyte concentrations, 500 20 nm, were collected and analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis (27O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using the BIAevaluation software 2.1. The dissociation data was fitted on the basis of the AB = A + B model. The association data was fitted to A + B = AB using the type 1 model. Jurkat cells (ATCC) (5 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with increasing concentrations of OPG (0, 0.2, 1.0, or 5.0 μg/ml), DR5-Fc (0, 0.008, 0.04, and 0.2 μg/ml), or DR3-Fc (0, 0.2, 1.0, or 5.0 μg/ml), and apoptosis was induced with an anti-Fas CH-11 monoclonal antibody (0.1 μg/ml, Medical and Biological Laboratories) or TRAIL-Flag (0.1 μg/ml) with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (3 μg/ml, Kodak) for 3 h. The anti-Flag M2 antibody was added to all treatments to normalize for potential nonspecific effects. Cells were stained with propidium iodide (6.5 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) and quantitated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Cytospins of Jurkat cells were fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained for 30 min with 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (1 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim). A modified osteoclast formation assay was adapted from Ref. 28Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar. In brief, bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from femurs of 4–6-week DBF1 mice in the presence of early passage stromal cells obtained from a human osteoclastoma at a 400:1 ratio. The co-culture was established in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 nm dexamethasone, 10 nm vitamin D3. Test reagents were added at day 0, and the cultures were left undisturbed for 7 days, after which the media were removed, and the cell monolayer was stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) or by a TRAP-solution assay (29Lacey D.L. Erdmann J.M. Teitelbaum S.L. Tan H.-L. Ohara J. Shioi A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2367-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the TRAP-solution assay, enzyme activity was measured by the conversion ofp-nitrophenylphosphate (20 nm) top-nitrophenol in the presence of 80 mm sodium tartrate and expressed as OD405 units. To identify interactions between novel TNF ligand and receptor family members, we screened a panel of receptor-Fc fusion proteins for binding to TRAIL by immunoprecipitation. TRAIL bound to TRID-Fc and DR5-Fc proteins as expected (Fig.1 A). TRAIL also bound to OPG-Fc. TRAIL did not bind to DR3-Fc and HVEM-Fc (Fig. 1 A), two additional members of the TNF receptor superfamily, indicating that the OPG-TRAIL interaction is not Fc-mediated. To confirm that binding of OPG-Fc to TRAIL was not to the Fc region, a 10-fold molar excess of OPG cleaved of its Fc domain was incubated with TRAIL and the Fc fusion proteins before immunoprecipitation. Cleaved OPG, TRID, and DR5 effectively competed away the binding of OPG-Fc to TRAIL (Fig.1 B). To determine if OPG could bind to cell-associated TRAIL, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with a full-length TRAIL expression vector, labeled with [35S]methionine, and the cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation by the OPG-Fc fusion protein. OPG-Fc precipitated a protein of the expected size in TRAIL but not vector-transfected cells (Fig. 1 C), indicating that OPG-Fc binds to cell-associated TRAIL. Unlabeled soluble TRAIL-Flag effectively competed with the 35S-labeled full-length TRAIL for binding to OPG-Fc. The ability of TRAIL to bind OPG was also examined by ELISA. Both OPG-Fc and DR5-Fc proteins were capable of binding to anti-Flag-immobilized TRAIL-Flag (Fig. 1 D). In blocking assays, cleaved DR5 prevented OPG-Fc from binding to TRAIL-Flag (Fig.1 E), indicating that the DR5 and OPG binding sites overlap. Cleaved OPG was more effective than cleaved DR5 in blocking TRAIL-Flag binding (Fig. 1 E), possibly reflecting the fact that the cleaved OPG is a dimer, whereas cleaved DR5 is a monomer (Ref. 14Simonet W.S.

Although overlapping, the binding sites of OPG-Fc and DR5-Fc are not identical, since only OPG-Fc recognized directly immobilized TRAIL-Flag (i.e. without an anti-Flag antibody, data not shown). The affinity of each receptor for TRAIL was determined by measuring the kinetics of TRAIL binding to each by surface plasmon resonance (TableI). OPG-Fc binds to TRAIL-Flag with an affinity of 3.0 nm, which is slightly weaker than the affinities of TRID-Fc and DR5-Fc for TRAIL-Flag (1.1 nm and 0.76 nm, respectively). The affinities of each receptor are within the range of affinities reported for other physiologically relevant TNF-like ligand and receptor pairs (30Smith C.A. Gruss H.-J. Davis T. Anderson D.

To examine this possibility, Jurkat cells were treated with anti-Flag-aggregated TRAIL-Flag in the presence or absence of OPG. Anti-Flag-aggregated TRAIL-Flag exhibited significant cytotoxicity within 3 h (Fig.2 A). OPG demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and blocked the appearance of apoptotic nuclei in Jurkat cells treated with TRAIL-Flag (Fig. 2, D and E). However, OPG did not prevent killing by an agonist anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, another potent inducer of apoptosis, indicating that OPG does not activate a nonspecific survival pathway (Fig. 2 A). DR5-Fc exhibited a similar but more potent inhibition of TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig.2 B), likely due to its higher affinity for TRAIL. DR3-Fc, which does not bind TRAIL, did not inhibit TRAIL-induced killing (Fig.2 C). This data suggests that OPG, which is secreted and detectable in the circulation (14Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

OPG may negatively regulate TRAIL activity, similar to the inhibition of TNFα by secreted TNF receptors of poxviruses (35Sedger L. McFadden G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNF receptors are shed from the cell surface and found in the circulation following certain stimuli. It has been suggested that soluble TNF receptors may inhibit or clear circulating TNFα (36Pinckard J.K. Sheehan K.C.F. Arthur C.D. Schreiber R.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3869-3873PubMed Google Scholar). A similar role for OPG might also underlie the splenomegaly in mice that overexpress OPG (14Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliot R. Colombero A. Tan H.-L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D.

In mice lacking the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, there is a decrease in the size of the spleen, suggesting that spleen cell homeostasis is regulated by apoptotic mechanisms (37Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). Thus, if TRAIL is involved in regulation of spleen cell homeostasis by inducing apoptosis, then constitutive overexpression of OPG might result in decreased apoptosis and splenomegaly. OPG inhibits osteoclastogenesis in vitro (14Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliot R. Colombero A.

Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). To determine the significance of the OPG-TRAIL interaction in osteoclastogenesis, we examined the effects of TRAIL in an in vitroosteoclastogenesis assay. Human stromal cells were co-cultured with murine bone marrow cells for 7 days in the presence of OPG, TRAIL, or TL4, another TNF-like ligand that does not bind OPG. 4J. A. Harrop, P. C. McDonnell, M. Brigham-Burke, S. D. Lyn, J. Minton, K. B. Tan, K. Dede, J. Spampanato, C. Silverman, P. Hensley, R. DiPrinzio, J. G. Emery, C. Eichman, M. Chabot-Fletcher, A. Truneh, and P. R. Young, submitted for publication. OPG inhibited the formation of multinucleate TRAP positive osteoclasts as expected, with an IC50 of approximately 60 pm (Fig.3). TRAIL alone had no effect on osteoclastogenesis. However, TRAIL completely blocked the inhibitory effect of OPG (Fig. 3), suggesting that soluble TRAIL may function to regulate the activity of OPG. TL4 had no effect on osteoclastogenesis in the presence or absence of OPG. It has been suggested that OPG may inhibit osteoclastogenesis by binding to a pro-osteoclastogenic TNF-related ligand (14Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M. Elliot R. Colombero A. Tan H.-L. Trail G. Sullivan J. Davy E. Bucay N. Renshaw-Gegg L. Hughes T.M. Hill D. Pattison W. Campbell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Program A.E. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this ligand may not be TRAIL. First, soluble TRAIL alone had no effect on osteoclastogenesis, and the IC50 of OPG is approximately 50-fold lower than the affinity of OPG for soluble TRAIL. Secondly, anti-Flag-aggregated TRAIL, which may mimic membrane TRAIL, induced massive apoptosis in these co-cultures, which is the opposite activity to what one would expect for the OPG ligand (data not shown). However, further experiments will be necessary to fully define the role of TRAIL in osteoclastogenesis and the existence of other OPG ligands. The identification of a fifth receptor for TRAIL suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms control its activity. A soluble antagonist receptor, OPG, and two decoy receptors, DcR1/TRID/TRAIL-R3 and DcR2, may prevent the transduction of apoptotic signaling through the death receptors DR4 and DR5/TRICK2/TRAIL-R2. It has also been suggested that the generation of two DR5/TRICK2/TRAIL-R2 isoforms by alternate splicing may regulate cellular responses to TRAIL (11Screaton G.R. Mongkolsapaya J. Xu X.-N. Cowper A.E. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 693-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Additionally, secreted TRAIL itself may antagonize OPG activity or prevent signaling by membrane-anchored TRAIL through its death receptors, as has been described for FasL and TNFα (reviewed in Ref. 3Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). A complete understanding of these regulatory circuits awaits the determination of soluble TRAIL and OPG levels in vivo and an analysis of knockout mutants of TRAIL and its receptors. Recently two groups (H. Yasuda et al. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95,3597–3602 and D. L. Lacey et al. (1998) Cell 93, 165–176) reported the identification of a different OPG ligand that is identical to TRANCE/RANK-L. TL4 was recently described as LIGHT (D. N. Mauri et al. (1998) Immunity 8, 21–30), another member of the TNF family. We thank Jeremy Harrop, Kristy Kikly, Gordon Moore, Terence Porter, Ray Sweet, K. B.

https://openalex.org/W1997510672,"Transcriptional regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is essential for survival. Since the GR can influence transcription both through DNA-binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms, we attempted to assess their relative importance in vivo. In order to separate these modes of action, we introduced the point mutation A458T into the GR by gene targeting using the Cre/loxP system. This mutation impairs dimerization and therefore GRE-dependent transactivation while functions that require cross-talk with other transcription factors, such as transrepression of AP-1-driven genes, remain intact. In contrast to GR-/- mice, these mutants termed GRdim are viable, revealing the in vivo relevance of DNA-binding-independent activities of the GR."
https://openalex.org/W2143022663,"Gain-of-function mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans gene egl-1 cause the HSN neurons to undergo programmed cell death. By contrast, a loss-of-function egl-1 mutation prevents most if not all somatic programmed cell deaths. The egl-1 gene negatively regulates the ced-9 gene, which protects against cell death and is a member of the bcl-2 family. The EGL-1 protein contains a nine amino acid region similar to the Bcl-2 homology region 3 (BH3) domain but does not contain a BH1, BH2, or BH4 domain, suggesting that EGL-1 may be a member of a family of cell death activators that includes the mammalian proteins Bik, Bid, Harakiri, and Bad. The EGL-1 and CED-9 proteins interact physically. We propose that EGL-1 activates programmed cell death by binding to and directly inhibiting the activity of CED-9, perhaps by releasing the cell death activator CED-4 from a CED-9/CED-4-containing protein complex."

Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for a wide variety of human diseases that range from suppurative infections of the throat (pharyngitis), skin (impetigo), and underlying tissues (necrotizing fasciitis), to an often fatal toxic shock syndrome, and the post-streptococcal sequelae, rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. Bacterial surface proteins play a major role in these disease processes by exhibiting a wide range of functions. As data have become available, it is clear that most surface proteins found on Gram-positive bacteria, particularly those on group A streptococci, have a great deal of structural similarities (1Fischetti V.A. Pancholi V. Schneewind O. Dunney G.M. Cleary P.P. McKay L.L. Genetics and Molecular Biology of Streptococci, Lactococci, and Enterococci. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Proteins for which the function(s) has been defined have been found to be multifunctional, whereas in others a function has only been attributed to one of two or more domains (2Fischetti V.A.

Thus, the multifunctional characteristics of these surface proteins increase the complexity of the Gram-positive surface beyond what has been previously imagined. We recently described one such multifunctional protein, streptococcal surface dehydrogenase (SDH), 1The abbreviations used are: SDH, streptococcal surface dehydrogenase; EACA, ε-aminocaproic acid; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; Plr, plasmin receptor; plasmin(ogen), plasminogen and plasmin; SEN, streptococcal enolase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 2-PGE, 2-phosphoglycerate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cfu, colony-forming units; ASD, azido-salicylamido]ethyl-1–3′-dithiopropionate. 1The abbreviations used are: SDH, streptococcal surface dehydrogenase; EACA, ε-aminocaproic acid; MES, 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulfonic acid; Plr, plasmin receptor; plasmin(ogen), plasminogen and plasmin; SEN, streptococcal enolase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 2-PGE, 2-phosphoglycerate; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cfu, colony-forming units; ASD, azido-salicylamido]ethyl-1–3′-dithiopropionate.as a major surface protein on group A streptococci and other streptococcal groups which is structurally and functionally related to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (4Pancholi V.

A. 1993; 90: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and exhibits multiple binding activities to several mammalian proteins such as fibronectin and cytoskeletal proteins (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). A structurally and enzymatically similar streptococcal protein, Plr, was also identified on group A streptococci, based on its ability to bind plasmin (6Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D.P. Kain S.J. Schroeder B.L. Curtiss III, R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5204-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SDH, however, is a weak plasmin-binding protein (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp.

During our studies characterizing the SDH molecule, we reported that a 45-kDa protein was also found in high amounts on the surface of group A streptococci (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp.

While determining the relative plasmin binding activity of SDH with respect to other streptococcal surface proteins, we found that the 45-kDa protein had in fact strong plasmin binding activity. 2V.

Studies on the ability of Gram-positive bacteria to subvert the fibrinolytic activity of human plasmin(ogen) to their own advantage for tissue invasion have been largely focused on pathogenic streptococci and were described first as early as 1933 by Tillet and Garner (10Tillet W.S. Garner R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1933; 58: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This property was subsequently attributed to the plasmin(ogen) activator, streptokinase (11Christensen L.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1945; 28: 363-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), an extracellular 48-kDa protein secreted in culture supernatants (12Castellino F.J. Sodetz J.M. Brockway W.J. Siefring G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 45: 244-257Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The role of pathogenic bacteria in tissue invasion utilizing this system has recently been reviewed (13Lottenberg R.

In the present communication, we describe purification and characterization of the 45-kDa protein and show that it is the major plasmin(ogen) binding molecule on the surface of streptococci. We also show that this protein has significant sequence similarity with one of the important glycolytic enzymes, α-enolase, found generally in the cytoplasm. While bound on the surface of group A streptococci, this 45-kDa protein is found to retain its α-enolase activity, hence we named it SEN (streptococcal surface enolase). It is distinct from the 48-kDa streptokinase (12Castellino F.J. Sodetz J.M. Brockway W.J. Siefring G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 45: 244-257Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Huang T.T.

Here, in addition to the structural and functional characterization of SEN, we also describe the biological activity of SEN, the functional consequence of plasmin(ogen) binding to SEN, and the enzymatic activity of SEN-bound plasmin. Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal strains of various M types and standard strains used for streptococcal grouping were from The Rockefeller University Culture Collection (New York, NY) and are listed as follows: M2(D626), M4(F694), M6(D471), M9(F690), M11(F743), M14(T14/46), M15(D176A), M22(D943), M25(B554), M35(C171), M40(C270), M44(C757), M49(B910), M51(A291), M58(D632), M60(D630), M61(D336), M62(D458), M63(D459), M66(D794), group B (0902), group C (C74), group D (D76), group E (K131), group F (F68C), group G (D166B), group H (F90A), group L (D167B), and group N (C559). These strains were grown overnight in Todd-Hewitt broth (Difco) and washed once with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate followed by two washes in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.1, to eliminate the presence of any soluble streptokinase, which may interfere with analysis. Type M6 (D471) streptococci (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) were used for the isolation of SEN, whereas the other strains were used to study the prevalence of the plasmin-binding 45-kDa related proteins in different streptococcal groups and group A serotypes. Purified human plasminogen and plasmin (lysine-plasmin) were purchased commercially (Sigma). Plasmin was also generated from plasminogen by incubation with urokinase (20 units/ml, Sigma) in HBS gel buffer (50 mmHEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% of gelatin) containing 40 mm lysine. Conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was maximal after 1 h at 37 °C. This method consistently converted more than 95% of the single chain zymogen molecule plasminogen to the heavy and the light chain of the plasmin molecule as reported earlier (20Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D.P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1914-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified plasminogen and plasmin were radioiodinated with Na125I (17 Ci mg−1, NEN Life Science Products) by the chloramine-T method, using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) as described (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were separated from free iodine by passage over a G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and collection in HBS gel. The labeled proteins were stored at −70 °C. Plasmin was also generated from the 125I-radiolabeled plasminogen by incubation with urokinase (20 units ml−1, Sigma) in HBS gel that contained 40 mm lysine (20Lottenberg R. Broder C.C. Boyle M.D.P. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1914-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More than 95% of the radioactivity was found to be retained with the plasmin. Thus, the specific radioactivity of the labeled plasmin and plasminogen was found to be essentially the same. Furthermore, the specific radioactivity of commercially available purified plasmin (Sigma) and urokinase-generated plasmin was also the same. Typically, specific radioactivity of the 125I-labeled plasmin/plasminogen was achieved in a range of 1.2–2.0 × 106 cpm μg−1 protein. Proteins in the bacterial cell wall extracts were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane as described (21Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2618-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2119-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Blots were incubated at room temperature for 3 h in a blocking HBST gel buffer (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% acidified BSA, 0.5% gelatin, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.04% NaN3) and probed for 4 h at room temperature in the HBST gel buffer containing 2.0 mmPMSF and 125I-labeled human plasminogen or plasmin 3 × 105 cpm ml−1. The probed blots were washed several times with half-strength HBST gel buffer containing 0.35m NaCl, dried, and autoradiographed by exposure to Kodak X-OMAT AR film with an intensifying screen for 15 h at −70 °C. M6 strain D471 was grown to stationary phase at 37 °C for 18 h in 4–6-liter batches of Todd-Hewitt broth. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer (1/50th of the original culture volume) containing 30% raffinose and 5 mm dithiothreitol and 5 mm EDTA. Streptococcal cell wall extracts using lysin (an amidase) enzyme (128 units ml−1) was carried out as described (21Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2618-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated 10-fold using Centriprep-10 concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The muralytic enzyme, mutanolysin (20 μg ml−1, Sigma), was used to prepare cell wall extracts of each grouping strain suspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 30% raffinose as described (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The dialyzed and concentrated cell wall extracts were sequentially precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 40, 60, and 80% saturation. The precipitated proteins were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrated to an appropriate volume. The proteins in the dialyzed preparations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane, and probed with labeled plasmin(ogen). A strong plasmin(ogen) binding activity was found to be mainly associated with a 45-kDa protein of the sequentially fractionated cell wall extract with 40–60% saturation of ammonium sulfate (Fig.1, A and B). For further purification, 40–60% ammonium sulfate precipitates were used as starting material. The dialyzed precipitate was concentrated (Centriprep-10, Amicon) and stored at −70 °C until further use. The concentrated sample was applied to a Mono Q FPLC column (HR10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. After washing with 5-column volumes of this buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 70-ml linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 700 mm and then with a 20-ml linear NaCl gradient from 700 mm to 1 m. Protein elution profile in each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE and by Coomassie stain. A duplicate gel was Western blotted and probed with125I-plasmin(ogen) as described above. The 45-kDa protein eluted at 630 mm NaCl. The pooled fractions containing the 45-kDa protein and exhibiting plasmin(ogen) binding activity were dialyzed against the starting buffer and re-chromatographed on the Mono Q column using the same conditions. The positive fractions were again pooled and concentrated to a volume of <1.0 ml, using Centriprep-30 and Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon). The concentrated sample was applied to a Superose-12 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing both the 45-kDa protein and plasmin(ogen) binding activity were pooled. These fractions were then concentrated, mixed with an equal volume of 4 m(NH4)2SO4, and applied to a Poros BU/M hydrophobic column (Perspective Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4. The proteins were eluted with a 20-ml decreasing linear gradient of (NH4)2SO4 from 2.0 to 0.0m. The 45-kDa protein was eluted in one fraction at 1.32m (NH4)2SO4. The eluted protein was then dialyzed and stored at a concentration of 250 μg/ml at −70 °C until further use. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method (Pierce). N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 45-kDa protein was determined as described (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 23Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified 45-kDa protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The protein was visualized by staining with 0.1% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 1% acetic acid. Plasminogen and plasmin binding activity was confirmed by autoradiography. The section of the membrane containing the protein band of interest was excised, destained with double distilled water, and subjected to automated Edman degradation. Each sample contained approximately 5 μg of the protein as determined by the BCA protein estimation method (Pierce). A duplicate sample of PVDF membrane was digested with lysine-specific endopeptidase (Lys-C, sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim), and the resulting peptide fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis interphased with the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems). N-terminal sequences of the two internal peptide fragments were then determined as described above. All microsequence analyses were performed at the Protein/Biotechnology Facility of the Rockefeller University. The strong N-terminal sequence homology of the 45-kDa protein with α-enolase prompted us to investigate whether this protein is enzymatically active. α-Enolase activity was measured essentially as described earlier by both the coupled assay (24Hunther F.-J. Psarros N. Duschner H. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the direct assay atA 240 (25Wold F. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 227: 301-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the coupled assay, α-enolase activity was determined by measuring the transformation of NADH·H+ to NAD+. The enzymatic reactions were performed at 37 °C in 100 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 3.3 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.3 mm 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGE), 1.2 mm ADP, 10.3 IU of lactate dehydrogenase, and 2.7 IU of pyruvate kinase in a final reaction volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was started by adding 100 μl of the test solution containing α-enolase. The α-enolase activity was measured in terms of the rate of reduction in the absorbance at 340 nm (i.e. increase in the production of NAD from NADH·H+). The decrease of the extinction at 340 nm was recorded as the change in (Δ)A 340 nm min−1, using a Spectronic 3000 spectrophotometer (Milton Roy, Rochester, NY). For kinetic studies, a single enzyme assay was used, involving only the transformation of 2-PGE to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by α-enolase, thus avoiding interactions of the effectors with other enzymes. This reaction was performed at 37 °C in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MgSO4 and 7.7 mm KCl and different concentrations of 2-PGE (9–35 mm) in a final volume of 1.0 ml. Change in absorbance/min was monitored spectrophotometrically at 240 nm as described above. The results were recorded as the rate of PEP release at 5-s intervals for a period of 3 min at 240 nm. To determine the extinction coefficient of PEP, the absorbance of different concentrations of PEP (32.5–1040 μg ml−1) was measured at 240 nm in 1-cm cuvettes. By using the Lambert-Beer formula (A =a m cl), the extinction coefficient (a m) for PEP (disodium salt) was calculated as 1.164 × 10−3m−1. By using 5 μg of SEN and different concentrations of 2-PGE, the kinetic coefficients, K m andV max, were calculated from the values obtained for the intercepts and slopes of the double-reciprocal plots of Lineweaver-Burk (26Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7963) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 45-kDa protein is functionally active as an α-enolase on the streptococcal surface, an overnight culture of group A streptococci (D471) was washed (3 ×) with 100 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, and different concentrations of streptococci were incubated with and without 3 mm 2-PGE in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 7.7 mm KCl as described above. The reaction was allowed to occur in a final volume of 1.0 ml for a period of 3 min at room temperature, after which the bacteria were removed by centrifugation (4000 × g for 10 min). The supernatants were analyzed by measuring absorbance at 240 nm as described above. For the remaining portion of the “Experimental Procedures,” the 45-kDa protein will be referred to as SEN (surface enolase). Polyclonal antibodies to SEN were prepared in New Zealand White rabbits immunized subcutaneously with 150 μg of purified SEN emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (1:1) at multiple sites. Rabbits were boosted twice, each time with 150 μg of the purified protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (1:1) at 3-week intervals. The rabbits were bled 10 days after the third immunization. All sera were filter-sterilized and stored at 4 °C. To prepare SEN-specific IgG, the polyclonal serum was subjected to sequential purification on protein-A Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and SEN affinity columns. The affinity column was made by covalently linking approximately 2 mg of purified SEN to 0.5 g of affinity matrix (Ultralink 3M-Carboxy beads, Pierce) with 200 μl of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide-HCl (Pierce, 120 mg ml−1), in a final volume of 2.0 ml of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 4.7, at room temperature for 3–4 h. The protein-coupled matrix was then washed, and finally the affinity column was equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer, pH 7.4. The polyclonal serum (2–3 ml) was first adsorbed to the protein A-Sepharose CL-4B column using 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, as the initial buffer. After washing, the bound IgG was eluted with 200 mm glycine/HCl buffer, pH 2.5. Eluted IgG was dialyzed against the starting buffer, concentrated, and affinity purified on the SEN affinity column using a strategy similar to that as described above. SEN-specific IgG was then used for immunochemical analyses. BALB/c × SJL-F1 mice were subcutaneously immunized with 30 μg of purified SEN in complete Freund's adjuvant (1:1 v/v). After 3 weeks, mice were bled and tested for antibodies to SEN by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis using a crude cell wall extract of group A M6 strain D471. Affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SEN were used as a positive control. Mice with high antibody titers were given a second dose of antigen intraperitoneally in distilled water. Mouse spleens were excised 3–3.5 days after the last booster. The spleen cell fusion to P3-NS1/1AG4–1(NS-1) myeloma cells was performed as described (27Kohler G. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1976; 6: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar,28Galfre G.S. Howe C. Milstein C. Butcher G.W. Howard J.C. Nature. 1977; 266: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Hybridomas cloned by limiting dilution were grown in 2-liter rolling tissue culture flasks. From these cultures, secreted monoclonal antibodies were precipitated at 50% ammonium sulfate saturation. The precipitates were then dialyzed and purified using a protein A-Sepharose affinity column. To determine the location of SEN in streptococcal cells, an overnight culture of strain D471 was subjected to lysine digestion in 30% raffinose buffer to extract streptococcal cell wall-associated proteins as described above. From the resulting protoplasts, the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described previously (5Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 2119-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins from each cellular fraction were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. The presence of SEN in different cell fractions was monitored by affinity purified anti-SEN polyclonal (75.0 ng ml−1) and monoclonal antibodies (12 ng ml−1) as described (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar,5Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Group A streptococci (D471) from the overnight TH broth cultures were harvested, washed, and adjusted to a concentration of 109 cfu/ml. An aliquot of 200 μl of the bacterial suspension was incubated with 4 μg of affinity purified anti-SEN(1A10) or anti-SDH (4F12) monoclonal antibodies for 4 h followed by a 2-h incubation with colloidal gold (5- and 10-nm sized beads for anti-SEN and anti-SDH labeled bacteria, respectively) anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1:25) at room temperature. The labeled bacteria were then fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4 °C. The fixed labeled bacteria were then processed for transmission electron microscopy as described (29Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1633-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Proteins from the cell wall extract of several M serotypes after lysin digestion and those of various streptococcal grouping strains (group A–H, L, and N) after mutanolysin digestion were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked, probed with affinity purified anti-SEN rabbit polyclonal antibodies (75.0 ng ml−1) for 3–4 h, and the reactive protein bands were visualized as described (4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 5Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Purified SEN (10 μg) was treated with carboxypeptidase Y (Boehringer Mannheim) at a substrate to enzyme concentration ratio of 13.5:1 in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 6 h. Equal amounts of the enzyme-treated and untreated SEN were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and their plasminogen binding activity was determined by the blot overlay method as described above. In another set of similar experiments, plasmin(ogen) binding activity was measured in the presence of 0.1 m EACA or 0.1 mlysine. The ligand binding analysis was carried out using 96-well microtiter plates (C8 Maxi Break-apart, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). The plates were coated with 100 μl of purified SEN in 0.05 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (5 μg ml−1), for 3 h at 37 °C and were then kept at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed and blocked with HBST gel blocking buffer for 4 h at room temperature. A serial 2-fold dilution of aprotinin and PMSF-treated 125I-plasminogen (3.8 pmol) or 125I-plasmin (2.2 pmol) in a final volume of 100 μl of HBST gel buffer containing 2 mm PMSF was added to the SEN-coated wells and incubated for 4 h at room temperature on a shaker. The plates were then washed thre"
https://openalex.org/W2034904195,"We examined the relative contributions of five distinct mammalian phospholipase A2(PLA2) enzymes (cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2; type IV), secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s; types IIA, V, and IIC), and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2; type VI)) to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism by overexpressing them in human embryonic kidney 293 fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Analyses using these transfectants revealed that cPLA2 was a prerequisite for both the calcium ionophore-stimulated immediate and the interleukin (IL)-1- and serum-induced delayed phases of AA release. Type IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) mediated delayed AA release and, when expressed in larger amounts, also participated in immediate AA release. sPLA2-V, but not sPLA2-IIC, behaved in a manner similar to sPLA2-IIA. Both sPLA2s-IIA and -V, but not sPLA2-IIC, were heparin-binding PLA2s that exhibited significant affinity for cell-surface proteoglycans, and site-directed mutations in residues responsible for their membrane association or catalytic activity markedly reduced their ability to release AA from activated cells. Pharmacological studies using selective inhibitors as well as co-expression experiments supported the proposal that cPLA2 is crucial for these sPLA2s to act properly. The AA-releasing effects of these sPLA2s were independent of the expression of the M-type sPLA2receptor. Both cPLA2, sPLA2s-IIA, and -V were able to supply AA to downstream cyclooxygenase-2 for IL-1-induced prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis. iPLA2 increased the spontaneous release of fatty acids, and this was further augmented by serum but not by IL-1. Finally, iPLA2-derived AA was not metabolized to prostaglandin E2. These observations provide evidence for the functional cross-talk or segregation of distinct PLA2s in mammalian cells in regulating AA metabolism and phospholipid turnover.

PLA2 has been implicated in diverse cellular responses, such as signal transduction, host defense, blood coagulation, digestion, and membrane remodeling. According to an updated classification, PLA2s can be subdivided into several groups based upon their structures and enzymatic characteristics (1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar).Secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) are low molecular mass (∼14 kDa) enzymes with a rigid tertiary structure configured by 6–8 disulfide bridges. They require a millimolar concentration of Ca2+ to exert their enzymatic action and have little fatty acid selectivity when assayed in vitro (2Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17247-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In mammals, five sPLA2 enzymes have been identified so far. Type I sPLA2 (sPLA2-I) is abundantly expressed in the pancreas, where it functions as a digestive enzyme for dietary phospholipids, and is present in relatively small amounts in several non-digestive organs, where it may act as a regulator of cellular functions via the M-type sPLA2 receptor (3Lambeau G. Ancian P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ishizaki J. Hanasaki K. Higashino K. Kishino J. Kikuchi N. Ohara O. Arita H. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA; often referred to as sPLA2 in the literature) was originally isolated from inflammatory fluids and cells (6Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P.

Chem. 1989; 264: 5335-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, this isozyme was shown to be induced by proinflammatory stimuli in many if not all cells (8Nakazato Y. Simonson M.S.

Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 225-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some mouse strains genetically lacking sPLA2-IIA are more susceptible to colon cancer, implying an anti-tumorigenic property (12MacPhee M. Chepenik K.P. Liddell R. Nelson K.K. Siracusa L.D. Buchberg A.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 957-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Type V sPLA2 (sPLA2-V) is expressed in the heart, and to a lesser extent in several other tissues (13Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol.

Type IIC sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIC) is expressed in rodent testes but is a non-functional pseudogene in humans (16Chen J. Engle S.J. Seilhamer J.J. Tischfield J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) is the most recently discovered sPLA2 isozyme that exhibits some features characteristic of both sPLA2s-I and -IIA, and is expressed mainly in immune tissues (17Cupillard L.

A phylogenetic tree derived from alignment of these sPLA2s reveals that three related isozymes (sPLA2s-IIA, -V, and -IIC), the genes for which are tightly linked to human chromosome 1, would have emerged from recent gene duplication events, whereas sPLA2s-I and -X, the genes for which map to human chromosomes 12 and 16, respectively, are more distant offshoots (2Tischfield J.A.

Despite many efforts to prove the involvement of sPLA2 isozymes, especially sPLA2-IIA, in AA metabolism, confirmation has not been possible until recently because of conflicting results from different experimental systems. Nevertheless, our recent studies have provided convincing evidence that sPLA2-IIA can promote AA metabolism under certain conditions, especially when “membrane rearrangement” is induced by particular stimuli such as the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1, and tumor necrosis factor (18Murakami M.

However, it remains unclear how these sPLA2s exert their actions on cellular AA metabolism, whether they are functionally redundant or discriminative, and which prostanoid-biosynthetic responses (immediate or delayed) they preferentially affected.Type IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) is a ubiquitously distributed 85-kDa enzyme, the activation of which has been shown to be tightly regulated by postreceptor transmembrane signaling (22Leslie C.C.

In vitro, cPLA2 requires a submicromolar Ca2+ concentration for effective hydrolysis of its substrate, AA-containing glycerophospholipids (23Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A.

The N-terminal CALB domain is responsible for Ca2+-dependent translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to perinuclear and endoplasmic reticular membranes (25Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E.

These enzymatic features of cPLA2 are consistent with its role in immediate eicosanoid biosynthesis occurring within minutes of stimulation, which is usually accompanied by rapid and transient cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. The AA thus liberated is supplied to constitutive COX-1 and 5-lipoxygenase to be converted into prostanoids and leukotrienes, respectively (30Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol.

On the other hand, conflicting results have demonstrated that type VI iPLA2 mediates stimulus-initiated AA release (49Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Studies using chemical inhibitors, antibodies, or even antisense oligonucleotides are limited in their ability to identify the particular PLA2 isozyme involved in certain biological events, since these agents often cannot gain access to certain cellular compartments and they could also cause cross-inhibition or undesirable side effects, thereby leading to misinterpretations. To reconcile the proposed functions of PLA2 enzymes, we have taken advantage of transfection analyses of each PLA2 cDNA, alone or in combination, into mammalian cell lines so as to assess gain-of-function. This approach has enabled us to compare overlaps or differences in the functions of five distinct PLA2s, including cPLA2, sPLA2s-IIA, -V, -IIC, and iPLA2. Our results have confirmed that cPLA2, sPLA2-IIA, and sPLA2-V are involved in “signaling,” whereas iPLA2 plays a role in “membrane remodeling,” but not vice versa. sPLA2s-IIA and -V, which have the capacity to bind to cell-surface proteoglycans, are functionally redundant, and their action requires the activation of cPLA2. Moreover, cPLA2, sPLA2s-IIA, and -V each are efficiently coupled with COX-2-dependent delayed PGE2 generation, whereas iPLA2 is not linked with it.DISCUSSIONTaking advantage of overexpression analyses, we examined the functions of cPLA2, various sPLA2s and iPLA2 in the regulation of AA metabolism. We showed that (i) cPLA2 is a key regulator of stimulus-initiated immediate and delayed AA release; (ii) sPLA2-IIA and sPLA2-V, which are heparin-binding PLA2s, each are capable of mediating cytokine-induced delayed AA release as well as ionophore-induced immediate AA release depending on their expression levels; (iii) both catalytic and cell surface-binding domains are essential for sPLA2s to function; (iv) cPLA2 is required for sPLA2s to act properly but not vice versa; (v) both cPLA2 and sPLA2s are linked to COX-2, which is responsible for PGE2 biosynthesis; (vi) iPLA2 is involved in the basal fatty acid release; and (vii) iPLA2 does not couple with COX-2-dependent PGE2 biosynthesis. Thus, our studies have provided unequivocal evidence for cross-talk between the signaling PLA2s cPLA2 and sPLA2s, the potentially redundant mode of action of the two closely related sPLA2-IIA and sPLA2-V isozymes, the functional segregation of the signaling PLA2s from iPLA2working as the “remodeling” PLA2, and the functional coupling of signaling PLA2 isozymes with downstream COX-2.As has been shown by a number of reports (11Murakami M.

Our present studies have led to confirmation that cPLA2 is certainly involved in IL-1-induced delayed AA release but only when FCS is also present. The requirement for both inflammatory (IL-1) and growth (FCS) stimuli for cPLA2activation may explain why inflammatory cytokines failed to activate cPLA2 during the delayed response in some previous studies performed in the presence of low FCS concentrations (36Hoeck W.G.

Proinflammatory stimuli that induce delayed AA metabolism, such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide, strongly activate members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (60Cano E.

Not only do growth stimuli stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinases, but they may also induce delayed and long-lasting intracellular Ca2+ oscillation that tends to be localized in specific subcellular areas (62Volarevic S.

We therefore assume that spatially and temporally synchronous coupling between local oscillatory Ca2+ elevations and phosphorylation may converge on the prolonged activation of cPLA2, leading to delayed AA release. The essential role of cPLA2 in the immediate and delayed eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways has recently been confirmed by studies using cPLA2 knock-out mice, in which peritoneal macrophages failed to generate PGE2, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor in response to ionophore and lipopolysaccharide, respectively (64Uozumi N.

In Drosophila embryos, Polycomb protein and the trxG protein GAGA factor colocalize at the Fab-7 DNA element of the bithorax complex. In transgenic lines, the Fab-7 element induces extensive silencing on a flanking GAL4-driven lacZ reporter and mini-white genes. However, a short single pulse of GAL4 during embryogenesis is sufficient to release PcG-dependent silencing from the transgene. Such an activated state of Fab-7 is mitotically inheritable through development and can be transmitted in a GAL4-independent manner to the subsequent generations through female meiosis. Thus, Fab-7 is a switchable chromosomal element, which can convey memory of epigenetically determined active and repressed chromatin states."

We now show that in serum-stimulated NIH 3T3 cells, rapamycin treatment delays the accumulation of cyclin D1 mRNA during progression through G1. Rapamycin also appears to affect stability of the transcript. The combined transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of the drug ultimately result in decreased levels of cyclin D1 protein. Moreover, degradation of newly synthesized cyclin D1 protein is accelerated by rapamycin, a process prevented by inclusion of the proteasome inhibitor, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. The overall effect of rapamycin on cyclin D1 leads, in turn, to impaired formation of active complexes with Cdk4, a process which triggers retargeting of the p27Kip1 inhibitor to cyclin E/Cdk2. In view of this novel experimental evidence, we discuss a possible mechanism for the rapamycin-induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition."
https://openalex.org/W2137770909,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is associated with the expansion of a GAA·TTC triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene, resulting in reduced levels of frataxin mRNA and protein. To investigate the mechanisms by which the intronic expansion produces its effect, GAA·TTC repeats of various lengths (9 to 270 triplets) were cloned in both orientations in the intron of a reporter gene. Plasmids containing these repeats were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. A length- and orientation-dependent inhibition of reporter gene expression was observed. RNase protection and Northern blot analyses showed very low levels of mature mRNA when longer GAA repeats were transcribed, with no accumulation of primary transcript. Replication of plasmids carrying long GAA·TTC tracts (∼250 triplets) was greatly inhibited in COS-7 cells compared with plasmids carrying (GAA·TTC)9 and (GAA·TTC)90. Replication inhibition was five times greater for the plasmid whose transcript contains (GAA)230than for the plasmid whose transcript contains (UUC)270. Our in vivo investigation revealed that expanded GAA·TTC repeats from intron I of the FRDA gene inhibit transcription rather than post-transcriptional RNA processing and also interfere with replication.

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) 1The abbreviations used are: FRDA, Friedreich ataxia; TRS, triplet repeat sequences; Pur·Pyr, polypurine·polypyrimidine; bp, base pair(s). is the first autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease found to be caused by the hyperexpansion of a triplet repeat sequence (TRS) (1Campuzano V.

The GAA·TTC expansion accounts for about 98% of all FRDA chromosomes, with the remaining ones carrying frataxin point mutations. The recessive inheritance, nature, and intronic localization of the expanded sequence make FRDA an unique case in TRS-related diseases (2Mandel J.-L.

However, the FRDA expanded GAA·TTC repeats show meiotic and mitotic instability as for other disease-associated TRS.

Together with the identification of frataxin point mutations resulting in a defective or truncated protein, this finding defines FRDA as a frataxin deficiency disease, in accordance with its recessive inheritance. The sizes of the GAA·TTC repeats carried by each patient correlate with the age of onset and the severity of the disease, particularly for the smaller one (5Dürr A. Cossée M. Agid Y. Campuzano V.

In addition, an inverse correlation between the length of the smaller GAA·TTC repeat and the residual amount of frataxin was observed in cultured cells from FRDA patients (9Campuzano V. Montermini L.

The GAA·TTC tract is a polypurine·polypyrimidine (Pur·Pyr) sequence, which may form an intramolecular triple helix in vitro under appropriate conditions of pH, metal ions concentrations, and supercoiling (4Wells R.D.

Pur·Pyr sequences, including GAA·TTC tracts, can also interfere with DNA replication, since they have been shown to stall DNA polymerase in vitro, probably again as a consequence of intramolecular triplex formation (11Mirkin S.M.

These data evidence that such TRS inhibit transcription and possibly DNA replicationin vivo.

The fragment containing (GAA·TTC)∼700 along with flanking sequences (352 bp 5′ and 250 bp 3′ to the TRS) was purified by a 1.2% agarose gel (13Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and ligated into the BamHI site of pUC19. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia coli SURE (Stratagene) by electroporation. The resultant recombinant plasmid contained 110 GAA·TTC triplets in orientation II (Fig.1 A). The SacI-HindIII digest was recloned into the SacI-HindIII site of pUC18NotI and pUC19NotI (29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) to give plasmids containing (GAA·TTC)70 and (GAA·TTC)65 in two different orientations, designating pRW3804 (orientation I) and pRW3803 (orientation II), respectively. To generate longer repeats, thein vivo expansion method was performed as described previously (13Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Briefly, after pRW3804 was grown in E. coli DH10B (Life Technologies) or SURE, theSacI-HindIII digest was loaded on an agarose gel and regions above 70 repeats were eluted and ligated into pUC18NotI. The procedure was repeated several times, obtaining cloned GAA·TTC repeats ranging from 70 to 360 triplets. To clone GAA·TTC repeats into pSPL3 (Life Technologies), inserts were excised from pUC18NotI-based plasmids by EcoRI and PstI digestion and cloned into the corresponding pSPL3 sites. The resulting constructs had the TRS in orientation I. To obtain pSPL3 constructs with (GAA·TTC)n in orientation II,Ecl136II-EcoRV fragments containing the TRS and flanking sequences were excised from the orientation I pSPL3-based plasmids and recloned in the opposite orientation into theEcoRV site of pSPL3. Using the in vivoexpansion-deletion method (13Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), from 9 to 500 GAA·TTC repeats were eventually cloned in pSPL3. For the construction of pMP106, a cDNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from total RNA isolated from pSPL3-transfected COS-7 cells, using primers SD6 and SA2 (Life Technologies). The resulting 263-bp fragment containing parts of the two pSPL3 exons was cloned into an EcoRV-digested, T-tailed, pMOS vector (Amersham). To obtain pMP107 and pMP108, pMP106 was digested with either XbaI or AvaI and subsequently self-ligated. pMP107 and pMP108 contain a 73- and a 159-bp fragment of the first and second pSPL3 exon, respectively. As a positive hybridization control for RNA analysis, theEcoRI-KpnI digest of pTRI-β-Actin-125-Human (Ambion), which contains a 127-bp cDNA fragment of the human β-actin gene (820–946), was cloned into theEcoRI-KpnI site of pGEM-3Zf(−) (Promega) to produce pMP125. For the construction of pMP129, the HindIII-EcoRI fragment of pIND/lacZ (Invitrogen) containing the β-galactosidase gene was filled in the overhangs with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs) and dNTPs, and cloned into the MspI site of pSPL3. pMP129-based plasmids containing (GAA·TTC)n were constructed by digesting the pSPL3-based plasmids with eitherApaI-PstI or HindIII and cloning the released inserts into the ApaI-PstI orHindIII sites of pMP129, respectively. Luciferase gene fragments (661 and 1340 bp), obtained by digesting pGL3-Control (Promega) with EcoNI or HindIII andHincII followed by filling in the overhangs, were cloned into the EcoRV site of pSPL3 in the antisense orientation to give pMP175 and pMP177, respectively. pMP183 was constructed by inserting the HindIII digest of pMP177 into theHindIII site of pMP129. For plasmid preparations, the recombinant plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli SURE by electroporation and the transformant was grown in 1 liter or 100 ml of LB with 75 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until the end of logarithmic phase (OD600 = ∼0.9). Plasmids were isolated by the alkali lysis method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation or the QIAprep Plasmid Kits (QIAGEN). Isolated plasmids were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. The digest was analyzed on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. The inserts in all of the recombinant plasmids were characterized by DNA sequencing on both strands to determine the repeat units. For plasmids containing more than 59 GAA·TTC repeats, the triplet repeat units were estimated from agarose gels and DNA sequencing to ±5 triplets. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Pharmaceuticals) containing 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and supplemented with 2 mmglutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Pharmaceuticals). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. COS-7 cells were plated on 60-mm diameter plastic dishes at a density of 4 × 105 cells/dish. After 24 h, the cells achieved 40–70% confluence and were transfected with 1 μg of pSPL3-based plasmid using cationic liposomes (Lipofectace, Life Technologies) (7 μg), according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method (Life Technologies): 800 μl of TRIzol and 200 μl of chloroform were added to the cells and the nucleic acids were subsequently recovered by precipitation with 2/3 volume of isopropyl alcohol. pMP106 and pMP125 were used as a template to make antisense RNA probes, R-MP106 and R-MP125, by in vitro transcription from the T7 and SP6 promoters, respectively, incorporating [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham) with the MAXIscript kit (Ambion). The reaction mixtures were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel containing 8 m urea, and the radiolabeled RNA products were excised and eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNase protection assays were performed using the RPAII kit (Ambion): 1 μg of total RNA was hybridized to 1.2 × 105 cpm and 2.2 × 104 cpm RNA probes synthesized from pMP106 and pMP125, respectively, at 45 °C for 16 h in 20 μl of the hybridization buffer containing 80% deionized formamide, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.4), 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.4), and 1 mm EDTA. The samples were digested with a mixture of RNase A (0.5 units) and RNase T1 (20 units) in 200 μl of digestion buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 8 μl of gel loading buffer. Samples were fractionated on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. After exposure of the dried gel to x-ray film at −80 °C for 48 h, the amounts of protected products was estimated using the AlphaImager version 3.0 (Alpha Innotech). Antisense probes R-MP107 and R-MP125 were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases from pMP107 and pMP125, respectively, as described above. 1 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel (Ambion) and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham) using the NorthernMax kit (Ambion). After UV cross-linking, blots were hybridized to either probe R-MP107 or R-MP125 at 65 °C for 16 h. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 24 h and 7 days for probes R-MP125 and R-MP107, respectively. COS-7 cells were plated on 100-mm diameter plastic dishes at a density of 8 × 105 cells/dish. After 24 h, pMP129-based plasmid (3 μg) and a luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Control (Promega) (1 μg) were introduced into COS-7 cells by cationic liposomes (LipofectAMINE, Life Technologies) (30 μg), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and lysed by 900 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The β-galactosidase and luciferase assays were performed using the respective kits (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the AutoLumat LB953 (EG&G Berthold). Plasmid DNA was recovered from transfected COS-7 cells as follows: 3 μg of pMP141, pMP180, pRW3823, pMP145, pMP165, pRW3827, pMP175, and pMP177 were separately introduced, along with 1 μg of pGL3-Control, into COS-7 cells in 100-mm diameter plastic dishes using LipofectAMINE (30 μg) as described above. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and incubated with 900 μl of lysis solution containing 0.6% SDS and 10 mm EDTA for 20 min at room temperature. The lysate was transferred into two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, mixed with 450 μl of 2.5 m NaCl, and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 4 min at 14,000 ×g, the supernatant was extracted with phenol twice and chloroform once and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and reprecipitated with 750 μl of ethanol in the presence of 25 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2). After centrifugation, plasmid DNA was isolated and resuspended in H2O. 10 μg of plasmid DNA were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes in the presence of RNase A and the digests were separated on agarose gels in 1 × TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). DNA was transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham) (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After UV cross-linking, blots were hybridized to32P-labeled probes indicated in the figures at 65 °C in 15 ml of hybridization solution (5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt solution, 1% SDS) with 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Membranes were washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS twice at 25 °C for 5 min and 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS twice at 25 °C for 5 min, and then exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 5–10 days. Band intensities on autoradiograms were measured using the AlphaImager version 3.0 (Alpha Innotech). Attempts were made to clone a polymerase chain reaction product from a FRDA patient containing (GAA·TTC)700 in pUC19. E. coli SURE transformants harbored plasmids with a family of repeat lengths containing 110 GAA·TTC triplets at most. TTC triplets were in the leading strand template of all these recombinant plasmids (Fig. 1 A, orientation II). This first result indicated that GAA·TTC repeats cloned into pUC19 are unstable in E. coli, and the instability may be related to the direction of replication, as previously observed for CTG·CAG (29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and CCG·CGG (31Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The insert containing (GAA·TTC)110 was then subcloned in both orientations into pUC18NotI (Fig. 1 A, orientation I) and pUC19NotI (Fig. 1 A, orientation II). The resulting recombinant plasmids, pRW3804 and pRW3803, contained 70 and 65 GAA·TTC triplets, respectively (Fig. 1 A). These shorter GAA·TTC repeats were quite stable in both plasmids when grown inE. coli SURE, but pRW3804 was more stable than pRW3803 when grown in E. coli DH10B (data not shown). Hence, the stability of GAA·TTC repeats in E. coli is influenced by the direction of replication (see below, Fig. 1 C). To clone longer GAA·TTC repeats, we used the in vivoexpansion method (13Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1853-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pRW3804, in which (GAA·TTC)nis more stable, was chosen as the starting material. This repetitive procedure successfully generated repeats containing between 70 and 360 GAA·TTC triplets (Fig. 1 A). The instability of the longest repeats was evident during their propagation (Fig. 1 B). While shorter repeats as (GAA·TTC)70 (lane 1) and (GAA·TTC)150 (lane 3) were quite stable, (GAA·TTC)270 (lane 5) and (GAA·TTC)360 (lane 7) generated multiple deletion products, visible as distinct bands on a smeary background, as previously seen with CTG·CAG (29Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of GAA·TTC triplet repeats on transcription and splicing (see below), we subcloned several such repeats from pUC vectors into the multicloning site of pSPL3 in both orientations (Fig. 2 A). The subsequent in vivo expansion-deletion procedure generated GAA·TTC repeats ranging from 9 to 500 triplets (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, GAA·TTC repeats were much more stable in pSPL3 than in pUC vectors (Fig. 1 B). pSPL3-based plasmids containing up to 270 repeats were completely stable (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2, 4, and 6), and pRW3824 containing 360 repeats showed only slight instability (lane 8). As expected, constructs containing 470 and 500 repeats showed an increasing frequency of deletions (data not shown). When comparing the stability of (GAA·TTC)360 in different orientations, the insert in orientation II (Fig. 1 C, lane 9) was less stable than the one in orientation I (lane 8), as observed for pUC-based plasmids. To avoid contamination by deleted products, we only used pSPL3-based plasmids in which the cloned GAA·TTC repeat was completely stable for further experiments. These contained up to 230 triplets in orientation II, and up to 270 triplets in orientation I (Fig. 1 C). pSPL3 (Fig.2 A) harbors a reporter gene, derived from the HIVgp120 gene, composed by two exons (exons 1 and 2) separated by an intron derived from the HIV tat gene (33Buckler A.L. Chang D.D. Graw S.L. Brook J.D. Haber D.A. Sharp P.A. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4005-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This intron contains a multiple cloning site where (GAA·TTC)n repeats were inserted. Transcription is controlled by the SV40 early promoter. (GAA·TTC)n repeat-containing pSPL3-based plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells and the reporter gene transcripts were detected by RNase protection analysis (Fig. 2 B). We observed a reduction in the amount of the mature transcript containing both exons 1 and 2 (indicated as I in Fig. 2 B) as the length of GAA·TTC repeats increased. Such reduction was much greater when (TTC)n was in the template strand, i.e. when GAA-containing RNA was synthesized (Fig. 2 A, lower inset), than when (GAA)n was in the template strand, i.e.when UUC-containing RNA was formed (Fig. 2 A, upper inset). Specifically, the mature transcript derived from (GAA)230-containing RNA was 6 times less abundant than the one derived from the (UUC)270-containing RNA (3% (Fig.2 B, lane 7) versus 17% (lane 4) of pSPL3 (lane 8)). The protected fragment indicated as II in Fig. 2 B, whose size corresponds to exon 2 only, was also reduced as the repeat length increased, suggesting that accumulation of unspliced RNA was not occurring. The protected fragment indicated as III in Fig. 2 B was also reduced in amount as the repeat length increased and is of uncertain nature, possibly resulting from an alternate splicing of exon 1 with part of exon 2. In the same figure, IV indicates a protected fragment corresponding to exon 1 only. Interestingly, its abundance remained stable in all samples, suggesting that the initiation of transcription was not affected by the length of the TRS. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from transfected cells (Fig.2 C) confirmed that GAA·TTC triplet repeats caused"
https://openalex.org/W2134423247,"Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), an enzyme involved in sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide metabolism, can potentially regulate, in opposite directions, the levels of ceramide and diacylglycerol. In this study SMS activity was investigated in normal and SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts (WI38). The addition of [3H]C2-ceramide to cells resulted in a time-dependent formation of [3H]C2-SM. At 24 h after treatment, normal WI38 cells cleared 17% of [3H]C2-ceramide producing [3H]C2-SM, which accounted for 13% of total radioactivity. On the other hand, SV40-transformed cells cleared 45% of [3H]C2-ceramide and produced C2-SM, which accounted for 24% of total radioactivity. This enhanced production of C2-SM was also supported by an increase in the total SMS activity of cells (measured in vitro), such that SV40-transformed cells had SMS activity of 222 pmol/mg of protein/h, whereas wild type cells had 78 pmol/mg of protein/h of activity. Additional studies aimed at examining the SMS activity directed at ceramide produced in the plasma membrane. Treatment of cells with exogenous bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) for 25 min resulted in cleavage of 90-95% of total SM and the concomitant generation of ceramide. After bacterial SMase treatment, wild type WI38 cells cleared ceramide very slowly (19.2 pmol of ceramide/nmol of phosholipid Pi after 6 h of incubation) and hardly regenerated any SM. On the other hand, SV40-transformed cells cleared ceramide much faster (41.1 pmol/nmol of Pi after 6 h of incubation) and regenerated approximately 80% of the original SM. These results show that the enhanced SMS activity of transformed cells is particularly pronounced when ceramide is produced in the plasma membrane. Finally, several observations led us to consider the relationship of SMS to the putative phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC). We, therefore, tested the effects of D609, a purported PC-PLC-specific inhibitor on the activity of SMS. D609 inhibited SMS activity in vitro. In addition, cellular studies showed that SMS activity was dramatically inhibited by concentrations of D609 used previously to study PC-PLC (10-50 microg/ml). These results suggest SMS as an important biochemical target for D609, and they raise the distinct possibility that many of the roles of PC-PLC, especially in cell transformation, may be attributable to SMS."
https://openalex.org/W2116908394,"The molecular mechanisms controlling the ability of motor axons to recognize their appropriate muscle targets were dissected using Drosophila genetics to add or subtract Netrin A, Netrin B, Semaphorin II, and Fasciclin II alone or in combination. Fas II and Sema II are expressed by all muscles where they promote (Fas II) or inhibit (Sema II) promiscuous synaptogenesis. NetB is expressed by a subset of muscles where it attracts some axons and repels others. However, growth cones in this system apparently do not rely solely on single molecular labels on individual targets. Rather, these growth cones assess the relative balance of attractive and repulsive forces and select their targets based on the combinatorial and simultaneous input of multiple cues."

Although it is clear that DNA-PK is an important component of mammalian DNA DSB repair pathways, it is not known how the enzyme participates in these processes. In vitro, DNA-PK preferentially phosphorylates protein substrates that co-localize on the same DNA molecule (3Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 25Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggests that the specificity of the phosphorylation reaction may be regulated, in part, via the co-localization of the enzyme and substrate target on DNA. Based on these data, it has been proposed that DNA-PK could participate in the DNA rejoining reaction by phosphorylating DNA repair factors that co-localize with it on broken DNA ends (26Jackson S.

In addition, other proteins that bind to DNA strand-break sites could function coordinately with DNA-PK by modifying the kinase activity or assembly of the holoenzyme. In this report we describe experiments that show a functional interaction between DNA-PK and another DNA-activated enzyme, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Like DNA-PK, PARP can bind to DNA ends (29Sastry S.S. Buki K.G. Kun E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5670-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Menissier-de Murcia J. Molinete M. Gradwohl G.

Lett. (Amst.). 1993; 67: 129-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). PARP can be phosphorylated by DNA-PKin vitro, and PARP, in turn, ADP-ribosylates the DNA-PKcs. Furthermore, the addition of PARP and its substrate, NAD+, increased the catalytic activity of DNA-PK. The activation of DNA-PK by PARP is independent of the Ku70/80 complex, and 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline, a specific inhibitor of PARP, blocks the ability of PARP to stimulate DNA-PK. In addition, the stimulation of DNA-PK by PARP-mediated protein ADP-ribosylation was directly correlated with the ADP-ribosylation of the DNA-PKcs. These results show that the activities of these two enzymes have the capacity to function in a coordinated manner in vitro and suggest that PARP may facilitate DNA DSB repair by stimulating the protein kinase activity of DNA-PK. HeLa cells were grown in suspension at 37 °C using RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Miles). HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA-PK complexes were isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts using a Ku80 immunoaffinity matrix as follows: monoclonal antibodies specific for Ku80 (34Li L.L. Yeh N.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 199: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were conjugated to protein G agarose beads using dimethylpimelimidate HCl to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg of antibody/ml of agarose beads. 50 ml of HeLa cell nuclear extract (10 mg/ml) was incubated with 2 ml of the anti-Ku80 matrix for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. The resin was then packed into a 5-ml disposal column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 5 column volumes of HEPES chromatography buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) containing 0.1 mKCl. Proteins that were bound to the column matrix were eluted sequentially with 5 column volumes each of HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.2 and 0.5 m KCl. The antibody-bound Ku70/80 complexes were then eluted from the washed column matrix using 5 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50% ethylene glycol, 1.75 m MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins found in the 0.5 m KCl anti-Ku80 column fractions were dialyzed against HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.1m KCl and further purified by heparin-agarose column chromatography using 1 ml of Hi-Trap heparin-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, and the remaining proteins were eluted from the heparin-agarose column sequentially with 5-ml step gradients of HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl. Fractions enriched for DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 eluted from the column with 0.3 mKCl. Two proteins with molecular masses of approximately 120 kDa eluted from the column with 0.5 m KCl. To purify further the two 120-kDa proteins the 0.5 m KCl fraction was diluted with HEPES chromatography buffer to achieve a KCl concentration of 0.1m and applied to a 1-ml Hi-Trap SP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The SP-Sepharose column resolved the two 120-kDa proteins into separate protein fractions, p120a, which eluted from the SP-Sepharose column at 0.3 m KCl and p120b, which eluted at 0.5 m KCl. Each of the p120 fractions were diluted with HEPES chromatography buffer to achieve a KCl concentration of 0.1 m and loaded individually on a 1 ml DNA-agarose column. The DNA-agarose column was washed with HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, and the proteins were eluted sequentially with HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m KCl. Both p120a and p120b eluted from the DNA-agarose with 0.5 m KCl. Peak fractions from the DNA-agarose column were pooled individually for p120a and p120b and dialyzed against TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin A, and leupeptin) containing 0.1 m KCl. The protein concentrations of the dialyzed samples were determined by Bradford analysis using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and the samples were stored in 100-μl aliquots at −70 °C. Recombinant Ku70/80 was purified from extracts prepared fromSpodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells that were co-infected with baculoviral expression constructs containing the human Ku70 and Ku80 genes. The Ku70/80 complex was purified by heparin-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, and DNA-agarose chromatography as described (33Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J.-T. Bear D.

Recombinant p53 protein was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein. The sequences encoding the full-length p53 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the wild-type human cDNA as template DNA. The primers were designed with restriction enzyme sites that allowed direct cloning into the pBlueBacHis2 vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant baculovirus was used to infect S. frugiperda Sf9 cells, and the cells were harvested 3 days postinfection. The protein was purified from cell extracts using TALON chelating resin (CLONTECH) and eluted with 50 mmimidizole. Recombinant p53 was dialyzed into HEPES chromatography buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration of p53 was determined by Bradford analysis and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Recombinant human RPA was purified as described previously (24Peterson S. Stackhouse M.

Protein microsequence information for the p120a and p120b samples was obtained by analyzing HPLC-purified peptides derived from tryptic digest of gel-purified samples using an applied Biosystems 473A protein/peptide sequencer. The N-terminal sequence of three tryptic peptides from the p120a sample showed 100% identity with the human PARP. The peptide sequences are as follows: SKLPKPVQDLIK, corresponding to amino acids 663–674 of PARP; KFYPLFIDYGQDEEAVK, corresponding to amino acids 637–653 of PARP; and VGTVIGSNK, corresponding to amino acids 592–600 of PARP. Mass spectroscopic analysis of an additional 13 tryptic peptides using a Perspective Biosystems MALDI-TOF Voyager-DE mass spectrometer confirmed the identity of the p120a protein as PARP. The N-terminal sequence of four tryptic peptides from the p120b sample showed a 100% identity with the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (hnRNP-U). The peptide sequences are as follows: SSGPTSLFAVT, corresponding to amino acids 187–197 of hnRNP-U; GYFEYIEENK, corresponding to amino acids 237–246 of hnRNP-U; EKPYFPIPEEYTFIQ, corresponding to amino acids 443–458 of hnRNP-U; and NFILDQTNVSAA, corresponding to amino acids 557–568 or hnRNP-U. Standard DNA-PK reactions contained 30 ng of purified DNA-PKcs (5 μg/ml), 20 ng of recombinant Ku70/80 (10 μg/ml), and 0.57 ng of a gel-purified 43-base pair DNA fragment prepared by digesting pGEM3Zf+ (Promega) with PstI andEcoRI. DNA-PKcs and Ku were preincubated with the DNA at 25 °C for 20 min individually or in the presence of 60 ng of PARP (30 ng/μl) in a final reaction volume of 40 μl as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. Protein kinase reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP to achieve a final concentration of 12.5 μm (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) and, where indicated, 75 ng of purified hnRNP-U as a protein kinase substrate. Standard protein kinase reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Data were quantified by calculating the optical densities of the autoradiographic bands using 1-Dimension Whole Band software (BioImage). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (22Peterson S.R. Kurimasa A. Oshimura M. Dynan W.S. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3171-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Immobilized proteins were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal 20 amino acids of PARP (PARP-N20, Santa Cruz Biochemical, Santa Cruz, CA), antibody 42-26 and the anti-Ku80 antibody LL1 and visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ADP-ribosylation reactions were performed by addition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to the protein kinase reactions to achieve a final concentration of 200 μm, as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C prior to addition of ATP and protein kinase substrate. To examine the ADP-ribosylation of DNA-PK (Fig. 5 A), 60 ng of purified PARP was incubated with 5.7 ng of the same 43-base pair DNA fragment used in the protein kinase reactions and, where indicated, 100 ng of recombinant Ku70/80 or 150 ng of DNA-PKcs. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 200 nm NAD containing 5 μCi of [32P]adenylate NAD+ and terminated by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Radiolabeled products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. To identify proteins that may co-localize with DNA-PK on damaged DNA we used a Ku80 antibody affinity matrix to purify DNA-PK complexes from HeLa cell nuclear extract. Under our experimental conditions, we found that the majority of DNA-PKcs eluted from the anti-Ku80 column in the 0.5 m KCl fraction (Fig.1 A, lane c). In addition to DNA-PKcs, the 70- and 80-kDa subunits of Ku and two other proteins with apparent masses of approximately 120 kDa were also found in the 0.5m fraction. Residual Ku70/80 complexes bound directly to the Ku80 antibody were also eluted from the column matrix (Fig.1 A, lane d). We were particularly interested in the two 120-kDa proteins that co-eluted with the DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 because they appeared to be nearly as abundant as the Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs subunits. To determine whether these proteins were unique to the anti-Ku80 column or were nonspecifically associating with the agarose beads or immunoglobulin chains, we compared the pattern of proteins eluting from anti-Ku80 agarose beads to those eluting from unconjugated agarose beads, DNA-conjugated agarose beads, and protein G-agarose beads coupled to a monoclonal antibody specific for the Cdk inhibitor p21. Small scale reactions were performed with these reagents using the same conditions employed in the large scale affinity purification. Proteins from the 0.5 m KCl fraction from each of the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Proteins eluting from the unconjugated beads and the p21 antibody beads were not detectable (Fig.1 B, lanes c and f) with Coomassie staining of the gel. However, several proteins, including DNA-PK and the two p120 proteins, eluted from the DNA-conjugated beads (Fig. 1 B, lane d) and the Ku80 antibody beads (Fig. 1 B, lane e). As a control, the p21 and Ku80 antibody beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed to ensure equivalent amounts of antibody were bound to the protein G-agarose beads (Fig. 1 B, lanes g andh). These results indicated that the two 120-kDa proteins were not binding in a nonspecific fashion to the column resin, protein G, or immunoglobulin. Interestingly, the results obtained using the DNA-agarose beads suggested that the relative amounts of the two 120-kDa proteins were in approximately equal stoichiometry with the Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs proteins. One of the objectives of the anti-Ku80 affinity purification was to identify proteins that may associate with and become phosphorylated by DNA-PK. To determine whether any of the proteins bound to the anti-Ku80 affinity matrix could be phosphorylated, we performed protein kinase assays using the 0.5 m KCl fractions from the anti-p21 and anti-Ku80 affinity columns (Fig. 1 C). As expected, very little protein labeling was detected in the anti-p21 control reactions (Fig. 1 C, lane a). However, labeling reactions that were performed with the anti-Ku80 fraction showed radioactive phosphate incorporation in several proteins. The most significant labeling occurred in proteins with SDS-PAGE mobilities consistent with the DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and in two proteins with masses of approximately 120 kDa (Fig. 1 C, lane b). The data presented in Fig. 1 suggested to us that the two abundant 120-kDa proteins that co-purified with the DNA-PK complexes may also be phosphorylated by DNA-PK. However, because the reactions were not performed with purified components, the phosphate incorporation in either of these proteins could be due to other protein kinases in the reaction or automodification by the p120 proteins themselves. To characterize better these proteins and their ability to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK, we further purified each of the 120-kDa proteins by heparin-agarose, SP-Sepharose, and DNA-agarose chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This purification strategy yielded highly purified preparations of the two 120-kDa proteins, which we preliminarily named p120a and p120b. To determine whether these proteins could be phosphorylated by DNA-PK, we performed in vitro protein kinase assays using purified recombinant Ku70/80 and DNA-PKcs (Fig.2 A, lanes b and c) and each of the p120 proteins (p120a and p120b) (Fig. 2 A, lanes d and e). In the absence of DNA-PK, there was no detectable labeling of either of the 120-kDa proteins (Fig. 2 B, lanes a and d), indicating that no significant protein kinase activity co-purified with the protein samples. However, in the presence of the Ku70/80 complex and the DNA-PKcs, both p120a and p120b were phosphorylated (Fig. 2 B, lanes b and e). The p120b appeared to be a better substrate for DNA-PK under these conditions. Interestingly, both p120a and p120b were efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs in the absence of the Ku70/80 complex (Fig.2 B, lanes c and f). Control reactions containing DNA-PKcs and Ku70/80 or DNA-PKcs alone showed no labeling of proteins in the 120-kDa range. Based on their apparent molecular mass and the ability of each of these proteins to bind to the DNA-agarose column, we considered that at least one of the 120-kDa proteins may be PARP. Immunoblot analysis of the purified p120a and p120b fractions was performed to test this idea using an antibody specific for PARP. The PARP antibody recognized the p120a, but not the p120b protein (Fig.3 A, compare lanes aand b). We also performed in vitroADP-ribosylation assays using the p120a and p120b samples (Fig.3 B). The p120a protein became radiolabeled in the presence of [32P]adenylate NAD+ in an automodification reaction that was stimulated by the addition of DNA (Fig. 3 B, lanes a and b). Reactions performed with the p120b sample showed very little radiolabel incorporation (Fig. 3 B, lanes c and d). Further confirmation that the p120a protein was identical to PARP was obtained by protein microsequence analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three tryptic peptides showed 100% identity with regions of PARP, and mass spectroscopic analysis of 13 additional tryptic peptides confirmed the identify of p120a as PARP. Protein microsequencing of four tryptic peptides from the p120b sample revealed that it was identical to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein-U (hnRNP-U) (35Dreyfuss G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 459-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Since PARP can bind to DNA, we tested whether the association of PARP with the anti-Ku80 immunoprecipitation complexes was DNA-dependent. Reactions were performed using purified preparations of Ku70/80, PARP, and DNA-PKcs and the same anti-Ku80 antibodies and conditions employed in the large scale immunoaffinity purification. We found the association of PARP with Ku70/80 was dependent on the inclusion of DNA in the sample (Fig. 3 C, compare lanes a and b). Similar results were seen for DNA-PKcs, which only associated with the immunoprecipitated Ku70/80 in the presence of DNA (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes cand d). In addition, PARP did not co-immunoprecipitate with DNA-PKcs either in the presence or absence of DNA (data not shown). Based on our data we concluded PARP was associated with the anti-Ku80 immunocomplexes by virtue of its association with DNA molecules bound to the Ku70/80 complex. It has been proposed that both PARP and DNA-PK may co-localize to the ends of damaged DNA molecules in vivo(32Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), perhaps functioning coordinately to facilitate DNA repair or DNA damage signaling. Since PARP has previously been shown to ADP-ribosylate a number of nuclear proteins (36Kawaichi M. Ueda K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9483-9489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed experiments to determine whether PARP could ADP-ribosylate DNA-PKcs or either member of the Ku complex (Fig.4 A). In the absence of added DNA-PK or Ku70/80, there is a pronounced automodification of PARP (Fig.4 A, lane a), which is consistent with other studies (36Kawaichi M. Ueda K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9483-9489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the purified Ku70/80 complex is added to the reaction, the amount of automodified PARP in the reaction was reduced 2-fold, and under these conditions, there was no apparent ADP-ribosylation of the Ku subunits (Fig. 4 A, lane b). When incubated with purified DNA-PKcs the automodification of PARP was reduced 1.5-fold (Fig.4 A, lane c), and we observed the appearance of a radiolabeled band with a mobility consistent with the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK. To determine whether the ADP-ribosylation of the DNA-PKcs might affect its protein kinase activity, we compared the in vitroprotein kinase activity of purified DNA-PK that had been preincubated alone or with PARP in the presence of 200 μmNAD+. Because PARP and hnRNP-U co-purified with the DNA-PK complexes, we used the hnRNP-U protein as a phosphorylation substrate in these reactions. The addition of PARP to these kinase reactions reduced DNA-PK activity by 20% (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes a and b). However, in the presence of PARP and NAD+, the phosphorylation of hnRNP-U was stimulated 7-fold relative to the control reaction (Fig. 4 B, comparelanes c and d). The observation that the PARP-mediated enhancement of DNA-PK activity required NAD+ suggested that the effect was dependent on the catalytic activity of PARP. To test this directly we compared the ability of PARP to stimulate DNA-PK activity in the presence of the ADP-ribosylation inhibitor 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoline (DHQ) (37Shah G.M. Poirier D. Desnoyers S. Saint-Martin S. Hoflack J.C. Rong P. ApSimon M. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mm DHQ the automodification activity of PARP in the presense of 200 μm NAD+ is nearly completely inhibited (Fig. 4 C, compare lanes aand b with c and d). Consistent with this, the addition of 1 mm DHQ inhibited the ability of PARP to stimulate DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-U but had no effect on the basal activity of DNA-PK (Fig. 4 D, comparelanes a and b with lanes c andd). To gain insight into how PARP stimulates the catalytic activity of DNA-PK, we compared the phosphorylation of hnRNP-U at different time points with and without the addition of NAD+ (Fig.5 A). Without added NAD+ (Fig. 5 A, lanes a–e) the phosphorylation of hnRNP-U appeared to proceed at a slower ra"

To understand how cells recognize morphogen concentration, we have bound naturally labeled activin to cells and related this to choice of gene activation. We find that the increasing occupancy of a single receptor type can cause cells to switch gene expression. Cells sense ligand concentration by the absolute number of occupied receptors per cell (100 and 300 molecules of bound activin induce Xbra and Xgsc, respectively, i.e., 2% and 6% of the total receptors) and not by a ratio of occupied to unoccupied receptors. The long duration of occupancy explains a previously described ratchet effect. Our results suggest a new concept of morphogen gradient formation and interpretation that is particularly well suited to the needs of early development."
https://openalex.org/W2007740186,"The let-23 receptor/mpk-1 MAP kinase signaling pathway induces the vulva in C. elegans. We show that MPK-1 directly regulates both the LIN-31 winged-helix and the LIN-1 Ets transcription factors to specify the vulval cell fate. lin-31 and lin-1 act genetically downstream of mpk-1, and both proteins can be directly phosphorylated by MAP kinase. LIN-31 binds to LIN-1, and the LIN-1/LIN-31 complex inhibits vulval induction. Phosphorylation of LIN-31 by MPK-1 disrupts the LIN-1/LIN-31 complex, relieving vulval inhibition. Phosphorylated LIN-31 may also act as a transcriptional activator, promoting vulval cell fates. LIN-31 is a vulval-specific effector of MPK-1, while LIN-1 acts as a general effector. The partnership of tissue-specific and general effectors may confer specificity onto commonly used signaling pathways, creating distinct tissue-specific outcomes."

To account for these diverse CaR species, it has been suggested that CaRs undergo post-translational modification including glycosylation (8Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S.

Moreover, studies using these same antibodies to probe endogenous CaRs present in rat kidney epithelial cells from both the thick ascending limb of Henle (10Chattopadhyay N. Baum M. Bai M.

However, at present no detailed studies have examined the origin of these multiple CaR species that are present on immunoblots. In this report, we have utilized a combination of immunoblotting, SDS gel permeation chromatography, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation of Triton-solubilized CaR prepared from rat kidney IMCD to characterize CaR associations in both nonionic and ionic detergents. The CaR examined in this study is present in purified endosomes that are derived exclusively from the apical membrane of IMCD epithelial cells (11Sands J.M. Naruse M. Baum M. Jo I. Hebert S.C.

Utilization of an endogenous CaR present in a defined intracellular compartment rather than a recombinant CaR species expressed in cultured cells at high levels and in multiple intracellular compartments precludes a potential complication of studying multiple CaR species that are actually present in different compartments within cells. The data reported here provide evidence that a major form of CaR is a putative dimeric species that is present following solubilization with both Triton X-100 and SDS detergents and perhaps in the cell membrane itself. Previous studies have demonstrated that the non-glycosylated CaR polypeptide migrates as a band of approximately 120 kDa on SDS-PAGE immunoblots in close agreement with the putative molecular mass predicted from its corresponding cDNA (13Brown E.M.

These data suggest that CaRs may also associate with, or be bound covalently to, other protein(s) including a second CaR molecule. Support for the possibility of a dimeric CaR species is suggested by recent data showing that the structurally related metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is a disulfide-linked homodimer in the plasma membrane of cells that exhibits a high molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE immunoblots (14Romano C.

Other antisera utilized included rabbit anti-Band III antibody, a gift of Dr. Samuel E. Lux (Harvard Medical School, Boston), rabbit anti-Gαq/Gα11, a gift of A. Tashjian (Harvard University, Boston, MA), and rabbit anti-Gαi(1–2) and anti-Gαi(3) antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). After animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under anesthesia (100 mg/kg pentobarbital, intraperitoneally), endosomes were prepared as described previously (12Harris Jr., H.W. Zeidel M.L. Jo I. Hammond T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11993-12000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and utilized either immediately or stored at −80 °C with identical results. Endosomal protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Endosomal proteins (100–200 μg) were solubilized by incubation on ice for 30 min in solubilization buffer: 8.3 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl, 1.25 μm pepstatin, 4 μm leupeptin, 4.8 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0% (v/v) Triton X-100 (final concentrations). The resulting mixture was then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min to remove Triton X-100-insoluble material, and the supernatant containing Triton-soluble endosomal proteins was collected and aliquoted into equal volumes for the experiments detailed below. To prepare crude membranes, inner medullary papilla homogenate was spun at 2,500 × g (5 min), and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g (30 min) to give a crude membrane pellet. Triton X-100-soluble endosomal proteins were layered on top of a 5–20% (w/v) sucrose density gradient (8 ml) in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 and ultracentrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 39,000 rpm for 8 h at 4 °C. Individual fractions were then collected from the bottom of the tube and processed for Western blotting. The mass of Triton X-100-soluble CaR was estimated by comparison of its mobility with those of standard proteins including bovine liver catalase, Band III, and hemoglobin as described by Martin and Ames (23Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Clarke (24Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5459-5469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of SDS-denatured endosomal proteins were applied to a 1.3 × 45-cm Sephacryl 4-B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 50 mmTris (pH 8), 0.1% SDS buffer in the absence or presence of 10 mm DTT. One-ml fractions were collected for analyses of both protein amount (A 280 nm) and content (Western blotting as described below). A single column was utilized for multiple chromatographic runs. Five-fold concentrated Laemmli buffer (0.32 m Tris (pH 6.8), 5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added in a 1:4 ratio to sample proteins that were incubated in the presence or absence of various SH group reducing agents at various temperatures and then fractionated using 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1976; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 15% (v/v) methanol) containing 0.5% (w/v) SDS so as to improve the transfer of the proteins >100 kDa (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar, 27Wang K. Fanger B.O. Guyer C.A. Staros J.V. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (20 min) to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by a 1-h incubation in either anti-CaR mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2500 dilution) or anti-CaR rabbit antiserum (1:1000 dilution). After washing to remove all nonspecifically bound anti-CaR antibodies, blots were then exposed to either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. All incubations and intervening washes were performed in Tween/TBS solution (15 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) at room temperature, and blots were developed with the ECL kit as detailed in the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoreactivity was quantified by densitometry and is expressed as percent of total CaR immunoreactivity in the lane (± S.E.), and statistical significance was determined by paired t test. Fig. 1 shows how various experimental manipulations affect the distribution of CaR-reactive bands in immunoblots after fractionation of IMCD endosomal proteins by SDS-PAGE. As shown in panel A, a CaR-specific mouse monoclonal antibody identifies sequence determinants in a highly acidic region of the extracellular domain present in all CaRs reported to date (3Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 200: 295-302Google Scholar). When purified endosomes are solubilized directly in SDS-PAGE Laemmli buffer in the absence of SH-reducing agents (Fig. 1,panel A, lane 1), greater than 90% of the CaR immunoreactivity is present in a broad band of approximate molecular mass 240–310 kDa. In contrast, addition of β-mercaptoethanol (βME) to a final concentration of 143 mm results in both a diminution in the intensity of the 240–310-kDa band and the appearance of additional CaR bands of 138–169 and 121 kDa (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 2). These additional CaR-specific bands produced after exposure to βME correspond to molecular masses of the glycosylated and nonglycosylated monomeric CaR proteins reported previously (8Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H.S. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 13Brown E.M.

Together, these apparent monomeric CaR species represent more than 40% of the total CaR signal within this purified subcellular fraction. Following solubilization in the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, integral membrane proteins such as Band III (28Yu J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9176-9184Google Scholar) and bacteriorhodopsin (29Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) maintain their intra- and intermolecular associations and native conformations (30Makino S. Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4926-4932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Helenius A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 29-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 solubilization of the CaR protein present in purified IMCD endosomes yielded a pellet of Triton X-100-insoluble proteins (Fig. 1,panel A, lane 3) and a supernatant of Triton X-100-soluble proteins (Fig. 1, panel A, lane 4) after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Although both fractions contain a similar distribution of CaR-reactive bands, the Triton-insoluble fraction possesses a 240–310-kDa band that is somewhat broader and constitutes 69 ± 7% (n = 3) of the total CaR immunoreactivity as compared with its counterpart in the Triton-soluble fraction where it represents only 42 ± 5% (n = 8) of total CaR immunoreactivity. The 121-kDa CaR band was not observed in any of the Triton-insoluble fractions indicating that it may have substantially greater solubility in Triton X-100 than the larger CaR species. To examine whether these alterations in CaR bands in immunoblots were present only after use of this mouse monoclonal antibody, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (panel C) was utilized as a second independent probe. Identical CaR species were obtained with the rabbit antiserum as compared with bands present in mouse monoclonal immunoblots. Exposure of either native or Triton X-100-solubilized endosomes to 100 °C after solubilization in SDS-containing Laemmli buffer with 143 mm βME causes aggregation of CaR as assayed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, panel A). Therefore, CaR samples were routinely immunoblotted without being preheated. As shown in Fig. 2, panel B, SDS denaturation of Triton-soluble endosomal proteins in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of 143 mm βME, respectively, yielded CaR immunoreactivity that was mostly present as either a single 240–310-kDa band (lanes 3 and 7) or as multiple CaR-reactive bands (lanes 4–6) identical to those shown in Fig. 1, panel A. The binding of the anti-CaR monoclonal antibody to the CaR bands was specific since it was ablated by preincubation of antibody with excess immunizing peptide (Fig. 2, panel B, lanes 1 and2). Substitution of βME with other SH-reducing agents, including 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT, lane 5) and 109 mm β-mercaptopropanol (lane 6), yielded similar results. In each case, there was only partial conversion of the 240–310-kDa CaR-reactive band to the smaller CaR-reactive bands. To determine whether oxidation of SH groups to form S-S bonds during SDS denaturation contributes to formation of the 240–310-kDa CaR band, Triton X-100-soluble endosomal proteins were denatured in SDS-Laemmli buffer containing 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) that modifies free SH groups but will not reduce S-S bonds (Fig.2 , panel B, lane 7). As shown in panel C, native endosomes were also preincubated on ice for 5 min with 1 mm NEM prior to their denaturation in SDS in the absence of reducing agents (lane 3). Subsequent immunoblotting of both samples revealed that CaR immunoreactivity was again present as a 240–310-kDa band (Fig. 2, panel C, lane 2) identical to that exhibited by respective controls that were not exposed to any SH-reducing agents (Fig. 2, panel B,lane 3, and Fig. 1, panel A, lane 1, respectively). In addition, exposure of endosomes to chelating agents (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA on ice for 5 min) prior to SDS solubilization also had no effect on the 240–310-kDa CaR band. These data suggest the involvement of pre-existing disulfide bonds in the formation of the 240–310-kDa immunoreactive CaR band and not oxidation of SH groups to form S-S bonds during exposure of CaR to either Triton X-100 or SDS detergents. To assay whether the apparent CaR dimeric complex may form artifactually from oxidation of SH groups during our tissue processing and endosome purification, we perfused the kidneys of anesthetized rats with 10 mm NEM in situ then removed the kidneys and rapidly prepared a crude membrane fraction from the inner medulla and papilla using homogenization buffer supplemented with 1 mm NEM. These membranes were then solubilized in Laemmli buffer in the absence (Fig. 2, panel D, lanes 1and 3) or presence (lanes 2 and 4) of 143 mm βME and compared with controls using anti-CaR Western blotting. As shown in panel D of Fig. 2, exposure of CaR to NEM both prior to and during tissue processing does not significantly alter the levels of the 240–310-kDa CaR band obtained under nonreducing conditions (lane 3). These data suggest that the S-S bonds responsible for the 240–310-kDa CaR complex pre-exist prior to tissue processing. Triton X-100-soluble extracts of endosomal proteins were subjected to ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients containing Triton X-100 in the absence of sulfhydryl reducing agents and the sedimentation of CaR compared with that of marker proteins of known native molecular weights. As shown in Fig.3, panel A, i, CaR immunoreactivity was observed in a single discrete region of the sucrose gradient in close proximity to the catalase (230 kDa) marker, where the peak CaR immunoreactivity corresponded to an estimated molecular mass of approximately 220 kDa (Figs. 1 and 2). As shown inpanel A, ii and iii, of Fig. 3, SDS-PAGE analysis of each respective sucrose gradient fraction revealed that each displayed a series of CaR bands including 121, 138–169, or 240–310 kDa identical in appearance to those shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Note that the dissociated monomeric CaR species are not equally represented in each gradient fraction (Fig. 3, panel A, iii). For example, the 121-kDa CaR protein is localized only in fractions 12–14, whereas the 138–169-kDa CaR protein is enriched in fractions 10–13. To determine whether the molecular mass of the detergent-solubilized CaR complex could be accounted for by the presence of a bound G protein as described for the galanin (32Chen Y. Couvinea A. Laburthe M. Amiranoff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2415-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), kainate (33Ziegra C.J. Willard J.M. Oswald R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4134-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), melatonin (34Barrett P. MacLean A. Morgan P.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 6: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), opioid (35Ofri D. Ritter A.M. Liu Y. Gioannini T.L. Hiller J.M. Simon E.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and pancreastatin (36Sanchez-Margalet V. Santos-Alvarez J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1712-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) receptors, a second identical sample was centrifuged in the presence of GTPγS in order to dissociate any complex-bound G proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, panel A, i, GTPγS had no effect on the apparent mass of the Triton-soluble CaR. Consistent with these data were additional results showing that no Gαq or Gαi(1–3) immunoreactivity was detectable in the CaR-containing fractions. Instead, Gαqand Gαi(1–3) immunoreactivity was present in other fractions nearer the top of the gradient suggesting that they migrate independently of CaRs (data not shown). Fig. 3, panel B, shows Triton X-100-solubilized CaR after density gradient ultracentrifugation in the presence of 10 mm DTT. DTT failed to alter the apparent molecular mass of Triton-soluble CaR as compared with ultracentrifugation under nonreducing conditions. To validate further the data shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, SDS gel permeation chromatography was utilized to demonstrate that DTT alters the apparent size of SDS-denatured CaR. As shown in Fig.4, fractionation of SDS-solubilized endosomes by gel permeation chromatography shows that theK av of SDS-solubilized CaR without DTT (0.41) is smaller as compared with a paired identical sample denatured and chromatographed in the presence of 10 mm DTT (K av 0.5). These data are in agreement with SDS-PAGE immunoblotting analyses and suggest that SH-reducing agents decrease the molecular mass of SDS-denatured CaR from a value consistent with a CaR dimeric species to that consistent with a monomeric species. The simplest interpretation of data displayed in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 is that CaR protein in rat IMCD endosomes is present as a dimeric species that can only be partially dissociated by SDS denaturation and SH-reducing agents under standard conditions utilized to isolate most membrane preparations. Derivatization of CaR SH groups with NEM to prevent SH oxidation and the formation of disulfide bonds prior to or during SDS denaturation fail to replicate the dissociation of the CaR complex achieved by SH-reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol or DTT. These data suggest that reduction of pre-existing S-S bonds are primarily responsible for the formation of CaR monomers on immunoblots. However, a minimum of 40% of the CaR immunoreactive protein contained in purified apical membrane endosomes is successfully reduced to CaR monomers, whereas the remainder is resistant to treatment with multiple SH-reducing agents. Although the binding of divalent, trivalent, and polyvalent cations to CaRs are known to activate downstream signaling cascades (13Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O.

Res. 1991; 6: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), only limited data exist investigating the structural alterations that occur in CaRs after ion binding. To examine whether the electrophoretic mobility of CaR is altered by agonist binding, Triton X-100-solubilized CaR was first incubated for 20 min in various concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Na+ at 37 °C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting as shown in Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. As shown in Fig. 5, Ca2+ exposure of Triton X-100-solubilized CaR induced a concentration-dependent decrease in the intensity of the monomeric (121 and 138–169 kDa) CaR bands accompanied by an increase"
https://openalex.org/W2084805930,"Recent evidence indicates that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor mediates a branch of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced signal transduction pathways that activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. However, it is unclear whether the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor is involved. We previously showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase pathway. Here, we identify tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor as an LPA signaling step that requires ROS. To evaluate the role of the tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase pathway, we examined the effects of an EGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PD158780. PD158780 potently inhibited the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase kinase 1/2 (MKK1/2) activation and EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in HeLa cells, while it had no detectable effect on c-Src kinase activity. PD158780 also inhibited LPA-induced MKK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis in NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, we compared LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 and MAP kinase activation, transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter, and DNA synthesis in B82L cells, which lack endogenous EGF receptor, and B82L cells expressing kinase-defective or wild-type human EGF receptor. Results obtained from analysis of these cell lines suggest that the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase contributes to the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase activation, c-fos transcription, and mitogenesis.

Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGF receptor is involved in G protein-coupled receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, MAP kinase activation, and downstream cellular responses such as gene transcription and DNA synthesis. EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor by inducing homodimerization of EGF receptor and heterodimerization of EGF receptor with ErbB-2 or ErbB-4, and activation of these receptor tyrosine kinases (18Pinkas-Kramarski R. Sourssan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y.

However, an increase in EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation can also occur without activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase. First, EGF receptor is basally active in the absence of EGF. The basal phosphorylating activity of EGF receptor is balanced by dephosphorylating activity (22Weiss F.U. Daub H. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of the dephosphorylating activity, such as incubation of cells with a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, will increase tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor.2 Second, other cellular kinases such as c-Src or putative Src-activated tyrosine kinases may also cause tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor (15Luttrell L.M. Rocca G.J.D. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 23Wasilenko W.J. Payne D.M.

By using transient expression of the Src-inactivating kinase, CSK, or a dominant negative c-Src mutant, it was reported that c-Src mediates Gβγ- and LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in COS cells (15Luttrell L.M. Rocca G.J.D. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). However, similar experiments indicated that c-Src is not involved in LPA signaling in Rat1 cells (3Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 17Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Hordijk P.L. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the intrinsic EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity contributes to the LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and MAP kinase pathway. We previously found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase activation pathway (25Rewcastle G.W. Palmer B.D. Thompson A.M. Bridges A.J. Cody D.R. Zhou H. Fry D.W. McMichael A. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1823-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We report here that LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor requires ROS. Importantly, using a newly developed specific inhibitor of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and B82L cells that lack EGF receptor, we have found that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor is involved in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase pathway. Lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleoyl) and enolase were from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-EGF receptor antibody LA22 and anti-Src antibody GD11 were from UBI. Polyclonal antibody to EGF receptor was from Santa Cruz Biotech. Heregulin and anti-ErbB-2 antibody were from NeoMarkers. Anti-Active MAPK antibody and the luciferase assay system were from Promega. Anti-MAP kinase antibody TR12 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael J. Weber (University of Virginia). Enhanced chemiluminescent SuperSignalTM substrate kit was from Pierce. Ray-tide was from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody against amino acid residues 2–17 of Src (N2–17) was from the National Cancer Institute Repository. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (85.5 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. PD158780 (4-[(3-bromophenyl)amino]-6-(methylamino)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine) is a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase recently developed at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research (25Rewcastle G.W. Palmer B.D. Thompson A.M. Bridges A.J. Cody D.R. Zhou H. Fry D.W. McMichael A. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1823-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells were grown and serum-starved as described previously (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). B82L cell lines were grown as described (26Wright J.D. Reuter C.W.M. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analyses of EGF receptor or ErbB-2 following immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in (1 ml/10-cm plate) lysis buffer (50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Precleared supernatants were incubated with anti-EGF receptor antibody LA22. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein G-agarose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (in some experiments, Immobilon-P filters were used). For immunoblotting analyses using anti-EGF receptor and anti-ErbB-2 antibodies, blots were probed with antibodies in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% dry milk. For immunoblotting analyses using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20), filters were blocked with ovalbumin in TBST. Blots were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescent method following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Total MKK1/2 activity was determined using a kinase defective p42MAPK mutant (KR) as substrate as described previously (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Total MKK1/2 activity is used as a measure of activation of the MAP kinase pathway (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Activation of MAP kinase, p42MAPK and p44MAPK, was assayed by immunoblotting using the anti-Active MAPK antibody (Promega), which only reacts with the activated dual threonine and tyrosine-phosphorylated p42MAPK and p44MAPK. For Src kinase activity assays, c-Src was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-Src antibody N2–17 (in some experiments, monoclonal antibody GD11 was used). Src immune complexes were mixed with Src-kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, 50 mmNaCl, 0.01% Brij-35, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1,000 cpm/pmol)) containing 75 μm Raytide in a total volume of 30 μl. After incubating at 30 °C for 12 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 10% phosphoric acid. Following a brief centrifugation, 60 μl of each supernatant was spotted onto P81 filters. The filters were washed 5 times with 2% phosphoric acid and radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined. In experiments using enolase as Src substrate, enolase (5 μg/reaction) was denatured with 25 μm acetic acid at 30 °C for 5 min and added to 1/10 of the total kinase reaction volume. Phosphorylation of acid-denatured enolase was analyzed by a PhosphorImager following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pLucSRE (28Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains a luciferase reporter gene controlled by two tandem copies of the c-fos promoter. To determine transcriptional activity of the c-fos promoter, cells were seeded in 35-mm plates in triplicate 20–24 h prior to transfection. A mixture of pLucSRE (1.5 μg) and the β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβgal (0.075 μg) was used to transfect each plate of cells using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instruction. Twenty-two h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated as indicated in the legend of Fig. 8. Luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega according to supplier's protocol and a Barthold luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined by a colorimetric assay as described (28Yamauchi K. Holt K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14597-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity as an internal control for transfection efficiency. DNA synthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay essentially as described (29Sekharam M. Trotti A. Cunnick J.M. Wu J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 149: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test as well as two sample ttest (assuming unequal variances). Differences in means were considered statistically significant when both tests indicated p < 0.05. To determine whether LPA stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in HeLa cells, confluent, serum-starved cells were treated with LPA or EGF and lysed in detergents. EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed with an antibody against phosphotyrosine. Fig.1 A shows that LPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in HeLa cells. Slightly higher levels of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation were consistently detected in cells treated with LPA for 2.5 min than for 4 min, suggesting a transient nature of the LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. Quantification of the EGF receptor bands by a densitometer indicated that a 2.5-min stimulation of HeLa cells with 10 μm LPA (a near-saturation concentration for HeLa cells) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor approximately 3-fold (3.1 ± 0.5 in four experiments), which is similar to that induced by 0.17 nm EGF in HeLa cells. Other experiments showed that 10 μm LPA and 0.17–0.34 nm EGF activate MKK 1 and MKK 2 (MKK1/2) to a similar extent in HeLa cells.2 To assess whether LPA also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of other growth factor receptors, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 in HeLa cells. While both heregulin and EGF markedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 in HeLa cells, LPA did not appear to affect ErbB-2 in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B). In other experiments,2 we found no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor in LPA-stimulated NIH 3T3 and Rat1 cells (HeLa cells have no PDGF receptor), while control experiments showed that LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in NIH 3T3 cells. Thus, LPA appears to preferentially induce tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. We reported previously that LPA rapidly increased intracellular levels of ROS and that ROS were involved in LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similarly, LPA-stimulated Raf-1 activation is also mediated by ROS.2 Other evidence suggests that ROS modulate the MAP kinase pathway at signaling steps upstream of the Ras protein (30Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). To assess whether ROS have a role in LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, we analyzed the effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. Our previous studies showed that NAC attenuated the LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in HeLa cells (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.2 A, NAC effectively blocked the LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in HeLa cells. Consistent with these results, direct exposure of HeLa cells to H2O2 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor (Fig. 2 A). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor resulted in increased binding affinity of EGF receptor to the signaling adaptor protein Grb2, as demonstrated by binding to a GST-Grb2 fusion protein in vitro (Fig. 2 C), confirming a previous observation (14Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). To verify that the inhibitory effect of NAC was attributable to its ROS scavenger/antioxidant activity, we determined whether other antioxidants could similarly block the LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. l-Histidine and dimethyl sulfoxide are hydroxyl radical scavengers (31Basu-Modak S. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer. Res. 1993; 53: 4505-4510PubMed Google Scholar) that inhibit the LPA-induced MKK1/2 activation in HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fig.2 D shows that both l-histidine and dimethyl sulfoxide attenuated the LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor. By contrast, the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole, which augments the LPA stimulated MKK1/2 activity (24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), slightly enhanced the LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in HeLa cells. These data indicate that ROS are required for LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. A protein tyrosine kinase that could potentially contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is c-Src. It was observed previously that LPA marginally activated c-Src kinase in neuroblastoma cells, but not in fibroblasts (32Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Postma F.R. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report suggests that c-Src mediates Gβγ- and LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (15Luttrell L.M. Rocca G.J.D. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Despite many attempts, we have not been able to detect activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase activity by LPA in HeLa cells (for an example, see Fig.3 B) or NIH 3T3 cells.2 Because ROS positively regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor and the MAP kinase pathway in HeLa cells, we examined whether H2O2 could activate c-Src kinase in HeLa cells. Serum-starved HeLa cells were treated with H2O2 or LPA and c-Src was immunoprecipitated. c-Src kinase activity was determined in the immune complexes using either acid-denatured enolase (Fig. 3 A) or Raytide (Fig.3 B) as substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, basal activity of c-Src kinase was detectable in serum-starved HeLa cells. H2O2 treatment reduced c-Src kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. These data indicate that ROS negatively regulate c-Src kinase activity, which is opposite to the effects of ROS on LPA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor and the MAP kinase pathway (Ref. 24Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Fig. 2). The compound PD158780 is a newly developed, specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (25Rewcastle G.W. Palmer B.D. Thompson A.M. Bridges A.J. Cody D.R. Zhou H. Fry D.W. McMichael A. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 1823-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PD158780 is more potent than another previously reported specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, PD153035 (33Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMichael A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). In human epidermoid carcinoma cells and in mouse fibroblasts, PD158780 inhibits EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of its receptor with an IC50 of approximately 13 nm (34Fry D.W. Nelson J.M. Slintak V. Keller P.R. Rewcastle G.W. Denny W.A. Zhou H. Bridges A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the intrinsic EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity is required for the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase pathway, we determined whether inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity by PD158780 affected LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation. Serum-starved HeLa cells were preincubated with 0–100 nmPD158780 followed by LPA stimulation, and MKK1/2 activity was assayed. Fig. 4 A shows that PD158780 inhibited LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner in HeLa cells. The IC50 value for the effect of PD158780 on LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation is approximately 20 nm, which is very similar to that for inhibition of EGF receptor autophosphorylation. Fig. 4 B illustrates the inhibitory effects of 50 nm PD158780 on LPA- and EGF-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in HeLa. In other experiments, we examined whether PD158780 affected PDGF-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Although control experiments showed that PD158780 (50 nm) inhibited LPA- and EGF-stimulated MKK1/2 activation (Fig. 4, C andD), preincubation of NIH 3T3 cells with PD158780 (50 nm) had little effect on the PDGF-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 4 D). To confirm that the inhibitory effect of PD158780 on LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation is due to suppression of LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, we examined LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in HeLa cells with or without PD158780 pretreatment. Confluent, serum-starved HeLa cells were pretreated with PD158780 (50 nm) or mock-treated, followed by LPA stimulation. The EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, preincubation of HeLa cells with PD158780 (50 nm) completely blocked LPA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. To assess the possibility that PD158780 may nonspecifically inhibit c-Src kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated c-Src from serum-starved HeLa cells and determined c-Src kinase activity in the presence or absence of PD158780 (50 nm) in the kinase reaction. Alternatively, serum-starved HeLa cells were treated with PD158780 (50 nm) and the c-Src kinase activity was subsequently determined following immunoprecipitation. Even though our assay is able to detect not only the basal kinase activity of c-Src but also decreases in c-Src kinase activity below the basal level (Fig. 3), no inhibitory effect of PD158780 on c-Src kinase activity was detected either in vitro or in vivo (Fig.6). These data indicate that the inhibitory effect of PD158780 on LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activation is not attributed to the nonspecific effect of PD158780 on c-Src kinase activity. B82L is a mouse L fibroblast cell line that has no detectable EGF receptor mRNA and protein (Refs. 35Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Carpenter C.D. Gill G.N. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G.

Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar; Fig. 7 A). To further evaluate the role of intrinsic kinase activity of EGF receptor in the LPA-stimulated MAP kinase pathway, we compared the LPA-stimulated MKK1/2 activity in parental B82L cells, and transfected B82L cell lines expressing the wild-type human EGF receptor (B82L/hER+) or the kinase-defective human EGF receptor (B82L/hER−) (27Wu J. Spiegel S. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11484-11488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that EGF receptor was expressed in B82L/hER+ and B82L/hER− cells (Fig. 7 A). The level of EGF receptor expression in B82L/hER− cells appears to be higher than that in B82L/hER+ cells (Fig.7 A). LPA weakly activated MKK1/2 in B82L cells (2.9 ± 0.01-fold), indicating that one or more EGF receptor-independent pathways exists for MKK1/2 activation in this cell line (Fig. 7, B andC). This observation is consistent"
https://openalex.org/W1993109819,"A search of the yeast data base for a protein homologous to Escherichia coliUDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase yieldedUAP1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosaminepyrophosphorylase), the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase. The Candida albicans and human homologs were also cloned by screening a C. albicans genomic library and a human testis cDNA library, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the human UAP1 cDNA was identical to previously reported AGX1. A null mutation of the S. cerevisiae UAP1 (ScUAP1) gene was lethal, and when expressed under the control of ScUAP1 promoter, bothC. albicans and Homo sapiens UAP1(CaUAP1 and HsUAP1) rescued theScUAP1-deficient S. cerevisiae cells. All the recombinant ScUap1p, CaUap1p, and HsUap1p possessed UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase activitiesin vitro. The yeast Uap1p utilizedN-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate as the substrate, and together with Agm1p, it produced UDP-N-acetylglucosamine from N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate. These results demonstrate that the UAP1 genes indeed specify eukaryotic UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase and that phosphomutase reaction precedes uridyltransfer. Sequence comparison with other UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases revealed that amino acid residues, Gly112, Gly114, Thr115, Arg116, Pro122, and Lys123 of ScUap1p are highly conserved in UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylases reported to date. Among these amino acids, alanine substitution for Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 severely diminished the activity, suggesting that Gly112, Arg116, or Lys123 are possible catalytic residues of the enzyme."

It has since been reported to bind several cellular proteins, including the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but the biological significance of these interactions is unknown.

We further show that overexpression of RAP46 in mouse thymoma S49.1 cells inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Conversely, glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and transactivation were enhanced after treating S49.1 cells with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which down-regulates cellular levels of BAG-1, the mouse homolog of RAP46.

More recently, further N-terminal sequences from the murine BAG-1 protein have been isolated by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique, indicating that larger transcripts of BAG-1 exist (6Packham G. Brimmell M. Clevelands J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). From these studies, it was proposed that RAP46 is an in-frame initiation codon from an even larger mRNA, whereas the cloned murine BAG-1 protein is a partial sequence (6Packham G. Brimmell M. Clevelands J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, BAG-1 has been shown to be a multifunctional protein. (i) It binds the catalytic domain of the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase Raf-1 and activates this kinase in vitro (7Wang H.-G. Takayama S. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7063-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). (ii) It also binds to the plasma membrane-associated receptors for hepatic growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, thereby enhancing their ability to protect cells from apoptosis (4Bardelli A. Longati P. Albero D. Goruppi S. Schneider C. Ponzetto C. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6205-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). (iii) BAG-1 further interacts with Bcl-2 and potentiates the anti-apoptotic function of this protein (3Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Recently, both RAP46 and BAG-1 were shown to function as molecular modulators of the chaperones hsp70 and hsc70 (2Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Takayama S. Brimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). They bound and interfered with the ability of these proteins to refold unfolded proteins (2Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Takayama S. Brimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus, BAG-1 and RAP46 may be novel chaperone regulatory proteins linking signal transduction pathways with the cellular apoptotic process and steroid hormone action. We therefore examined the role of RAP46 in transactivation by the GR and in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. The GR belongs to a class of ligand-binding transcription factors that play diverse roles in development, differentiation, and cellular proliferation (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Members of this class contain an N-terminal modulator domain, a centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a hinge region that separates this domain from a carboxyl-terminal hormone-binding domain (9Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by these receptors requires additional regulators termed coactivators and corepressors (10Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 11McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Bioessays. 1996; 19: 153-160Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Coactivators bind mainly to a region known as AF-2 in the hormone-binding domain and enhance ligand-activated transcriptional activity of the receptors (10Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9525-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) interact with the hinge region of members of the thyroid and retinoic acid receptor family and inhibit their activity in the absence of hormone (12Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 14Chen D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). The GR also associates with a number of cofactors, including the Ada adaptor complex (17Henriksson A. Almlöf T. Ford J. McEwan I.J Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 14-3-3η (18Wakui H. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Zilliacus J. J.

Micjhalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and RAP46 (1Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but not all of these interactions have been functionally analyzed. In this study, we demonstrate that RAP46 interacts with the hinge region of the GR and down-regulates the transcriptional activity of this receptor. Overexpression of RAP46 inhibits glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis in mouse thymoma cells, whereas down-regulation of the levels of the mouse homolog of RAP46 in the same cells enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. These findings identify RAP46 as a negative regulator that links the activity of the GR with the cellular apoptotic pathway. Wild-type and mutant GR vectors have been previously described by Hollenberg et al. (20Hollenberg S.M. Giguère V. Segui P. Evans R. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), and the mutant A458T by Heck et al. (21Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). These constructs either were used as Rous sarcoma virus-based mammalian expression vectors (20Hollenberg S.M. Giguère V. Segui P. Evans R. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar,21Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) or were recloned into the plasmid pBAT (22Annweiler A. Hipskind R.A. Wirth T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 193750Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) for in vitrotranscription/translation reactions. The plasmid pHCwtCAT and pHCwtLUC constructs have been previously described (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar, 24Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Göttlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid GST-RAP46 was obtained by cloning the coding sequence of RAP46 in frame into the multiple cloning site of the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The constructs Gal4-DBD, Gal4-NFI/CTF1, and pHC8/17MX2 have been previously described (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). Gal4-RAP46 fusion protein-encoding plasmid was generated by cloning the RAP46 sequence in frame into pSG424 (the Gal4-DBD vector) (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). Androgen receptor expression vector has been previously described (25Gast A. Neuschmid-Kaspar F. Klocker H. Cato A.C.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells, human Jurkat cells, simian kidney COS-7 cells, and mouse thymoma S49.1 cells were all cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. All the culture media contained 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Unless otherwise stated, transient transfection of JEG-3 and COS-7 cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. In this assay, the activity of the reporter gene was occasionally normalized by the inclusion of the plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the transfection mixture. This plasmid consists of a β-galactosidase coding sequence controlled by the SV40 promoter. Results obtained with this internal control were no different from those generated with equal amounts of cellular proteins. Cellular extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were obtained from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GR and RAP46 constructs with the use of electroporation as described previously (25Gast A. Neuschmid-Kaspar F. Klocker H. Cato A.C.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Stable and transient transfections in S49.1 cells were carried out by a DEAE-dextran method previously described for lymphoid cell lines (26Fujita T. Shibuya H. Ohashi T. Yamanishi K. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1986; 46: 401-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of DNA/2 × 106 cells was resuspended in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 mm Na2HPO4) containing 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then treated with 1% Me2SO for 3 min and thereafter washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and resuspended in culture medium. In some experiments, 1 μg of Renilla luciferase expression vector was cotransfected to help quantify the efficiency of transfection. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and luciferase enzyme activity determinations were performed as described previously (27Schneikert J. Peterziel H. Defossez P.A. Klocker H. de Launoit Y. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23907-23913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For stable transfection, the transfected S49.1 cells were selected for 3 weeks in medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml puromycin. Puromycin-resistant pools of cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates and verified for expression of RAP46 by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was carried out as described previously (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar), except that the primer pairs 5′-CCGGATCCCAGGGCGAAGAGATGAAT-3′ and 5′-AAGAATTCGGCCAGGGCAAAGTTTGT-3′ were used. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers used were 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. Poly(A)+ RNA from ∼107 cells was prepared and subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (28Nebl G. Mermod N. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7371-7378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filters were hybridized with a randomly primed radioactively labeled 0.9-kilobase pairEcoRI fragment of RAP46 cDNA (1Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment of the human elongation factor 1α gene (29Kim D.W. Uetsuki T. Kaziro Y. Yamaguchi N. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined with the annexin V procedure (30Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie C.A.A. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and annexin incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2). Thereafter, they were resuspended in 100 μl of annexin incubation buffer containing 0.02 volume of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V stock solution provided by the manufacturer and incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStarPLUS, Becton Dickinson) after diluting the samples to 500 μl with annexin incubation buffer containing 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. This latter treatment was important to distinguish cells that had lost membrane integrity. Only propidium iodide-negative cells were further analyzed. The production of GST and GST-RAP46 as well as the pull-down experiments were performed as described previously (27Schneikert J. Peterziel H. Defossez P.A. Klocker H. de Launoit Y. Cato A.C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23907-23913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), with the exception that the in vitro translated products were made 3 mwith urea and incubated for 30 min on ice. Thereafter, the concentration of urea was reduced to 1 m before binding to the glutathione-Sepharose beads. The urea treatment increased binding of the GR to RAP46. Identical results were obtained in the absence of urea, albeit with a lower binding efficiency. Preparation of whole cell extract and EMSA were performed as described previously (25Gast A. Neuschmid-Kaspar F. Klocker H. Cato A.C.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate how RAP46 influences GR activity, we examined its effect on transactivation by the receptor in a transient transfection assay. As recipient cells, receptor-negative JEG-3 cells that express moderate endogenous levels of RAP46 were transfected with GR and RAP46 expression vectors and an indicator construct. This construct consists of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter driving the expression of a luciferase gene. As a negative control, an androgen receptor (AR) expression vector was used instead of the GR. The GR was activated by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, and the AR by the androgen dihydrotestosterone. Transactivation by the GR was inhibited by different amounts of transfected RAP46 (Fig. 1 A,hatched bars) without any noticeable effect on the basal level of expression (data not shown). In contrast, RAP46 did not repress transactivation by the AR (Fig. 1 A, open bars), indicating a specific negative regulatory action of this protein on GR function. To determine whether RAP46 itself is transcriptionally active, we fused it to the DBD of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and expressed the fusion protein with a GAL4 reporter gene in COS-7 cells. The activity of the GAL4 reporter gene was not affected, showing that RAP46 is transcriptionally inactive (data not shown). A different result was obtained when Gal4-RAP46 and the GR were expressed together with an MMTV indicator gene in which an NFI/CTF1-binding site next to the GR-binding sites had been replaced by Gal4-binding sites (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, Gal4-RAP46 compared with Gal4-DBD alone repressed the glucocorticoid response by 50% (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the transcription factor NFI/CTF1 linked to Gal4-DBD (Gal4-NFI/CTF1) enhanced glucocorticoid response (Fig. 1 B), as we have previously reported (23Nebl G. Cato A.C.B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 85-95PubMed Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that when physically close to the GR, RAP46 inhibits transactivation by the GR. As transactivation is dependent on the ability of the GR to bind DNA, we investigated whether RAP46 interferes with this activity of the receptor. COS-7 cells were transfected with the GR by electroporation, and cellular extracts from the transfected cells were used for EMSA. These experiments showed that RAP46 drastically reduced the DNA binding activity of the GR (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 3and 5). To clearly demonstrate the effect of RAP46, an anti-GR antibody that stabilizes GR-DNA interactions (21Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) was added to the reaction mixture. Even in the presence of this antibody, the negative effect of RAP on the DNA binding activity of the GR was still evident (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 4 and 6). Extracts from cells transfected with the empty vector or with RAP46 alone did not bind DNA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1, 2, 9, and 10). Down-regulation of the DNA binding activity of the GR by RAP46 occurred in the absence of an altered receptor level as shown by immunoblots with the same cellular extracts used for the EMSA (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3and 4 withlanes 5and 6). The increased level of the GR inlanes 7and 8 arises from transfection of double the amount of the GR expression vector. Thus, negative regulation of DNA binding activity by RAP46 is one of the means used by this protein to inhibit transactivation by the GR. The negative effect of RAP46 on transactivation and the DNA binding activity of the GR possibly occurs through an interaction of this protein with the GR. To determine this, we performed GST pull-down assays in which we used the wild-type GR and deletion mutants lacking the N-terminal transactivation region (Δ9–385) (20Hollenberg S.M. Giguère V. Segui P. Evans R. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the DBD (Δ428–490), or the hinge region (Δ490–515) (20Hollenberg S.M. Giguère V. Segui P. Evans R. Cell. 1987; 49: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The receptor constructs were labeled in vitro by translation and allowed to interact with GST or GST-RAP46 proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. In these experiments, the wild-type GR and the two mutants Δ9–385 and Δ428–490 preferentially interacted with GST-RAP46 as opposed to GST (Fig.3 A, lanes 6–11), but not the hinge region deletion Δ490–515 (Fig. 3 A,lanes 12and 13). We therefore concluded that the hinge region (amino acids 490–515) of the GR is the site of interaction with RAP46. These GST pull-down results were corroborated by results of transfection experiments in which deletion mutants and a point mutant of the GR were cotransfected with the MMTV luciferase indicator gene into JEG-3 cells. RAP46 down-regulated the activity of the wild-type GR and all the mutants, with the exception of the hinge region mutant Δ490–515 (Fig. 3 B), despite the fact that the wild-type and mutant receptors were all expressed at identical levels (data not shown). Thus, the GST pull-down and transfection experiments together demonstrate the contribution of the hinge region of the GR to the RAP46-mediated negative regulation of glucocorticoid action. Since the functional activity of the GR is also required for glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis, we investigated the effect of RAP46 on this process. To this end, we overexpressed RAP46 by stable transfection into thymoma S49.1 cells, and positive clones were analyzed for their ability to undergo apoptosis upon glucocorticoid treatment. All the positive clones expressed RAP46 as well as the GR, but were resistant to GR-induced apoptosis. These results have been demonstrated in Fig. 4 with a representative RAP46 expression clone (clone 1). The level of RAP46 expressed in the transfected clones was so low that it could only be detected by RT-PCR. In Fig. 4 A, these results are shown with mRNAs derived from clone 1 as well as from a clone containing an empty expression vector and, as positive control, with mRNA from glucocorticoid-resistant Jurkat cells (31Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Overexpression of RAP46 was detected in clone 1 and in the Jurkat cells, but not in the S49.1 cells containing the empty vector (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–3). Clone 1 also expressed the GR as demonstrated by an immunoblot assay (Fig. 4 B). Nevertheless, upon treatment with dexamethasone, it did not undergo apoptosis as determined by flow cytometric measurements (Fig. 4 C). This observation was also made with all the other RAP46-expressing cells and the Jurkat cells (data not shown). Note that a smear was obtained in the RT-PCR with mRNA from mouse S49.1 cells that contain BAG-1 but no RAP46 sequences (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). This is most likely due to a nonspecific amplification reaction. Since the RAP46 3′-primer used is homologous to sequences in BAG-1, amplification products may be obtained if the RAP46 5′-primer hybridizes nonspecifically to the BAG-1 sequence. Interestingly, Jurkat cells that are resistant to glucocorticoids express a relatively high level of RAP46. These cells probably express several isoforms of this gene since the RT-PCR products, compared with those obtained with the RAP46-transfected S49.1 cells, showed fragments with retarded electrophoretic mobility (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 2 and3 withlanes 5 and 6). The inability of RAP46-expressing cells to respond to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis correlated with the inhibition of glucocorticoid-mediated cell cycle arrest by RAP46 (data not shown) and with the inhibition of GR-induced transactivation. Clone 1 and two other RAP46-expressing clones, but not the clone with the empty expression vector, failed to show a dexamethasone-induced transactivation of the MMTV promoter construct in a transient transfection assay (Fig. 4 D). A cotransfectedRenilla luciferase construct demonstrated that all the clones examined were transfectable (Fig. 4 D, lower panel). This rules out differences in transfection efficiency as the cause for the lack of GR-induced transactivation in the RAP46-expressing cells. Thus, overexpression of RAP46 inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and transactivation. The complete block of transactivation by the GR in the S49.1 cells by overexpression of RAP46 (Fig. 4 D) strongly contrasts with the 80% inhibition in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1 A). The reason for this difference is unknown at the moment. To further confirm the inverse correlation between increased expression of RAP46 and a reduced activity of the GR, we decreased the level of the mouse homolog of RAP46 (BAG-1) in S49.1 cells and expected an increase in GR-induced apoptosis and transactivation. This was done by treating the S49.1 cells with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which is known to decrease BAG-1 levels (32Adachi M. Sekiya M. Torigoe T. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Miyazaki T. Minami Y. Taniguchi T. Imai K. Blood. 1996; 88: 4118-4123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment decreased the Bag-1 mRNA level in the S49.1 cells by 40% (Fig.5 A) and BAG-1 protein levels to the same extent (data not shown). At the same time, it produced a slight increase in GR-mediated transactivation (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with reports of other investigators (33Ishizuka T. Sakata N. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Tereda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Ning Y.-M. Sánchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sánchez E.R. Hu J.-L. Ning Y.-M. Gametchu B. Glucocorticoid Receptor Structure and Leukemic Cell Response. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 105-123Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment also enhanced the apoptotic signal of dexamethasone, although it had no effect on its own (Fig. 5 C), as previously reported by Ishizuka et al. (33Ishizuka T. Sakata N. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Tereda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm that the down-regulation of BAG-1 expression by rapamycin was directly responsible for the increase in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis and transactivation, we repeated the apoptosis experiments with S49.1 cells stably transfected with RAP46. In these experiments, we hoped that the overexpressed RAP46 would overcome the effect of rapamycin. As we expected, apoptosis in these cells was no longer induced by dexamethasone even in the absence of rapamycin (Fig.6). Similarly, the cells were also resistant to transactivation by the GR (data not shown). These results together prove a negative regulatory effect of RAP46 and endogenous BAG-1 on GR-induced apoptosis and transactivation. We have shown in this work that RAP46 represses transactivation by the GR. This was demonstrated by transient transfection experiments in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells and simian COS-7 cells. Inhibition of GR transactivation activity was also observed in mouse thymoma S49.1 cells stably transfected with RAP46. The negative effect of RAP46 correlated with inhibition of GR-induced apoptosis. Conversely, rapamycin-mediated down-regulation of BAG-1, the mouse homolog of RAP46, enhanced transactivation by the GR and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Potentiation of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis by rapamycin may occur through a number of processes since this drug interferes with several signal transduction pathways (for review, see Ref. 36Abraham R.T.

It was therefore necessary for us to demonstrate that the effect of this drug on glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is linked directly with down-regulation of BAG-1 levels. We achieved this in experiments in which we analyzed the effect of rapamycin in S49.1 cells that overexpress RAP46. We showed that RAP46 not only abolished the effect of rapamycin on dexamethasone-mediated responses, but also inhibited the response mediated by dexamethasone alone. This suggests either that the level of the transfected RAP46 far exceeded the amount needed to overcome the repressed endogenous level of BAG-1 or, alternatively, that RAP46 may be functionally more potent than BAG-1. To distinguish between these two possibilities would require a direct comparison of the function of RAP46 and the full-length murine BAG-1 sequence in GR-mediated transactivation and GR-induced apoptosis. Contradictory reports exist on how the GR contributes to apoptosis. SRG3, a member of the SW1·SNF complex of coactivators of the GR (37Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), has been reported to be necessary for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (38Jeon S.H. Kang M.G. Kim Y.H. Jin Y.H. Lee C. Chung H.-Y. Kwon H. Park S.D. Seong R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1827-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), implying that the transactivation function of the receptor is necessary for apoptosis. On the other hand, transrepressing activity of the GR has also been shown to be essential for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (31Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 39Miyashita T.U.M. Inoue T. Reed J.C. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In one study, the GR mutant LS-7, which transrepresses but does not transactivate, was used to prove that transrepression is essential for the apoptotic process (31Helmberg A. Auphan N. Caelles C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, recent results show that the LS-7 GR mutant is not totally defective in transactivation (24Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Göttlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This makes it difficult to assess the exact functional requirement of the GR for apoptosis. In our study, although we showed that inhibition of GR-mediated apoptosis and transactivation are linked, we cannot rule out the involvement of the transrepressive function of the receptor in the apoptotic process. RAP46 represses transactivation by the GR through interaction with the hinge region of the receptor. It is interesting to note that the hinge region is the site of interaction of other repressors of nuclear receptors such as N-CoR/RIP13 (12Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar), SMRT/TRAC (14Chen D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar), and TRUP (16Burris T.P. Nawaz Z. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9525-9529Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, no sequence homology exists between the hinge region bound by these corepressors and the region on the GR bound by RAP46. Furthermore, these cofactors differ from RAP46 in other aspects. N-CoR and SMRT interact with Sin3A/B and histone deacetylase 1 in the absence of ligand, causing histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (40Nagy L. Kao H.-Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J.

Glass C.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 682-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the presence of hormone, they dissociate and allow other factors that cause histone acetylation to interact with the receptors to enhance transcription. In the case of RAP46, repression takes place in the presence of ligand, making it unlikely that recruitment of Sin3A/B and/or histone deacetylase 1 is involved. However, it has been shown that RAP46 associates with several proteins in an indirect manner via the molecular chaperones hsp70/hsc70 (2Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 8Takayama S. Brimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). As these proteins interact with the nonactivated and activated forms of the GR (43Diehl E.E. Schmidt T.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13510-13515Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), hsp70-GR interactions may play an important role in the negative regulation of the activity of the GR by RAP46. hsp70 also interacts with other steroid receptors, suggesting that RAP46 may regulate the activity of these receptors as well. Our studies show that down-regulation of GR activity by RAP46 is specific for this receptor as no negative effect of this protein was observed on transactivation by the AR. What then is the biological significance of the negative regulation of GR action by RAP46? In a number of developmental processes, the activity of glucocorticoids needs to be carefully controlled, and this may require the action of RAP46. For example, in Xenopus, ectopic expression and activation of the GR lead to inhibition of early differentiation of the embryo (44Gao X. Stegeman B.I. Lanser P. Koster J.G. Destrée O.H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas mice that do not express the GR at all die perinatally (45Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Monaghan A.P. Krieglstein K. Schmid W. Aguzzi A. Fantuzzi G. Hummler E. Unsicker K. Schütz G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1608-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the importance of controlled expression and action of the GR during development. It is therefore at this stage that we expect RAP46 to exert its major influence on GR activity. Control of GR action may not be restricted only to early development. GR-induced lymphocytolysis is a well known example of apoptosis that is likely to be regulated by RAP46 in adult organisms. In certain cultured cell lines, BAG-1, the mouse homolog of RAP46, is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids (46Clevenger C.V. Thickman K. Ngo W. Chang W.-P. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 608-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this is not the case in our S49.1 cells, our finding that RAP46 down-regulates the activity of the GR in a number of cells implies the involvement of BAG-1/RAP46 in a cell type-specific feedback control of GR action.

Mermod for the Gal4-DBD expression vector and the Gal4-NFI/CTF1 construct. We are grateful to A. Hesselschwerdt and J. Stober for excellent technical assistance."

The effects of vitamin D on the expression of renal Na+-dependent inorganic phosphate (Pi) transporters (types I and II) were investigated. In vitamin D-deficient rats, the amounts of type II Na+-dependent Pi transporter (NaPi-2) protein and mRNA were decreased in the juxtamedullary kidney cortex, but not in the superficial cortex, compared with control rats. The administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) to vitamin D-deficient rats increased the initial rate of Pi uptake as well as the amounts of NaPi-2 mRNA and protein in the juxtamedullary cortex. The transcriptional activity of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the promoter region of the human type II Na+-dependent Pi transporter NaPi-3 gene was increased markedly by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in COS-7 cells expressing the human vitamin D receptor. A deletion and mutation analysis of the NaPi-3 gene promoter identified the vitamin D-responsive element as the sequence 5′-GGGGCAGCAAGGGCA-3′ nucleotides −1977 to −1963 relative to the transcription start site. This element bound a heterodimer of the vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor, and it enhanced the basal transcriptional activity of the promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene in an orientation-independent manner. Thus, one mechanism by which vitamin D regulates Pi homeostasis is through the modulation of the expression of type II Na+-dependent Pi transporter genes in the juxtamedullary kidney cortex.

Knox F.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Ravan Press, NY1992: 2511-2531Google Scholar). However, the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the reabsorption of Pi in the kidney remains unclear. Contradictory results showing an increase or decrease in Piexcretion in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 have been reported (2Berndt T.J. Knox F.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Ravan Press, NY1992: 2511-2531Google Scholar). The results may be due to differences in the mode of action (genomic action versus non-genomic action) of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and/or to differences in the experimental conditions including the time of exposure, dose of 1,25-(OH)2D3, and previous status of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (2Berndt T.J. Knox F.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Ravan Press, NY1992: 2511-2531Google Scholar). A study using a micropuncture technique, in situmicroperfusion, isolated perfused tubules, and primary cell cultures revealed an axial heterogeneity in proximal tubular Pitransport (2Berndt T.J. Knox F.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Ravan Press, NY1992: 2511-2531Google Scholar). The extent of Na+-Pico-transport is greater in the proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs) than in the proximal straight tubules (PSTs) (3McKeown J.W. Brazy P.C. Dennis V.W. Am. J.

They have been classified into two different types on the basis of their predicted amino acid sequences: type I, which includes NaPi-1 (rabbit), NPT-1 (human), Npt-1 (mouse), and RNaPi-1 (rat); and type II, which includes NaPi-2/3 (rat, human), NaPi-4 (OK cell), NaPi-6 (rabbit), and NaPi-7 (mouse) (9Biber J.

Both types of Na+-Pi co-transporters are localized in PCTs and PSTs. With the use of polyclonal antibodies and cDNA probes, the regulation of the expression of the rat renal type I and type II transporters by several physiological factors has been studied (9Biber J.

The type II transporter was found to be regulated mainly by dietary Pi and PTH. In addition, the regulation of the type II transporter by dietary Pi and PTH was shown to differ between PSTs and PCTs (12Levi M. Arar M. Kaissling B. Murer H. Biber J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: E1021-E1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on renal Pi transport, we have now examined the regulation by 1,25-(OH)2D3 of the expression of the type II phosphate transporter NaPi-2 at the mRNA and protein levels in the rat kidney cortex. We also characterized the promoter of the human type II phosphate transporter NaPi-3 gene with regard to transcriptional regulation by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), because we and another group demonstrated that the structures of the type II Na-Pitransporters (rat NaPi-2, human NaPi-3 and mouse NaPi-7) gene are highly conserved (15Taketani Y.

In addition, 1,25-(OH)2D3 is known to affect renal Na-Pi co-transport activity in these three species (2Berndt T.J. Knox F.G. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and Pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Ravan Press, NY1992: 2511-2531Google Scholar). Male Wistar rats (age, 3 weeks; body weight, ∼40 g) purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) and fed a vitamin D-free diet (Diet 11) ad libitum for 6 weeks and subsequently a vitamin D-free and calcium-free diet (Diet 11-Ca) for 1 week (17Kimura T. Okano T. Tsugawa N. Okamura Y. Kobayashi T. J. Bone Miner. Met. 1994; 12: S7-S11Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The rats with low plasma calcium and undetectable levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D obtained thus were subjected to the experiments. For repletion, the deficient-rats were intravenously injected with 1,25-(OH)2D3(6.25 μg (15 nmol, 2500 IU) per kilogram of body weight) dissolved in ethanol-propylene glycol (1:4, v/v) (18Reeve L.E. Jorgensen N.A. DeLuca H.F. J. Nutr. 1982; 36: 122-126Google Scholar). Kidneys were sliced horizontally in 3-mm sections. The outer 3-mm portion of the cortex (superficial cortex) and the inner cortex (juxtamedullary cortex), including the outer-most portion of red medulla were used for the preparation of BBMVs (19Yusufi A.N.K.

The enzyme activity profiles of these cortex preparations indicate that they correspond to BBMVs of PCTs and PSTs, respectively. The BBMVs were prepared by the Ca2+ precipitation method as described previously (20Minami H. Kim J.R. Tada K. Takahashi F. Miyamoto K. Nakabou Y. Sakai K. Hagihira H. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 692-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and their purity was assessed by the measurement of the leucine aminopeptidase, Na+- and K+-dependent ATPase, and cytochrome-c-oxidase activities (21Nakagawa N. Arab N. Ghishan F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13616-13620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of [32P]Pi was measured by a rapid filtration technique (21Nakagawa N. Arab N.

Total RNA was isolated from the kidney tissue by IsoGen RNA extraction regent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo). Total RNA was separated by electrophoresis with a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde. The resolved RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The hybridization and washing and the analysis of the data were carried out essentially as described previously (22Takahashi Y. Taketani Y. Endo T. Yamamoto S. Kumegawa M. Biochim. Biophys.

The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) with the use of a Megaprime labeling system (Amersham). For the immunoblot analysis, BBMVs were prepared as described above and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membrane was treated with non-fat dried milk and 1:1,000 diluted anti-NaPi-2 antibody prepared previously (24Magagnin S. Werner A. Markovich D. Sorribas V. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5979-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The membrane was also treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody. The signal was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham). Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Both kidneys were removed, immersed in fixative for 15 h, and processed for the preparation of cryostat sections. After microwave irradiation (for 10 min in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0) and treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the sections were exposed overnight at 4 °C to the NaPi-2-specific antibodies (1:2,000 dilution). Visualization was achieved by incubation with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 2 h at 37 °C. The sections were observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS-4D, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). COS-7 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, Saitama, Japan, (25Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar)) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat osteosarcoma ROS-17/2.8 cells (RIKEN Cell Bank, (26Majeska R. Rodan S. Rodan G. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 1494-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar)) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Two luciferase reporter vectors (p3P2400 and p3P1260) containing the 5′-flanking region of the human NaPi-3 gene were described in a previous study (15Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Katai K.

The luciferase reporter plasmids pTKDRCF, pTKDRCR, pTKDRCmt2, and pTKDRCmt3 containing the DR-C sequence of the NaPi-3 gene promoter in the forward and reverse directions, respectively, were constructed by placing synthetic double-stranded DNA (annealed oligonucleotides with XhoI cleavage sites (5′-TCGAGATCAGGGGCAGCAAGGGCAGAAATG-3′ and 5′-TCGACATTTCTGCCCTTGCTGCCCCTGATC-3′) and with the mutation bases indicated in Table I for pTKDRCmt2 and pTKDRCmt3) corresponding to nucleotides −1982 to −1957 (relative to the transcription start site) of NaPi-3 upstream of the minimum promoter region of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene (kindly provided by H. Kondo) (27Hayashi S. Goto K. Okada T.S. Kondoh H. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 818-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Two additional reporter plasmids (pTKDRCmt2 and pTKDRCmt3) were also constructed by the above method using synthetic oligonucleotides containing mutations as described in Table I, respectively. A p3PΔ1850TK was constructed withKpnI-SacI-digested polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment with the following two primers: 5′-CGGGATCCAGGCTGGTCTCGAACTCC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides −2121 to −2102, with an added KpnI clevage site), and 5′-ATTGCTCCAGGAGCTC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides −1859 to −1843, contains the SacI cleavage site), the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase minimum promoter, and pGL-3 vector.

COS-7 cells (1.5 × 105) were transferred to a 35-mm plastic dish and transfected with 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter vector, 0.05 μg of human VDR expression vector, and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β with the use of TransIT-LT1 lipofection reagent (Pan Vera Corp., Madison, WI). ROS-17/2.8 cells (2.0 × 105), also in 35-mm dishes, were transfected with 0.5 μg of luciferase reporter vector and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β, again with the use of TransIT-LT1. After transfection, the cells were incubated under standard conditions for 24 h and then exposed to 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 15 h. The cells were then harvested in cell lysis buffer supplied with a luciferase assay kit (Pica-gene; Toyo Ink, Tokyo), and the lysates were assayed for luciferase activity, β-galactosidase activity, and protein concentration (30Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells were prepared as described by Arakawaet al. (30Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using a slight modification of the method established by Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected with the human VDR expression vector by the DEAE-dextran method (32Maruyama K. Wang H-M. Miyajima A. Takebe Y. Arai N. Karam J.D. Chao L. Warr G.W. Methods in Nucleic Acids Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 283-306Google Scholar). The human VDR expression vector pSG5/hVDR (28Arai H. Miyamoto K. Taketani Y. Yamamoto H. Iemori Y. Morita K. Tonai T. Nishisho T. Mori S. Takeda E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and the murine RXRα expression vector pSG5/m RXRα (kindly provided by P. Chambon) were used to synthesize the encoded protein in vitro protein synthesis system (Single Tube Protein System (STP) 2, Novagen, Madison, WI). The 50-μl reaction mixture contained 0.5 μg of expression vector, STP System 2 Transcription Mix, and STP System 2 Translation Mix, and 25 μm methionine. Eleven double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to direct repeat-like sequences in the 5′-flanking region of the NaPi-3 gene (15Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Katai K. Chikamori M. Tatsumi S. Segawa H. Yamamoto H. Morita K. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), human osteocalcin gene (33Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4455-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and rat 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase gene (34Zierold C. Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), as well as various mutant sequences of the DR-C region of the NaPi-3 gene were synthesized (Table I). The oligonucleotides were purified electrophoretically on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP (167 TBq/mmol; ICN). The binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg of nuclear extract or 2 μl of in vitrosynthesized protein pretreated with 1,25-(OH)2D3, and 25 fmol of probe (1 × 105 cpm). The reaction mixture was then subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel with 1 × TAE (40 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA) as electrode buffer at a constant current of 30 mA for 2 h. The gel was dried and analyzed with a bio-imaging analyzer (BAS-1500, Fuji-film, Tokyo). BBMVs were prepared from the superficial and juxtamedullary cortex of rat kidneys. The Pi uptake remained linear for up to 3 min in both types of vesicles (data not shown). The initial rate of Pi uptake was greater in the BBMVs from the superficial cortex than in those from the juxtamedullary cortex (785 ± 164 and 554 ± 121 pmol/mg of protein per min, respectively (means ± S.E., n = 6)) of normal rats (Fig. 1 A). In the vitamin D-deficient animals, the initial rate of Pi uptake in BBMVs from the juxtamedullary cortex was substantially decreased (215 ± 49 pmol/mg of protein/min) whereas that in the vesicles from the superficial cortex was slightly increased (987 ± 121 pmol/mg of protein/min). Forty-eight hours after the injection of 1,25-(OH)2D3 into vitamin D-deficient rats, the initial rate of Pi uptake was ∼160% (897 ± 143 pmol/mg of protein/min) and ∼50% (398 ± 115 pmol/mg of protein/min) of the values of normal animals for BBMVs from the juxtamedullary and superficial cortex, respectively (Fig.1 B). The amounts of NaPi-2 mRNA (∼2.4 kilobase) and protein (∼90–110 kDa) did not differ between the superficial and juxtamedullary cortexes of the normal rats (data not shown). The amounts of NaPi-2 mRNA and protein in the juxtamedullary cortex were markedly decreased in the vitamin D-deficient animals (Fig. 2, Aand B). In contrast, the type I transporter rNaPi-1 mRNA and protein levels were not significantly different between the normal and vitamin D-deficient animals. In addition, the levels of neutral basic amino acid transporter mRNA and protein were not changed. Moreover, the amounts of NaPi-2 mRNA and protein in the juxtamedullary cortex were 2.5- and 3.1-fold of the value for normal rats in the vitamin D-deficient rats 12 h after the administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig.3, A and B), respectively. In contrast, the amounts of NaPi-2 mRNA and protein in the superficial cortex showed only small changes in response to vitamin D deprivation and slightly decreased after the 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration. In the normal animals, the localization of NaPi-2 immunoreactivity in the apical membrane of tubular cells was shown in the juxtamedullary and superficial cortexes (Fig.4, A and E). In the vitamin D-deficient animals, the intensity of NaPi-2 immunoreactivity was decreased (Fig. 4, B and F), to a greater extent in the juxtamedullary cortex than in the superficial cortex. The administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to vitamin D-deficient rats resulted in the gradual but slight diminishment of NaPi-2 immunoreactivity from the superficial cortex (Fig. 4,C and D) and a gradual increase in the amount of NaPi-2 in the juxtamedullary region (Fig. 4, G andH). To further characterize the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the expression of a type II co-transporter gene, we performed a functional analysis of the human NaPi-3 gene promoter in COS-7 cells expressing the human VDR. 1,25-(OH)2D3 was previously shown to stimulate the transcriptional activity of this promoter in COS-7 cells (15Taketani Y. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Katai K. Chikamori M. Tatsumi S. Segawa H. Yamamoto H. Morita K. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of COS-7 cells expressing VDR and transfected with the luciferase reporter vector p3P2400, which contains 2462 base pairs (nucleotides −2409 to +53) of the NaPi-3 gene and all three direct repeat-like motifs (DR-A, DR-B, and DR-C) present in the promoter, increased markedly up on the exposure of the cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with p3P1260, which contains 1312 base pairs (nucleotides −1259 to +53) of the NaPi-3 gene but lacks DR-C, was not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (Fig.5). In addition, the luciferase activity of the cells transfected with p3PΔ1850TK, which lacks −1854 to +53, but contains the minimum promoter of herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase, was increased by the exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3. The human type I co-transporter NPT-1 gene promoter (nucleotides −1414 to +109) did not respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3 (data not shown). To determine whether the DR-C sequence possesses functional VDRE activity, we constructed luciferase reporter plasmids that contain DR-C in the forward (pTKDRCF) or reverse (pTKDRCR) direction upstream of the minimal promoter of the thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus. COS-7 cells, which express both VDR and retinoid X receptor (RXR), were transfected with each of these plasmids separately, and the inducibility of luciferase activity by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was examined. 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated luciferase activity to a similar extent in the COS-7 cells transfected with either plasmid (Fig. 5). To further test whether the DR-C sequence 5′-GGGGCAGCAAGGGCA-3′ is the target sequence of the candidate VDRE, we determined the luciferase activity of the cells transfected with pTKDRCmt2 and pTKDRCmt3, which contain the oligonucleotide mutated in the VDRE half-site. The mutation of AG in the 5′ half-site to GT (pTKDRCmt2) or the first and second (GG to TC; mt3) of the 5′ half-site of the VDRE completely inhibited the ability to respond to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Similar results were obtained by the transfection of ROS-17/2.8 cells endogenously expressing VDR (data not shown). The VDRE of the NaPi-3 gene was investigated further by an EMSA with various oligonucleotides as probes and competitors (TableI). The EMSA demonstrated the formation of a complex between an oligonucleotide containing the VDRE of the rat 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase gene promoter and the VDR-RXR heterodimer (Fig. 6 A). The formation of this complex was inhibited in the presence of DR-C but not in the presence of DR-A or DR-B oligonucleotides. An oligonucleotide containing DR-C formed a complex with the VDR-RXR heterodimer but not with either VDR or RXR alone (Fig. 6 B). The DNA-protein complex could be observed in EMSA using the DR-C oligonucleotide as a probe and the nuclear extract of COS-7 cells expressing human VDR (Fig. 7). The formation of this complex was inhibited in the presence of either an oligonucleotide containing the VDRE of the human osteocalcin gene promoter (nucleotides −501 to −483) (33Kerner S.A. Scott R.A. Pike J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4455-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody (9A7γ) to chick VDR which could inhibit the VDR-DNA complex formation described previously (35Pike J.W. Sleator N.M. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1305-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we compared the binding affinity of the VDREs of the human osteocalcin and NaPi-3 genes. The binding affinity of the NaPi-3 VDRE was slightly but not significantly lower than that of the osteocalcin VDRE (data n"

Their Ca2+-mobilizing effects in ascidian oocytes were characterized in connection with that induced by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). Fertilization of the oocyte is accompanied by a decrease in the oocyte Ca2+ current and an increase in membrane capacitance due to the addition of membrane to the cell surface. Both of these electrical changes could be induced by perfusion, through a patch pipette, of nanomolar concentrations of cADPR or its precursor, β-NAD, into unfertilized oocytes. The changes induced by β-NAD showed a distinctive delay consistent with its enzymatic conversion to cADPR. The cADPR-induced changes were inhibited by preloading the oocytes with a Ca2+ chelator, indicating the effects were due to Ca2+ release induced by cADPR. Consistently, ryanodine (at high concentration) or 8-amino-cADPR, a specific antagonist of cADPR, but not heparin, inhibited the cADPR-induced changes. Both inhibitors likewise blocked the membrane insertion that normally occurred at fertilization consistent with it being mediated by a ryanodine receptor. The effects of NAADP were different from those of cADPR. Although NAADP induced a similar decrease in the Ca2+ current, no membrane insertion occurred. Moreover, pretreatment of the oocytes with NAADP inhibited the post-fertilization Ca2+ oscillation while cADPR did not. A similar Ca2+ oscillation could be artificially induced by perfusing into the oocytes a high concentration of InsP3 and NAADP could likewise inhibit such an InsP3-induced oscillation. This work shows that three independent Ca2+ signaling pathways are present in the oocytes and that each is involved in mediating distinct changes associated with fertilization. The results are consistent with a hierarchical organization of Ca2+ stores in the oocyte.

This work shows that three independent Ca2+ signaling pathways are present in the oocytes and that each is involved in mediating distinct changes associated with fertilization. The results are consistent with a hierarchical organization of Ca2+ stores in the oocyte. Ca2+ signaling in cells generally involves both its influx from the extracellular medium and its release from intracellular stores. Two families of intracellular Ca2+release channels have been characterized, namely, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; NAADP, nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPR, ADP-ribose; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ASW, artificial sea water; pF, picofarad. 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; NAADP, nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPR, ADP-ribose; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ASW, artificial sea water; pF, picofarad. and the ryanodine receptors (RyR). Unlike the InsP3R, the physiological agonist for RyR has not been identified although it is known that its Ca2+ channel property can be modulated by a plant alkaloid, ryanodine. The skeletal muscle RyR isoform is known to be activated directly by conformational coupling with the voltage sensors at the cell surface and does not seem to require an agonist (1Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De J.K. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,2Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other RyR isoforms may require specific ligand for activation, and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) has been proposed to be such an agonist for RyR (3Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cyclic ADP-ribose was discovered during an investigation of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms in sea urchin eggs (4Clapper D.L.

Cyclic ADP-ribose is synthesized from β-NAD by the enzyme ADP-ribosyl cyclase, which was first described in sea urchin eggs (4Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11725-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 12Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A soluble form of the cyclase has been purified from Aplysia ovotestis, and its crystalline structure has been solved recently (13Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Prasad G.S. McRee D.E.

A membrane-bound homolog of the Aplysia cyclase is CD38, a lymphocyte antigen (16States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). CD38 is catalytically different from theAplysia cyclase in that it not only can cyclize β-NAD into cADPR but can also catalyze the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose (17Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos A.L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Both CD38 and the soluble cyclase can, additionally, catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of β-NADP with nicotinic acid to produce nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (18Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), a metabolite that can release Ca2+ from intracellular stores different from that mobilized by cADPR (19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).Ca2+ is involved in a complex series of changes accompanying fertilization of ascidian oocytes (20McDougall A. Sardet C. Lambert C.C. Zygote. 1995; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21McDougall A. Sardet C. Curr.

An immediate decrease in depolarization-activated Ca2+ current is followed by a progressive increase in membrane capacitance (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The latter is indicative of membrane insertion into the cell surface. Subsequently, a prolonged Ca2+ oscillation occurs, lasting until meiosis is complete. Perfusion of high concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) into unfertilized oocytes through a whole-cell patch pipette can elicit repetitive Ca2+ transients similar to that observed during fertilization (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, neither the rapid decrease of Ca2+ current nor membrane insertion is induced by InsP3, suggesting other Ca2+ messengers may be involved in mediating these early changes at fertilization (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to introduce three independent Ca2+ messengers, cADPR, NAADP, and InsP3 into the oocytes (25Arnoult C. Albrieux M. Antoine A.F. Grunwald D. Marty I. Villaz M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The resulting Ca2+mobilization was monitored by two independent methods, by electrical measurements to sense the localized Ca2+ changes near the plasma membrane and by fluorescent indicator to sample the cytoplasmic Ca2+ changes. Results show that all three Ca2+signaling mechanisms are present in the oocytes and are involved not only in mediating the early electrical changes at the cell surface associated with fertilization but also in modulating the subsequent Ca2+ oscillation.DISCUSSIONIt is generally believed that cells possess multiple types of Ca2+ stores (reviewed in Ref. 37Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recent discoveries of cADPR and NAADP (4Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C.

Indeed, it has been shown that the NAADP-sensitive stores can be physically separated from those sensitive to the other two Ca2+ agonists (32Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 38Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol.

The cADPR-dependent mechanism is also quite widespread, being present in a variety of cells from plant to mammalian tissues (32Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In contrast, the distribution of the NAADP-mechanism in cells is just beginning to be explored. This study is of notable importance since it is the first to demonstrate that the mechanism is present in a cell other than sea urchin eggs. Although both sea urchins and ascidians are marine animals, they diverged in evolution hundreds of millions of years ago. The fact that NAADP-dependent Ca2+ signaling is present in these two widely different species suggests that the mechanism may prove to be as widespread as those mediated by cADPR or InsP3. In this study, pharmacological evidence is obtained, indicating all three mechanisms may be mediated by its own independent receptor, consistent with that shown in sea urchin eggs (32Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, 8-amino-cADPR inhibited the effect of cADPR while heparin blocked the effect of InsP3, and neither antagonist had any effect on the action of NAADP (Figs. 5 and6).The intriguing question of why cells possess three different Ca2+ signaling mechanisms was explored in this study. Our results show that each of the three mechanisms has its own special function. Evidence is presented indicating the cADPR mechanism is involved in mediating the insertion of membranes associated with fertilization. Thus, neither NAADP nor InsP3 can induce an increase in the membrane capacitance (Figs. 4 and 6). Perfusion of cADPR into oocytes mimicked the capacitance increase seen at fertilization while preapplication of 8-amino-cADPR blocked the increase naturally occurring (Figs. 1 and 9). It is likely that cADPR is also responsible for mediating the decrease in membrane Ca2+ current during fertilization. Although all three Ca2+ agonists can induce a decrease in membrane Ca2+ current in the oocyte, only cADPR can do so with fast enough kinetics (Figs. 1, 4, and 6) as compared with those of fertilization (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The fast changes induced by cADPR or fertilization are consistent with the cortical localization of the Ca2+stores (25Arnoult C. Albrieux M. Antoine A.F. Grunwald D. Marty I. Villaz M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).That this effect of cADPR on the current is due to Ca2+release activated by the agonist is shown by the fact that preloading the oocytes with BAPTA totally inhibited the change (Fig.5 B). However, measurements of the cytosolic Ca2+using Fura-2 dextran detected no Ca2+ changes induced by either cADPR (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or NAADP (Fig. 7 C). This could be due to the relatively low temporal and spatial resolution of our classical fura-2 measurement. Future experiments using other probes, in conjunction with confocal microscopy may allow direct measurement of the local Ca2+ in the cortical region. In any case, the experiments using BAPTA presently serve to validate the current measurement as a method for monitoring localized Ca2+release close to the plasma membrane. This technique has been widely used and is generally accepted (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Arnoult C. Albrieux M. Antoine A.F. Grunwald D. Marty I. Villaz M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Grumetto L. Wilding M. DeSimone M.L. Tosti E. Galione A. Dale B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The use of the Ca2+ chelator to distinguish between Ca2+-dependent and -independent effects is important since, in principle, factors other than Ca2+ may be able to induce a similar change in Ca2+ current. This is the case for ADPR, whose inactivating effect on the Ca2+current is not inhibitable by BAPTA, indicating it is not mediated by Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 5 B). The ADPR-effect is likely to be due to a direct interaction of the metabolite with ion channels. Indeed, it has been reported that ADPR can directly activate a K+-channel in arterial smooth muscles (40Li P. Zou A.P. Campbell W.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In contrast to cADPR and NAADP, perfusion with InsP3induces a cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillation in the oocytes similar to that observed after fertilization. Preloading the oocytes with heparin blocks the oscillation (41Russo G.L. Kyozuka K. Antonazzo L. Tosti E. Dale B. Development. 1996; 122: 1995-2003PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that post-fertilization Ca2+ oscillation is mediated by InsP3. The exact mechanism of how these Ca2+ oscillations are generated is not known, but our results point to the critical involvement of the NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores. It has previously been shown in sea urchin eggs that NAADP itself is an inactivator of the NAADP-dependent Ca2+ release mechanism and can totally desensitize the release mechanism even at non-activating concentrations (38Genazzani A.A. Empson R.M. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11599-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 42Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the ascidian oocytes, our results show that pretreatment with NAADP, which presumably would discharge the stores and inactivate the release mechanism, can effectively inhibit the Ca2+ oscillation. It is possible that the oscillation requires the functional interaction between the InsP3- and the NAADP-sensitive stores. Inactivating the NAADP-mechanism by the pretreatment could disrupt the critical interaction and thus block the oscillation, even if the InsP3-sensitive stores are fully functional. Indeed, it has previously been proposed that the interaction between the NAADP- and the cADPR/InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores may be responsible for mediating the Ca2+ oscillation seen in sea urchin eggs (32Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 42Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the exact mechanism, the inhibition by pretreatment with NAADP does suggest the involvement of NAADP, together with InsP3, in mediating the post-fertilization Ca2+ oscillation. Moreover, the known pH regulation of the NAADP production could allow the natural alkalinization of the cytoplasmic pH that occurs after fertilization to influence the pattern of post-fertilization Ca2+ oscillation (43Johnson J.D. Epel D. Nature. 1976; 262: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).The results presented in this study are consistent with a model where the three independent Ca2+ stores are arranged in a hierarchical manner. It is proposed that the cADPR-sensitive stores are localized next to the plasma membrane. Their mobilization by cADPR would rapidly raise the cortical Ca2+ concentration, resulting in activation of a fast decrease in oocyte current and membrane insertion. Since the action of cADPR can be blocked by ryanodine (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is suggested that a RyR-like release channel is involved. Such a channel has indeed been immunolocalized to the cortical region of the oocytes (25Arnoult C. Albrieux M. Antoine A.F. Grunwald D. Marty I. Villaz M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The next level of the hierarchical organization is suggested to be the NAADP-sensitive stores. The farther distance of these stores from the plasma membrane accounts for the NAADP-induced current decrease being slower than that of cADPR. The attenuation of the Ca2+ release from these stores by local buffering could also contribute to the slow change and could account for the ineffectiveness of NAADP to activate the capacitance increase. The cortical region where the cADPR- and NAADP- sensitive stores are localized may represent a diffusion barrier for either large molecules, such as Fura-2 dextran, or for Ca2+ ions. The latter could be due to rapid resequestration of Ca2+ and/or buffering by Ca2+ binding proteins. Thus the cortical Ca2+changes can be detected readily by electrical measurements but not by the cytoplasmic Fura-2 dextran. In contrast, the Ca2+release induced by InsP3 can be detected by the cytoplasmic probe, indicating that the stores are distributed in the cytoplasm. It is proposed that the InsP3-sensitive stores interact specifically with the NAADP-sensitive stores to generate the observed Ca2+ oscillation. The exact nature of the interaction remains to be determined. One possibility is that the Ca2+released from one type of store is sequestered by the other, resulting in overloading and activating spontaneous release. A similar proposal has been advanced to account for the effect of NAADP on Ca2+ oscillations seen in sea urchin eggs (32Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 42Aarhus R. Dickey D.M. Graeff R.M. Gee K.R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8513-8516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Self-desensitization of the NAADP mechanism by pretreatment with the agonist could disrupt the crucial interaction between the Ca2+ stores and thus terminate the oscillation. This hierarchical model was designed to account for results presented in this study and will serve as our working model for future investigations of the Ca2+ signaling pathways in the oocyte. Ca2+ signaling in cells generally involves both its influx from the extracellular medium and its release from intracellular stores. Two families of intracellular Ca2+release channels have been characterized, namely, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; NAADP, nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPR, ADP-ribose; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ASW, artificial sea water; pF, picofarad. 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; NAADP, nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate; cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ADPR, ADP-ribose; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; RyR, ryanodine receptor; ASW, artificial sea water; pF, picofarad. and the ryanodine receptors (RyR). Unlike the InsP3R, the physiological agonist for RyR has not been identified although it is known that its Ca2+ channel property can be modulated by a plant alkaloid, ryanodine. The skeletal muscle RyR isoform is known to be activated directly by conformational coupling with the voltage sensors at the cell surface and does not seem to require an agonist (1Marty I. Robert M. Villaz M. De J.K. Lai Y. Catterall W.A. Ronjat M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2270-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,2Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other RyR isoforms may require specific ligand for activation, and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) has been proposed to be such an agonist for RyR (3Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Cyclic ADP-ribose was discovered during an investigation of Ca2+ signaling mechanisms in sea urchin eggs (4Clapper D.L.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11725-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 12Lee H.C. Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A soluble form of the cyclase has been purified from Aplysia ovotestis, and its crystalline structure has been solved recently (13Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 14Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 15Prasad G.S. McRee D.E.

A membrane-bound homolog of the Aplysia cyclase is CD38, a lymphocyte antigen (16States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). CD38 is catalytically different from theAplysia cyclase in that it not only can cyclize β-NAD into cADPR but can also catalyze the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose (17Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos A.L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Both CD38 and the soluble cyclase can, additionally, catalyze the exchange of the nicotinamide group of β-NADP with nicotinic acid to produce nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (18Aarhus R.

Ca2+ is involved in a complex series of changes accompanying fertilization of ascidian oocytes (20McDougall A. Sardet C. Lambert C.C.

An immediate decrease in depolarization-activated Ca2+ current is followed by a progressive increase in membrane capacitance (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The latter is indicative of membrane insertion into the cell surface. Subsequently, a prolonged Ca2+ oscillation occurs, lasting until meiosis is complete. Perfusion of high concentrations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) into unfertilized oocytes through a whole-cell patch pipette can elicit repetitive Ca2+ transients similar to that observed during fertilization (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, neither the rapid decrease of Ca2+ current nor membrane insertion is induced by InsP3, suggesting other Ca2+ messengers may be involved in mediating these early changes at fertilization (24Albrieux M. Sardet C. Villaz M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 174-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)."

In this paper we report the isolation and characterization of theLPP1 (lipid phosphatephosphatase) gene in S. cerevisiae. The expression of the LPP1 gene in S. cerevisiaecells on a multicopy plasmid and in Sf-9 insect cells by baculovirus infection resulted in the overexpression of Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity. The overexpressed gene product also exhibited LPA phosphatase and DGPP phosphatase activities. Biochemical analyses of an lpp1Δ mutant, adpp1Δ mutant, and an lpp1Δ dpp1Δ double mutant showed that the LPP1 and DPP1 gene products encoded nearly all of the Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase and LPA phosphatase activities and all of the DGPP phosphatase activity in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, the analyses of the mutants showed that the LPP1 andDPP1 gene products played a role in the regulation of phospholipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae and in particular the cellular contents of phosphatidylinositol and PA.

U33057) flanked the 3′-end of the PSP1 gene. We obtained plasmid pSK5+ (from Dr. Timothy Formosa) that contained genomic copies of the PSP1and LPP1 genes. A 1.8-kb insert, containing theLPP1 gene, 755 bp of the promoter region, and 200 bp of the untranslated region, was released from pSK5+ by digestion withHpaI. This DNA fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of pRS426, a multicopy E. coli/yeast shuttle vector containing the URA3 gene (39Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) to form plasmid pWB1-LPP1. This construct was transformed into W303-1B and the indicated mutants for the overexpression of the LPP1 gene product. The plasmid pSK5+ was digested with HpaI/SalI to remove theLPP1 gene. This DNA fragment was ligated into theSmaI/SalI sites of pCRScriptTM AMP SK(+) to form pCR-LPP1. The pCR-LPP1 construct was digested withStyI/HindIII to remove the entire LPP1coding sequence. The sites on the digested plasmid were converted to blunt ends using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. A 2.5-kbHIS3/Kanr disruption cassette, derived from plasmid pJA50 (40Allen J.B. Elledge S.J. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by SmaI digestion, was inserted into the blunt-ended plasmid to form plasmid pCR-lpp1Δ. A linear 2.8-kbLPP1 deletion cassette was released from pCR-lpp1Δ by digestion with XhoI/NotI. This DNA fragment was transformed into W303-1B to delete the chromosomal copy of theLPP1 gene by the one-step gene replacement technique (41Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on complete synthetic medium without histidine. The deletion of the chromosomal copy of the LPP1 gene was confirmed by PCR (primers, 5′-GAATGTCAATGAGTTTCGCAGAAGACG-3′ and 5′-GTATTTTGGCTTCGGTTAATATCTGG-3′) using 30 cycles at 55 °C annealing temperature with a 3.5-min extension time at 72 °C. The template for the PCR used to confirm the LPP1 deletion was genomic DNA isolated from transformed colonies. The PCR template for the native LPP1 gene was genomic DNA isolated from W303-1B. One of the lpp1Δ mutants that we isolated was designated strain WBY1. Thelpp1Δ mutant was crossed with a dpp1Δ mutant to form a diploid that was heterozygous for the LPP1 andDPP1 alleles. Putative lpp1Δ dpp1Δ double mutants were selected for their ability to grow on complete synthetic media lacking both histidine and tryptophan. The deletion of the chromosomal copies of the LPP1 gene and theDPP1 gene (16Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Dillon D.A. Wu W.-I. Chen X. Ostrander D.B. Oshiro J. Cremesti A. Voelker D.R. Fischl A.S.

Strain TBY1 was one of the haploid lpp1Δdpp1Δ double mutants that were isolated. Plasmid pWB1-LPP1 was digested withBamHI/SalI to release the entire coding sequence of the LPP1 gene. This DNA fragment was ligated into theBamHI/SalI sites of the YEp352 vector resulting in the formation of plasmid pDT1-LPP1. This construct was then digested with Bsu36I/SalI to reduce the remaining promoter sequence to 26 bp upstream of the protein coding sequence. These sites on the plasmid were converted to blunt ends using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The blunt ends were ligated together to form plasmid pDT2-LPP1. The pDT2-LPP1 plasmid was digested withBamHI/PstI to release the LPP1 open reading frame. This DNA fragment was then ligated into theBamHI/PstI site of the baculovirus vector PVL1392 to form plasmid pWW1-LPP1. The pWW1-LPP1 plasmid was subsequently co-transfected with BaculoGoldTM Autographa californica DNA (PharMingen) into a monolayer of Sf-9 cells using the CaCl2 method. The Sf-9 cells were routinely grown in TMNFH medium (42O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. General procedures for the growth, maintenance, and infection of Sf-9 cells followed the methods described by O'Reilly et al.(42O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 109-215Google Scholar). Routine infection of Sf-9 cells for LPP1 expression used 1–2 × 107 cells grown in 75-cm2tissue culture flasks. The cells were infected at a viral multiplicity of 10 and grown in TMNFH medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The infected cells were collected by gentle trituration with medium, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap-frozen over dry ice and stored at −80 °C. All steps were performed at 5 °C.

We report that transient expression of the constitutively active mutants of Gα12 or of Gα13 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a set of proteins ofM r of 110,000–130,000, 97,000, and 60,000–70,000. We identified p125 focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130 Crk-associated substrate as prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing constitutively active Gα12 and Gα13. In common with the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins mediated by mitogens acting through heptahelical receptors, the Gα12- and Gα13-mediated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation is blocked by cytochalasin D, which specifically disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and by the Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which ADP-ribosylates and inactivates Rho. Our results support the hypothesis that Gα12 and Gα13activate Rho and suggest that Gα12 and Gα13may mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130 Crk-associated substrate.

Many mitogens, including bioactive lipids such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 1The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; anti-Tyr(P), anti-phosphotyrosine; C3 toxin,C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gα12QL, Gα13QL, Gαi-2QL, and GαqQL, constitutively active mutant Gα12-Q229L, Gα13-Q226L, Gαi-2-Q205L, and Gαq-Q209L subunits, respectively; G-protein, guanine nucleotide regulatory protein; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptors; mAb, monoclonal antibody; p125fak, p125 focal adhesion kinase; p130cas, p130 Crk-associated substrate; PKC, protein kinase C; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) ; EF, elongation factor. and neuropeptides such as bombesin, signal through distinct cell surface proteins that are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with seven putative transmembrane domains. In Swiss 3T3 cells, a useful model system to analyze the mechanisms of growth factor signaling, an early event in the signal transduction pathways activated by these mitogens is the tyrosine phosphorylation of a common set of focal adhesion proteins (1Rozengurt E.

The increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak, paxillin, and p130cas are accompanied by profound alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in Swiss 3T3 cells, leading to the formation of actin stress fibers and the assembly of focal adhesions (3Seufferlein T.

The immediate mechanism(s) coupling mitogen-induced activation of GPCRs to tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins is not understood. Although many GPCRs couple to the pertussis toxin-sensitiveGi, Gidoes not appear to mediate increases in protein tyrosine phosphorylation (1Rozengurt E. Cancer Surv. 1995; 24: 81-96PubMed Google Scholar, 33Moolenaar W.H. Kranenburg O. Postma F.R. Zondag G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Gα12 and Gα13, which together comprise the ubiquitously expressed G12 subfamily of Gα proteins, are distantly related to other G-protein α subunits and are pertussis toxin-insensitive (34Strathmann M.P.

Furthermore, in astrocytoma cells, thrombin-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis was prevented by the microinjection of anti-Gα12 antibody (43Aragay A.M. Collins L.R. Post G.R. Watson A.J.

The downstream targets through which Gα12 and Gα13 induce these effects have not been identified, although Ras-, Rac-, Rho-, and Cdc42-dependent pathways leading to cytoskeletal reorganization and to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase, and the Na+-H+ exchanger have been implicated (40Mitsui H.

However, it is not known whether activation of Gα12 and/or Gα13 can also promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase p125fak and the adaptor proteins paxillin and p130cas. To examine whether the G12 subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we have transiently transfected human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells with expression vectors encoding constitutively active Gα12 and Gα13 proteins and determined the effect of the expression of these activated Gα subunits on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak, paxillin, and p130cas. Our results demonstrate that expression of active Gα12 and Gα13 in HEK 293 cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of these focal adhesion proteins through a pathway that requires the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and functional Rho. The murine Gα12 subunit cDNAs in the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA-1 (Invitrogen) were gifts from Dr. H. R. Bourne (University of California at San Francisco, CA) and included the constitutively active mutants Gα12-Q229L and Gα13-Q226L (Gα12QL and Gα13QL) (37Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Pace A.M. Bourne H.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2559-2565PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutively active mutant murine Gαi-2-Q205L (Gαi-2QL) and Gαq-Q209L (GαqQL) subunit cDNAs in pcDNA-1 (49Wong Y.H. Federman A. Pace A.M.

The Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (C3 toxin) cDNA in the eucaryotic expression vector EFplink, EFC3, was a gift from Dr. R. Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK). This construct encodes the C3 toxin under the control of the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoter (51Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cultures of transformed HEK 293 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the various plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation (52Wilson S.P. Liu F. Wilson R.E. Housley P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or with LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.). The conditions for transient transfection of HEK 293 cells using calcium phosphate precipitation and LipofectAMINE were each optimized to yield peak efficiency of transfection using an expression plasmid encoding β-galactosidase under the control of the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoter (pEFlacZ, a gift from R. Treisman). Both transfection methods yielded greater than a 50% transfection efficiency optimally, and we were unable to match this transfection efficiency with Lipofectin or DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection methods. Briefly, HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/60-mm Nunc dish and transfected the following day. For calcium phosphate transfections, 12.5 μg of plasmid DNA (precipitated in 0.25 ml of 140 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 125 mmCaCl2, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.95) was added per dish containing 2.25 ml of Optimem-1 medium, and the dishes were incubated for 4 h at 5% CO2. For LipofectAMINE transfections, HEK 293 cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 25 μl of LipofectAMINE in 3 ml of Optimem-1/dish for 18 h at 5% CO2 according to the manufacturer's specifications. In the cotransfection experiments, total amounts of DNA were kept constant, and equal amounts of Gα and of C3 expression constructs (or vector without cDNA insert) were mixed. After transfection with calcium phosphate or LipofectAMINE, the cells were washed and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were used for experimental purposes 4 days after plating. Cultures (one 60-mm dish/condition) were washed twice with DMEM and equilibrated in 5 ml of the same medium at 37 °C for 1–2 h. Some dishes were treated with inhibitors during this equilibration period or with growth factors for 10 min at the end of this period as indicated. Cultures were lysed in 1.4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm4-(aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride and 0.1% SDS. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. In some experiments, the cultures were washed and lysed as described above, with the exception that DMEM without phenol red was used, and the lysates were adjusted to 1 mg protein/ml after protein determination using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). 1 ml of the lysate was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3–4 h with anti-mouse IgG-agarose-linked mAb directed against phosphotyrosine (4G10 or PY72), p125fak (2A7), paxillin, or p130cas or with Protein A-agarose-linked rabbit antisera directed against p125fak. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times by centrifugation with lysis buffer A supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4 and extracted in 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 100 °C. The solubilized proteins were fractionated by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (53Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions on an 8% acrylamide resolving gel. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM-P) at 4 °C for 2 h at 35 V and 2 h at 70 V in 48 mmTris, 386 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. The membranes were then blocked with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (blocking buffer) (54Haycock J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and incubated for 2 h with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) mAb (4G10, 1 μg/ml) in blocking buffer. For some experiments, cultures were immunoprecipitated with anti-paxillin and with anti-p130cas mAb in duplicate, and parallel Western blots were probed with anti-Tyr(P) antibody and with the immunoprecipitating antibody to verify that equivalent amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated. Bound antibodies were visualized by the binding of 125I-labeled anti-mouse IgG (0.1 μCi/ml) followed by autoradiography. After autoradiographic detection of bound anti-Tyr(P), membranes from anti-p125fak immunoprecipitates were reprobed with rabbit antiserum directed against p125fak (1:500) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies to rabbit IgG (1:5,000). Immunoreactive p125fak was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting ECLTM reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For analysis of Gα subunit expression, identical samples of 50 μl (50 μg of protein) of the excess clarified lysate were diluted with 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide resolving gels. Proteins were transferred onto ImmobilonTM-P polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 4 °C for 3 h at 400 mA in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. After blocking the membranes as above, immunoreactive Gα subunits were visualized with rabbit antisera directed against Gα12, Gα13, Gα i -1/Gαi-2, or Gαq at 1:500–1:1,000 dilution, 125I-labeled Protein A (0.1 μ Ci/ml), and autoradiography. The Gα13 antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide CLHDNLKQLMLQ (which corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal peptide 367–377 of murine Gα13 with an N-terminal cysteine added for coupling) cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with the heterobifunctional reagent sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate as described by Offermannset al. (55Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The Gαq antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide (corresponding to amino acid residues 119–133 of murine Gαq) cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin with glutaraldehyde. Although both the calcium phosphate and the LipofectAMINE transfection methods appeared to yield little variation in levels of expression of Gα proteins between dishes in a single transfection, both methods yielded variation in levels of expression of Gα proteins between experiments. Although this variation in the levels of expression of the Gα proteins was reflected in the variation in the levels of increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the reported experiments were repeated at least two times with results equivalent to those illustrated. LipofectAMINETM and Optimem-1 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and the bicinchoninic acid BCA*TM protein assay reagent was obtained from Pierce. The anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10 and the anti-p125fak mAb 2A7 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; mAbs directed against paxillin and p130cas were obtained from Transduction Laboratories; the rabbit anti-p125fak antiserum C-20 and rabbit anti-Gα 12 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; and the rabbit anti-Gαi-1/Gαi-2 was obtained from Calbiochem. 125I-Labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG (100 μCi/ml), 125I-labeled protein A (100 μ Ci/ml), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig, and the ECLTM Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham International. Polyvinylidene fluoride ImmobilonTM-P Western blotting membranes were obtained from Millipore. Anti-mouse IgG-linked agarose, Na3VO4, thrombin, 1-oleoyl-LPA, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, epidermal growth factor, cytochalasin D, pertussis toxin, polyvinylpyrrolidone 40, and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma. GF109203X and U73122 were obtained from LC Laboratories. The synthetic Gα13 peptide CLHDNLKQLMLQ was obtained from Research Genetics. The anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY72 was obtained from the Hybridoma Development Unit, Imperial Cancer Research Fund. All other reagents were of the highest available grade from standard commercial sources. Elements of the signal transduction pathways mediating the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins downstream of GPCRs have been well characterized in Swiss 3T3 cells. We were interested in using a transient transfection system to analyze the ability of the G12 subfamily of heterotrimeric G-proteins to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. We elected to use HEK 293 cells for these studies because these cells can be efficiently transfected. However, signal transduction pathways exhibit a degree of heterogeneity in different cells types. Consequently, we initially examined tyrosine phosphorylation induced by ligands of GPCRs in HEK 293 cells. As thrombin causes GPCR-mediated activation of Gα12 and Gα13 (43Aragay A.M. Collins L.R.

Lysates from these cells treated with or without thrombin were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) mAb PY72 or mAbs directed against p125fak, paxillin, and p130cas. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-Tyr(P) mAb 4G10. As illustrated by Fig. 1 (left panel), treatment of HEK 293 cells with thrombin resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparentM r of 110,000–130,000, 97,000, and 60,000–70,000.

Fig. 1 (right panels) shows that thrombin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak, paxillin, and p130cas in HEK 293 cells. p125fak and paxillin exhibit a greater increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in response to thrombin than does p130cas. Western blot analysis confirmed that similar amounts of p125fak, paxillin, and p130casprotein were immunoprecipitated (data not shown). Stimulation of HEK 293 cells with LPA resulted in an identical pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p125fak, paxillin, and p130cas (data not shown). Agonist-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins in Swiss 3T3 cells occurs through a PKC-, Ca2+-, and Gi-independent pathway that is critically dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and of functional Rho (1Rozengurt E.

In the current study, we further explored the potential points in the cell death cascade where IGF-I receptor activation may afford neuroprotection. As an initial step, we examined the effects of the PCD stimulus, high glucose, on stress-activated protein kinases, specifically the two mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). High glucose treatment activated the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p38 kinase and JNK in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. We next examined the effects of IGF-I on JNK and p38 kinase under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. IGF-I activated p38 kinase alone and had additive effects on glucose-induced p38 kinase phosphorylation. In contrast, IGF-I inhibited glucose activation of JNK phosphorylation and JNK activity. IGF-I also inhibited the glucose-induced nuclear translocation of JNK, but did not effect glucose-induced translocation of p38 kinase. Finally, IGF-I inhibition of JNK phosphorylation was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor, PD98059.

Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The first members identified in the family were p42 and p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), now known as ERK1 and ERK2, respectively. In the Ras pathway, phosphorylation of c-Raf 1 activates the downstream protein kinase, MAP kinase kinase 1 (also known as MAPK/ERK (MEK) or MKK1) or MAP kinase kinase 2 (MKK2). MKK1 and 2 activate ERK1 and ERK2, which leads to activation and translocation of ERKs to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the ERKs phosphorylate transcription factors, including Elk-1 and ATF-2. This signaling cascade is activated by growth factors and is important for cellular growth and mitogenesis (2De Meyts P. Wallach B. Christoffersen C.T. Urso B. Gronskov K. Latus L.-J. Yakushiji F. Ilondo M.M. Shymko R.M. Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Another class of MAP kinase family members, the stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), are primarily responsive to stressful stimuli. There are 10 identified isoforms of JNK originating from three homologous genes (JNK1, JNK2, andJNK3) with molecular masses of 46 or 54 kDa due to alternative splicing (3Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R.

The Thr and Tyr sites of active phosphorylation are conserved between ERK and JNK; however, these sites are located within distinct phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNKs) and Thr-Glu-Try (ERKs) (5Sanchez I.

JNK activation induces the phosphorylation of transcription factors, including c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2, which regulate immediate early gene expression (4Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ERK pathway, Ras activation alone stimulates only a low level of JNK activity, implying distinct differences between the upstream JNK and ERK pathways (12Jessell T.M. Goodman C.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). p38 kinase is a more recently described member of the MAP kinase family (13Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). p38 kinase shares the phosphorylation motif Thr-Gly-Tyr with HOG1, a yeast MAP kinase required for cellular osmoregulation (13Han J.

It is likely that p38 kinase and JNK are components of parallel but distinct stress-activated pathways. p38 kinase can only be activated by the recently discovered MKK3 and MKK6, whereas both MKK3 and the related MKK4 can both activate JNK (7Davis R.J.

Because stressful stimuli activate JNKs and p38 kinase, it has been proposed that these signaling pathways are involved in apoptosis. Differentiated PC12 cells undergo PCD when deprived of nerve growth factor (NGF) (21Rukenstein A. Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2552-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paradigm, NGF withdrawal correlates with increased JNK and p38 kinase activity (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). JNK and p38 kinase activity precede the induction of PC12 cell apoptosis, suggesting that kinase activation participates in the cell death pathway (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is homologous to proinsulin and has insulin-like metabolic effects (29Daughaday W.H. Rotwein P. Endocr.

In vivo, IGF-I is highly expressed in the developing nervous system (31Sara V.R. Carlsson-Skwirut C. Andersson C. Hall E. Sjogren B. Holmgren A. Jornval H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro, IGF-I is a neurotrophic factor for sensory, sympathetic, and motor neurons (33Ishii D.N. Glazner G.W. Pu S.-F. Pharmacol.

We have recently shown that osmotic stress induces PCD in neurons and that IGF-I, but not NGF, epidermal growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, serves as a neuroprotectant (35Matthews C.C.

In the current study, we examined the signaling mechanisms mediating the neuroprotective effects of IGF-I. We found high glucose conditions stimulated both p38 kinase and p54 JNK tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. IGF-I activated p38 kinase independent of glucose treatment. In contrast, IGF-I inhibited both glucose-mediated JNK phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. IGF-I inhibition of JNK phosphorylation was blocked by the MEK inhibitor, PD98059. Our findings suggest cross-talk between the MAP kinases and lead us to speculate that IGF-I protects neurons from high glucose-induced PCD via activation of p38 kinase, as well as deactivation of JNK. Recombinant human IGF-I was a generous gift of Cephalon, Inc. (West Chester, PA). PY20 antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and JNK activity kit were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-JNK1 antiserum (recognizing JNK1 p46, p54 (or p54γ), JNK2 (p54α), and p54β), protein A/G PLUS-agarose, anti-ERK2 monoclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and avidin-rhodamine were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-c-Jun antiserum was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Biotinylated secondary antibodies were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Fisher (University of Michigan). SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum at 37 °C. The cells were deprived of serum overnight prior to use in experiments. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described previously (39Leventhal P.S. Shelden E.A. Kim B. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5214-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF). 500 μg of protein of each sample was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg/ml antibody and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (12.5%), electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting with p38 kinase antisera (1:1000) or anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (1 μg/ml PY20 and 0.4 μg/ml 4G10). Immunoreactive proteins were identified by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with primary antisera against JNK1 or p38 kinase (1:50). Cells were rinsed and incubated with appropriate biotinylated secondary antiserum followed by avidin-rhodamine. Cell lysates were collected and immunoprecipitated with JNK antiserum as described above. The immunoprecipitates were assayed for JNK activity using a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (1–169) fusion protein as described in the instructions for the JNK activity kit. However, nonradioactive ATP was substituted for [γ-32P]ATP, and GST-c-Jun (1–169) fusion protein phosphorylation was assessed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with 1:1000 anti-phospho-c-Jun antiserum. Several laboratories, including our own, have used SH-SY5Y cells as a model system to study the role of IGFs in neuronal survival (38Singleton J.R. Dixit V.M. Feldman E.L. J. Biol.

We have reported that IGF-I can protect SH-SY5Y cells from PCD in the face of several death-inducing stimuli, including hyperglycemia, osmotic shock, and DNA-damaging agents (35Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Matthews C.C. Odeh H. Feldman E.L.

Dixit V.M. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31791-31794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As a first step in understanding IGF-I-mediated neuroprotection, we began examining the signaling cascades that could underlie cell death mediated by hyperglycemic, hyperosmotic stress. We speculated that high glucose-induced PCD is mediated, in part, by activation of the stress-activated protein kinases p38 kinase and JNK. Because phosphorylation of p38 kinase and JNK is a hallmark of their activation (1Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of glucose on the tyrosine phosphorylation of these two proteins. We first analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 kinase by immunoprecipitation with PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-p38 kinase antiserum. As shown in Fig.1, treatment of the SH-SY5Y cells with DMEM + 20 or 150 mm glucose induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 kinase (Fig. 1). Treatment of the cells with DMEM alone, however, did not stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 kinase. Interestingly, the time course for p38 kinase phosphorylation was concentration-dependent. Specifically, p38 kinase was tyrosine-phosphorylated 15 min after treatment with 20 mm glucose, and maximal phosphorylation was observed after 30 min. The phosphorylation decreased after 90 min (Fig.1 A). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation after treatment with 150 mm glucose resulted in p38 kinase tyrosine phosphorylation within 5 min with a peak of phosphorylation at 30 min. Phosphorylation was sustained up to 90 min (Fig. 1 B). In a separate set of experiments, we examined the effects of glucose treatment on JNK tyrosine phosphorylation. In these experiments, JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-JNK antisera, and tyrosine phosphorylation assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 2 A, DMEM + 5 or 20 mm glucose stimulated JNK tyrosine phosphorylation after 15 min, whereas DMEM + 150 mm glucose stimulated JNK tyrosine phosphorylation within 5 min. Thus, the time course of maximal JNK activation correlates with the intensity of glycemic exposure. As expected, immunoblotting revealed no major change in JNK expression (Fig. 2 B). We have previously shown that IGF-I protects SH-SY5Y cells from glucose-induced PCD. Because our results suggested that p38 kinase and JNK tyrosine phosphorylation participate in the stress response of these cells to glucose, we investigated the effect of IGF-I on their tyrosine phosphorylation. As seen in Fig.3 A, IGF-I activated p38 kinase phosphorylation in a time and dose-dependent manner. IGF-I-induced p38 kinase tyrosine phosphorylation was observed after 2 min and peaked between 5 and 15 min. p38 kinase tyrosine phosphorylation returned to baseline by 30 min. Addition of 10 nm IGF-I along with DMEM + 20 mm glucose enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p38 (Fig. 3 B). In direct contrast to p38 kinase, the induction of JNK tyrosine phosphorylation by DMEM + 20 mm glucose was inhibited by IGF-I (Fig. 4 A). JNK immunoblots demonstrated similar loading of samples (Fig.4 B). In parallel, we observed the induction of JNK kinase activity by DMEM + 20 mm glucose, as assessed by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun, was blocked by 10 nm IGF-I (Fig. 4 C). JNK immunoblots demonstrated equal sample loading (Fig. 4 D).Figure 4IGF-I inhibits JNK tyrosine phosphorylation. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with DMEM containing various additions, and JNK tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. A, effect of IGF-I on glucose-induced JNK tyrosine phosphorylation. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with DMEM alone as a control (C) or treated with DMEM + 20 mm glucose (G) or DMEM + 20 mm glucose + 10 nm IGF-I (GI) for 15 and 30 min. B, the immunoblot was stripped and reprobed with anti-JNK serum. C, effect of IGF-I on glucose-induced JNK kinase activity. Cells were treated for 15 min with DMEM + 20 mm glucose (G) or DMEM + 20 mmglucose + 10 nm IGF-I (GI). JNK activity was determined by GST-c-Jun (1–169) phosphorylation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Blots from the JNK activity assay were stripped and immunoblotted with anti-JNK serum. Results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Members of the MAP kinase family are translocated to the nucleus upon activation, where they are thought to elicit their effects on transcription (1Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further explore the effects of glucose and IGF-I on p38 kinase and JNK function, we examined how these agents influence the localization of JNK and p38 kinase in SH-SY5Y cells. In these experiments, cells were treated with 20 mm glucose ± 10 nm IGF-I for 30 min, and cells were stained with p38 kinase or JNK antiserum. We found that in cells treated with DMEM alone, p38 kinase and JNK appear to be localized throughout the cell body (Fig.5, A and D: nuclear localization,arrows; cytoplasmic localization, arrowheads). When the cells are treated with DMEM + 20 mm glucose, p38 kinase and JNK immunoreactivity is found primarily in the nucleus (Fig.5, B and E, arrows), with very weak cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5, B and E, arrowheads). Treatment of the cells with DMEM containing both IGF-I and 20 mmglucose results in nuclear localization of p38 kinase (Fig.5 C: nuclear localization, arrows; cytoplasm,arrowheads), whereas JNK is localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 F: nuclear localization, arrows; cytoplasmic localization, arrowheads). Thus, there is a direct contrast between how IGF-I influences the glucose-induced nuclear localization of p38 kinase and how it influences that of JNK. Investigation of IGF-I-mediated effects on JNK is complicated by the fact that IGF-I interacts with both the IGF-IR and a family of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). We have reported that SH-SY5Y cells express IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5 (42Feldman E.L. Randolph A. Yee D. Raizada M.K. LeRoith D. The role of insulin-like growth factors in the nervous system. The New York Academy of Sciences, New York1993: 262-264Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of IGF-I on JNK were mediated via the IGF-IR rather than the IGFBPs, we treated cells with 20 mm glucose and 10 nm IGF-I in the presence of the neutralizing IGF-IR antibody. When cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml α-IR3for 1 h, there was no inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by IGF-I (Fig. 6). These results suggest that inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by IGF-I occurs via the IGF-IR. Commonly, binding of a growth factor to a growth factor receptor activates two signaling pathways: MAPK and PI-3K. The interplay between growth factor activation of these pathways with that of JNK is unclear (1Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 43Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that activation of JNK by some ligands may require signaling through both PI-3K and MAPKs (43Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As a first step toward understanding which of these signaling pathways are involved in IGF-I-mediated JNK inhibition, we examined the effects of glucose on IGF-I activation of ERKs. We have previously reported that IGF-I activates ERK2 in a dose- and time-dependent fashion (44Kim B. Leventhal P.S. Saltiel A.R. Feldman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21268-21273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig.7 A) or ERK2 immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 7 B) confirms that IGF-I treatment activates the tyrosine phosphorylation of p42 ERK2. IGF-I activation of ERK2 phosphorylation was reduced by 20 mm glucose at 2 and 5 min, suggesting that glucose interferes with early IGF-IR signaling. However, this effect was transient. By 15 min, glucose had no effect on the ability of IGF-I to activate ERK2. These results indicate that IGF-I inhibition of JNK activation occurs via the IGF-IR and that these effects could be mediated, in part, by the MAPK pathway. To further establish the respective roles of the MAPK and PI-3K pathways in IGF-I inhibition of JNK activation, we treated cells with either the PI-3K blocker wortmannin (45Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) or an inhibitor of MAPK signaling, PD98059 (46Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with 20 mmglucose and 10 nm IGF-I in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin, there was no effect on IGF-I inhibition of JNK activation (Fig. 6). A separate PI-3K blocker, LY294002, also had no effect on IGF-I inhibition of JNK activation (data not shown). In sharp contrast, 10 μm PD98059 completely blocked the effect of IGF-I on JNK phosphorylation. Collectively, these data suggest that IGF-I inhibits glucose-mediated JNK phosphorylation via activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. These data also suggest a role for MAPK signaling in neuroprotection by IGFs. Our laboratory is interested in understanding how IGF-I rescues neurons from PCD (35Matthews C.C. Feldman E.L. J. Cell.

Several recent reports suggest a link between p38 kinase and JNK, and neuronal cell death (22Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

In each case, we first investigated the effects of a death-inducing stimulus, high glucose, on p38 kinase and JNK activity. We next determined how IGF-I regulated p38 kinase and JNK activity during normal growth as well as under experimental conditions where IGF-I protects SH-SY5Y cells from glucose-mediated PCD. Treatment with high glucose stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p38 kinase and JNK, suggesting that both kinases are activated. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of a GST-c-Jun fusion protein by JNK is enhanced in glucose-treated cells. This glucose-stimulated p38 kinase and JNK phosphorylation first occurred when cells were treated with DMEM + 20 mm glucose. This represents an iso-osmotic (320 mosmol), hyperglycemic stress that kills neurons over a 24-h time period (49Gandhi D. Mathews C.C. Feldman E.L. Hotta N. Greene D."

The various AKAPs are functional and not structural homologs; they possess partly homologous RII-binding domains, but the remaining portions of their sequences are divergent. Moreover, different AKAPs target PKAII isoforms to distinct intracellular loci including mitochondria, peroxisomes, Golgi, and plasma membranes and sites in cytoskeleton (1Rubin C.S. Biochim.

This accomplishes incorporation of AKAP·PKAII complexes into signaling modules that are either juxtaposed with or spatially segregated from hormone-activated adenylate cyclase. Substrate-effector proteins are thought to be clustered in proximity with anchored PKAII. RIα is expressed in most tissues, where it mediates (as PKAIα) actions of many hormones. It is the only R isoform that is essential for the progression of embryogenesis (7Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K. Brandon E.P. Wailes L.A. Le K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Persistent synthesis of low levels of free RIα serves as a critical homeostatic mechanism to maintain the total R:PKA catalytic subunit (C) ratio at 1 (7Amieux P.S. Cummings D.E. Motamed K.

If excess C accumulates it is bound by RIα, and thet½ of RIα increases 5-fold, thereby inhibiting otherwise unregulated and potentially toxic C activity. It is possible that RIα (PKAIα) functions are further diversified by interactions with anchor proteins. This topic received little attention because fractionation of cell and tissue homogenates and immunocytochemical localization analysis indicate that the bulk of PKAI is dispersed in cytoplasm. However, RI is bound to the plasma membrane of human erythrocytes, and PKAI is recruited to a multi-protein complex at the “cap” site of activated T lymphocytes (8Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. Rosen O.M.

Moreover, high concentrations of RIα competitively inhibit the binding of RII subunits with D-AKAP1 and Ht31 (10Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Although RIIα is bound with 25–500-fold higher affinity than RIα in the cited studies (10Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

The preceding observations raise additional pertinent questions. Are there high affinity, RI-specific anchor proteins? If so, what is the biochemical basis for the binding and anchoring of RI (PKAI)? To what degree are structures of RI anchor proteins homologous with or divergent from RII-selective AKAPs? The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an advantageous system for addressing these questions. The pathways, protein components, and mechanisms of cell signaling systems are conserved between C. elegans and mammals (13Han M. Sternberg P. Cell. 1990; 65: 921-931Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14Clark G.S. Stern M.J. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, the C. elegans genome contains only one C gene and one R gene (15Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Lu X. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6896-6907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. elegans C is 82% identical with mammalian Cα. C. elegans R (RCE) is closely related to mammalian RIα (∼60% overall identity) but not the RII isoforms (∼30% identity) (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like RIα (17Bubis J. Vedvick T.L. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), RCE has a pseudosubstrate site and two N-terminal Cys residues that covalently cross-link RCEsubunits in vitro. 2R. Angelo and C. S. Rubin, unpublished results. Moreover, RCE has (a) an N-terminal region that is homologous with the RI dimerization domain and (b) cAMP-binding sites that are 100% (site 1) and 87% (site 2) identical with corresponding regions in RIα (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties strongly indicate that RCE is a homolog of RI. A basic conundrum is as follows: how can one PKA holoenzyme mediate all aspects of cAMP-regulated signaling? Fractionation of C. elegans homogenates revealed that only 40% of PKA is isolated in cytosol, whereas 60% partitioned with the particulate fraction (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, RCE anchor proteins might play a key role in diversifying and adapting C. elegans PKA for multiple functions. We now report the discovery and characterization of an RCE-binding protein, AKAPCE. Approximately 500,000 plaques from a C. elegans cDNA library in the expression vector λZAPII (CLONTECH) were screened by the procedure of Bregman et al. (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length,32P-labeled RCE (1.5 × 105cpm/ml) (see below) was used as a probe. Complexes of radiolabeled RCE with β-galactosidase-AKAP fusion proteins were detected by autoradiography (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive plaques were purified to homogeneity. Recombinant pBluescript SK phagemids that contained anchor protein cDNAs were excised from the phage in Escherichia coli (20Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar), amplified, and purified. Two related cDNA clones were isolated. The larger cDNA (4.3 kbp) contained the complete coding and 3′-untranslated sequences for AKAPCE mRNA, as well as a segment of the 5′-untranslated region. The entire sequence of the smaller cDNA (3.3 kbp) is included within the larger insert. cDNA inserts were sequenced by a dideoxynucleotide chain termination procedure (21Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar) as described previously (6Chen Q. Lin R.-Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparisons, and data base searches were performed using PCGENE-Intelligenetics software (Intelligenetics, Mountainview, CA) and BLAST programs (22Pearson W.R.

Complementary DNA encoding C. elegans RCE was cloned and sequenced as described in a previous paper (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A DNA insert that encodes amino acids 1–73 in RCE was amplified by the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) chain reaction (PCR). The 5′ primer contained aNotI restriction sequence upstream from an ATG codon in the context of an NdeI cleavage site. This was followed by 18 nucleotides corresponding to codons 2–7 of RCE (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ primer corresponded to the complement of codons 67–73 in RCE. A unique BspE1 site is embedded in codon 71. Amplified DNA was digested with NotI andBspE1 and cloned into a recombinant pBluescript plasmid (which contains full-length RCE cDNA) that was cleaved with NotI (a 5′ vector site) and BspE1. Fidelity of the PCR amplification was verified by DNA sequencing. Next, full-length RCE cDNA was released from pBluescript by digestion with NdeI and KpnI (a 3′ vector site) and cloned into the plasmid pGEM3Z (Promega) that was digested with the same restriction enzymes. Finally, RCE cDNA was excised from the pGEM3Z plasmid by cleavage with NdeI andBamHI (a 3′ vector site) and cloned into the expression plasmid pET14b (Novagen), which was cut with the same restriction endonucleases. In pET14b RCE cDNA (375 codons) is preceded by DNA that encodes a 20-residue N-terminal fusion peptide that includes 6 consecutive His residues. Transcription of the chimeric gene is governed by a promoter sequence for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, and synthesis of the polymerase is induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the expression plasmid, and synthesis of His-tagged RCE was induced with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described previously (24Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

To generate a radiolabeled probe for screening a cDNA expression library (see above), purified RCE was phosphorylated by incubation with Mg-[γ-32P]ATP and casein kinase as described previously (25Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). RCE was labeled to a higher specific activity for overlay and equilibrium binding assays by using a different approach. Gly94 in the pseudosubstrate site (RRTGI) was replaced with a phosphorylatable residue (Ser) via site-directed mutagenesis, using previously described conditions (26Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation has no effect on the properties of RCE. However, it enables the efficient phosphorylation of RCE by incubation with Mg-[γ-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, as previously reported (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis was performed via PCR as described for AKAP75 and S-AKAP84 (4Lin R.-Y. Moss S.B.

Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) after digestion of insert and vector with EcoRI andHindIII. This placed cDNAs encoding partial AKAPCE polypeptides downstream from and in-frame with the 3′ terminus of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in the vector. Transcription of the GST fusion gene is driven by an inducibletac promoter. High levels of chimeric GST partial AKAPCE polypeptides were produced when E. coliDH5α was transformed with recombinant pGEX-KG plasmids and then induced with 0.5 mm IPTG as described previously (28Han J.-D. Baker N.E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26611-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the RCE-binding domain of AKAPCE via site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (26Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C. eleganswas grown at 20 °C as described previously (29Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cell line (AV-12) derived from a hamster subcutaneous tumor was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Full-length RCE and AKAPCE cDNA inserts were excised from recombinant, pBluescript plasmids by digestion with NotI andApaI and ligated into the pCIS2 mammalian expression vector (30Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA Protein Eng. Tech. 1990; 2: 3-10Google Scholar), which was cleaved with the same enzymes. This placed the cDNAs downstream from a powerful cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream from a poly(A) addition signal. Transient transfections of AV-12 cells were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation (31Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 60 h after transfection. A fragment of AKAPCE cDNA (nucleotides 526–1227, Fig. 2 A) that encodes amino acids 176–409 in the anchor protein was cloned into the expression plasmid pGEX-KG. The methodology is described above for “Deletion Mutagenesis of AKAPCE.” This enabled synthesis of a GST-AKAPCE fusion protein in E. coli DH5α that was transformed with recombinant plasmid and induced with IPTG (24Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). After induction, bacteria were disrupted in a French press, and the soluble GST-AKAPCE (176–409) protein was purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously reported (24Land M.

Serum was collected at 3-week intervals after the first injection. Purified GST partial AKAPCE antigen was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B as described by Bregman et al. (19Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a final concentration of 1.7 mg of protein bound per ml of resin. Antibodies that bind GST were eliminated by passing serum (2 ml) over a column of GST-Sepharose 4B (24Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adsorbed serum was applied to a column (2 ml) of partial AKAPCE (176–409)-Sepharose 4B. The resin was washed extensively, and anti-AKAPCE IgGs were then isolated by successive elutions at pH 2.5 and pH 11.8, as described previously (24Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9234-9244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sufficient 1 m Na2HPO4 or 0.5m Hepes was added to column fractions to adjust the pH to ∼7.5. The IgG concentration was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm. IgGs were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 50% (v/v) glycerol and were stored at −20 °C. Preparation of antibodies directed against RCE is described in Lu et al. (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-RCE IgGs were purified from serum by affinity chromatography on a column of Sepharose 4B that was derivatized with 2.2 mg/ml His-tagged, full-length RCE(see above). Specific anti-RCE IgGs were eluted and stored as described above. Proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Bregman D.B. Hirsch A.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7207-7213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin (M r = 210,000), phosphorylaseb (M r = 97,000), transferrin (M r = 77,000), albumin (M r = 68,000), ovalbumin (M r = 45,000), and carbonic anhydrase (M r = 29,000) were used as standards for the estimation of molecular weight values. Size-fractionated proteins were transferred from denaturing polyacrylamide gels to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.) as described previously (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were blocked, incubated with affinity purified IgGs directed against AKAPCE (1:4000, relative to serum), and washed as described previously (26Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

In brief, a Western blot is probed with 32P-labeled RCE (using a subunit concentration of 0.3–0.7 nm and 2 × 105 cpm 32P radioactivity/ml). Complexes of 32P-RCE and RCE-binding proteins are visualized by autoradiography. Results were quantified by scanning laser densitometry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech XL laser densitometer) or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) as described previously (26Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots (200 ng) of highly purified, GST partial AKAPCE protein (residues 176–409, Fig. 2 A) were used for binding assays. Residues 236–255 constitute the high affinity RCE-binding site in AKAPCE (see “Results”). Full-length C. elegans RCE was expressed, purified, and labeled with32P as described above. Binding assays were performed in 250 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) supplemented with 5% (w/v) fat-free powdered milk proteins. The amount of 32P-labeled RCE was varied from 0.1 to 25 nm. Incubations were carried out at 0 °C for 90 min. Subsequently, 40 μl of a 50% suspension of GSH-Sepharose 4B beads, which was pre-equilibrated with buffer A plus 5% milk proteins, was added and the incubation was continued for 30 min. Next, the samples were diluted to 1 ml with buffer A plus 5% milk, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of buffer A, 5% milk and centrifugation at 2,000 × g at 4 °C. Finally, partial AKAPCE·RCE complexes on the beads were washed three times by resuspension in 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation at 2,000 × g. Bound32P-labeled RCE was eluted from the beads in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was determined by a scintillation counter. 32P radioactivity in an aliquot of the first supernatant solution was also determined to measure the amount of free RCE. Similar results were obtained when the beads were collected and rapidly washed on glass fiber filters. Cytosol was prepared from transfected AV-12 cells as described previously (31Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Affinity purified IgGs directed against RCE (3 μl, 1:1.5, relative to serum) or preimmune serum (2 μl) were mixed with ∼100 μl of cytosol containing 150 μg of protein, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Next, 30 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 16 h. Subsequently, samples were diluted with 0.9 ml of buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20 and centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected and washed five times (1 ml per wash) with buffer A, 0.1% Triton X-100 by resuspension and centrifugation at 4,000 × g. Proteins in immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose 4B were dissolved and denatured in gel loading buffer, fractionated according to size by denaturing electrophoresis, and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane as described above. The Western blots were probed with anti-AKAPCE IgGs and AKAPCE·IgG complexes were visualized as described above. The overlay binding assay described by Bregmanet al. (18Bregman D.B. Battacharya N.

To execute functional screening of a C. elegans cDNA expression library, it was essential to produce and purify the nematode RI-like, cAMP-binding subunit, RCE. A cDNA that encodes full-length RCE(375 amino acids) (16Lu X.Y. Gross R.E. Bagchi S. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3293-3303Abstract Full Tex"

The enzyme was purified 83,400-fold with an overall yield of 21.1% from a culture supernatant of strain AN17. After being stained with a silver staining solution, the purified enzyme showed a single protein band, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme showed quite wide specificity for various ceramides,i.e. it hydrolyzed ceramides containing C12:0–C18:0 fatty acids and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labeled dodecanoic acid, and not only ceramide containing sphingosine (d18:1) or sphinganine (d18:0) but also phytosphingosine (t18:0) as the long-chain base. However, the enzyme did not hydrolyze galactosylceramide, sulfatide, GM1, or sphingomyelin, and thus was clearly distinguished from aPseudomonas sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (Ito, M., Kurita, T., and Kita, K. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24370–24374). This bacterial ceramidase had a pH optimum of 8.0–9.0, an apparent K m of 139 μm, and a V max of 5.3 μmol/min/mg using N-palmitoylsphingosine as the substrate. The enzyme appears to require Ca2+ for expression of the activity. Interestingly, the 70-kDa protein catalyzed a reversible reaction in which the N-acyl linkage of ceramide was either cleaved or synthesized.

Ceramide is a common biosynthetic precursor of sphingolipids such as acidic and neutral glycosphingolipids (GSLs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSL, glycosphingolipid; CDase, ceramidase; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SCDase, sphingolipid ceramideN-deacylase; SM, sphingomyelin; TDC, taurodeoxycholate; TFAc, trifluoroacetyl. and sphingomyelin (SM). Recently, ceramide has emerged as a second messenger in cell differentiation (1Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). In the epidermis of mammalian skin, ceramide is produced from SM and glucosylceramide by the action of sphingomyelinase and β-glucosidase, respectively, and then secreted into the extracellular space to form a mantle surrounding individual horny (keratinized) cells (4Lampe M.A. Burlingame A.L. Whitney J. Williams M.L. Brown B.E. Roitman E. Elias P.M. J. Lipid. Res. 1983; 24: 120-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This extracellular ceramide, arranged in a lamellar structure, may serve as a major component of the permeability barrier and a skin water reservoir (5Imokawa G. Akasaki S. Hattori M. Yoshizuka N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 758-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramidase (CDase, EC 3.5.1.23) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes theN-acyl linkage between fatty acids and sphingosine bases in ceramides. It was strongly suggested that CDase plays a crucial role not only in the control of cellular ceramide content but also in the regulation of intracellular signal transduction (6Coroneos E.

Recently the gene of acidic CDase from human urine was cloned and expressed in COS-1 cells (14Koch J. Gärtner S. Li C.-M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, to date, no CDase has been isolated from prokaryotes. Although the etiologic factors in atopic dermatitis have yet to be fully elucidated, dry and barrier-disrupted skin is a distinctive feature of this disease which could be evoked by a decrease of ceramide in the stratum corneum (15Imokawa G. Abe A. Jin K. Higaki Y. Kawashima M. Hidano A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Recently, the activity of a SM-deacylase capable of hydrolyzing SM to generate sphingosylphosphorylcholine and fatty acid was detected in atopic dermatitis (16Murata Y. Ogata J. Higaki Y. Kawashima M. Yada Y. Higuchi K. Tsuchiya T. Kawaminami S. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1242-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The activity of this enzyme was considered to relate to the decrease of ceramide in atopic dermatitis (16Murata Y. Ogata J. Higaki Y. Kawashima M. Yada Y. Higuchi K. Tsuchiya T. Kawaminami S. Imokawa G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1242-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), since the enzyme may decrease the content of SM which appeared to be the main precursor of ceramide in the human skin. However, a SM-deacylase was originally found in bacteria (17Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and thus we examined whether lesions of atopic dermatitis were infected with sphingolipid-degrading bacteria. As a result, we have isolated many sphingolipid-degrading bacteria including SM-deacylase producers from the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. Surprisingly, the most dominant bacteria among isolates were the unknown CDase producers. This report describes the purification and characterization of a novel type of CDase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AN17 isolated from the skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis. 14C-Labeled fatty acids (stearic acid, palmitic acid, and lauric acid) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. N-Palmitoylsphingosine, ceramide III, SM, d-sphingosine, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma. A precoated Silica Gel 60 TLC plate was obtained from Merck (Germany). Sep-Pak Plus Silica, Sep-Pak CM, Sep-Pak QMA, and Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, and bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit were purchased from Waters and Pierce, respectively. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. A type strain of P. aeruginosaIFO12689 was obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (IFO), Japan. AN17 was isolated from a 29-year-old female patient with relatively severe atopic dermatitis, who was attending the dermatologic clinic of our university and receiving no topical corticosteroids. The patient was diagnosed according the clinical criteria (18Imayama S. Hashizume T. Miyahara H. Tanahashi T. Takeishi M. Kubota Y. Koga T. Hori Y. Fukuda H. J. Am. Acad.

CDase-producing bacteria were isolated from desquamated materials of the patient with atopic dermatitis by an enrichment culture method using a synthetic medium A (0.05% NH4Cl, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.05% TDC, pH 7.2), containing 0.05% SM as the sole source of carbon. When appropriate, ceramide was used instead of SM at the same concentration. Briefly, a small amount of desquamated material was suspended in 100 μl of synthetic medium A containing 0.05% SM in an Eppendorf tube and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. After incubation, 5 μl of culture were transferred to fresh medium and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. This procedure was repeated four or five times, and then SM-utilizing bacteria were isolated using Trypto-Soya agar plates (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Japan) containing 0.01% SM. Each strain of isolated bacteria was cultured in synthetic medium A containing 0.05% SM at 30 °C for 3 days, and the supernatant was then subjected to an assay for CDase activity as described below. The identification of strain AN17 was conducted according to the 8th edition of Bergy's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (20Buchanan R.E. Gibbons N.E. Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology. 8th ed, pp. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1974: 217-253Google Scholar). The main characteristics of AN17 were as follows: Gram-negative rod (0.8 × 1.6 μm), motile with polar flagella, optimum growth at 37 °C, growth at 42 °C positive, O-F test oxidative, catalase positive, oxidase positive, denitrification positive, fluorescent pigment production positive, and GC content 66%. AN17 was thus assigned toP. aeruginosa. This strain is maintained in a Trypto-Soya agar slant containing 0.01% SM at our laboratory. Syntheses of 14C-labeled ceramides and GSLs were conducted by using the reverse hydrolysis (condensation) reaction of sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (SCDase) as described in Mitsutake et al. (21Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Mitsutake S. Kita K. Nakagawa T. Ito M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SCDase efficiently condensed the free fatty acid to sphingosine, although the enzyme hardly hydrolyzed ceramides (21Mitsutake S. Kita K. Okino N. Ito M. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). C12-NBD-ceramide was also synthesized by SCDase. 2M. Tani, K. Kita, H. Komori, T. Nakagawa, and M. Ito, unpublished results. Briefly,N-TFAc-aminododecanoic acid, which was prepared from amino-fatty acid by blocking with TFAc, was condensed with sphingosine by SCDase at pH 10. After the reaction, excess amounts of sphingosine and N-TFAc-aminododecanoic acid were separated fromN-TFAc-amino-ceramide by using Sep-Pak C18, Sep-Pak Plus Silica, and Sep-Pak QMA cartridges. The block was removed by CH3ONa to produce ω-amino-ceramide, which was then purified with Sep-Pak C18 and Sep-Pak Plus Silica cartridges. Purified ω-amino-ceramide was then labeled with NBD fluoride. C12-NBD-ceramide was finally purified with a Sep-Pak Plus Silica cartridge. The activity of CDase was measured using C12-NBD-ceramide as a substrate as described below. The reaction mixture contained 550 pmol of C12-NBD-ceramide and an appropriate amount of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2.5 mmCaCl2. Following incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 30 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I (chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonia, 90/20/0.5, v/v). C12-NBD-fatty acid released by the action of the enzyme and the remaining C12-NBD-ceramide were separated on a TLC and then analyzed and quantified with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner (excitation 475 nm, emission 525 nm). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount capable of catalyzing the release of 1 μmol of C12-NBD-fatty acid/min from the C12-NBD-ceramide under the conditions described above. A value of 10−3 units of enzyme was expressed as 1 milliunit in this study. A reverse hydrolysis reaction was measured by the method described below. The mixture containing 100 pmol of [14C]palmitic acid and 500 pmol of sphingosine in 20 μl of 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2.5 mm CaCl2 was incubated at 37 °C for an appropriate time, and the reaction was terminated by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The sample was evaporated, dissolved in 20 μl of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v), and applied to a TLC plate, which was developed with solvent I. An imaging analyzer BAS1000 (Fuji Film, Japan) was used for analysis and quantification of the [14C]ceramide produced and unreacted [14C]palmitic acid. Inocula from an agar slant of the strain AN17 were introduced into a 14-ml test tube containing 4 ml of sterilized PY-medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.01% SM and 0.05% TDC, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 day with vigorous shaking. The culture was then transferred to four cotton-plugged 2,000-ml flasks each containing 500 ml of the same medium and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days with vigorous shaking. The culture fluid was centrifuged at 5,600 ×g for 20 min, and the supernatant obtained (1,900 ml) was then applied to a DEAE Sepharose FF column (30 × 120 mm; Amesham Pharmacia), previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (w/v) Lubrol PX (buffer A), using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system (Yamazen Co., Japan). The enzyme was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of buffer A with increasing concentration of NaCl up to 1 m at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled (36 ml), supplemented with NaCl to 1m, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose FF column (15 × 150 mm; Amersham) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 mNaCl. The proteins were eluted with an increasing Lubrol PX gradient from 0 to 1% in buffer A, using a BPLC-600FC HPLC system at the flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled (45 ml), and half of this sample was applied to a POROS PI packed column (4.6 × 100 mm; PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with an increasing NaCl gradient from 0 to 1 min buffer A, using the BioCAD system at the flow rate of 5 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled (15 ml) and concentrated using a Millipore Molcut LGC (10,000-cut), and an aliquot of the samples (0.25 ml) was applied to a TSKgel G3000SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm; TOSOH Co., Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.3% Lubrol PX. The protein was eluted from the column with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The CDase activity was detected in Fr. 27–33 as shown in Fig. 1 C. This chromatography using a TSKgel G3000SWXL column was found to be repeatable at least 20 times with high recovery. Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) or SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The proteins on SDS-PAGE were visualized by staining with a silver-staining solution (24Ohsawa K. Ebata N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and determined with a Shimadzu CS-9300 chromatoscanner with the reflectance mode set at 540 nm (Table I, Fig. 1 C).Table IPurification of CDase from P. aeruginosaStepTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityRecoveryPurificationmilliunitsmgmilliunits/mg%-foldCulture fluid396017702.231001DEAE-Sepharose FF70264.410.917.74.89Phenyl-Sepharose FF14138.9615835.770.9POROS PI11233.6131128.4139TSKgel G3000SWXL8354.48 × 10−31-aEstimated by SDS-PAGE as described in the text.186,00021.183,4001-a Estimated by SDS-PAGE as described in the text.

Open table in a new tab 14C-Labeled sphingolipids (100 pmol each) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and 12 h (for ceramides) or 16 h (for GSLs and sphingomyelin) with 10 microunits of the enzyme in 20 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100. 14C-Labeled fatty acid and 14C-labeled substrates were separated by TLC and analyzed with an imaging analyzer as described in the text. The extent of hydrolysis (%) was calculated as follows: 14C-labeled fatty acid released × 100/14C-labeled substrate remaining + 14C-labeled fatty acid released. Sphingosine bases were determined with HPLC essentially as described in Merrill et al. (28Merrill A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C.L. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were dissolved in 50 μl of methanol and mixed with 50 μl of the o-phthalaldehyde reaction buffer (9.9 ml of 3% boric acid, pH 10.5, mixed with 0.1 ml of ethanol containing 5 mg ofo-phthalaldehyde and 5 μl of β-mercaptoethanol). After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 0.25 ml of a mixture of methanol and 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, (9/1, v/v), was added. Sample was then applied to an Inertosil ODS-3 column (4.6 × 100 mm; GL Science Inc.) which was equilibrated with the same buffer solution. Sphingosine bases were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min using HITACHI L-7100 HPLC system and detected with a HITACHI L-7480 fluorescence detector (excitation 340 nm and emission 455 nm). Gas chromatography of fatty acids was conducted with GC-14A gas chromatography (Shimadzu Co., Japan) using a HR-SS-10 column (30 m, Shinwa Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) with the temperature programmed from 150 to 220 °C at the rate of 4 °C/min. Before analyses, fatty acid standards or samples were heated at 80 °C for 2 h in 1 ml of 5% anhydrous HCl in methanol for methanolysis. Sphingosine and fatty acids were also analyzed by positive and negative FAB-MS, respectively, using a Jeol JMS LX-2000 mass spectrometer (Jeol Ltd., Japan). Triethanolamine and 3-nitrobenzylalcohol were used as the matrix for the negative and positive ion mode, respectively. In this study, we have isolated many CDase-producing bacteria from desquamated materials of patients with atopic dermatitis using a synthetic medium containing SM or ceramide as the sole source of carbon. Among the isolates, the strain AN17, identified as P. aeruginosa, was selected for further study owing to its high productivity of CDase. The amount of CDase in the culture supernatant of AN17 was 1–2 milliunits/ml when the strain was cultivated at 30 °C for 2 days in a PY-medium containing SM. It was found that production of the CDase of this strain was induced by addition of ceramide or SM to the medium. Since the strain secreted sphingomyelinase as well, the SM added was hydrolyzed to generate ceramide which may induce the CDase production of this bacterium. CDase was purified from 2 liters of culture supernatant of strain AN17 by sequential chromatographies on DEAE Sepharose FF, phenyl-Sepharose FF, POROS PI and TSKgel G3000SWXL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in TableI, CDase was finally purified 83,400-fold with an overall yield of 21.1%. The most effective purification procedure for the bacterial CDase was the gel filtration chromatography using a TSKgel G3000SWXL column, in which the CDase was weakly adsorbed and eluted at about 1.5 bed volumes of the column. Using this chromatography, almost all remaining proteins were separated from the CDase, thereby increasing the purification about 600-fold (Table I). This chromatography seems to work as a kind of adsorption chromatography in which the enzyme may interact with the silica-based gel matrix. However, it should be noted that the chromatography using the TSKgel G3000SWXL column was specifically useful for bacterial alkaline CDase but not for other CDases, such as CDases of mouse liver (data not shown). This result may indicate that the bacterial CDase is somewhat different from other CDases in physical properties. The yield of CDase decreased with the progress of purification, but after phenyl-Sepharose chromatography it was found to increase (Table I), suggesting that some inhibitor(s) for CDase are removed at this step. The final preparation of bacterial CDase was completely free from the following enzymes: α- and β-galactosidases, α- and β-glucosidases, α- and β-mannosidases, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, proteases, sphingomyelinase, endoglycoceramidase, and SCDase, as was confirmed by activity determination made using 0.1 milliunit of CDase for each assay and incubation with an appropriate substrate for 16 h. The purified enzyme gave a single protein band on SDS-PAGE after staining with a silver-staining solution under both reduced (Fig.1 A, land 1) and nonreduced conditions (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The apparent molecular mass of CDase was estimated to be 70 kDa on SDS-PAGE under both conditions (Fig. 1 B), indicating no subunit is linked by disulfide bond in the enzyme molecule. This contrasts completely with human urine acid CDase (13Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which is composed of two subunits of molecular mass of 13 kDa (α) and 40 kDa (β). The 70-kDa protein was most likely to be a CDase, since the elution profile of CDase activity on the chromatography using a TSKgel G3000SWXL column at the final purification step coincided exactly with that of 70-kDa band (Fig. 1 C) and no other co-eluted bands were observed. The optimal activity of the CDase was found around pH 8.5 using 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 2 A), indicating that this enzyme should be classified as a type of alkaline CDase. The enzyme was potently inhibited by Zn2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, but not by Mn2+ or Mg2+ at 1 mm. EGTA and EDTA completely abolished the activity at the same concentration (Fig. 2 B). After EDTA treatment, Ca2+ addition reestablished the enzyme activity at 150% of that before treatment, indicating that Ca2+ is the preferred divalent cation. Mn2+ addition is about half as effective as Ca2+ in reestablishing enzyme activity (Fig.2 B). It was found that sphingosine (d18:1), sphinganine (d18:0), phytosphingosine (t18:0), and N-oleoylethanolamine inhibited enzyme activity by 92.7, 84.2, 39.8, and 67.8%, respectively, at a concentration of 100 μm. The addition of Triton X-100 at a concentration of 0.25–0.5% (w/v) increased the enzyme activity about 6-fold in comparison with that in the absence of the detergent, while the enzyme activity was little affected by TDC or cholate at a concentration up to 1% (w/v). The apparentK m and the V max were estimated to be 139 μm and 5.3 μmol/min/mg, respectively, using N-palmitoylsphingosine as a substrate in a 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100. The purified CDase was stable at room temperature (24 °C) for 12 h, but 25 and 100% of the activity were lost after being kept at 37 °C for 12 h and at 60 °C for 5 min, respectively. The enzyme can be kept at −85 °C for at least 2 months without detectable loss of activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Ceramide from bovine brain (ceramide III, Sigma) was digested with the enzyme and digestion products were subjected to TLC which was visualized either with a ninhydrin or a Coomassie Brilliant Blue reagent. A spot having the sameR F of the sphingosine standard (d18:1) was observed on TLC after enzyme treatment (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and4). Fatty acids were also detected when TLC was visualized with a Coomassie reagent (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Fig.3 B shows the chromatogram of HPLC showing sphingosine base released from the authentic ceramide, N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16:0, d18:1), by the enzyme. The product showed the same retention time as sphingosine (d18:1). The fatty acid released from the ceramide by the enzyme was identified to be palmitic acid (C16:0) by using gas chromatography (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, the digestion products of the ceramide showed molecular ion peaks at m/z255 and 301, by FAB-MS with negative and positive ion modes, respectively. These peaks coincided with (M − H)− of palmitic acid (C16:0) and (M + H)+ of sphingosine (d18:1), respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the enzyme cleaves the N-acyl linkage of ceramide to produce sphingosine base and fatty acid. We found that the bacterial CDase catalyzed not only the hydrolysis reaction but also its reverse reaction. When [14C]ceramide (C16:0, d18:1) was used as a substrate, [14C]palmitic acid was generated by the hydrolysis reaction with the enzyme (Fig.4 A, lane 4). On the other hand, [14C]ceramide was found to be synthesized when sphingosine was incubated with [14C]palmitic acid in the presence of the enzyme (Fig. 4 A, lane 6). The condensation reaction seems to be due to the action of the enzyme, since boiling of the enzyme at 100 °C for 5 min completely abolished the reaction (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). To determine whether a single protein catalyzed both hydrolysis and condensation reactions, the 70-kDa protein was subjected to Triton-PAGE in which 0.1% Triton X-100 was used instead of SDS. The gel was sliced into 3-mm pieces after electrophoresis, and the enzyme was extracted, before measuring the activities for hydrolysis and condensation reactions. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the activity for hydrolysis corresponded exactly with that for condensation. Additionally, the elution profile of the 70-kDa protein on the gel filtration chromatography using a TSKgel G3000SWXL column completely coincided with the activities of both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (Fig.1 C). These results showed that the 70-kDa protein catalyzed a reversible reaction in which the N-acyl linkage of ceramide was cleaved or synthesized. The substrate specificity of CDase of AN17 was examined using various 14C-labeled sphingolipids. As shown in Table II, CDase hydrolyzed various species of ceramides but not GalCer, sulfatide, GM1, or SM. This result clearly shows that this bacterial CDase is completely different from the SCDase capable of hydrolyzing the N-acyl linkage between fatty acids and sphingosine bases in ceramides of various GSLs and SM (17Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast to CDase, SCDase hardly attacked the N-acyl linkage of ceramides (17Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Ceramide containing sphingosine (d18:1), dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine, d18:0), or phytosphingosine (t18:0) was hydrolyzed by the bacterial CDase, but ceramide containing phytosphingosine was more resistant to hydrolysis by the enzyme (Table II). Interestingly, C12-NBD-ceramide (NBD-C12:0, d18:1) was hydrolyzed much faster thanN-lauroylsphingosine (C12:0, d18:1), suggesting that the susceptibility of ceramide to an alkaline CDase increases with the attachment of NBD to the fatty acid moiety of ceramide. The enzyme of P. aeruginosa strain AN17 seems to be a novel type of CDase, judging from the following observations. 1) The 70-kDa protein was the first purified CDase of prokaryotes. Previous reports on CDases were restricted to those from mammalian sources (11Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). 2) Mammalian CDases are classified mainly into two types according to their pH optima: an acidic CDase derived from lysosomes (13Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and a membrane-bound alkaline enzyme (6Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 12Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since the bacterial CDase shows a pH optimum of 8.0–9.0, it should be classified as an alkaline enzyme. However, the enzyme was a secreted protein and not membrane-bound. 3) The molecular weight and secondary structure of bacterial CDase were clearly different from those of mammals (12Yada Y. Higuchi K. Imokawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Bernardo K. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Desnick R.J. Ferlinz K. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11098-11102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the CDase of bacterial origin was not fully compared with that from other sources, because no detailed data for the purified enzyme is available at present except for the bacterial CDase. 4) The bacterial CDase is completely different from SCDase (17Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), since the CDase did not hydrolyze GSLs or SM. 5) The enzyme was activated by Ca2+ and inactivated by EDTA and EGTA. The activity of EDTA-inactivated enzyme was completely restored by addition of Ca2+, suggesting that Ca2+affects the catalytic domain of the enzyme. All CDases reported so far were independent on metal ions including Ca2+. It was suggested that an acidic ceramidase of rat brain participates in the synthesis as well as hydrolysis of ceramide (9Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the question of whether a single protein can catalyze both hydrolysis and synthesis reactions, or some other factors are required for ceramide synthesis by CDase remains open, because the enzyme has not yet been purified (9Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3131-3133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gatt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3724-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hassler D.F. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that the 70-kDa protein can catalyze the reversible reactions in which theN-amide bond of ceramide was either cleaved or synthesized without the assistance of co-factors (Figs. 1 C and 4). In the skin of atopic dermatitis, decrease of ceramide content in the stratum corneum (15Imokawa G. Abe A. Jin K. Higaki Y. Kawashima M. Hidano A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and replacement of abnormal fatty acids in the ceramide moiety have been reported (29Yamamoto A. Serizawa S. Ito M. Sato Y. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1991; 283: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These abnormalities might form the dry and barrier-disrupted skin. It was speculated by the present study that bacterial alkaline CDase could contribute directly or indirectly to the abnormality, since the enzyme was found to hydrolyze ceramides isolated from the desquamated materials of patients with atopic dermatitis (data not shown). The surface pH of normal skin is usually neutral or slightly acidic, whereas that of patients with atopic dermatitis tends to alkaline (30Anderson D.S. Br. J. Dermatol. 1951; 63: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which might suit the alkaline CDase of bacteria. One significant finding in this study is that the CDase-producing bacterium AN17 was identified to be P. aeruginosa, which is a well known opportunistic pathogen (31Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the strain P. aeruginosa IFO 12689 also retained the ability to produce CDase (data not shown). The role of the CDase as an etiologic factor in atopic dermatitis as well as infectious diseases caused by P. aeruginosa should be studied in the future. Some bacterial sphingolipid-degrading enzymes have proved to be a useful tool for sphingolipid research (17Ito M. Kurita T. Kita K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24370-24374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Ito M. Yamagata T. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2074624862,"To determine the organization of the orphan nuclear receptor SHP gene (Seol, W., Choi, H.-S., and Moore, D.D. (1996) Science 272, 1336–1339), genomic clones were isolated from human and mouse genomic libraries. TheSHP gene was composed of two exons interrupted by a single intron spanning approximately 1.8 kilobases in human and 1.2 kilobases in mouse. Genomic Southern blot analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization of human metaphase chromosomes indicated that the SHP gene is located at the human chromosome 1p36.1 subband. The 5′-flanking regions of human and mouse SHPgenes were highly conserved, showing 77% homology in the region of approximately 600 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start site. Primer extension analysis was carried out to determine the transcription start site of human SHP to 32 nucleotides downstream of a potential TATA box. The human SHP gene was specifically expressed in fetal liver, fetal adrenal gland, adult spleen, and adult small intestine. As expected from this expression pattern, the activity of the mouse SHP promoter measured by transient transfection was significantly higher in the adrenal-derived Y1 cells than HeLa cells.

The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcription factors regulated by small hydrophobic hormones such as retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and steroids and also includes a large number of related proteins that do not have known ligands, referred to as orphan nuclear receptors (for reviews see Refs. 1Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6043) Google Scholar). The nuclear receptors directly regulate transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements, generally located in promoters of target genes. The nuclear hormone receptors share a common domain structure. The central DNA binding domain (DBD) 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand binding domain; PHA, phytohemoagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand binding domain; PHA, phytohemoagglutinin. includes two zinc binding modules, which consist of a series of invariant cysteine residues. A conserved helical region termed the P box within the DBD (3Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) makes base-specific contacts and serves as one of the main criteria used for classification of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) binds to the cognate ligands. This domain also contains dimerization and transcriptional activation functions. A less well conserved hinge domain that separates DBD and the ligand binding domain has been thought to serve merely as a flexible linker. However, recent results demonstrate that it is also involved with transcriptional repression, at least for a subset of receptors (4Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). In addition, it was also shown to contain nuclear localization signals (1Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6043) Google Scholar). A quite variable N-terminal domain includes a transcriptional activation function with some receptors. Although ligands have not been identified for orphan nuclear receptors, a variety of results indicate that they have important functions. The simplest is that knockout mutations of these orphans in mice frequently have shown much more dramatic defects than similar mutations of the conventional receptor genes (5Chen W.S. Manova K. Weistein D.C. Duncan S.A. Plump A.S. Prezioso V.R. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 6Kastner P. Parker M. Chambon P.

We have recently reported an unusual orphan member of the nuclear receptors that contains a ligand binding domain but lacks the conserved DBD (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This orphan receptor interacts, both in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system with several conventional and orphan members of the receptor superfamily, including retinoid receptors (RAR and RXR), thyroid hormone receptor, and the orphan receptor CAR. In mammalian cells, this receptor specifically inhibited transactivation by the superfamily members with which it interacted, suggesting that it functions as a negative regulator of receptor-dependent signaling pathways. On the basis of its small size and its ability to interact with several superfamily members, it was named SHP (small heterodimer partner) (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The ability of SHP to interact with multiple superfamily members was independently confirmed by isolation of its rat homologue on the basis of its interaction with the PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) (9Masuda N. Yasumo H. Tamura T. Hashiguchi N. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ability of SHP to interact with a range of receptors with different affinities suggests that the level of SHP gene expression could play a pivotal role in regulation of receptor-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, information regarding the SHP promoter and its activity is crucial to understanding the function of this novel orphan receptor. In this report, we characterized the structure of the human and mouse SHPgenes, the location of the human gene, the expression pattern of SHP in various tissues, and the basal SHP promoter. Human and mouse genomic phage lambda libraries (CLONTECH, CA) were screened using the SHP cDNA as a probe. One human and three mouse SHP clones were independently isolated and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Boundaries between exons and introns were determined by DNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction analysis. The 5′-flanking region of the SHP gene was analyzed by restriction mapping, DNA sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction analysis. Sequence homology between human and mouse genes was analyzed by using the GCG program. The transcription start site of the SHP gene was determined by primer extension assay with an end-labeled oligonucleotide primer complementary to positions +34 to +69 of the human SHP coding sequence. Total RNA was prepared from HepG2 and JEG3 cells using guanidinium isothiocyanate and CsCl density gradient centrifugation (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1997Google Scholar). The isolated total RNAs were further purified using the Poly(A)-Tract mRNA isolation Kit (Promega, WI). The primer extension assay was basically performed as described previously (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1997Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled primer was mixed with 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA in 20 μl of hybridization buffer and denatured at 65 °C for 90 min. The mixture was slowly cooled down to room temperature. After the addition of 30 μl of reverse transcription buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 37.5 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2), 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 μl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), the reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The extended transcripts were recovered by ethanol precipitation after RNA digestion and phenol extraction and resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The start site was determined by comparison to sequencing reactions carried out on the genomic clone using the same primer in parallel. A human adult tissue blot was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), 13-week-old human fetus tissue RNA was isolated, and Northern blot analysis was carried out as described previously (11Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). A fragment containing 2080 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequences from the mouse SHP gene was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the genomic clone as template and used to replace the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter fragment in the pTKLuc reporter plasmid (12Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) to generate pSHP2080Luc. The 5′-deletion constructs were prepared by digestion with BamHI and restriction enzymes as indicated in Fig. 6 followed by Klenow fill-in and T4 ligation. Y1 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The day before transfection, cells were split into 12-well plates. On the next day, the medium was changed, and 4 h later, cells were transfected in triplicate using calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (12Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). For each well, equal molar amounts (0.5 μg of pSHP2080Luc, with others adjusted accordingly) of the pSHPLuc constructs was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pTKGH as an internal control. The medium was replaced 18 h after transfection, and cells were further grown for 36 h in culture medium. The medium was collected for measuring growth hormone activity, and the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (Promega, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GH and luciferase activities were determined as described previously (11Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1596-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid blot was obtained from Biosis Laboratories (New Haven, CN). A zoo blot containing EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs from nine eukaryotic species was purchased from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). The blots were hybridized with human SHP cDNA as a probe and washed with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and 0.1×SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Phytohemoagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocyte was synchronized with methotrexate, and human male metachromosomes were hybridized with a biotin-labeled SHP genomic DNA probe (13Park S.-W. Suh Y.-S. Kim H. Rhyu I.-J. Kim H.-L. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 200-203PubMed Google Scholar). Bromodeoxyuridine release technique was applied for the delineation of R- or G-band. Briefly, SHP probe was labeled with biotin dUTP by nick translation, and the labeled probe was combined with human Cot-1 DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating slides in fluorescein-conjugated avidin. The slides were counter-stained with propidium iodide and analyzed with a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. A total of 80 metaphase cells were examined, with 65 exhibiting specific signals. To investigate the genomic organization of the SHP gene, we isolated three genomic clones for the murine SHP gene and one for the humanSHP gene, respectively, from genomic phage lambda libraries by using SHP cDNA (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) as a probe. The genomic structures of human and mouse SHP genes were characterized by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction analysis, and sequences of the intron-exon boundaries and part of the coding regions were determined. As indicated in Fig. 1, A andB, both the human and mouse SHP genes consist of two exons interrupted by one intron, and the sequence of exon-intron boundaries conform to the consensus splicing signals. No evidence for the existence of the DBD of nuclear hormone receptors was found with neither the human nor the mouse genomic clones (data not shown). The intron in the human and mouse SHP gene lies between the first and second nucleotides of the codon for aspartic acid 181. This is quite reminiscent of the structure of the gene encoding the closest relative of SHP, DAX-1, which also consists of two exons with an intron located exactly at the same relative position (14Guo W. Burris T.P. Zhang Y.H. Huang B.L. Mason J. Copeland K.C. Kupfer S.R. Pagon R.A. McCabe E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2481-2486PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the chromosomal location of the SHP gene, a monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid Southern blot was hybridized with human SHP cDNA as a probe. The monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel consists of 24 hybrid cell lines, each carrying 1 or 2 human chromosomes within the context of mouse or hamster background, as shown in Fig. 2 A. Somatic cell hybrid 0A1AR that contained human chromosome 1 showed a 3.8-kilobase band hybridized to the human SHP cDNA probe. The identical band also showed up in control lanes of human and mixtures of human-mouse genomes. These results indicate that the SHP gene is located in human chromosome 1. To further locate the SHP gene on the human chromosome 1, fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out (Fig. 3). To confirm the precise location of the gene, the fluorescent signals were visualized directly on R-banded metaphase spreads, and the identical spreads were separately stained with Giemsa (data not shown). These analyses demonstrated that the SHP gene resides in a single locus on human chromosome 1 at position 1p36.1. A genomic Southern blot containing EcoRI-digested DNAs from various species was hybridized with human SHP cDNA as a probe (Fig. 2 B). Two genomic EcoRI fragments (approximately 7 and 2.8 kilobases) from human DNA, as well as one or two bands from various species were hybridized to the probe, indicating that the SHP genes are well conserved throughout different species (Fig. 2 B). Since the human SHP genomic clone has three EcoRI sites in its intron, those two bands are likely to originate from an identical SHP genome. This result is consistent with an idea that the SHPgene is a single-copy gene.Figure 3Fluorescence in situhybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of biotin-labeled SHP gene to human male metaphase, phytohemoagglutinin-stimulated peripheral lymphocyte. A human SHP probe was labeled, hybridized, and washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescent signals on chromosome 1p36.1 are indicated as arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis was used to identify the expression pattern of the SHP gene in various human tissues. SHP mRNA was detected in spleen and small intestine among human adult tissues examined (Fig.4 A). In addition,SHP gene expression was also detected in fetal liver and fetal adrenal gland (Fig. 4 B). These results confirm and extend previous results with the mouse (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and rat (9Masuda N. Yasumo H. Tamura T. Hashiguchi N. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) genes, which indicated a relatively tissue specific pattern of expression. To identify the transcription start site for the SHP gene, primer extension analysis was used with HepG2 mRNA as a template (Fig. 5 A). The apparent start site of transcription identified by these studies lies 32 nucleotides downstream from a consensus TATA box. This TATA motif is present within both the human and murine sequences, which are relatively well conserved over the 600 base pairs of 5′-flanking region (Fig.5 B) and match the 5′-end of the longest cDNA clone isolated previously (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To confirm that the 5′-flanking sequences of the SHP gene can confer promoter activity, an approximately 2-kilobase fragment of the mouse sequences was inserted into a luciferase reporter construct. As expected from the SHP expression in the adrenal gland, this construct showed significantly higher basal activity in the adrenal-derived Y1 cells than HeLa cells (Fig.6). Finally, a series of 5′-deletion mutants were constructed to locate sequences required for the promoter activity in Y1 cells. As indicated in Fig. 6, full activity was observed with rather short fragment from −139 to +22, with a further deletion to −68 showing significantly decreased expression. Thus, these results map the minimal SHP sequences necessary for the promoter activity in adrenal cells to approximately −139 to +22. The specific transcription factors involved in this activity remain unclear.Figure 5Transcription start site of the human SHP gene. A, to map the transcription start site, primer extension analysis was carried out using poly(A)+ RNA from HepG2 cell line (lane 2). Lane 1 represents the extended transcripts of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from human choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells. A sequencing ladder of the corresponding genomic fragment, which was primed with the identical oligonucleotide, was electrophoresed in parallel. The position of the consensus TATA site is as marked.

As it was the case with DAX-1 (14Guo W. Burris T.P. Zhang Y.H. Huang B.L. Mason J. Copeland K.C. Kupfer S.R. Pagon R.A. McCabe E.R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2481-2486PubMed Google Scholar), theSHP gene consists of two exons with a single intron located near the C terminus. Since this position lies within a relatively well conserved region of the ligand binding domain, it will be interesting to examine whether other receptor genes also have an analogous intron. Accordingly, several receptors, including CAR (15Choi H.-S. Chung M. Tzameli I. Simha D. Lee Y.-K. Seol W. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23565-23571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), vitamin D receptor (16Miyamoto K. Kesterson R.A. Yamamoto H. Taketani Y. Nishiwak E. Tatsumi S. Inoue Y. Morita K. Takeda E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1165-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and thyroid hormone receptor (17Sakurai A. Nakai A. DeGroot L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 71: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), have been shown to contain exactly analogous insertions in the conserved aspartate residue. In addition, the steroid receptors GR (glucocorticoid receptor), MR (mineralocorticoid receptor), AR (androgen receptor) and PR (progesterone receptor) were shown to share an insertion in what appears to be an analogous position (18Zennaro M.C. Keightley M.C. Kotelevtsev Y. Conway G.S. Soubrier F. Fuller P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, this intron is not present in every receptor genes known (e.g. theDrosophila orphan E75 (19Seagraves W.A. Hogness D.S. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 204-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar)), as expected from the generally observed intron loss over evolutionary time spans. However, the quite extensive divergence of the putative ligand binding domains of SHP and DAX-1 from those of other nuclear hormone receptor members (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) suggest that this intron must have been present in the earliest members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Since superfamily members are found in species ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, this intron must be quite ancient. Based on the results of genomic Southern blot and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, we concluded that the SHPgene is located at a single locus on the human chromosome one at position 1p36.1. At least two interesting functions map to this region: the tumor suppressor gene BCDS2, associated with ductal carcinoma of the breast (20Genuardi M. Tsihira H. Anderson D.E. Saunders G.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 45: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar), and an apparent tumor suppressor associated with cutaneous malignant melanoma-dysplastic nevus (21Bales S.J. Dracopoli N.C. Tucker M.A. Clark Jr., W.H. Fraser M.S. Green B.Z. Donis-Keller H. Housman D.E. Greene M.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320 (Correction): 1367-1372N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324 (Correction): 925Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Other studies indicate a loss of heterozygosity in this region in various tumors (e.g. Ref. 22Moley J.F. Brother M.B. Fong C.T. White P.S. Baylin S.B. Nelkin B. Wells S.A. Brodeur G.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 770-774PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither its postulated functions nor its limited pattern of expression suggest that SHP is a strong candidate for a tumor suppressor. In addition to the previous results suggesting the SHP expression in liver (8Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we observed specific expressions in small intestine, spleen, ovary, adrenal gland, and testis (Fig. 4 and data not shown). In particular, the expression in adrenal gland, ovary, and testis overlaps with that of the SHP relative, DAX-1, which also lacks the conventional DBD. A recent report suggests that DAX-1 inhibits transactivations by the orphan receptor SF-1, which is also expressed in these tissues (23Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, preliminary results suggest that SHP shows a functional synergy with SF-1. 2Y.-K. Lee, W. Seol, I. Tzameli, K. L. Parker, H.-S. Choi, and D. D. Moore, manuscript in preparation. Thus, it will be interesting to compare the developmental patterns of SHP expression with those of DAX-1 and SF-1 (24Ikeda Y. Swain A. Weber T.J. Hentges K.E. Zanaria E. Lalli E. Tamai K.T. Sassone-Corsi P. Lovell-Badge R. Camerino G. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1261-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results with the rat SHP gene (9Masuda N. Yasumo H. Tamura T. Hashiguchi N. Furusawa T. Tsukamoto T. Sadano H. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the primer extension analysis reported here indicate that SHP transcription is initiated 32 nucleotides downstream of a consensus TATA box. The transient transfection results indicate that a relatively short fragment encompassing this region confers promoter activity in Y1 cells but not in HeLa cells. The molecular basis for this difference in expression, which is consistent with the expression of SHP transcripts in adrenal gland, remains unknown. However, another potential linkage to SF-1 is provided from the presence of several consensus SF-1 binding sites in both the human and mouse promoter regions. Although this would be consistent with the expressions of SF-1 in Y1 cells, most of these sites lie outside of the minimal region required for basal promoter activity in these cells. Further work will be necessary to determine the role of SF-1 and other factors in the SHP expression. We would like to thank Dr. Sang Young Chun for critical readings of this manuscript and Han-Jong Kim and Dr. Eun Young Choi for technical assistance with Northern blot analysis."

This study shows that transcription elongation is required to form, and histone acetylation is needed to maintain, the unfolded structure of transcribing nucleosomes. Acetylation of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) is a dynamic process catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (1Davie J.R. J. Cell.

In chicken immature erythrocytes, 4% of the modifiable lysine sites participate in dynamic histone acetylation. These core histones are rapidly acetylated (t½ = 12 min for monoacetylated H4) and rapidly deacetylated (t½ = 5 min for the tetraacetylated isoform of H4) (3Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem.

Histones undergoing rapid acetylation and deacetylation are associated with transcriptionally active chromatin (5Ip Y.T. Jackson V. Meier J. Chalkley R. J. Biol.

The recent findings that histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases are transcriptional coactivators and corepressors have increased our understanding of how the process of dynamic histone acetylation is established on transcriptionally active chromatin (2Davie J.R. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1997; 24: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 8Wade P.A. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R82-R84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active chromatin has a soluble and insoluble nature (9Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transcribed DNA is found in chromatin fragments that are soluble in 0.15 m NaCl and/or 2 mm MgCl2and in chromatin fragments associated with the low salt-insoluble residual nuclear material (nuclear skeletons) (for review, see Davie (10Davie J.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162A: 191-250PubMed Google Scholar)). Chromatin engaged in transcription is thought to be retained by the nuclear skeleton by multiple dynamic attachments between the nuclear matrix and transcribed chromatin; hence rendering the transcribing chromatin insoluble (11Andreeva M. Markova D. Loidl P. Djondjurov L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Gerdes M.G. Carter K.C. Moen Jr., P.T. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities are associated with the nuclear matrix (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we proposed that these nuclear matrix-bound enzymes may mediate some of the dynamic attachments between active chromatin and nuclear matrix (13Hendzel M.J.

Biochem. 1994; 55: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most information on the structure and composition of transcriptionally active nucleosomes is from studies that analyze soluble transcriptionally active chromatin. However, most of the transcribed chromatin fragments partition with the low salt-insoluble nuclear material (nuclear skeleton) (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stratling W.H. Dolle A. Sippel A.E.

We presented evidence that dynamically acetylated histones are associated with the nuclear matrix-bound transcriptionally active chromatin (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Otherwise, little is known about the structure and composition of transcribing nucleosomes attached to the nuclear skeleton. Allfrey and co-workers demonstrated that nucleosomes in the transcribed regions of soluble chromatin of mammalian cells unfold exposing the cysteinyl-thiol groups of histone H3 (17Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Bazett-Jones D.P. Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The unfolding of the nucleosome was dependent upon ongoing transcription. Exploiting this feature of transcribing nucleosomes, a procedure to isolate soluble transcriptionally active chromatin by organomercury-agarose affinity chromatography was developed. The transcribing chromatin was associated with highly acetylated histones (18Bazett-Jones D.P. Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol.

Res. 1987; 15: 4375-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, current evidence argues that histone acetylation is not involved in the generation of the unfolded nucleosome. Reconstitution of nucleosomes with highly acetylated histones did not result in the formation of a thiol-reactive nucleosome (21Imai B.S. Yau P. Baldwin J.P. Ibel K. May R.P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8784-8792Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, treating mammalian cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate, did not increase the level of thiol-reactive nucleosomes (6Boffa L.C. Walker J. Chen T.A. Sterner R. Mariani M.R. Allfrey V.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 811-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Analysis of chicken mature erythrocyte salt-soluble polynucleosomes highly enriched in transcriptionally competent DNA and highly acetylated histones (22Rocha E. Davie J.R. Van Holde K.E. Weintraub H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8558-8563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ridsdale J.A. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5915-5926Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that this chromatin fraction lacked thiol-reactive nucleosomes. 1J. A. Ridsdale, P. Fredette, and J. R. Davie, unpublished observations. To address the question of whether unfolded nucleosomes exist in chicken erythrocytes, we investigated the H3 thiol reactivity of salt-soluble and low salt-insoluble (nuclear skeleton-associated) chromatin from mature (transcriptionally silent) and immature (transcriptionally active) chicken erythrocytes. We report that the thiol-reactive, unfolded nucleosome exists in immature, but not mature, erythrocyte salt-soluble chromatin fragments and chromatin fragments associated with the nuclear skeleton. However, histone deacetylase activity had to be suppressed to detect thiol-reactive nucleosomes in immature erythrocyte chromatin. These studies show that highly acetylated histones maintain the unfolded nucleosome structure formed by transcriptional elongation. Mature and immature erythrocytes were isolated from normal and anemic young adult White Leghorn chickens, respectively, as described previously (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immature and mature erythrocytes were collected in 75 mm NaCl and 25 mm EDTA, while cells to be incubated with sodium butyrate or trichostatin A were collected in 75 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 30 mm sodium butyrate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in Swims S-77 medium (Sigma) with 30 mm sodium butyrate or 100 ng/ml trichostatin A for 90 min to prevent the deacetylation of highly acetylated histones. To inhibit transcription elongation, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 90 min with transcription inhibitors actinomycin D (0.04 μg/ml) (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) 2The abbreviations used are: DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; DTT, dithiothreitol.

Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) followed by a 90-min incubation with or without 30 mm sodium butyrate. The fractionation of chromatin was done as described previously (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Briefly, nuclei (50A 260 units/ml) were digested with micrococcal nuclease (15 A 260 units/ml for 25 min at 37 °C), collected by centrifugation, and then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Following centrifugation the soluble chromatin fraction (fraction SE) and low salt insoluble chromatin fraction (nuclear skeleton, PE fraction) were isolated. The chromatin fragments of fraction SE were further fractionated by the addition of NaCl to 150 mm. Following centrifugation, chromatin fractions P150 (pellet) and S150 (salt-soluble chromatin) were isolated. Chicken erythrocyte chromatin fraction S150 was dialyzed against buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.5) and then applied to an organomercurial column (Affi-Gel 501; Bio-Rad) that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column (1.5 × 8 cm) was then washed with buffer A (flow rate, 60 ml/h) to remove unbound chromatin fragments until the absorbance at 260 nm returned to base line. This was followed by washing the column with 0.5m NaCl in buffer A (buffer B) until the absorbance at 260 nm returned to base line. The bound nucleosomes were eluted by 10 mm DTT in buffer A. The released material was monitored by measuring absorbance at 260 nm (17Allfrey V.G. Chen T.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 35: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the unbound material and 0.5 m NaCl eluted material were pooled; the fractions eluted with DTT were pooled. For analysis of histones in the unbound and bound fractions, the fractions were acid-extracted by the addition of 4 n sulfuric acid to a final concentration of 0.4 n. Before lyophilization, the supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m acetic acid and then against two changes of double-distilled H2O. Ten μl/ml [3H]iodoacetic acid (NEN Life Science Products, 204.9 mCi/mmol) containing 2.50 μCi was added to the chromatin fraction SE, S150, P150, and PE (2A 260/ml) in buffer E (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The chromatin fraction was applied directly to a hydroxylapatite column. The histones were isolated by acid extraction as described above. Histones were electrophoretically resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following staining with Coomassie Blue, the gel pieces containing a histone band were disrupted in hydrogen peroxide and then counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The chromatin fraction was mixed with hydroxylapatite HTP gel powder (Bio-Rad) at a ratio of 1 mg of DNA to 0.25 g of hydroxylapatite as described previously (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 0.63 m NaCl in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, to remove histone H1, H5, and non-histone chromosomal proteins before applying a linear gradient of NaCl (0.63 to 2 m NaCl in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7) at a flow rate of 35 ml/h as described previously (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from the different chromatin fractions as described previously (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For electrophoresis, equal amounts of DNA were dissolved in DNA sample loading buffer, and the samples were loaded onto 1% agarose minigels containing 0.5 μg of ethidium bromide/ml. The DNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membrane and hybridized to radiolabeled probes as described previously (28Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 2.9.7-2.10.2Google Scholar). The cloned probes used were pCBG 14.4, a unique intronic sequence of chicken β globin gene; pChV2.5B/H, which contains the gene coding for chicken histone H5 and flanking sequences; and pVTG412, that recognizes the 5′ region of the chicken vitellogenin gene (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). AUT (acetic acid, 6.7 m urea, 0.375% (w/v) Triton X-100) and SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were performed as described elsewhere (24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antiacetylated H3 and antiacetylated H4 antibodies generously supplied by Dr. D. Allis were used to detect acetylated species of H3 and H4 (29Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30Perry C.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4349-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) in Western blot experiments using a protocol described previously (32Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is rapidly reversible in immature erythrocytes (3Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To find the steady state of acetylated H3 and H4, histones of immature and mature erythrocyte chromatin fractions S150 and PE were electrophoretically resolved on AUT-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunochemically stained with either antiacetylated H4 antibodies or antiacetylated H3 antibodies. Both antibodies detect the multiacetylated forms of H4 and H3, with the antibody to acetylated H3 showing a strong preference for the highest acetylated isoforms of H3 (30Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that highly acetylated histones are found in chromatin fractions S150 and PE, but not in fraction P150 (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, this latter fraction was not analyzed. Fig.1 shows that the steady state levels of highly acetylated H3 and H4 isoforms were low in fractions S150 and PE from immature erythrocytes. However, the steady state levels of the highly acetylated H3 and H4 isoforms in fractions S150 and PE were markedly increased when immature erythrocytes were incubated in the presence of sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 60 min (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the rate of deacetylation is so rapid in immature erythrocytes that, once dynamically acetylated H3 and H4 reach a highly acetylated state, they are rapidly deacetylated (4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the net result is a low steady state level of highly acetylated histone isoforms in untreated immature cells. The steady state of acetylated H3 and H4 in mature erythrocyte chromatin fractions was higher than that of H3 and H4 in the corresponding fractions of immature erythrocytes (Fig. 1). Incubation of mature cells with sodium butyrate elevated the level of hyperacetylated H3 and H4 isoforms in chromatin fraction S150. The level of highly acetylated H3 and, to a lesser extent, highly acetylated H4 in fraction PE was also increased. The chromatin fraction S150 was isolated from chicken immature erythrocytes that were untreated or incubated with sodium butyrate for 90 min. The S150 chromatin fractions were applied to mercury-agarose columns (Fig.2). Analysis of the proteins released from the mercury column with DTT showed that histones were present in the S150 chromatin fraction from butyrate incubated cells (Fig.2 C), but absent in the S150 fraction from untreated cells (Fig. 2 B). The major proteins in the latter fraction were the cysteine-containing high mobility group proteins 1 and 2 (Fig.2 B). These results suggested that unfolded nucleosomes were absent or at very low levels in the S150 chromatin fraction from untreated immature erythrocytes. However, the unfolded nucleosome appeared to be present in immature erythroid cells that were incubated with butyrate. This result suggested that when deacetylation of dynamically acetylated histones was halted, the transcriptionally active nucleosomes was prevented from reverting to a thiol-nonreactive state. To find if the mercury-agarose-bound nucleosomes from fraction S150 of butyrate-incubated immature erythrocytes had hyperacetylated histones, histones from S150, mercury-agarose-bound, and mercury-agarose-unbound chromatin fractions were analyzed in Western blot experiments with antiacetylated H3 and H4 antibodies. Fig.3 shows that bound nucleosomes were enriched in hyperacetylated H3 and H4 isoforms. DNA isolated from the S150, unbound and bound mercury-agarose chromatin fractions was analyzed by Southern blotting with probes containing DNA sequences to genes that were either expressed or repressed in immature erythrocytes. The chromatin fraction bound to mercury-agarose contained transcriptionally active histone H5 and β-globin (not shown) DNA, but not repressed vitellogenin DNA (Fig. 4). These results show that mercury-bound nucleosomes were associated with transcriptionally active DNA. The characterization of the thiol-reactive, unfolded nucleosome of transcribing chromatin described by Allfrey and colleagues has been done solely with soluble chromatin fragments. However, most transcribing chromatin is associated with the residual nuclear material (fraction PE), the nuclear skeleton. In immature erythrocytes approximately 75% of the transcribed DNA sequences are associated with the nuclear skeleton (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the reactivity of the thiol group (Cys-110) of H3 in chromatin from butyrate-incubated immature erythrocytes, fraction SE and PE chromatin fragments were incubated with [3H]iodoacetic acid. Fig.5, B and C, shows that H3 was labeled in SE and PE chromatin. In contrast to the results obtained with fraction SE and PE chromatin, the H3 of chromatin fraction P150, which contained repressed DNA, was not labeled (data not shown). To monitor the labeling of H3 in the chromatin fractions, hydroxylapatite dissociation chromatography was applied (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hydroxylapatite was added to fraction SE or PE in 0.63 mNaCl, removing non-histone chromosomal proteins and H1 histones from the hydroxylapatite-bound chromatin (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of NaCl were then applied to the hydroxylapatite column, resulting first in the dissociation of H2A-H2B dimers followed by H3-H4 tetramers from the hydroxylapatite-bound chromatin (Fig.6, A and C) (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The interpeak fractions contained H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Fig.6 C, lane b). The concentration of NaCl required to dissociate the H2A-H2B dimer or H3-H4 tetramer from the nucleosomal DNA provides a measure of the strength of the interaction between the dimer or tetramer and DNA (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, highly acetylated H3-H4 tetramers dissociate from hydroxylapatite-bound nucleosomal DNA at a lower ionic strength than do unmodified H3-H4 tetramers (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Hirose M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Chromatin fragments of fractions SE and PE isolated from butyrate-incubated immature erythrocytes were incubated with [3H]iodoacetate and then subjected to hydroxylapatite dissociation chromatography. Fig. 6, A and B, shows that labeled H3 dissociated from the hydroxylapatite-bound chromatin after the H2A-H2B dimers but before the bulk of the H3-H4 tetramers. To determine whether incubation of immature erythrocytes with histone deacetylase inhibitors was required to detect the thiol-reactive H3 in nucleosomes, chromatin fractions SE and S150 were isolated from cells that were untreated or incubated with sodium butyrate. Following incubation with [3H]iodoacetate, the chromatin fractions were applied to hydroxylapatite. Labeled H3 was detected only in fraction SE and S150 when cells were incubated with sodium butyrate (compare Fig. 6 A with 7C and Fig. 7, Awith B). Immature erythrocytes were also incubated with trichostatin A, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor, instead of sodium butyrate. The dissociation profiles of hydroxylapatite bound SE chromatin fragments from trichostatin A-treated immature erythrocytes were similar to those from butyrate-treated cells (compare Fig.7 D with 6A). Hydroxylapatite dissociation chromatography with PE chromatin was problematic as the addition of insoluble nuclear skeletons to hydroxylapatite reduced the flow rate appreciably. For the following experiments with the PE fraction, the suspension of nuclear skeletons was incubated with [3H]iodoacetate, and then the acid-extracted histones were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The H3 band was excised and counted (see Fig. 5). In accordance with the results with fraction SE and S150, H3 of fraction PE was thiol-reactive in chromatin fragments from butyrate-incubated, but not untreated, immature erythrocytes (Fig. 8). These observations suggest that the thiol reactivity of H3 in immature erythrocyte chromatin fractions SE, S150, and PE is dependent upon the acetylation states of the nucleosomal histones. Transcriptional elongation is arrested in mature erythrocytes. To find if hyperacetylating histones associated with transcriptionally competent chromatin (3Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 34Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) was sufficient to observe a thiol-reactive H3, chromatin fractions S150 and PE from mature cells untreated or incubated with sodium butyrate were labeled with [3H]iodoacetate. Figs. 8 and9 show that labeled H3 was not observed in the mature erythrocyte S150 and PE chromatin fractions. These results and those with immature erythrocyte chromatin suggest that histone acetylation is required but not sufficient for formation and/or stabilization of nucleosomes with thiol-reactive H3. The absence of thiol-reactive nucleosomes in butyrate-treated mature erythrocytes indicates that both transcription elongation and highly acetylated histones are required to form and maintain the unfolded nucleosome conformation. To test whether inhibition of transcription elongation has an effect on the H3 thiol reactivity of immature erythrocyte nucleosomes, immature erythrocytes were incubated with inhibitors of transcription before the addition of sodium butyrate. Camptothecin is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I and has been reported to stimulate initiation but inhibit elongation by RNA polymerase II (26Ljungman M. Hanawalt P.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Stewart A.F. Schutz G. Cell. 1987; 50: 1109-1117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Stewart A.F. Herrera R.E. Nordheim A. Cell. 1990; 60: 141-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A thiol-reactive H3 was not detected in the SE and PE chromatin of immature cells treated with DRB or camptothecin followed by butyrate (Figs. 8 and 10) (25Chadee D.N. Allis C.D. Wright J.A. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8113-8116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results show that both highly acetylated histones and elongation are needed to detect the thiol-reactive H3 in immature erythrocyte chromatin. We show that highly acetylated histones are required to maintain the unfolded, thiol-reactive structure of transcribing nucleosomes. The thiol-reactive nucleosome is not detected in the chromatin of transcriptionally active immature erythrocytes where the steady state level of highly acetylated histones is low. But when deacetylation of the highly acetylated histones is prevented by incubating immature erythrocytes with histone deacetylase inhibitors, the thiol-reactive nucleosome is detected. The rate of deacetylation in immature erythrocytes is such that the highly acetylated H3 and H4 isoforms are short lived (4Zhang D.-E. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, the thiol-reactive nucleosome is detected in the chromatin of mammalian cells without the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors (37Allegra P. Sterner R. Clayton D.F. Allfrey V.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) (unpublished observations). These observations suggest that the net activities of the histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases decide the longevity of the unfolded nucleosome. In transcribing regions where the rate of histone deacetylation exceeds the rate of acetylation, the unfolded nucleosome structure will be short lived and will rapidly revert to a thiol nonreactive state following passage of the RNA polymerase. In yeast the converse is the case. The unfolded nucleosome structure associated with a specific gene persists well after the transcription of that gene has been arrested (38Chen T.A. Smith M.M. Le S.Y. Sternglanz R. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6489-6498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of histone acetylation and deacetylation are very slow in yeast, but the high steady state of highly acetylated histones argues that the rate of histone acetylation exceeds the rate of deacetylation (39Davie J.R. Saunders C.A. Walsh J.M. Weber S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3205-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 40Nelson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1565-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histone acetylation, however, is not sufficient to generate the unfolded nucleosome structure; transcription elongation is required. Thiol-reactive nucleosomes could not be found in the chromatin of chicken mature erythrocytes. Transcription may be initiated in these mature cells, but RNA polymerases are paused at the 5′ end of the transcribed genes (41Gariglio P. Bellard M. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2589-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Sun J.-M. Ferraiuolo R. Davie J.R. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The treatment of immature erythrocytes with camptothecin may mimic the mature erythrocyte situation, that is, transcription initiation occurs but elongation does not (26Ljungman M. Hanawalt P.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, although dynamic histone acetylation and initiation are occurring in these cells at transcriptionally competent/active loci, without elongation the thiol-reactive nucleosome is not formed. Our results suggest that unfolded transcribing nucleosomes are associated with highly acetylated H3-H4 tetramers. In agreement with the studies of Allfrey and colleagues (19Chen-Cleland T.A. Boffa L.C. Carpaneto E.M. Mariani M.R. Valentin E. Mendez E. Allfrey V.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23409-23416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that immature erythrocyte chromatin fragments bound to mercury agarose are enriched in highly acetylated H3 and H4. Furthermore, Sterner et al.(20Sterner R. Boffa L.C. Chen T.A. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic. Acids. Res. 1987; 15: 4375-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) showed that the thiol-reactive H3 of unfolded mammalian nucleosomes is hyperacetylated. Acetylation of H3 and H4 may maintain the unfolded nucleosome conformation by breaking interactions between the histone N-terminal tail and nucleosomal DNA. The N-terminal tail of H4 is not mobile in nucleosomes, and there is evidence that the H4 N-terminal tail makes intranucleosomal contacts (43Smith R.M. Rill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10574-10581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, His-18 in the N-terminal region of H4 cross-links to nucleotides 57, 66, and 93 from the 5′ end of nucleosomal DNA (44Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45Gavin I.M. Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2429-2434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This position in the nucleosomal DNA corresponds to where the nucleosomal DNA is sharply bent or kinked. In active gene chromatin and in chromosomal domains containing hyperacetylated histones, the cross-linking between His-18 of H4 and nucleosomal DNA in situ is greatly diminished (44Ebralidse K.K. Grachev S.A. Mirzabekov A.D. Nature. 1988; 331: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,46Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4734-4738Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Moreover, site 60 from the end of nucleosomal DNA of hyperacetylated nucleosomes has an increased susceptibility to DNase I (48Ausio J. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest that acetylation at lysines located in N-terminal tail of H4 may have important functions in altering histone-DNA contacts and nucleosome structure. Further, hyperacetylation of the H3-H4 tetramer reduces the linking number change per nucleosome, that is, negative DNA supercoils constrained in unmodified nucleosomes are partially released in nucleosomes with hyperacetylated histones (49Norton V.G. Marvin K.W. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19848-19852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Thomsen B. Bendixen C. Westergaard O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The destabilizing effect that histone acetylation has on H3-H4 tetramer-DNA interactions in transcribing nucleosomes is seen in hydroxylapatite dissociation chromatography. The H3 of thiol-reactive nucleosomes dissociated from hydroxylapatite bound S150 or SE chromatin after the dissociation of the H2A-H2B dimers but before the bulk of the H3-H4 tetramers. In a previous study we monitored the dissociation of labeled ([3H]acetate) dynamically acetylated histones from hydroxylapatite-bound chromatin of immature erythrocytes. The dissociation of the labeled ([3H]acetate) highly acetylated H3-H4 tetramers coincided exactly with that of labeled ([3H]iodoacetate) H3 (27Li W. Nagaraja S. Delcuve G.P. Hendzel M.J. Davie J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These observations with SE chromatin from chicken immature erythrocytes suggest that the interaction between highly acetylated H3-H4 tetramer and DNA of transcribing nucleosomes is weaker than that of typical nucleosomes. Analysis of mercury-agarose bound nucleosomes by electron spectroscopic imaging also indicated that the H3-H4 tetramer of unfolded nucleosomes is disrupted (18Bazett-Jones D.P. Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The disruption of the tetramer in transcribing nucleosomes may facilitate subsequent rounds of elongation. Transcribing chromatin is associated with the insoluble residual nuclear material (fraction PE) which contains the nuclear matrix. The PE chromatin from butyrate treated immature erythrocytes had 76% of the active DNA and 74% of the acetate-labeled tetraacetylated H4 (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the PE fraction retained 75–85% of the nuclear histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity (7Hendzel M.J. Delcuve G.P. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21936-21942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22894-22901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol-reactive nucleosome was detected in PE chromatin of butyrate-treated immature erythrocytes, but not in the PE chromatin of untreated immature erythrocytes or mature erythrocytes. Further, inhibition of transcription with camptothecin or DRB prevented the detection of the unfolded nucleosome. Thus, the results obtained with PE chromatin were similar to those observed with S150 or SE chromatin; both hyperacetylated histones and elongation are required to detect the unfolded nucleosome in fraction PE. There is increasing evidence that the transcription machinery is associated with the nuclear matrix and that for chromatin to be transcribed it is spooled through the anchored large RNA polymerase complex (51Iborra F.J.

We have proposed that histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase are localized in these transcription foci (13Hendzel M.J. Sun J.-M. Chen H.Y. Rattner J.B. Davie J.R. J. Biol.

These studies suggest that the basal transcription machinery and transcription factors recruit histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases to sites of transcription at the nuclear matrix. Nucleosome structure will be perturbed when the chromatin fiber is passed through the fixed RNA polymerase (transcriptosome) (53Halle J.-P. Meisterernst M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 161-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). While in a highly acetylated state, the unfolded nucleosome structure will persist, helping subsequent rounds of transcription. Our results are consistent with the idea that the nucleosome is a dynamic structure conforming its structure to facilitate movement of chromatin through the RNA polymerase II elongation complex, with dynamic histone acetylation having a major role in modulating the unfolded structure of transcribing nucleosomes."

Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), which are critical to these processes, are heteromultimeric complexes composed of α1, α2/δ, and β subunits. β subunits function to direct the VDCC complex to the plasma membrane as well as regulate its channel properties. The importance of β to neuronal functioning was recently underscored by the identification of a truncated β4 isoform in the epileptic mouse lethargic (lh) (Burgess, D. L., Jones, J. M., Meisler, M. H., and Noebels, J. L. (1997) Cell 88, 385–392). The goal of our study was to investigate the role of individual β isoforms (β1b, β2, β3, and β4) in the assembly of N-type VDCC during rat brain development. By using quantitative Western blot analysis with anti-α1B-directed antibodies and [125I-Tyr22]ω-conotoxin GVIA (125I-CTX) radioligand binding assays, we observed that only a small fraction of the total α1B protein present in embryonic and early postnatal brain expressed high affinity125I-CTX-binding sites. These results suggested that subsequent maturation of α1B or its assembly with auxiliary subunits was required to exhibit high affinity125I-CTX binding. The temporal pattern of expression of β subunits and their assembly with α1B indicated a developmental pattern of expression of β isoforms: β1b increased 3-fold from P0 to adult, β4 increased 10-fold, and both β2 and β3 expression remained unchanged. As the β component of N-type VDCC changed during postnatal development, we were able to identify both immature and mature forms of N-type VDCC. At P2, the relative contribution of β is β1b > β3 ≫ β2, whereas at P14 and adult the distribution is β3 > β1b = β4. Although we observed no β4 associated with the α1B at P2, β4 accounted for 14 and 25% of total α1B/β subunit complexes in P14 and adult, respectively. Thus, of the β isoforms analyzed, only the β4 was assembled with the rat α1B to form N-type VDCC with a time course that paralleled its level of expression during rat brain development.

The expression of N-type VDCC with different channel properties is a possible mechanism for controlling membrane excitability. As β subunits are known to influence the time course of channel inactivation, the diversity in N-type VDCC activity was suggested to reflect heterogeneity in the β subunit component. We undertook this study to test directly the hypothesis that N-type VDCCs are differentially associated with β subunits during rat brain development. The objectives of this investigation are 1) to identify possible trends in calcium channel subunit expression by evaluating changes in the expression of α1B and β isoforms throughout postnatal development and 2) to identify possible “immature” and “mature” forms of the N-type VDCC by characterizing the β subunit component of N-type VDCC at different stages of rat brain maturation. Materials—Unless noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. Calpain inhibitors I and II were obtained from Calbiochem. Enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; unlabeled ω-GVIA conotoxin was from Peninsula Laboratories; [125I-Tyr22]ω-conotoxin GVIA (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol) and 125I-protein A (specific activity 21.1 μCi/μg) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. 125I-IgG was obtained from ICN (specific activity 12.9 μCi/μg). Nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. All goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Boehringer Mannheim. Sulfolink columns were purchased from Pierce. Bovine serum albumin was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Hepes was from Research Organics. Embryonic (E18), neonatal, and adult rats were euthanized and the brains removed and immediately placed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors at a protein to volume ratio of 1.3 g/25 ml. The protease inhibitors were added from stock solutions prepared as follows: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1/1000 dilution from 200 mm stock in ethanol), calpain inhibitors I and II (1/1000 dilution from 4 mg/ml stock), benzamidine (1/500 dilution of 200 mm stock), aprotinin (1/500 dilution from 1 mg/ml stock), leupeptin (1/500 dilution from 1 mg/ml stock), pepstatin (1/500 dilution from 1 mg/ml stock in Me2SO), and DTT (1/1000 dilution from 1 m stock). The tissue was homogenized with a Polytron for 10 s and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (48,000 × g) for 15 min. The membranes were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors at a resulting protein concentration of 3–10 mg/ml. For subsequent use in Western blot analysis, all samples were stored in −20 °C at concentrations of 2 mg/ml in sample buffer (5× sample buffer: 325 mm Tris, pH 7.0, glycerol (25% v/v), mercaptoethanol (25% v/v), SDS (10%)) in 100-μl aliquots. The samples were not freeze-thawed. The peptide antigens were synthesized to include a unique cysteine residue to be used both in the unambiguous attachment of peptide to carrier protein (maleimide-derivatized keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and to the affinity column (Sulfolink). The peptides were synthesized, purified, and coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The coupled peptide antigens were used in the production of polyclonal sera in rabbits under continued contractual agreement with Covance, Inc. The rabbits were bled twice per month (15–20 ml/bleed) and tested for production of specific antibodies after 4 weeks as described previously (34McEnery M.W. Haase H. Vance C.L. Dubel S.J. Morano I. Copeland T.D. Choi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Anti-α1B rat sequence-specific antibodies (Ab CW8) were raised to a sequence (ASTPAGGEQDRTDC corresponding to amino acid residues 863–875 in the rat cDNA) that is present in the rat brain and rat spinal cord α1B cDNA (37Dubel S.J.

The concentration of free sulfhydryl group available in the peptide sample was quantified by Ellman's assay with cysteine as the standard used in the range of 20–200 nmol/assay. The free peptide (1.5–3 mg in 2-ml volume) was coupled to a Sulfolink column (Pierce), and excess reactive groups were coupled to cysteine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupling efficiency was 94–99% as determined by both dot blotting and Ellman's assay. Crude antisera were diluted with 3% BSA in TBS and incubated with peptide column for 90 min at room temperature. The column was then washed with 25 ml of TBS and sequentially eluted with 3 ml of 30 mmglycine, pH 5, and 3 ml of 80 mm glycine, pH 4. The affinity purified antibodies were eluted from the column with 6 ml of 200 mm glycine, pH 2.5, with each 1 ml collected and immediately neutralized by the addition of 50 μl of 1 mTris, pH 9.5. The protein concentrations of the fractions were determined, and the peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in the cold room against 4 liters of TBS. The following morning, the sample was dialyzed for an additional 4 h, and the purified antibody was aliquoted in 50–100-μl volumes and stored at −80 °C without freeze-thawing. The peptide column was extensively washed with TBS and stored in TBS plus 0.05% azide. Anti-β subunit “generic” antibodies (Ab CW24) were raised to a highly conserved sequence (CESYTSRPSDSDVSLEEDRE) present in all β subunits cloned to date that is not implicated in either the binding of β to the α1 subunit or the consensus sites for protein phosphorylation or ATP-binding in the β4 subunit (39Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide was coupled via a unique CYS as described above. For the generation of β isoform-specific antibodies, the peptides were synthesized with an N-terminal monochloroacetyl-glycyl extension (BioTeZ, Berlin, Germany) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin after activation with 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride as described (40Haase H. Karczewski P. Beckert R. Krause E.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunization was done in New Zealand White rabbits in accordance with internationally accepted principles concerning the care and use of laboratory animals. Antigenic epitopes comprised the amino acid sequences 554–567 (YEEEMTDNRNRGRN) of the β1b (41Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P.

Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The β subunit isoform-specific antibodies have been characterized elsewhere (23Pichler M. Cassidy T.N. Reimer D. Haase H.

N-type VDCC fractions were routinely screened at several protein concentrations to determine the linear range for the binding. Individual assay tubes contained 100 μl of representative N-type VDCC fractions diluted into 50 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 100 μl of 1% BSA (w/v), 100 μl of125I-CTX stock solution diluted to correspond to approximately 20,000 cpm 125I-CTX (or approximately 4.2 fmol), 100 μl of 500 nm stock solution of unlabeled CTX (Peninsula Laboratories) or 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 buffer in 1 ml final volume. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, filtered over 0.5% PEI-soaked glass fiber filters, and rapidly washed as described. The filters were counted for 1 min in Packard Cobra autogamma counter. Scatchard analysis of 125I-CTX binding to membranes was carried out under similar conditions with protein assayed at dilutions that supported approximately 2,500 cpm of specific 125I-CTX bound (1–200 μg/ml per assay). The amount of protein present in each assay was as follows: adult, 2 μg; P0, 25 μg; and E18 rat brain, 200 μg. Unlabeled CTX added was from 0.1 pm to 50 nm in the presence of constant125I-CTX. Data presented are mean ± S.D. from three determinations done in duplicate. The N-type VDCC was solubilized from P2 brain and P14 and adult rat forebrain as described previously (21McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Sharp A.H. Adams M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11095-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the N-type VDCC from P2 brain and P14 forebrain were solubilized directly from membranes using 0.75% CHAPS. Following centrifugation, the solubilized preparations were assayed for 125I-CTX binding. Approximately 9,000–12,000 cpm of specific 125I-CTX receptor activity (200 μl of the solubilized preparation) was added to individual microcentrifuge tubes that contained 20,000–40,000 cpm125I-CTX, 0.1% BSA, plus protease inhibitors in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Identical reactions were also carried out in the presence of 50 nm unlabeled CTX to determine nonspecific binding of 125I-CTX. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, antibody was added in a total volume of 100–200 μl of TBS and left to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. After this time, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B (final concentration of 0.6 mg/ml) was added to each sample and rotated in the cold room overnight. 125I-CTX binding to the soluble fraction was determined by directly filtering 1.1 ml of the sample through 0.5% PEI-soaked glass fiber filters. The pellets were washed 3 × with 1 ml of 50 mm Hepes/EGTA, and 50 μl of 2× sample buffer were added to the protein A beads. The samples were counted in a gamma counter for 1 min. 125I-Protein A and 125I-goat anti-rabbit IgG were diluted in 50 ml of 3% BSA in 1× TBS. Filters previously blocked with 5% milk in 1× TBS and probed with primary antibody were washed with 1× TBS for 15 min and then washed two additional times for 5 min. The washed filters were incubated in 50 ml of either the 125I-protein A, 3% BSA solution (approximately 500 cpm/μl) or the 125I-IgG, 3% BSA solution (approximately 30–50 cpm/μl) for 2 h at room temperature with constant shaking. Following this incubation, the125I solution was removed, and the filters were washed 3–5 times with TBS (5 min each). The approximate wash volume was 50 ml. The filters were blotted with paper towels and exposed to film at −80 °C with the aid of intensifying screens. The position of the antigen was determined relative to the exposed film, and the corresponding band on the filter was cut and counted. Slices that corresponded to nonspecific areas of the filter were also counted and subtracted from the signal. The data were obtained from multiple determinations done in duplicate. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose at 0.45 A for 17–22 h. The filter was incubated in 5% powdered milk in TBS + 0.01% sodium azide + 0.05% Tween and blocked for either 3 h at 37 °C with constant shaking or overnight at 4 °C in the cold room. The primary antibody was diluted in 3% BSA, 1 × TBS and incubated with the filter overnight at 4 °C. The filters were washed 3 times in TBS at room temperature. The secondary antibody was diluted to 1/10,000 in 3% BSA, 1× TBS, and the filter was incubated for 45 min at room temperature with constant shaking. The filters were washed as before. The antigen was visualized using ECL. Membrane protein and soluble protein were measured by the Pierce BCA assay. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard in all cases, and all samples were normalized with respect to buffer and detergent composition. Gel electrophoresis was carried out on polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207498) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was carried out using a 4% stacking gel and a resolving gel of appropriate porosity (see figure legends) according to standard procedures. All samples were incubated with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (325 mm Tris, pH 7.0, glycerol (25% v/v), mercaptoethanol (25% v/v), SDS (10%) without boiling. Staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels was Coomassie Blue (0.05%), 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid. The results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was evaluated by a paired t test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's or Dunnett's post hoc test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Anti-peptide antibodies to the II–III intracellular loop of the rat α1B subunit were raised to two distinct epitopes. The first antibody, Ab CW14, was raised to an epitope present in all α1B subunits cloned to date (34McEnery M.W. Haase H. Vance C.L. Dubel S.J. Morano I. Copeland T.D. Choi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The second antibody, Ab CW8, was raised to an epitope present only in the rat α1B sequence (37Dubel S.J. Starr T.V. Hell J. Ahlijanian M.K. Enyeart J.J. Catterall W.A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5058-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both antibodies were analyzed in parallel to characterize the structure of the endogenous α1B as it relates to the original rat α1BcDNA clone (37Dubel S.J. Starr T.V. Hell J. Ahlijanian M.K. Enyeart J.J. Catterall W.A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5058-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The pan specificity of Ab CW14 was verified by its detection of 230/210-kDa proteins in HEK293 cell line G1A1 stably expressing the human α1B (46Williams M.E. Brust P.F. Feldman D.H. Patthi S.

Lovinger D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 912-922PubMed Google Scholar) and a single 230-kDa protein in rat, rabbit, and mouse forebrain samples (Fig.1 A). Both the 230/210-kDa proteins in HEK293 cell line G1A1 were determined to bind125I-CTX by photoaffinity labeling with derivatized125I-CTX (21McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Sharp A.H. Adams M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11095-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The specificity of Ab CW8 for the rat epitope was evidenced by its reaction with the 230-kDa protein expressed only in rat brain. To verify the expression of the rat α1B as the isoform expressed in representative developmental samples, we quantified the amount of α1Bdetected by Ab CW8 and Ab CW14 in brain homogenates of E18, P0, and adult rat. As shown in Fig.2 A, α1B detected by Ab CW14 increases from E18 to adult. The signal obtained with Ab CW8 is very similar to that obtained with Ab CW14. The signals were quantified using 125I-protein A, and the results indicate that the epitopes targeted by Ab CW8 and Ab CW14 are equivalently expressed.Figure 2Expression of different α1Bepitopes during rat brain development. Experimental conditions were identical to those represented in Fig. 1. A, tissues obtained from differently aged rats were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–17% gradient gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies Ab CW14 (at 1/200 dilution) or Ab CW8 (1/200 dilution).B, following incubation with primary antibody the blots were incubated with 125I-protein A, washed, and exposed to film, and the data were expressed as the ratio of 125I-protein A/band relative to the adult sample. The samples are from rat brain at embryonic day 18 (lane 1), postnatal day 0 (lane 2), and adult rat forebrain (lane 3). The concentration of protein was 100 μg/lane. The total 125I-protein/band for adult was 1340 cpm when probed with Ab CW8 a"

We have used a combination of transient transfection analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to examine the role of locally produced factors in contributing to this activation. Conditioned media from strained, but not static, cultures led to a dose-dependent increase in human brain natriuretic peptide gene promoter activity. This increase was completely blocked by losartan or BQ-123, implying a role for angiotensin and endothelin as autocrine/paracrine mediators of the response to strain. Inclusion of the same antagonists in the cultures themselves led to only partial inhibition (∼60%), whereas inclusion of exogenous endothelin or angiotensin II resulted in amplification of the strain response. Angiotensin II and endothelin appear to be arrayed in series in the regulatory circuitry; the angiotensin response was blocked by BQ-123, whereas the endothelin response was unaffected by losartan. Mechanical strain was also shown to stimulate expression of the endogenous angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and endothelin genes in this system. Collectively, these data indicate that locally generated angiotensin II and endothelin, acting in series, play an important autocrine/paracrine role in mediating strain-dependent activation of cardiac-specific gene expression.

Application of mechanical strain, or passive stretch, to myocardial cells in culture results in a series of phenotypic changes that closely resemble those that occur with myocyte hypertrophyin vivo. This includes activation of the immediate early gene family (e.g. c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, and egr-1), increased expression of the fetal gene program (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide, α skeletal actin, and β-myosin heavy chain), and increased protein synthesis (1Komuro I.

In their hands, the induction of MAP kinase, MAP kinase kinase, Raf-1 kinase, or protein synthesis by strain was suppressed, although only by 50–70%, following blockade of the AT1 receptor (4Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5Yamazaki T.

This subtotal inhibition implies variable dependence of different responses on locally generated AII. In an independent study, the same group found that the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin (ET) also participates as an intermediate in the MAP kinase response to strain (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I.

This effect was found to be additive with that produced by AII suggesting that the two operate in parallel as autocrine/paracrine effectors of hypertrophy. The cell culture studies have found corroboration in several whole animal models. Angiotensinogen, ACE, and renin gene expression have been identified in the heart (16Raman V.K. Lee Y.A.

Subpressor AII infusions have been shown to promote ventricular hypertrophy in rats (24Dostal D.E. Am. J.

A. 1982; 79: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Typically, the anti-hypertrophic effect of the ACE inhibitor is out of proportion to its afterload reducing properties (26Linz W. Schoelkens B.A. Ganten D. Clin. Exp. Hypertens. 1989; 11: 1325-1350Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a number of anti-hypertensives that operate independently of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) lack anti-hypertrophic activity despite comparable efficacy in lowering blood pressure (versus ACE inhibition) (25Bruckschlegel G.

Of note, the endothelin antagonist BQ-123 has also been shown to prevent hypertrophy in the banded rat aorta model (28Ito H. Hiroe M. Hirata Y. Fujisaki H. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Ohta Y. Marumo F. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2198-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Collectively, the existing data seem to imply an important role for AII, ET, and perhaps other locally produced autocrine/paracrine factors as signaling intermediates linking mechanical strain/hemodynamic overload to the phenotypic changes associated with hypertrophy. However, there is considerable variability in the magnitude of the contribution(s) of these putative autocrine/paracrine intermediates to different strain-dependent responses (3Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 4Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K.

Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is little consensus regarding the functional relationships that exist among these different factors during the development of hypertrophy. Finally, there is a paucity of data linking mechanical strain and/or its autocrine/paracrine effectors to cardiac-specific gene expression in the myocyte. Recently, we found that application of mechanical strain to cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes in vitro resulted in significant activation of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene promoter activity (29Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). BNP is a cardiac hormone that is normally produced at relatively low levels in the adult myocardium but increases dramatically with the development of cardiac hypertrophy (30Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y.

In the present work we have used BNP promoter activation as a cardiac-specific marker of the response to strain to investigate the role of locally produced autocrine/paracrine mediators in this response. Angiotensin II (AII), endothelin-1 (ET-1), BQ-123, and IRL-1038 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Losartan and PD123319 were provided by Merck Sharp and Dohme and Parke-Davis, respectively. Captopril was obtained from Hoffmann-LaRoche. Anti-TGF-β antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-endothelin antiserum and angiotensin I were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Cruachem Inc. (Dulles, VA). The RT-PCR kit (AdvantageTM RT-for-PCR) was purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old neonatal rat hearts by alternate cycles of 0.05% trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption as described previously (32Kovacic-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were cultured on collagen-coated Flex plates (Flexcell, Inc.; McKeesport, PA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-H21 medium containing 10% enriched calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Medium was changed 24 h prior to initiation of the experiment. Cells were stretched by cyclical strain (60 cycles/min) on the Flexcell Strain apparatus at a level of distension sufficient to promote ∼20–25% increment in surface area at the point of maximal distension on the culture surface (33Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of −1595 hBNPLUC (34Lapointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been described previously. The −1329 rat endothelin-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (pdLux/pret-1) (35Paul M. Zintz M.

Hypertension. 1990; 16: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was provided by C. F. Deschepper. Freshly prepared ventricular myocytes were transiently transfected with the indicated reporters and expression vectors (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 280 mV and 250 microfarads. Individual cultures were normalized for transfected DNA with pUC 18. After transfection, cells were plated in 6-well collagen-coated Flex plates at a density of 1 × 106cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-H21 medium containing 10% enriched calf serum. Medium was changed 24 h after plating, and cyclical strain was applied. Cells were harvested and lysed in 60 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, WI). Protein concentration of each cell extract was measured using Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates were processed (30 μg of protein per sample) and assayed for luciferase as described previously (29Liang F. Wu J. Garami M. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28050-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated 3–5 times, using at least three different plasmid DNA preparations. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured ventricular myocytes by using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). 1 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize and amplify cDNA using AdvantageTM RT-for-PCR, a conventional RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH). Angiotensinogen (AOG) cDNA was amplified to generate an 810-bp fragment by PCR with the following two primers: 5′-GACCGCGTATACATCCACCCCTTTCATCTC-3′ (sense, exon 2; positions 73–102 in the cDNA) and 5′-GTCCACCCAGAACTCATGGAGCCCAGTCAG-3′ (antisense, exon 3; positions 882–853 in the cDNA). A 317-bp rat angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cDNA fragment was synthesized by using 5′-CCTGATCAACCAGGAGTTTGCAGAG-3′ (sense, exon 2; positions 279–303 in the cDNA) and 5′-GCCAGCCTTCCCAGGCAAACAGCAC-3′ (antisense, exon 4, positions 595–571 in the cDNA). A 545-bp rat ET cDNA was synthesized using 5′-CGTTGCTCCTGCTCCTCCTTGATGG-3′ (sense, positions 338–362 in the cDNA) and 5′-AAGATCCCAGCCAGCATGGAGAGCG (antisense, positions 883–859 in the cDNA). A 1000-bp rat renin cDNA was generated by using 5′-TGAGATCGGCATTGGTACCCCAT-3′ (sense, exon 3; positions 473–495 in the cDNA) and 5′-AGGAACGCCAGCTTTGGCTTGGC-3′ (antisense, exon 9; positions 1479–1457 in the cDNA). A 366-bp rat GAPDH cDNA fragment was co-amplified along with the AOG, ACE, or ET cDNA fragments using 5′-TCCATGACAACTTTGGCATCGTGG-3′ (sense, positions 515–538 in the cDNA) and 5′-GTTGCTGTTGAAGTCACAGGAGAC-3′ (antisense, positions 891–868 in the cDNA). PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel, denatured with 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5m NaOH, then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized, respectively, with the following end-labeled32P-oligonucleotides: AOG, 5′-CGCATGTACAAGATGCTGAGTGAGGCAAGAG-3′ (positions 372–402); ACE, 5′-GCTAAAGCAACATGAGCAGAATCTACTCCAC-3′ (positions 470–500); ET, 5′-CAAAGACCACAGACCAAGGG-3′ (positions 486–505), renin, 5′-GCAACTTTCACTACGTGAGCATCAGCAAGGC-3′ (positions 961– 991), and GAPDH, 5′-CAGAGCTGAACGGGAAGCTCACTGGCATGGC-3′ (positions 689–719). Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at room temperature for 1–12 h. Autoradiographic signals were quantified using the NIH Image program. Normalized data are presented as the ratio of AOG, ACE, or ET to GAPDH signal. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls test for significance. To determine whether an autocrine/paracrine factor, capable of stimulating BNP gene promoter activity, is produced in myocyte cultures exposed to mechanical strain, we collected media from cultures subjected to cyclical distortion (1 Hz) or from cells cultured in a static environment for 24 h. These media were placed on a second group of ventricular myocytes (cultured in a static environment) that had previously been transfected with the −1595 hBNP luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 1, at full strength the strain-conditioned medium provided a level of BNP promoter activation which was 75–80% higher than that seen with medium conditioned by static cultures. Progressive dilution with fresh, unconditioned medium reduced the magnitude of the effect seen with the strain-conditioned medium but had little effect on that from the static cultures. Next, we explored the roles of AII and ET as potential contributors to this autocrine/paracrine activity. As shown in Fig.2 A, both the AT-1 antagonist losartan and the ETA blocker BQ-123 completely blocked the ability of strain-conditioned media to activate the BNP promoter in transfected ventricular myocytes. PD 123319, an AT-2 blocker, and IRL-1038, an ETB antagonist, were devoid of activity. Of note, none of these agents affected activity seen with conditioned media from the static cultures. These studies indicate that both AII and ET can completely, or near completely, account for the autocrine/paracrine activity in the strain-conditioned media. This is further supported by the study presented in Fig. 2 B that shows that antibody directed against the ET peptide effected a dose-dependent reduction in the strain conditioned media-dependent stimulation of BNP promoter activity. Non-immune serum was devoid of activity. When the inhibitors were included in the cultures during application of mechanical strain, somewhat different results were obtained. As shown in Fig. 3, PD123319 and IRL-1308 were still without activity in this paradigm. On the other hand, losartan, BQ-123, and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril each reduced strain-dependent BNP promoter activity, but the inhibition, unlike that seen with the culture media, was partial (∼60%) in each case. The combination of losartan and BQ-123 was no more effective that either agent used alone, implying that AII and ET employ a final common pathway to stimulate BNP promoter activity. Given the findings with the AT-1 and ETA antagonists, we next asked whether exogenous AII and ET would prove capable of directly stimulating hBNP promoter activity in these cultures. Both AII (Fig.4 A) and ET (Fig.4 B) effected a dose-dependent stimulation of this promoter. These effects were prevented by co-treatment with losartan and BQ-123, respectively (see Fig. 6, below), but not by PD123319 or IRL-1038 (data not shown). Of note, in each case the activation was further amplified if the peptide agonists were applied coincident with the strain stimulus (Fig. 4 C). Once again the combination of AII and ET was no better than ET alone in effecting this response, supporting the hypothesis that they operate over similar circuitry in promoting activation of the BNP gene promoter.Figure 6Effects of antagonists on AII or ET-induced hBNP promoter activity. 5 μg of −1595 hBNP luciferase was transfected into ventricular myocytes. After 24 h of culture, cells were treated with AII (100 nm) or ET (100 nm) alone, or in the presence of losartan (1 μm) or BQ-123 (10 nm), for 48 h. The data are expressed as means ± S.D. from four separate experiments. *, p < 0.01 versus the control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next explored the role of endogenous AII generation in contributing to basal and strain-dependent induction of the BNP promoter. Angiotensin I, the immediate precursor of AII, raised basal BNP promoter activity modestly and significantly amplified the response to strain (Fig. 5 A). The latter effect was partially reversed by inclusion of either losartan or captopril in the cultures. Similarly, co-transfection of a rat angiotensinogen expression vector together with the BNP luciferase reporter resulted in a modest increase in basal activity and amplification of the strain response (Fig. 5 B). Again, this increase was partially blocked by co-incubation with losartan or captopril indicating, as with AI above, an AII-dependent process. Collectively, the data suggest that these cultures have the capacity to both process angiotensinogen to AI (i.e.renin-like activity) and to convert AI to AII (i.e.converting enzyme activity) and that endogenous generation of AII is associated with activation of BNP gene transcription. Next, we investigated the inter-relationship of AII and ET in promoting the autocrine/paracrine induction observed in Fig. 1. Since antagonists of either peptide completely blocked the stimulatory properties of strain-conditioned media and reversed the strain-dependent effect in cultured cells to a roughly equivalent extent, we postulated that the two were operating in series. To explore this possibility, we examined the effects of the AT-1 and ETA antagonists on hBNP promoter induction by each of these two peptides. As shown in Fig.6, neither antagonist had a significant effect on basal promoter activity. Losartan, as expected, completely blocked induction by AII. Noteworthy, however, BQ-123 also blocked the AII effect. As expected, BQ-123 blocked the ET induction; however, losartan was ineffective in this regard. This confirms our hypothesis that AII and ET operate in series. It appears that locally produced AII increases ET production which, in turn, leads to activation of the hBNP promoter and increased BNP gene expression. AII has also been shown to increase production of TGF-β in cardiac myocytes (37Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 38Everett A.D. Tufro-McReddie A. Fisher A. Gomez R.A. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 587-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TGF-β is known to be a potent activator of those genetic programs typically associated with hypertrophy (10Takahashi N. Calderone A. Izzo Jr., N.J. Maki T.M. Marsh J.D. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 11Parker T.G. Packer S.E. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether locally generated TGF-β might provide an additional level of autocrine/paracrine control. As shown in Fig.7, addition of anti-TGF-β antisera resulted in a decrease in the activity of the transfected hBNP gene promoter in both the static and strained cultures; however, the magnitude of the strain effect (i.e. fold induction) was preserved. The specificity of the anti-TGF-β antibody effect was confirmed by the ability of purified TGF-β to partially reverse the inhibition. These findings imply that TGF-β is important for maintenance of basal promoter activity but does not contribute directly to generation of the response to mechanical strain. We next asked whether mechanical strain would lead to increased expression of the individual components of RAS or endothelin in this system as a prelude to activation of hBNP promoter activity, and if so, whether the temporal pattern of induction would fit the model outlined above. We used RT-PCR to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of angiotensinogen, ACE, renin, and ET gene expression as a function of time following application of the strain stimulus. As shown in Fig.8 A, strain led to a time-dependent increment in angiotensinogen gene expression which was first apparent after 6 h of culture in the dynamic environment. The effect peaked at ∼3-fold above basal after 24 h and then fell by 48 h. Rat renin gene expression could not be detected in these cultures using conditions that easily identified the renin gene transcript in preparations of rat kidney mRNA (data not shown). Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a somewhat slower and smaller induction (Fig. 8 B) than that seen with angiotensinogen. The effect was first seen after 12 h, remained stable at 24 h, and disappeared after 48 h of continuous strain. Finally, induction of ET gene expression was first observed following 24 h of strain, peaking at 3–4-fold above basal (Fig.8 C). This effect persisted after 48 h of continuous strain. The induction of ET gene expression derived, at least in part, from activation of ET promoter activity. A construct linking 1329 bp of rat ET-1 5′-flanking sequence to a luciferase reporter (35Paul M. Zintz M. Bocker W. Dyer M. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 683-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into cultured myocytes that were then subjected to mechanical strain. As shown in Fig. 9 A, strain effected a ∼2-fold increase in ET-dependent reporter activity. The strain-dependent induction was completely reversed by either losartan or captopril, supporting the hypothesis that AII lies immediately upstream from ET in the autocrine/paracrine cascade. In keeping with this model, AII (Fig. 9 B) activated the rET promoter directly in these cultures. ET itself also displayed a stimulatory effect raising the possibility of auto-amplification of rET promoter activity in this setting (Fig. 9 C). The present study demonstrates an important role for AII and ET as autocrine/paracrine contributants in the BNP gene transcriptional response to mechanical strain. Interestingly, virtually all of the soluble mediator-dependent contributions to the strain response could be linked to the presence of AII or ET in the culture medium. However, this contribution represented, at best, only 50–60% of the total response, implying the existence of an intrinsic stimulatory mechanism leading to BNP gene promoter activation independent of autocrine/paracrine activity. Additional support for this derives from the fact that the strain continued to demonstrate an independent stimulatory effect even in the presence of maximally active concentrations of AII and ET (see Fig. 4 C). Like a number of earlier studies, our findings support the presence of an intrinsic renin-angiotensin system (16Raman V.K. Lee Y.A. Lindpaintner K. Am. J. Cardiol. 1995; 76: 18D-23DAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Baker K.M. Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) in the heart. Both angiotensinogen and ACE were found to be expressed in these myocyte cultures. Furthermore, expression of each was increased (within 6 h in the case of angiotensinogen and within 12 h for ACE) following application of mechanical strain. Exogenous AI and overexpressed angiotensinogen amplified the response to strain, in each instance in an AII-dependent fashion. This together with the AII antagonist studies alluded to above support a key role for the cardiac RAS in the autocrine/paracrine amplification of the strain response. We did not, however, find evidence for expression of endogenous rat renin in these cultures, despite detection of the renin transcript in total RNA from rat kidney. This stands in contrast to other reports of renin expression in the heart (21Iwai N. Shimoike H. Kinoshita M. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Lee Y.

Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1630-H1636PubMed Google Scholar), and may reflect differences in the sensitivity of the assays employed for detection. A true absence of renin gene expression here does not negate the proposed involvement of the RAS in amplifying the response to strain. Relevant angiotensinogen processing activity could derive from circulating plasma renin in vivo (39Von Lutterotti N. Catanzaro D.F. Sealey J.E. Laragh J.H. Circulation. 1994; 89: 458-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or, in the case of thein vitro model used here, from residual renin-like activity present in the serum used in culturing the myocytes. Alternatively, renin-like activity (independent of true renin) could be produced endogenously in the myocytes or non-myocytes themselves. The antagonist studies support a role for the AT1 and ETAreceptors in signaling the responses to AII and ET, respectively, and specifically exclude a role for AT2 and ETB. The fact that the effects of strain-conditioned media were completely reversed by AT1 blockade, ACE inhibition, or ETA blockade implies that AII and ET operate through a common final pathway in signaling the strain response. Our data support this and further indicate that the two are arrayed in series with AII leading to enhanced ET production which, in turn, leads to increased BNP gene transcription. This is somewhat at odds with the conclusions drawn by Yamazaki et al. (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) who found that AII- and ET-dependent increments in MAP kinase activity were additive in their myocyte cultures. The discrepancy is not readily explained but suggests that different regulatory circuitry may be involved in controlling expression of individual components of the hypertrophic phenotype. Alternatively, the discrepancy could reflect intrinsic differences between the single stretch system employed by Yamazaki et al. (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T.

Our studies do, however, concur with those of Ito et al. (8Ito H. Hirata Y. Adachi S. Tanaka M. Tsujino M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) who found that AII-dependent increments in ANP or BNP secretion in myocyte/fibroblast co-cultures were suppressed by the ET antagonist BQ123, and those of Clavellet al. (40Clavell A.L. Mattingly M.T. Stevens T.L. Nir A. Scott-Wright R. Aarhus L.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) who found that chronic ACE inhibition abolished increases in plasma ET levels during chronic canine thoracic inferior vena caval constriction. The role of ET as an autocrine/paracrine mediator of the strain response has been controversial. Sadoshima et al. (3Sadoshima J. Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) found no increase in media ET levels despite a robust increase in AII levels. Yamazaki et al. (7Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), on the other hand, reported a marked stimulation of both ET secretion and gene expression in myocyte cultures subjected to mechanical strain. In our own studies ET gene expression was clearly activated by mechanical strain. The induction was first demonstrated after 24 h of continuous strain. Temporally, this is compatible with the proposed dependence upon AII in that angiotensinogen and ACE gene expression were increased a full 12–18 h earlier. This dependence was further supported by the finding that the strain-dependent induction of the ET gene promoter was completely reversible with either losartan or captopril, a finding which, notably, was not seen with the hBNP gene promoter, implying that strain-dependent activation of the ET promoter is heavily dependent upon the autocrine/paracrine effects of AII released into the culture media. Our studies do not exclude a role for additional mediators distal to ET in the signaling cascade. AII has, in fact, been shown to stimulate production of TGF-β (37Lee A.A. Dillmann W.H. McCulloch A.D. Villarreal F.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2347-2357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 38Everett A.D. Tufro-McReddie A. Fisher A. Gomez R.A. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 587-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a well documented hypertrophic agonist in the myocardium (11Parker T.G. Packer S.E. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and TGF-β has been linked to stimulation of ET secretion from the non-myocyte elements present in the myocardium (9Harada M. Ito H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Owaga E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, although specific antisera directed against TGF-β reduced basal hBNP promoter activity, they did not abrogate the response to strain. This implies that TGF-β plays an important role in supporting basal myocyte activity, a role advocated by others (41Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Winokur T.S. Burmester J.K. Sporn M.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2056-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but argues against a significant role for this particular growth factor as an autocrine/paracrine mediator of the strain response. The cellular compartment responsible for synthesizing or processing the precursors for AII or ET cannot be established in the model employed here since low level contamination of the myocyte cultures with cardiac mesenchymal cells (primarily fibroblasts) is known to be present. A recent study from Harada et al. (9Harada M. Ito H. Nakagawa O. Ogawa Y. Miyamoto Y. Kuwahara K. Owaga E. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Masuda I. Yoshimasa T. Tanaka I. Saito Y. Nakao K. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3737-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggested the mesenchymal fibroblast as the dominant contributor to endothelin production in these in vitro cultures, implying that these cells serve as the primary effector of the hypertrophic response. This model receives partial support from the study of Fujisaki et al. (42Fujisaki H. Ito H. Hirata Y. Tanaka M. Hata M. Lin M. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) who showed that AII stimulates ET gene expression in fibroblasts cultured from neonatal hearts. Others, however, have documented both angiotensinogen and endothelin production within the cardiac myocytes themselves (8Ito H. Hirata Y. Adachi S. Tanaka M. Tsujino M. Koike A. Nogami A. Marumo F. Hiroe M. J. Clin. Inest. 1993; 92: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 40Clavell A.L. Mattingly M.T. Stevens T.L. Nir A. Scott-Wright R. Aarhus L.L. J. Clin.

Science. 1996; 384: 353-355Google Scholar), so, at present, the role of individual cellular compartments and, by inference, the importance of the topographical relationship which they maintain with one another in the heart must be regarded as unresolved. In summary, strain-activated BNP gene promoter activity results from a combination of direct effects on the cardiac myocyte and indirect effects mediated by soluble activators (angiotensin II and, secondarily, endothelin) released into the extracellular compartment. These activators serve to amplify the primary response to strain at the level of the individual myocytes and, therefore, represent logical targets for pharmacological intervention where control of myocyte hypertrophy and progression to failure (43Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita Y. Science. 1996; 384: 353-355Google Scholar) is desired.

Within the brain, CGA is localized in neurodegenerative areas associated with reactive microglia. By using cultured rodent microglia, we recently described that CGA induces an activated phenotype and the generation of nitric oxide. These findings led us to examine whether CGA might affect neuronal survival, expression of neurofilaments, and high affinity γ-aminobutyric acid uptake in neurons cultured in the presence or absence of microglial cells. We found that CGA was unable to exert a direct toxic effect on neurons but provoked neuronal injury and degeneration in the presence of microglial cells. These effects were observed with natural and recombinant CGA and with a recombinant N-terminal fragment corresponding to residues 1–78. CGA stimulated microglial cells to secrete heat-stable diffusible neurotoxic agents. CGA also induced a marked accumulation of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-α by microglia, but we could not establish a direct correlation between the levels of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor-α and the neuronal damage. The possibility that CGA represents an endogenous factor that triggers the microglial responses responsible for the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration is discussed.

Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 2Winkler H. Fischer-Colbrie R. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 497-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In neuroendocrine secretory granules, CGA is proteolytically processed (3Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Hogue-Angeletti R. Aunis D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) leading to the formation of various small peptides, some of them with a defined biological activity. For example, CGA is the precursor of pancreastatin, a peptide that negatively modulates secretion from exocrine and endocrine pancreas (4Tatemoto K. Efendic S. Mutt V. Makk G. Feistner G.J. Barchas J.D. Nature. 1986; 324: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 5Ishizuka J. Asada I. Poston G.J. Lluis F. Tatemoto K. Greeley G.H. Thompson J.C.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and catestatin, a peptide controlling catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells (7Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. Mahata M. Yoo S.H. Taupenot L. Wu H. Gill B.M. Parmer R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1623-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Vasostatins, which exhibit a vasoinhibitory activity when applied to blood vessels (8Aardal S. Helle K.B. Elsayed S. Reed R.K. Serck-Hanssen G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), contain the N-terminal domain of CGA. In addition, several chromogranin A-derived peptides have been found to exhibit an antibacterial activity (9Strub J.M. Goumon Y. Lugardon K. Capon C. Lopez M. Moniatte M. Van Dorsselaer A. Aunis D. Metz-Boutigue M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28533-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in the host defense against microbial infections. Both CGA and its corresponding mRNA have been localized in a variety of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system (10Munoz D.G. Kobylinski L. Henry D.D. George D.H. Neuroscience. 1990; 34: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,11Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Marksteiner J. Sperk G. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1991; 3: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) indicating a major role for CGA in the brain. Indeed, injection of CGA into the rostral ventrolateral medulla of rat brain induces changes in blood pressure and renal nerve activities (12Krassioukov A.V. Munoz D.G. Yang J.P. Weaver L.C. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1994; 50: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and injection into the nucleus accumbens modifies locomotor activity (13Brudzynski S.M. Munoz D.G. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 35: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Treatment with anti-psychotic drugs affects the mRNA levels of various neuropeptides and chromogranins (14Kroesen S. Marksteiner J. Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Fischer-Colbrie R. Saria A. Kapeller I. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Dehydration of rats, which stimulates the secretion of vasopressin and oxytocin, induces a parallel change of CGA immunoreactivity in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (15EI Majdoubi M. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Theodosis D.T. Aunis D. J. Neurocytol. 1996; 25: 405-416PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise function(s) of CGA in the brain remains elusive. CGA may directly modulate synaptic activity, since an inhibition of dopamine release has been reported (13Brudzynski S.M. Munoz D.G. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 35: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alternatively, by analogy with peripheral neuroendocrine cells, CGA may play a role in the biosynthesis and stabilization of large dense core secretory vesicles in central neurons (15EI Majdoubi M. Metz-Boutigue M.H. Garcia-Sablone P. Theodosis D.T. Aunis D. J. Neurocytol. 1996; 25: 405-416PubMed Google Scholar). Because CGA is secreted during synaptic activity, the protein may also have a functional significance in the extracellular space. This idea is supported by the observation that CGA accumulates in brain areas with neuronal degeneration. CGA is concentrated in the Levy bodies of substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, in the Pick bodies, and swollen neurons in Pick's disease (16Nishimura M. Tomimoto H. Suenaga T. Nakamura S. Namba Y. Ikeda K. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Brain Res. 1994; 634: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Yasuhara O. Kawamata T. Aimi Y. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and tends to accumulate in the senile and pre-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (18Munoz D.G. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 826-832PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, high levels of CGA have been measured in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (19Kirchmair R. Benzer A. Troger J. Miller C. Marksteiner J. Saria A. Gasser R.W. Hogue-Angeletti R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1994; 63: 1179-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of neurons, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Several lines of evidence indicate that neurons and microglial cells cooperate in the initiation and development of toxic signaling pathways. Both cell-surface interactions and released molecules seem to be involved in the process of neuronal degeneration. The presence of CGA in brain lesions encouraged us to examine whether CGA may modulate the functional activity of brain microglial cells and thereby contribute to neuronal degeneration. We found that both recombinant human CGA and natural CGA purified from bovine chromaffin granules were able to induce an activated phenotype in rat microglial cells (20Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CGA induced a drastic morphological change in cultured microglia that was accompanied by a complete reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the accumulation of nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO), in the culture medium. To probe further the idea that CGA might be one of the neurotoxic signaling molecules in neurodegenerative diseases, in the present study we examine the effect of CGA on neurons. For this purpose, we used highly purified neurons from rat brain cerebral hemispheres either in culture alone or in co-culture with microglial cells. The effect of CGA on neuronal survival and proliferation, on the expression of neurofilaments, and on the uptake of GABA was analyzed. Our results demonstrate that CGA impairs the function and survival of neurons, and this toxic effect requires the presence of microglia. bCGA was purified from bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules as described by Simon et al. (21Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with an additional purification step on a column of Ultraspherogel Sec 2000 (7.5 × 30 mm, Beckman). Stock solutions usually containing 50 μm CGA were aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The final bCGA preparation was composed of the native 70-kDa CGA (60% of the total proteins) and a set of smaller processed components (60 to 43 kDa) together representing 40% of the total proteins as estimated from scanned monodimensional electrophoretic profiles. Immunodetection on nitrocellulose sheets indicated that all protein bands were immunoreactive with specific anti-native CGA antibodies (21Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and anti-CGA(124–143) antibodies (21Simon J.P. Bader M.F. Aunis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 22Cetin Y. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Galindo E. Jörns A. Bargstein G. Grube D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis (by automatic Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 473A microsequencer) demonstrated that the final CGA preparation contained only CGA-derived sequences with 80% of the sequenced material containing the N-terminal sequence of CGA (LPVNS). rhCGA was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified in our laboratory using the multistep procedure previously described (23Taupenot L. Remacle J.E. Helle K.B. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Regul. Pept. 1995; 56: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). VS-1 (NH2-Ser-Thr-Ala-rhCGA1–78) was cloned, purified, and characterized as described in detail elsewhere (24Corti A. Sanchez L.P. Gasparri A. Curnis F. Longhi R. Brandazza A. Siccardi A.G. Sidoli A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The synthetic CGA(173–194) peptide (YPGPQAKEDSEGPSQGPASREK) and CGB(614–626)peptide (QKIAEKFSGTRRG) were synthesized in our laboratory (432A Peptide Synthesizer SYNERGY, Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Purity was checked on high performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis was performed by Edman degradation on an automated gas phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and mass spectrometry was used to assess the structure of the final products. The content of endotoxin in the CGA preparations was determined at the Institut d'Hygiène et de Médecine Préventive (Strasbourg, France) with the chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate test (Coamatic Endotoxin Chromogenix, Biogenic, Maurin, France). At 10 nm, the CGA preparations contained less endotoxin than the culture medium alone, which itself is unable to trigger the production of NO in microglial cells. CGA was usually dissolved at the indicated final concentrations in serum-free defined culture medium and directly applied to cultures by changing the medium. The activity of the CGA preparations was systematically controlled by measuring the production of NO in microglial cell cultures. Acid hydrolysis of the CGA preparations (6 n HCl, 18 h) totally abolished the NO2− accumulation in the culture medium. Neuronal cell cultures were established after mechanical dispersion of cerebral cortices from Wistar fetal (day 14 of gestation) rat brain as described previously (25Booher J. Sensenbrenner M. Neurobiology. 1972; 2: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cerebral cortices cleaned from meninges were forced through a nylon sieve (pore size 48 μm) in nutrient medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cell suspension was centrifuged and cell viability determined with trypan blue. Viable cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well in 24 multiwell Falcon plates coated with poly-l-ornithine in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunocytochemistry, each well contained a 12-mm glass coverslip. Cells were subsequently incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The serum-containing medium was then replaced by serum-free defined medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with transferrin (100 μg/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), albumin (100 μg/ml), progesterone (6 ng/ml), and sodium selenite (5.2 ng/ml). Microglial cells were isolated from high density glial cell cultures as described previously (20Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells dissociated from cerebral hemispheres of neonatal rat brain (Wistar strain) were plated at density of 5 × 104cells/cm2 in culture medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Culture medium was changed after 5 days and then twice a week. After 2 weeks, cultures contained glial cells including amoeboid microglia mostly localized on the top of the cellular layer. The loosely adherent microglial cells were recovered by shaking. After centrifugation (1000 rpm/5 min), cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion, and viable cells were then plated at a final density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well on 24 multiwell Falcon plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Nonadherent cells were removed 30 min after plating by changing the medium for serum-free defined medium. Amoeboid microglia isolated from neonatal rat brain cultures consist of flat, round, or spindle-shaped, highly adherent cells. They respond to bacterial endotoxin (26Bader M.F. Taupenot L. Ulrich G. Aunis D. Ciesielski-Treska J. Glia. 1994; 11: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and express Fc (27Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Aunis D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 29: 362-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and CR3 complement receptors (20Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was prepared by incubating microglial cell cultures for 48 h in serum-free defined medium. Medium was subsequently collected and cleared by centrifugation (4000 rpm/20 min). To probe the heat stability of neurotoxic factors, medium conditioned by CGA-treated microglial cells was boiled for 15 min and centrifuged (12,000 rpm/20 min at 4 °C) to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was then diluted 1/1 with fresh medium and added to cultured neurons. Co-cultures of neurons and microglial cells were prepared by plating a suspension of isolated microglia (2.5 × 105 cells) on neurons maintained 4 days in culture. Cells were incubated for 30 min in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Serum-free defined medium with or without additives was then added, and co-cultures were grown for at least 6 days. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 5 min in methanol at −20 °C followed by brief immersion in acetone at −20 °C. Alternatively, fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by 5 min permeabilization with 0.02% Triton X-100 in 4% paraformaldehyde was used and produced identical results. Fixed cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% bovine serum albumin to inhibit nonspecific binding of antibodies and with propidium iodide (PI, Sigma, St. Quentin, Fallavier, France) at 25 μg/ml for 20 min to visualize nuclei before incubation for 1 h with antibodies. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (Dako S. A., Trappes, France) were used at 1/100 dilution, monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments (SMI 31 Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Baltimore, MD), and monoclonal antibodies to microtubule-associated protein 2 (SMI 52 Sternberger Monoclonals Inc.) at 1/500 dilution. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (5 changes, 30 min), the coverslips were incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies which consisted of either fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Sigma) used at 1/100 dilution or FITC-conjugated affinity purified F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse class G immunoglobulins used at 1/300 dilution (Fc fragment specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Coverslips were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (5 changes, 30 min) and mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem, Meudon, France). Mounted coverslips were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with an epifluorescence system and appropriate filters. Sequential through-focus images of labeled cells were obtained using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 410 invert) equipped with a planapo oil (63 ×) immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) and an argon 488-nm and a helium/neon 543-nm lasers. The emission signals were filtered with a 515–565-nm filter (FITC) or with a long pass 595-nm filter (rhodamine). The images were recorded using identical laser power, wavelength, and photomultiplayer tube voltage. They were recorded digitally in a 768 × 556 pixel format and saved on an magneto optical disk. Digital data were down-loaded to a color video printer, Sony UP-1800EPM. To estimate the effect of CGA on neuronal survival, living cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with PI (25 μg/ml) in culture medium before fixation. Under these conditions, PI stains only the nuclei of damaged cells having a permeable membrane. Cells were then fixed and immunolabeled with anti-neurofilament antibodies revealed with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The viability of cells in neuronal cultures and in neuronal/microglial co-cultures was also estimated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), a technique that is based on the reduction of MTT by mitochondrial enzymes (28Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46852) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated for 6 h in MTT (1.5 mg/ml) which is converted into an insoluble blue formazan product by living cells. The blue product was then solubilized by the addition of isopropyl alcohol, 0.08 n HCl, and the optical density of the mixture was measured within 1 h at 570 and 630 nm. The value at 630 nm was subtracted from the value at 570 nm. Neuronal cell cultures and neuronal/microglial co-cultures in 24 multiwell Falcon plates were washed three times with 500 μl of DMEM without serum and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 mm β-alanine (Sigma) to inhibit the uptake of GABA by astroglial cells (29Sher P.K. Hu S. Brain Res. Bull. 1990; 25: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Banati R.B. Graeber M.B. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). No uptake of GABA was found in microglial cultures without neurons. The incubation medium was then discarded, and the cultures were further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 100 nm [3H]GABA (92 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, France) in the presence of β-alanine. Control values were obtained by the addition of [3H]GABA to cell-free wells. Cells were subsequently washed with DMEM (three times) and extracted with NaOH (0.1n, 400 μl per well). After neutralization with HCl (1n, 40 μl per well), the radioactivity present in the extracts was estimated by scintillation counting with Rotiszint (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). NO2− levels, measured with the Griess reagent, were taken as an estimate of NO generation (30Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuer D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). Griess reagent consists of an equal volume of (i) 0.1% (w/v) N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dichloride (Sigma) in water and (ii) 1% (w/v) sulfanilamide (Sigma) plus 5% (v/v) H3PO4 in water. NO2− was measured in the supernatants of cells grown on 24-multiwell Falcon plates. Briefly, a volume of 350 μl of supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the optical density of the mixture was read at 546 nm. A standard curve was established using NO2− (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in a concentration range from 0 to 50 μm. Data were corrected for the background levels of nitrite in the cell-free medium. TNF-α in conditioned media was measured using a two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Genzyme) with a solid phase-bound antibody to capture the rat TNF-α from standards and samples. The reporter antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat TNF-α. Bound TNF-α was visualized with hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine and read at 450 nm. Results were converted to ng/ml TNF-α using the standard curve. Experiments were performed on at least three different cell cultures. In the figures, data are representative of a typical experiment and are given as the mean of six determinations (± S.E.). Neurons derived from rat embryonal brain cortex maintained in serum-free medium formed small aggregates and within 4 days of culture extended neuritic processes, immunoreactive with anti-neurofilament antibodies. Since in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of cellular proliferation, neurons showed morphological damage and marked reduction in neuronal specific [3H]GABA uptake (data not shown); the present study was performed without mitotic inhibitors. Instead, the presence of glial cells was systematically controlled by staining parallel cultures with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells usually represent 3–5% of the total cell population. Cultures were discarded when a higher percentage was detected. The extension of neuronal processes and the expression of neurofilaments was complete within 4 days in culture. Furthermore, up to 14 days in culture in serum-free medium, neurons showed no sign of degeneration such as the retraction of processes and loss of cell adhesion. Therefore, we chose day 4 in culture to establish the co-cultures with microglial cells. To examine the effect of natural bovine CGA on neuron survival and neurofilament expression, neurons after 4 days in culture were incubated with 10 nm bCGA for 6 days. We previously demonstrated that the maximal effect of natural and recombinant CGA on microglia is obtained at 1 nm (20Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fig.1 illustrates a double staining experiment with anti-neurofilament antibodies and with the DNA-specific fluorochrome PI. Cells were exposed to PI before fixation. Under these conditions, PI labels only extracellular DNA fragments and the nuclei of damaged cells displaying a permeable membrane. Treatment with bCGA did not modify the nuclear staining in cells expressing neurofilaments, indicating that CGA apparently did not alter neuronal viability. Note the presence of some prominently stained nuclear fragments reflecting cell debris which are common features of neurons cultured in the absence of glial cells (Fig. 1, A and B). To test further a possible direct toxic effect of CGA on neurons, we examined the effect of bCGA on neuronal proliferation assessed by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine. As shown in Fig.1 C, neurons in culture displayed mitotic activity, as demonstrated by the significant incorporation of [3H]thymidine at day 1, which progressively declined with time in culture. Exposure of neuronal cultures to 10 nmbCGA did not change the pattern of [3H]thymidine incorporation, clearly indicating that the protein does not interfere with the capacity of neurons to proliferate. We also used the high affinity neuronal [3H]GABA uptake as an index of functional behavior, since it has been previously reported that at least 50% of the cortical neurons are GABAnergic when maintained in culture (31Larsson O.M. Hertz L. Schousboe A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1986; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that the uptake of [3H]GABA in rat brain cortical neurons progressively increased up to 3–4-fold between days 1 and 6 in culture (Fig.1 C). Incubation of cortical neurons with 10 nmbCGA (Fig. 1 C) or 10 nm recombinant human CGA (data not shown) did not significantly affect the maximal values of [3H]GABA uptake, further indicating that CGA does not provoke neuronal cell injury. We previously reported that CGA is able to induce an activated phenotype in microglia (20Taupenot L. Ciesielski-Treska J. Ulrich G. Chasserot-Golaz S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since activated microglia release cytotoxic substances potentially responsible for neuronal degeneration (32Banati R.B. Graeber M.B. Dev. Neurosci. 1994; 16: 114-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Chao C.C. Hu S. Peterson P.K. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1995; 9: 189-205PubMed Google Scholar, 34Giulian D. Corpuz M. Chapman S. Mansouri M. Robertson C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 681-69331Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of CGA on neurons co-cultured with microglia. Fig. 2illustrates a neuronal/microglial co-culture double-labeled with PI and anti-neurofilament antibodies. In the absence of CGA, the survival of neurons as judged by the density of the neurofilament network was not affected by a 6-day co-culture with microglial cells (Fig.2 A). However, addition of 10 nm bCGA to the co-culture medium for 6 days markedly reduced the expression of neurofilaments and increased the number of compacted PI-labeled nuclei, indicating that neurons progressively degenerated (Fig. 2 B). The remaining neuronal processes appeared abnormally dilated, and almost all cells were damaged in CGA-treated co-cultures. The microglial cell density required to produce maximal toxic effect in response to 10 nm bCGA was 2.5 × 105microglia per well, representing a 1/1 neuron/microglia cell ratio (Fig. 2 B). Neuronal damage and disruption of neurofilaments were also evident in a co-culture with a 2/1 neuron/microglia cell ratio (data not shown). To confirm further the effect of CGA on neuronal viability in neuronal/microglial cell co-cultures, we performed the MTT assay in control and 10 nm bCGA-treated co-cultures. MTT assay is a sensitive indicator of mitochondrial damage preceding cell death (35Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Compared with untreated co-cultures, treatment with 10 nmbCGA provoked a 50% decrease in MTT reduction after 6 days of incubation (Fig. 2 C), an observation which is consistent with the decrease in cell viability detected by microscopic observation. The functional activity of cortical neurons cultured with microglial cells was estimated by measuring [3H]GABA uptake. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of bCGA to the co-culture produced a dramatic dose-dependent decrease of the neuronal uptake of GABA. At 10 nm, bCGA decreased the [3H]GABA uptake after 3 and 6 days of treatment by 70 and 95%, respectively. Similarly, rhCGA at 10 nm inhibited the neuronal uptake of GABA after 6 days of incubation (see Fig.5 C), indicating that the recombinant protein was as effective as the natural protein in promoting neuronal injury and that CGA di"

The functional significance of these fucosylated structures is incompletely defined, although there is evidence that subsets of them, represented by the sialyl Lex determinant, are important participants in leukocyte adhesion and trafficking processes. Genetic deletion of these fucosylated structures in the mouse has been a powerful tool to address functional questions about fucosylated glycans. However, successful use of such approaches can be problematic, given the substantial redundancy in the mammalian α-1,3-fucosyltransferase and α-1,2-fucosyltransferase gene families. To circumvent this problem, we have chosen to clone the genetic locus encoding a mammalian GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMD). This enzyme generates GDP-mannose-4-keto-6-d-deoxymannose from GDP-mannose, which is then converted by the FX protein (GDP-4-keto-6-d-deoxymannose epimerase/GDP-4-keto-6-l-galactose reductase) to GDP-l-fucose. GMD is thus imperative for the synthesis of all fucosylated oligosaccharides. An expression cloning approach and the GMD-deficient CHO host cell line Lec13 were used to generate a population of cDNA molecules enriched in GMD cDNAs. This enriched plasmid population was then screened using a human expressed sequence tag (EST AA065072) with sequence similarity to anArabidopsis thaliana GMD cDNA. This approach, together with 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, yielded a human cDNA that complements the fucosylation defect in the Lec13 cell line. Northern blot analyses indicate that the GMD transcript is absent in Lec13 cells, confirming the genetic deficiency of this locus in these cells. By contrast, the transcript encoding the FX protein, which forms GDP-l-fucose from the ketosugar intermediate produced by GMD, is present in increased amounts in the Lec13 cells. These results suggest that metabolites generated in this pathway may participate in the transcriptional regulation of the FX protein and possibly the GMD protein. The results also suggest that the genomic structure encoding GMD in Lec13 cells likely has a defect different from a point mutation in the coding region.

Fucose is one of the critical carbohydrates in membrane-associated glycoproteins and glycolipids. Carbohydrates containing fucose are often characteristic of different cell types and are determinants for carbohydrate antigens (1Fukuda M. Fukuda M. Hindsgaul O. Molecular Glycobiology.

Moreover, sulfated derivatives of sialyl Lex, were found to be ligands for l-selectin (9Imai Y. Lasky L.A. Rosen S.D.

On the other hand, FucTIII was found to be responsible for the expression of sialyl Lea as well as sialyl Lex (12Natsuka S. Lowe J.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 683-691Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among these α1→3/4 fucosyltransferases, FucTVII is present in granulocytes, memory T cells, and high endothelia venules and directs the synthesis of selectin ligands in these cells (14Sasaki K.

Recent report on gene knockout of mouse FucTVII clearly demonstrated the role of FucTVII in selectin ligand presentation (18Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.F. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FucTIII, -V, and -VI are present in a wide variety of cells, and more than one α1→3/4 fucosyltransferase is present in a given tissue or cell. To address the roles of sialyl Lex and fucosylated oligosaccharides in general, a mouse lacking each gene encoding a fucosyltransferase must first be established and then such a mutant mouse must breed with another mutant mouse. Such a step has to be repeated three or possibly four times to obtain null mouse which completely lacks sialyl Lex in all tissues. In order to overcome this problem, we decided to clone a cDNA encoding an enzyme that is critically involved in fucose metabolism in general. This direction was also prompted by the report on patients with recurrent pneumonia and skin infections (19Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These patients lack sialyl Lex in neutrophils and are defective in the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Because fucose-containing antigens such as ABO blood group antigens are also absent in these patients, it is assumed that a step in the fucose metabolism is defective in these patients (19Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Donor substrate GDP-l-fucose is synthesized from GDP-d-mannose via three steps; GDP-d-mannose is first converted to GDP-4-keto-d-deoxymannose, and then to GDP-4-keto-6-l-deoxygalactose, which is further converted to GDP-l-fucose (20Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2196-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liao T.H. Barber G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, catalyzing the first reaction in the above metabolic pathway, is defective in a mutant CHO cell line Lec13 (22Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, no successful correction of Lec13 phenotype has been reported. In this report, we first describe the molecular cloning of the human GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMD). For this cloning, cDNA was initially enriched by expression cloning strategy using Lec13 as recipient cells. Plasmids rescued from those Lec13 cells expressing fucose were then screened by a human expressed sequence tag (EST) sequence, which has a strong similarity to cDNA encoding GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), resulting in the isolation of a plasmid DNA containing the human GMD. Introduction of the cloned cDNA into Lec13 cells resulted in the expression of fucosylated oligosaccharides in Lec13 cells, correcting the Lec13 phenotype. α-1,2-Fucosyltransferase (α-1,2-FT) cDNA was excised from pcDNA I-α-1,2-FT (24Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) byEcoRI and XbaI digestion and cloned into the same sites in pcDNA3, resulting in pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT. α-1,2-FT was shown to add α-1,2-fucose to both type 1 (Galβ1→3GlcNAc) and type 2 (Galβ1→4GlcNAc) oligosaccharides, forming Leb and H structure, respectively (24Kelly R.J. Rouquier S. Giorgi D. Lennon G.G. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4640-4649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). pcDNA I-FucTIII was prepared as described previously (25Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Anti-H antibody was prepared from a hybridoma cell line obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Lec13 cells were found to be negative for H antigen after pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT was transiently expressed. Lec13 cells were thus co-transfected with 7 μg of a human fetal brain cDNA library in pcDNA I (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), 7 μg of pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT, and 7 μg of pPSVE1-PyE harboring polyoma large T antigen cDNA (27Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Sixty-two h after the transfection, the transfected cells were dispersed into single cells by the cell dissociation solution (Cell & Molecular Technologies, Levellete, NJ), and then incubated with mouse anti-H antibody followed by FITC-conjugated goat affinity-purified (Fab′)2 fragment specific to mouse IgM. The cells were then sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using FACStar (Becton Dickinson). Plasmids were rescued by the Hirt procedure (28Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar) from those transfected cells strongly positive for H antigen expression. Plasmid DNA was amplified in the host bacteria Escherichia coliDH10B/P3 in the presence of ampicillin and tetracycline. The pcDNA I vector contains the supF suppressor tRNA gene, so that DH10B/P3 cells containing pcDNA I are resistant to both ampicillin and tetracycline. In contrast, DH10B/P3 cells having pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT or pPSVE1-PyE are resistant only to ampicillin. By selection with ampicillin and tetracycline, only bacteria containing pcDNA I were rescued and amplified (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), allowing the isolation of plasmids responsible for fucose expression assessed by the anti-H antibody. From this initial pool of 2 × 104 plasmids, sibling selection was carried out to isolate a plasmid clone that encodes a human GMD. However, this attempt was not successful. We then decided to clone GMD by hybridization method. Human EST data bases were searched with the nucleotide sequence reported for GMD cloned from A. thaliana (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and one sequence (AA065072) was identified. This human EST cDNA, obtained from Genome Systems, was digested withEcoRI and the resultant 5′-half cDNA fragment (450 base pairs), having high homology with A. thaliana GMD cDNA, was used as a probe. This was necessary because the nucleotide sequence after 301 base pairs from the 5′-end in the EST cDNA differ entirely from that of A. thaliana GMD cDNA (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). After screening approximately 2 × 104 clones of plasmids derived from the sorted cells as described above, four positive clones were isolated. One of them was found to have the largest cDNA insert, the nucleotide sequence of which is very similar to that reported for A. thaliana GMD and was tentatively designated as a partial human GMD cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the obtained clone indicated that the 5′-end was missing. To obtain a complete cDNA, 5′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out using poly(A)+ RNA from human fetal brain (CLONTECH) as a template and an oligonucleotide 5′-TCAGTGAGATCGCCATAGTGCAAC-3′ complementary to nucleotides 144–167. Using the cDNA formed as a template, 5′-region of human GMD cDNA was amplified by PCR using 5′-anchor primer provided in the RACE kit and 3′-PCR nested primer, 5′-TGTTTCCTTCAATGTGAGCCTGGG, which is complementary to nucleotides 116–139. The 241-base pair PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II/SK+ by T-A cloning. HindIII-NcoI fragment of 5′-RACE product was then ligated into NcoI andEcoRI fragment of GMD at a common NcoI site to form a cDNA encoding a full length of the coding region. This cDNA was cloned into pcDNA I, resulting in pcDNA I-hGMD. Lec13 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FucTIII and pcDNA I-hGMD using LipofectAMINE as described (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7031-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After selection with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), the transfected cells were selected by immunofluorescent staining for their expression of Lexusing anti-Lex antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France) or sialyl Lex using CSLEX-1 antibody (Becton Dickinson), as described previously (10Tsuboi S.

Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from human fetal and adult multiple tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Northern blots were also made using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from CHO parent cells, Lec13, HeLa, and HepG2 cells using a FastTrack™ 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). These blots were hybridized with a gel-purified cDNA insert of pcDNA I-hGMD after labeling with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming (Prime It-II labeling kit, Stratagene). The blots, made in an identical manner, were hybridized with a gel-purified cDNA encoding GDP-4-keto-6-d-deoxymannose epimerase/NADPH-depen-dent reductase (FX protein) (29Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This cDNA encoding FX protein was obtained as an EST cDNA (AA115440) and purchased from Genome Systems. Enzymatic activity of GMD and formation of the GDP-l-fucose from GDP-d-mannose were assayed using a slight modification of procedures published previously (22Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The incubation mixture in 100 μl contained 0.1 μmol of GDP-[14C]mannose (0.08 μCi, NEN Life Science Products), 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm nicotinamide, 2% glycerol, 0.28 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 96 μg of cytosolic proteins. In some instances, assays were supplemented with 0.2 mm NADPH. Assays completed in the absence of added NADPH measure the generation of GDP-4-keto-6-d-deoxymannose intermediate from GDP-d-mannose via the action of GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase activity (20Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2196-2201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Liao T.H. Barber G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 230: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This keto intermediate accumulates because its subsequent conversion to GDP-l-fucose by the action of the FX protein is an NADPH-dependent reaction (29Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Consequently, assays supplemented with NADPH measure the concerted actions of both steps in this pathway. The unstable GDP-ketosugar intermediates generated in the assays were converted to their reduced forms and acid-hydrolyzed as described before (22Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Free mannose liberated by this hydrolysis procedure was re-phosphorylated with yeast hexokinase and removed by passing through a Dowex 1X8(-200) column (phosphate counter-ion) as described (22Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The eluate was dried by rotary evaporation, resuspended in a small volume of water, and subjected to descending paper chromatography for 6 h on Whatman No. 1 paper in the upper phase of pyridine:ethyl acetate:water (1.0:3.6:1.15, v/v/v). The paper was cut into 3-cm strips, and the radioactivity in each strip was quantitated by scintillation counting. Sugars were identified by their mobilities relative to commercially available standards (mannose, fucose, 6-deoxyglucose, and α-d-rhamnose), or 6-deoxytalose standard generously provided by Dr. James Paulson and Katherine Ketchum (Cytel Corp.). The parent CHO (Pro−5) and Lec13 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Pamela Stanley, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. CHO mutant Lec13 cells were co-transfected with a human fetal brain cDNA library in pcDNA I, pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT, and pPSVE1-PyE. The transfected cells highly positive for H antigen expression were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Plasmid DNAs, recovered from the above H-antigen positive Lec13 cells, were initially subjected to sibling selection with sequentially smaller, active pools, attempting to isolate a single clone that directs the synthesis of fucose in Lec13 cells. However, this attempt was not successful (see below). We then screened the plasmid pool right after the cell sorting with a human cDNA fragment which contains a sequence highly homologous toA. thaliana GMD (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and isolated four positive clones. Comparing A. thaliana GMD to human cDNA sequences cloned, the cloned DNA contained almost all of the coding sequence but lacks the extreme 5′-region. The sequence obtained by 5′-RACE reaction was ligated to the common NcoI site of the cDNA clone to form a cDNA encoding the entire GMD, resulting in pcDNA I-hGMD. The cDNA sequence of hGMD contains 1466 nucleotides encoding 339 amino acids (Fig. 1). Because poly(A)n tail is present in nucleotides 1383–1409, ATTAAA at nucleotides 1355–1360 may have functioned as a polyadenylation signal. The amino acid and nucleotide sequence of human GMD are similar to those of the A. thaliana GMD (55.0% and 55.4% identity, respectively). The sequence is highly conserved from bacteria to human (see also Ref. 23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To confirm that pcDNA I-hGMD directs the expression of fucosylated oligosaccharides on Lec13 cells, Lec13 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA I-hGMD and pcDNA3-FucTIII or pcDNA I-hGMD and pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT. As shown in Fig. 2 (G andH), Lec13 cells were highly positive for sialyl Lex and Lex after transfection with pcDNA I-hGMD and pcDNA I-FucTIII. In contrast, Lec13 cells were barely positive for H-antigen expression after transfection with pcDNA I-GMD and pcDNA3-α-1,2-FT (Fig. 2 D). On the other hand, wild-type CHO cells were highly positive for H-antigen expression as well as Lex and sialyl Lex expression after transfection with α-1,2-FT or FucTIII (Fig. 2, B,E, and F). These results indicate that the fucose metabolism of Lec13 was corrected by the expression of pcDNA I-hGMD. The above results also indicate that Lec13 cells can barely express Fucα1→2Galβ1→4GlcNAc structure, possibly because the high degree of sialylation prevents the addition of fucose at terminal galactose residues. This was probably the reason why the cloning of GMD was not successful by detecting H-antigen after transfection of Lec13 cells with fractionated plasmids and pcDNA-α-1,2-FT. To confirm that the cloned cDNA encodes GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, the enzymatic assay was carried out on the Lec13 cells and Lec13 cells stably transfected with pcDNA I-hGMD. GDP-d-mannose is converted to GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose by GMD. This keto intermediate will be converted to GDP-l-fucose by an epimerase and GDP-4-keto-6-l-deoxygalactose reductase (Fig.3). As shown previously, the last two reactions are carried out by a single enzyme, FX protein (29Tonetti M. Sturla L. Bisso A. Benatti U. De Flora A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27274-27279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the absence of NADPH, however, the second and the third reactions do not take place, thus allowing us to measure the activity of the dehydratase by determining the amount of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose formed (Fig. 3). GDP-4-keto-6-d-deoxymannose would be converted by NaBH4 reduction to GDP-6-deoxy-d-talose and GDP-rhamnose, whereas GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-galactose would be converted to GDP-l-fucose and GDP-6-deoxy-l-glucose by the same treatment. These products can be then released by acid hydrolysis and resultant monosaccharides can be separated by paper chromatography as shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4Separation of intermediate monosaccharides and fucose by paper chromatography. Reduced intermediate monosaccharides, released from GDP-bound forms, were separated by paper chromatography, and radioactivity in each 3-cm strip was determined by a scintillation counter. Rhamnose and 6-deoxytalose, derived from GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose, migrated at the positions of 25–30 cm and 31–36 cm from the origin, respectively. Fucose and 6-deoxyglucose, derived from GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-l-galactose, migrated together at the positions of 15–21 cm from the origin. The majority of fucose was produced from the final product, GDP-fucose. The cell lysates from Lec13 stably transfected with FucTIII (A and B) and Lec13 cells stably transfected with pcDNA I-GMD and FucTIII (C and D) and the parent CHO Pro−5cells (E and F) were assayed in the absence (A, C, and E) or the presence (B, D, and F) of NADPH. The radioactivity in the origin may be phosphorylated sugars (22Ripka J. Adamany A. Stanley P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The parent Lec13 cells produced the same results as Lec13-FTIII cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lec13-FTIII cells produced almost no detectable amount of rhamnose, 6-deoxygalactose or fucose, in the absence (Fig. 4 A) or presence (Fig. 4 B) of NADPH, indicating that no GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose was formed. In contrast, Lec13-FTIII cells transfected with pcDNA I-GMD produced a substantial amount of rhamnose and 6-deoxytalose in the absence of NADPH (Fig. 4 C) as did the wild-type CHO Pro−5cells (Fig. 4 E). In the presence of NADPH, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose was converted to GDP-l-fucose by the FX protein present in Lec13 and wild-type CHO cells, inasmuch as fucose was detected from reduced-acid hydrolyzed product (Fig. 4, D and F; see also Table I). These results establish that pcDNA I-hGMD encodes GDP-d-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, capable of correcting the defect in fucose metabolism in Lec13 cells.Table IQuantitation of products formed from GDP-[14C]mannose using cytosolic extracts derived from different cell linesGDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannoseGDP-l-fucose−NADPH+NADPH−NADPH+NADPHCHO(Pro−5)27.136.980.9928.37Lec13<0.5<0.5<0.5<0.5Lec13+FucTIII0.62<0.5<0.5<0.5Lec13+FucTIII+GMD10.40.88<0.56.81The numbers correspond to the amount of products formed in picomoles/90 min of incubation/96 μg of cytosolic proteins. Open table in a new tab The numbers correspond to the amount of products formed in picomoles/90 min of incubation/96 μg of cytosolic proteins. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA derived from various human tissues were examined. A GMD transcript of ∼1.7 kilobases was detected in all tissues examined. However, it was more prominent in fetal kidney than in fetal brain, lung, and liver. Among various adult tissues, the strongest signal was detected in colon and pancreas and a moderately strong signal was detected in testis and small intestine (data not shown). An ∼1.4-kilobase transcript of FX protein, on the other hand, was more prominent in fetal liver than in fetal brain, lung, and kidney. Among adult tissues, pancreas, testis, colon, and skeletal muscle expressed more prominently the transcript for the FX protein than the other tissues. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+RNA derived from Lec13 and CHO cells demonstrated that the transcript for GMD was not detectable in Lec13 cells whereas it was detected in CHO cell (Fig. 5). In contrast, Lec13 cells express more transcripts for FX protein than CHO. The same analysis also showed that the transcript for FX protein is less in HepG2 cells than HeLa cells whereas the transcript for GMD is more in HepG2 cells than HeLa cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the transcript for GMD is absent in Lec13 cells. The results also suggest that the transcript for FX protein is increased when GMD is not sufficiently expressed. In the present study, we have isolated a human cDNA encoding GMD using expression cloning strategy and then screening the obtained plasmid pool by EST sequence. The expression of cloned GMD in Lec13 cells corrected the phenotype of Lec13 cells, acquiring fucosylated oligosaccharides. The amino acid sequence of human GMD is highly homologous to those isolated from other organisms including bacteria (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Currie H.L. Lightfoot J. Lam J.S. Clin. Diag. Lab. Immunol. 1995; 2: 554-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This situation differs completely from Golgi-associated glycosyltransferases. For example, the amino acid sequences of mammalian polysialyltransferases (26Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B.

Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Similarly, human β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase has no homology withNisseria gonorrhoeae β-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (36Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S.

Med. 1994; 180: 2181-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amino acid sequences of Golgi-associated α-mannosidases are conserved from yeast to humans (38Jarvis D.L. Bohlmeyer D.A. Lian Y.-F. Lomax K.K. Merkle R.K. Weinkauf C. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 113-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results suggest that enzymes forming donor sugars in the cytoplasm evolved early in very primitive organisms and were conserved during evolution. In contrast, Golgi-associated glycosyltransferases most likely evolved only after organisms reached eukaryotes, acquiring the Golgi-apparatus. Previously, it has been shown that a point mutation in the coding region of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and V leads into the glycosylation defect in Lec1 and Lec4A cells, respectively (39Puthalakath H. Burke J. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27818-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,40Weinstein J. Sundaram S. Wang X. Delgado D. Basu R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type II, a point mutation was discovered in the nucleotide sequence encoding the catalytic domain of β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (41Tan J. Dunn J. Jaeken J. Schachter H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar). Such a point mutation leads to inactivation of the enzyme, causing defective brain development (41Tan J. Dunn J. Jaeken J. Schachter H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 810-817PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Lec13 cells lack the transcript for GMD as shown in the present study. This defect is similar to that discovered in one of HEMPAS (congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II) patients, where the transcript for α-mannosidase II is substantially reduced (42Fukuda M.N. Masri K.A. Dell A. Luzzato L. Moremen K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7443-7447Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that a defect in the genomic structures encoding GMD and α-mannosidase II leads to glycosylation anomaly in Lec13 and HEMPAS patients, respectively. These defects can be due to a defect in the transcription regulatory element, a deletion of part or all of the locus or dramatically decreased mRNA stability caused by nonsense mutation (43Maquat L.E. RNA. 1995; 1: 453-465PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the amount of the transcript for the FX protein, which converts the intermediate formed by GMD to GDP-l-fucose, is increased in Lec13 cells as if Lec13 cells try to compensate the low activity of GMD (Fig. 5). These results suggest that metabolites generated in this pathway may participate in the transcriptional regulation of the FX protein and possibly the GMD protein. It will be significant to determine if patients with the defect in fucose metabolism (19Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 327: 1789-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) is due to a genomic defect in GMD or FX protein, and in parallel to determine the genetic defect in Lec13 cells. In the present study, we have demonstrated that the defect of fucose metabolism in Lec13 cells can be corrected by the expression of GMD. Similarly, the mutant of A. thaliana cells regained normal fucose metabolism by expressing GMD in the mutant cell line. A point mutation was identified in the coding sequence of GMD gene,MUR1 in the latter studies (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Although an additional gene for GMD is suggested in A. thaliana (23Bonin C.P. Potter I. Vanzin G.F. Reiter W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2085-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), these results strongly suggest that only one gene may be dominant for expressing GMD in A. thaliana, and most likely in Lec13 cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that cloned human GMD is expressed in all tissues so far examined. However, we do not know whether the cloned enzyme is solely responsible for fucose metabolism in hematopoietic and endothelial cells. These issues need to be dissolved before attempts for generating knock-out mice defective in the GMD gene will be carried out. We thank Drs. Pamela Stanley, James Paulson, and Katherine Ketchum for their kind gifts of cells and reagents; Dr. Edgar Ong for critical reading of the manuscript; and Susan Greaney for organizing the manuscript."

Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the activation mechanism of the MAPK cascade by receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity has been well studied, the route from G proteins to the MAPK cascade in mammalian cells is less understood (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 7Herskowitz I.

Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the detailed biochemical steps are far from clear, these studies have shown that G protein-coupled receptors use pathways very similar to those utilized by receptor tyrosine kinases to activate the prototype Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade. Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors transmit the signals to MAPK through a pathway involving tyrosine kinase, adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, Ras, and Raf in most cases (for review, see Ref. 5Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated to act upstream of tyrosine kinases in the Gi/MAPK pathway in some cells (8Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

It is also unclear if cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) participate in the Gs-coupled receptor/MAPK pathway. Whereas one group reported that cAMP, forskolin, and Gs-coupled receptors can stimulate MAPK in COS-7 cells (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), another reported that cAMP and PKA do not mediate activation of MAPK by Gs-coupled receptors in COS-7 cells (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor used the Gβγ subunit to activate the MAPK pathway through Ras and used the Gsα subunit to inhibit MAPK activation through cAMP and PKA (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These contradictory results regarding whether the α-subunit or the βγ-subunits of Gs protein mediate the receptor stimulation of MAPK and whether PKA is involved in the Gs/MAPK pathway in mammalian cells prompted us to address this question genetically. For the most part, signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins has not been studied genetically in mammalian cells.S49 mouse lymphoma cells have played an important historical role in G protein research (15Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A variant of S49 cells lacking Gsα was instrumental in defining the function of and characterizing Gsα (15Gilman A.G. Biosci.

Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels results in growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and later (after several days) in cell death (16Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell.

Mutants have been selected that are resistant to cytolysis. These mutants includecyc − (which lacks Gsα) (18Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 187: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar),UNC(which has a mutation of arginine at position 372 of Gsα and thus uncouples the interaction of Gsα with the receptors) (19Haga T.

Bourne H.R. Coffino P. Tomkins G.M. Science. 1975; 190: 896-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).These Gsα and PKA mutant S49 cells should be very useful in a molecular genetic study to understand the role of Gsα and PKA in the β-adrenergic receptor/MAPK signaling system. In this study, using these mutant S49 cells, we demonstrate that Gsα transduces the β-adrenergic receptor signal to MAPK in a protein kinase A-dependent pathway involving Rap1 and Raf (but not Ras) molecules.DISCUSSIONIn summary, using various mutant S49 mouse lymphoma cells, we have provided the first genetic evidence for Gsα and protein kinase A transducing the β-adrenergic receptor signal to MAPK. Incyc − mutant S49 cells that lack Gsα proteins, stimulation of the β-adrenergic receptor failed to activate MAPK. In UNC mutant S49 cells that Gsα is unable to couple to the β-adrenergic receptor, MAPK could not be stimulated by the β-receptor. Two Gsα mutants that can complex with the Gβγ subunit and β-receptor, but are unable to stimulate adenylyl cyclase, failed to rescue thecyc − mutant response to β-receptor stimulation of MAPK. Wild-type Gsα rescued thecyc − cell response. Furthermore, inkin − mutant S49 cells that lack protein kinase A activity, stimulation of MAPK by the β-receptor was blocked. Moreover, dominant-negative mutants of Rap1 or Raf, but not Ras, suppressed the β-receptor-induced MAPK stimulation. These data collectively demonstrate that the Gs-coupled adrenergic receptor uses Gsα, transducing the signal to a PKA-, Rap1-, and Raf-dependent, but Ras-independent, pathway leading to MAPK activation in S49 mouse lymphoma cells.Previously, Faure et al. (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that overexpressing Gβγ or constitutively activated Gsα could lead to activation of MAPK and that cAMP, forskolin, and Gs-coupled receptors could stimulate MAPK in COS-7 cells. On the other hand, Crespo et al. (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) reported that only overexpression of Gβγ subunits, but not the activated Gsα subunit, could increase MAPK activity in COS-7 cells. It was proposed that in COS-7 cells, whereas Gβγ transduces a positive signal to increase MAPK activity, Gsα, through protein kinase A, inhibits the MAPK stimulation (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. The suggestion that Gβγ mediates the β-adrenergic receptor signal to MAPK is based on two types of experiments (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). One is that, as mentioned above, overexpression of Gβγ could lead to increased MAPK activity. Another is that overexpression of a Gβγ-binding fragment from the β-adrenergic receptor kinase protein or Gtα could attenuate the stimulation of MAPK by β-adrenergic receptors.We were unable to perform a genetic analysis of the role of Gβγ subunits due to the lack of null mutants of Gβ or Gγ subunits in S49 cells. Gβγ is likely required in a structural role for the integrity of G protein function, but is unlikely to play a major signaling role for the following reasons. First, incyc − mutant cells, the basal activity of MAPK is similar to that in wild-type cells. If Gβγ is the major signal transducer, as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, then in cyc − cells, MAPK could be constitutively active, as in Gα null mutant cells in S. cerevisiae (38Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,39Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Second, two mutant Gsα (αs89 and αs389) subunits did not rescue thecyc − cell response despite being able to release Gβγ upon receptor stimulation. Third, in S49 cells, the isoforms of adenylyl cyclases can be stimulated by Gsα, but not by Gβγ or calcium/calmodulin (40Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). These data suggest that if Gβγ is needed, it is for structural reasons only, not for activating downstream targets. Therefore, in S49 mouse lymphoma cells, Gsα, not Gβγ, transduces the receptor signal to MAPK.In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the α-subunit of G protein carries the signal to the MAPK pathway (41Obara T. Nakafuku M. Yamamoto M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the βγ-subunit of G protein couples the receptor to the MAPK cascade (38Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K.

Given that the α-subunit of Gs transduces Gs-coupled receptor signal to MAPK in S49 cells and that the βγ-subunit of Gi likely conveys the message from Gi-coupled receptors to MAPK (13Faure M.

A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), these different usages of the α and βγ subunits might be reminiscent of S. pombe versus S. cerevisiae MAPK signaling pathways. Thus, mammalian cells have both yeast pathways that are utilized by different families of G proteins.The cAMP and protein kinase A effect on the MAPK pathway depends on cell type: in some cells, they are stimulatory to the MAPK pathway, whereas in other cells, they are inhibitory (44Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A recent study has determined that these stimulatory or inhibitory effects are dictated by the expression of B-Raf (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A directly activates the small G protein Rap1, which in turn, selectively and directly activates B-Raf, leading to the activation of MAPK. We found that B-Raf is expressed in S49 cells and that isoproterenol could stimulate B-Raf activity in S49 cells. Also, we have examined the activation of MEK, an upstream activator of MAPK, and obtained results similar to those for MAPK activation. Thus, we propose the activation sequence as β-adrenergic receptor/Gsα/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA/Rap1/B-Raf/MEK/MAPK. This Gsα/MAPK pathway represents the first complete biochemical pathway for G protein/MAPK signaling. G proteins serve their physiological roles by transducing signals from a broad class of cell-surface receptors to specific effector proteins (1Gilman A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar, 2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar, 3Simon M.I.

A variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways are regulated by G proteins, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; PKA, protein kinase A. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase; PKA, protein kinase A.pathway (5Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the activation mechanism of the MAPK cascade by receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity has been well studied, the route from G proteins to the MAPK cascade in mammalian cells is less understood (6Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 7Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Recent studies in cultured cell lines with pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants of certain signaling molecules have revealed the participation of some molecular components in the regulation of MAPK by G protein-coupled receptors (for review, see Ref.5Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Although the detailed biochemical steps are far from clear, these studies have shown that G protein-coupled receptors use pathways very similar to those utilized by receptor tyrosine kinases to activate the prototype Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade. Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors transmit the signals to MAPK through a pathway involving tyrosine kinase, adapter proteins Shc and Grb2, guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, Ras, and Raf in most cases (for review, see Ref. 5Post G.R. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated to act upstream of tyrosine kinases in the Gi/MAPK pathway in some cells (8Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For receptors coupled to Gs, overexpressing Gβγ or Gsα subunits in COS-7 cells has shown that whereas Gβγ subunits have the capacity to stimulate MAPK, the ability of Gsα to stimulate MAPK is controversial (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It is also unclear if cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) participate in the Gs-coupled receptor/MAPK pathway. Whereas one group reported that cAMP, forskolin, and Gs-coupled receptors can stimulate MAPK in COS-7 cells (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), another reported that cAMP and PKA do not mediate activation of MAPK by Gs-coupled receptors in COS-7 cells (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptor used the Gβγ subunit to activate the MAPK pathway through Ras and used the Gsα subunit to inhibit MAPK activation through cAMP and PKA (14Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These contradictory results regarding whether the α-subunit or the βγ-subunits of Gs protein mediate the receptor stimulation of MAPK and whether PKA is involved in the Gs/MAPK pathway in mammalian cells prompted us to address this question genetically. For the most part, signaling by heterotrimeric G proteins has not been studied genetically in mammalian cells. S49 mouse lymphoma cells have played an important historical role in G protein research (15Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A variant of S49 cells lacking Gsα was instrumental in defining the function of and characterizing Gsα (15Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels results in growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and later (after several days) in cell death (16Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Tomkins G.M. J. Cell.

Third, in S49 cells, the isoforms of adenylyl cyclases can be stimulated by Gsα, but not by Gβγ or calcium/calmodulin (40Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). These data suggest that if Gβγ is needed, it is for structural reasons only, not for activating downstream targets. Therefore, in S49 mouse lymphoma cells, Gsα, not Gβγ, transduces the receptor signal to MAPK. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the α-subunit of G protein carries the signal to the MAPK pathway (41Obara T. Nakafuku M. Yamamoto M. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5877-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the βγ-subunit of G protein couples the receptor to the MAPK cascade (38Dietzel C. Kurjan J. Cell. 1987; 50: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 39Miyajima I. Nakafuku M. Nakayama N. Brenner C. Miyajima A. Kaibuchi K. Arai K. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Cell. 1987; 50: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Given that the α-subunit of Gs transduces Gs-coupled receptor signal to MAPK in S49 cells and that the βγ-subunit of Gi likely conveys the message from Gi-coupled receptors to MAPK (13Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S.

A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), these different usages of the α and βγ subunits might be reminiscent of S. pombe versus S. cerevisiae MAPK signaling pathways. Thus, mammalian cells have both yeast pathways that are utilized by different families of G proteins. The cAMP and protein kinase A effect on the MAPK pathway depends on cell type: in some cells, they are stimulatory to the MAPK pathway, whereas in other cells, they are inhibitory (44Faure M. Bourne H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 45Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biol. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A recent study has determined that these stimulatory or inhibitory effects are dictated by the expression of B-Raf (31Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A directly activates the small G protein Rap1, which in turn, selectively and directly activates B-Raf, leading to the activation of MAPK. We found that B-Raf is expressed in S49 cells and that isoproterenol could stimulate B-Raf activity in S49 cells. Also, we have examined the activation of MEK, an upstream activator of MAPK, and obtained results similar to those for MAPK activation. Thus, we propose the activation sequence as β-adrenergic receptor/Gsα/adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA/Rap1/B-Raf/MEK/MAPK. This Gsα/MAPK pathway represents the first complete biochemical pathway for G protein/MAPK signaling. We thank Drs. T. Kozasa, A. Gilman, and P. Stork for providing plasmids. We are grateful to Drs.

Recently, it was shown that class I myosins are phosphorylated by a member of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family. PAK phosphorylates a conserved serine or threonine residue in the myosin heavy chain. Phosphorylation at this site is required for maximal activation of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity in vitro. This serine or threonine residue is conserved in all known class I myosins of microbial origin and in the human and mouse class VI myosins. We have investigated the in vivo significance of this phosphorylation by mutating serine 371 of the class I myosin heavy chain gene myoA of Aspergillus nidulans. Mutation to glutamic acid, which mimics phosphorylation and therefore activation of the myosin, results in an accumulation of membranes in growing hyphae. This accumulation of membranes results from an activation of endocytosis. In contrast, mutation of serine 371 to alanine had no discernible effect on endocytosis. These studies are the first to demonstrate the in vivo significance of a regulatory phosphorylation on a class I myosin. Furthermore, our results suggest that MYOA has two functions, one dependent and one independent of phosphorylation.

These studies are the first to demonstrate the in vivo significance of a regulatory phosphorylation on a class I myosin. Furthermore, our results suggest that MYOA has two functions, one dependent and one independent of phosphorylation. Class I myosins have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell locomotion, contractile vacuole function, receptor-mediated endocytosis, protein secretion, and intracellular vesicle transport (1Hanson T. Mooseker M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have been studying the function of the class I myosin gene, myoA, of the filamentous fungusAspergillus nidulans (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We constructed a conditional null mutant myoA strain using the promoter of the inducible alcohol dehydrogenase gene alcA (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Using this strain, we showed that myoA is an essential gene in A. nidulans and that it was required for the establishment of polarized hyphal growth. We also showed that strains lackingmyoA were deficient for the secretion of acid phosphatase into the medium. In contrast, work on class I myosin function in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has suggested that they function in endocytosis and possibly protein secretion (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae there are two genes, MYO3 andMYO5, that code for class I myosin polypeptides. Deletion of either of these genes is not lethal, suggesting that they have overlapping or redundant functions. Deletion of both genes produces strains that either grow poorly (4Goodson H.V. Anderson B.L. Warrick H.M. Pon L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1277-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) or are inviable (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A strain that has a temperature-sensitive myo5 mutation is defective for endocytosis but not for protein secretion (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Studies of class I myosin function and their actin-activated ATPase activity in Dictyostelium discoideum and Acanthamoeba castellanii have shown that these class I myosins are regulated by phosphorylation at a specific and highly conserved serine or threonine residue on the heavy chain (5Brzeska H.

This phosphorylation site is also found in other unconventional myosins like the class VI myosins from humans and mice (Fig. 1). Recent studies have shown that the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of the amoeboid class I myosins is a member of the PAK/STE20 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast; FM 4–64,N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-diethylaminophenyl-hexitrienyl)pyridinium dibromide. family of serine-threonine protein kinases (5Brzeska H.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), stimulates the activity of PAKs. Activated forms of these small GTPases when transfected into tissue culture cells have dramatic effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (7Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The demonstration that a PAK regulates the activity of class I myosin provides a link to how members of the small GTP-binding proteins, like Rac, mediate some of their effects on the actin cytoskeleton and membrane ruffling of vertebrate cells in culture (7Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 8Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin.

Class I or other unconventional myosins, like the class VI myosins, may in turn be the functional connection between the regulatory activity of PAKs and the motor activity necessary for changes in the actin cytoskeleton and membrane ruffling. The morphological changes previously attributed to PAKs may in fact be due to phosphorylation of myosins by PAK-like kinases. To investigate the in vivo significance of phosphorylation of class I myosin heavy chain in myosin function, we have mutated the class I myosin gene myoA of A. nidulans and examined the consequences of these changes on cell growth, cell morphology, protein secretion, and endocytosis. We made these mutants because in vitro the myosin I kinase from A. castellanii phosphorylates a synthetic peptide with the sequence of this region of MYOA. 2H. Brzeska and E. Korn, personal communication. We generated mutant forms of MYOA containing either alanine or glutamic acid substitutions at the conserved, PAK-phosphorylated serine 371 of MYOA (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These mutations were introduced back into the chromosomalmyoA locus by homologous recombination. Strains were identified that express only the mutant forms of the class I myosin (S371E or S371A), and the phenotypes of these strains were characterized. Our results indicate that mutation of serine 371 to glutamic acid leads to constitutive activation of endocytosis. S371A and S371E myoA mutations were made using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis method (10Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The names and sequences of the primers used in these studies are given in Table I. The primers used to make the mutations in myoA were Ser-Ala, Ser-Ala2, Ser-Glu, and Ser-Glu2. Ser-Ala and Ser-Glu were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase prior to being used in the PCR. The flanking primers used were myoA3, and myoA7. The conditions for the PCR reaction were 95 °C for 5 min to denature the plasmid. This was followed by 30 cycles of 95, 55, and 72 °C for 1, 1, and 2 min, respectively. The reactions consisted of 10 ng of plasmid DNA template in 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 0.1 mg/ml gelatin, and 100 ng of the appropriate primer pair in a final volume of 0.05 ml. The final PCR product was digested with NheI and MluI and cloned into plasmid pmyo4. The presence of the specific mutations and the absence of other changes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. AKpnI-SmaI fragment containing the mutation was used to replace the equivalent wild type sequence in the plasmid pmyo3 to generate pmyo3-Ala and pmyo3-Glu. These plasmids are based on the vector pRG3 and used for transformation into A. nidulans(13Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions to determine which myoA allele was being expressed used the same conditions described above but used 100 ng of genomic DNA as template in the first PCR reaction. The primers used in the first PCR reaction were myoA5 and myoA7. The product of this reaction was 1274 bp (base pairs) in length. The primer myoA5 is not contained in the sequences of the integrative vector and would not produce a PCR product with the expected restriction polymorphism unless the crossover during homologous recombination was upstream of the site of the mutation. Thus, non-homologous integration events and those in which the crossover occurred downstream of the site of the mutation would yield the wild type sequence lacking the restriction polymorphism expected for the mutant allele. The product from the first PCR reaction was purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.). A portion of the purified PCR product was used to prime a second reaction with the primers myoA24 and myoA7 to produce a product of 190 bp. The time of incubation at each temperature were reduced by half for this second PCR reaction.Table IOligonucleotides used in these studies and their sequencesPrimer nameSequencemyoA3CGTCGGTGCTAATATmyoA5TGCATTAAATTGATAmyoA7TTGCTACTCGATTGAmyoA24ATCAGTGGTTGACTTCGTCGSer-AlaGCCGTGGCGCCGTTTATGAGSer-Ala2CTCATAAACGGCGCCACGGCSer-GluGCCGTGGCGAGGTTTATGAGSer-Glu2CTCATAAACCTCGCCACGGC Open table in a new tab Differential interference contrast micrographs were collected from hyphal tips grown in 0.5% yeast extract, 1% dextrose, and 1.5% agar and placed as thin layers on sterile microscope slides. The slides were incubated overnight in a humid chamber to allow germination of the conidia. Hyphae were observed using a Zeiss Axiophot, and images were collected as described below. To look at endocytosis, conidia were germinated overnight at room temperature (14–16 h). They were incubated on ice in medium containing 32 μm FM 4–64 (11Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Germlings were subsequently observed using a Zeiss Axiophot. Digital images were collected using a Hamamatsu Model C2400 camera, and images were obtained using a SCSI adapter and twain driver with Adobe™ Photoshop 3.0. Samples for electron microscopy were grown in 0.5% yeast extract, 20 mm glucose for 20 h at room temperature. Germlings were fixed in 6% glutaraldehyde, PBS for 2 h. They were washed three times in PBS, post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 1 h, and rinsed in three changes of distilled water. The fixed sample was dehydrated through a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol and then into absolute ethanol and propylene oxide. They were infiltrated with a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Epon resin overnight at room temperature and then embedded in Epon resin. Sections were cut using a diamond knife on an RMC ultramicrotome at 80-nm thickness and viewed on a Phillips 410 electron microscope after staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Methods for the growth and genetic manipulation of A. nidulans have been described in detail elsewhere (12Pontecorvo G. Roper J.A. Hemmons C.M. MacDonald K.D. Bufton A.W.J. Adv. Genet. 1953; 5: 141-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 13Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, those methods used in the manipulation of plasmids and molecular cloning have been described elsewhere (13Waring R.B. May G.S. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The determination of the number of conidia produced in culture was determined using the method previously described (14Weatherbee J.A. May G.S. Gambino J. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Primary transformants were purified three times to single spores on selective medium. A PCR-based assay was designed to determine whether the wild type or mutant allele of myoA was being expressed (Fig. 2 A). Our assay uses two rounds of PCR to detect the allele being expressed from the promoter of myoA. Both the S371A and S371E mutations generate a restriction polymorphism that was readily identified following PCR amplification from the expressed gene. The S371A mutation introduces a HaeII site, which results in two fragments of 105 and 85 bp following digestion of the PCR product. The S371E mutation introduces a BslI site, which produces three fragments of 105, 59, and 26 bp while the wild type produces two fragments of 131 and 59 bp (Fig. 2 B). The nested PCR procedure made detection of the restriction polymorphism reproducible. Genomic Southern analysis was performed on strains expressing the mutant allele to confirm that a single integration event had occurred at the homologous myoA locus (data not shown). The phenotype of the S371A and S371E mutations was confirmed for at least three independent isolates. The S371A and S371E mutants and a control strain were examined by light microscopy. We found that the S371E mutation had a dramatic effect on the appearance of the cytoplasm by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Hyphal tips of the S371E mutant strain displayed a grainy appearance, suggestive of a major change in the composition of the cytoplasm, whereas the hyphal tips of the S371A and control strains appeared similar to one another (Fig. 3). Many things could account for the differences in the appearance of the cytoplasm between the control strains and the S371E mutant strain. Among these would be changes in organization of cytoskeletal elements, the accumulation of additional membranous organelles, or a change in the amount of solute in the cytoplasm. To determine the reason for the changes in the cytoplasm, we examined hyphae by electron microscopy. Thin section electron micrographs of control and S371E mutant hyphae confirmed our light microscopic observations, suggesting a change in the organization of the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Vesicles were visible in the tips of the control and S371A strains, but they were present in greater numbers along with tracks of membranes, presumably formed by invagination, in the S371E mutant. In addition to the membrane tracks in the S371E mutant, other intracellular membranes take on a rougher appearance (Fig. 4). To show that this difference is not restricted to those images we present, we quantified the difference in the numbers of vesicles and membrane tracks in the control and mutant strains. The number of vesicles and membrane tracks was determined for a fixed area in eight hyphal tips from the control and the two mutant strains. The S371A mutant strain had 70% of the vesicles and 75% of the membrane tracks observed in the control strain. In contrast, the S371E mutant strain had 2.6 times the number of vesicles and 5.8 times the number of membrane tracks seen in the control strain. In yeast, class I myosin has been shown to be important for endocytosis (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the S371E mutant internalizes more plasma membrane by endocytosis. To test this, we examined endocytosis in germlings of the control and the S371A and S371E mutants by measuring the uptake of the fluorescent molecule FM 4–64. FM 4–64 is a lipophilic styryl dye that has been used to follow bulk membrane internalization and transport in yeast (11Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Germlings were incubated in FM 4–64 at 0 °C to label the plasma membrane and then warmed to room temperature. Internalization of the dye was assessed at various times by fluorescence microscopy. We observed that FM 4–64 was rapidly internalized in S371E germlings, whereas in the control its internalization was much slower (Fig. 5). After 10 min, the internalized membrane in the S371E mutant appeared as large fluorescent patches that continued to increase in number out to 20 min. In contrast, the number and size of fluorescent patches in the control were reduced at all time points. Thus, the S371E mutant strain showed a dramatic increase in plasma membrane internalization. To demonstrate that this internalization of plasma membranes was F-actin dependent, we treated germlings with cytochalasin D, a compound that depolymerizes F-actin. Cytochalasin D treatment of control and S371E mutant germlings blocked FM 4–64 internalization (Fig. 5). Together these experiments demonstrate that FM 4–64 uptake is a MYOA-dependent process that also requires F-actin. We predicted that the S371E mutation resulted in a constitutively active myosin, and therefore the phenotype would be dominant. We tested this hypothesis by constructing a diploid between an S371E mutant and a control strain, FGSC 122 (Fungal Genetics Stock Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS). Diploids heterozygous for the wild type and S371E MYOA proteins displayed the same grainy appearance of the cytoplasm characteristic of the S371E myoA mutant strains when examined by DIC microscopy (data not shown). Thus, constitutive activation of MYOA function by mutation of serine 371 to glutamic acid leads to a dominant activation of endocytosis. The growth characteristics of strains identified as expressing only the S371A or S371E mutant forms of MYOA were examined under a variety of conditions. The S371A and S371E mutations had no discernible effects on the growth of the fungus on normal solid media. In contrast to the apparently normal growth observed for these strains on standard solid media, we noticed that the mutant strains grew less well in submerged liquid cultures than did the control strains. Both the S371E and S371A mutant strains took longer to germinate, as measured by the timing of germtube emergence. At 5 h of growth, approximately 20% of the control spores and less than 2% of the mutant spores had germinated. Similarly, both mutants showed delays in sending out a second germtube from the conidium and in hyphal branching when compared with control strains. Though the mutants grew more slowly than control strains they were morphologically normal and were able to reach the same hyphal mass in culture given a sufficient growth period. We also noted that both the S371A and S371E mutant strains appeared to conidiate less well on solid medium containing high concentrations of potassium chloride. We quantified the effect of higher potassium chloride on conidiation in the S371A and S371E strains by determining the number of conidia produced by each of the mutant strains and a control wild type transformant on medium with increasing concentrations of potassium chloride (Fig. 6). The S371E mutant displayed the most dramatic response to the presence of increasing concentrations of potassium chloride in the medium. Conidiation in the S371E mutant strain was 70% of that observed for the control on 0.3 m potassium chloride. Conidiation in this mutant strain remained at 50–70% of the control strain at potassium chloride concentrations up to 1.2 m. Similarly, the S371A mutant strain showed reduced levels of conidiation but not until the concentration of potassium chloride reached 0.9 mor higher. The effect of potassium chloride on conidiation was not simply the result of increased osmolarity of the medium because a similar effect on conidiation was not seen when sucrose was substituted for potassium. We conclude from this that efficient conidial development in high medium requires that the activity of MYOA be precisely regulated. Previously, we showed that protein secretion was reduced in the absence of MYOA function (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For this reason we looked at the secretion of invertase and acid and alkaline phosphatases. The secretion of all three enzymes was not significantly different from that of control strains when normalized for cell mass. Thus, the S371A and S371E mutations do not have a measurable effect on protein secretion (data not shown). The experiments are the first to investigate fungal class I myosin function in vivo. We have shown that the phosphorylation site for a PAK, serine 371 of the MYOA protein, plays a central role in regulating class I myosin activity in vivo. Mutation of serine 371 to glutamic acid leads to constitutive activation of endocytosis in A. nidulans. Using both light and electron microscopy, we showed that plasma membrane is internalized more rapidly and to a greater degree in the S371E mutant strains. We also showed that membrane internalization in the S371E and control strains requires the presence of filamentous actin, as would be predicted if MYOA was functioning as the motor for membrane internalization. We previously reported that, in A. nidulans, the class I myosin, MYOA, functioned in polarized hyphal growth and protein secretion (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The studies we report here suggest a role for class I myosin in endocytosis. We attribute the differences observed in our previous studies and those in budding yeast (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) to the kinds of mutations used in the various studies. Our earlier studies which suggested that MYOA functions in polarized cell growth and secretion used a conditional null mutant strain (2McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas our current studies used a point mutation that would not be expected to grossly interfere with MYOA function. Like our present studies, the studies in yeast were conducted with a point mutation that confers heat-sensitive growth (3Geli M.I. Riezman H. Science. 1996; 272: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We would suggest that the diverse results obtained are the consequence of the kind of mutation used to conduct the studies. Our previous studies were conducted with a conditional null mutation inmyoA, whereas our current studies use point mutants. Thus, the complete absence of a MYOA polypeptide has a more dramatic phenotype than that observed for the point mutants. We propose that, in the absence of MYOA polypeptide, cell polarity cannot be established and that this is necessary for efficient growth and protein secretion. In contrast, if a MYOA polypeptide is made, even if it is somewhat defective as in this study, the establishment of cell polarity is not impaired and protein secretion is normal. So why is the S371A mutant viable if one requires activation of MYOA by phosphorylation by a PAK? One possibility is that the S371A mutation is not inactivating and that basal activity is sufficient to support growth of the fungus. Alternatively, MYOA motor function is not the essential activity and there are other transport systems that overlap those of MYOA in endocytosis. Thus MYOA has two functions, it is a motor protein functioning in endocytosis, a nonessential activity of the myosin, and it is an actin-binding protein that is required for polarized hyphal growth and protein secretion. In yeast, many mutations that alter the actin cytoskeleton have effects on bud site selection and the directed transport of chitin to the growing cell wall, invertase secretion, endocytosis, and mitochondrial distribution (4Goodson H.V.

The current studies are the first to establish that the PAK phosphorylation site can play a significant role in regulating class I myosin function in vivo. It further demonstrates that activation of class I myosin leads to increased endocytic activity. Since small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family activate PAKs and activated forms of these small GTP-binding proteins have dramatic effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, it is interesting to speculate that at least some of the changes are mediated through activation of unconventional myosins. One inherent problem with this hypothesis is that class I myosins of vertebrates lack the conserved serine or threonine residue at the site of phosphorylation. Instead, they have a charged amino acid that would closely mimic the S371E mutant we have used in this study (26Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). This makes it unlikely that vertebrate class I myosins are regulated by a p21-activated kinase. A more likely target for regulation by a PAK is the class VI unconventional myosin family. The class VI myosins have the conserved serine or threonine at the PAK phosphorylation site and thus could have their activity regulated by phosphorylation (Fig. 1). We know of no current studies that demonstrate that a class VI myosin family member is the substrate for a PAK. It would be interesting to see what consequences transfection of a class VI myosin that has its conserved serine or threonine residue mutated to a charged amino acid is on the actin cytoskeleton of a vertebrate cell in culture.

The lectins (29–31 kDa) were extracted from the worms without the use of detergent and purified by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-agarose. On the basis of the partial primary structures of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris 29-kDa lectin (EW29), degenerate primers were synthesized for use in the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. An amplified 155-base pair fragment was used to screen a cDNA library. Four types of full-length clones were obtained, all of which encoded 260 amino acids, but which were found to differ at 29 nucleotide positions. Since three of them resulted in non-silent substitutions, EW29 mRNA was considered to be a mixture of at least three distinct polynucleotides encoding the following proteins: Ala44-Gln197-Ile213 (clone 5), Gly44-Gln197-Val213 (clone 7), and Ala44-His197-Ile213 (clones 8 and 9; different at the nucleotide level, but encoding an identical polypeptide). Genomic polymerase chain reaction using DNA from a single worm revealed that the single worm already had four sets of cDNAs. The EW29 protein showed two features. First, the lectin was composed of two homologous domains (14,500 Da) showing 27% identity with each other. When each of the domains was separately expressed inEscherichia coli, the C-terminal domain was found to bind to asialofetuin-agarose as strongly as the whole protein, whereas the N-terminal domain did not bind and only retardation was observed. EW29 was found to exist as a monomer under non-denaturing conditions. It had significant hemagglutinating activity, which was inhibited by a wide range of galactose-containing saccharides. Second, EW29 contained multiple short conserved motifs, “Gly-X-X-X-Gln-X-Trp.” Similar motifs have been found in many carbohydrate-recognizing proteins from an extensive variety of organisms, e.g. plant lectin ricin B-chain and Clostridium botulinum 33-kDa hemagglutinin. Therefore, these carbohydrate-recognition proteins appear to form a protein superfamily. Novel type lectins were found in the phylum Annelida, i.e. in the earthworm, tubifex, leech, and lugworm.

Therefore, these carbohydrate-recognition proteins appear to form a protein superfamily. Galactose-binding proteins (lectins) represent a distinguished group among lectins because statistics have shown that more than 60% of the lectins reported thus far are galactose-specific (1Doyle R.J. Doyle R.J. Slifkin M. Lectin-Microorganism Interactions. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 1-65Google Scholar). A possible explanation for such a preference is that galactose was selected as an important “recognition” saccharide especially in higher organisms. In fact, galactose is used more frequently in higher organisms like mammals, whereas glucose and mannose are recognized by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. From a glycochemical viewpoint, galactose has a nature inherently distinct from that of glucose, mannose, or fructose. The latter three monosaccharides are related by “Lobry de Bruyn-Alberta van Ekenstein transformation” (2Speck Jr., J.G. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1958; 13: 63-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is well established that in N-linked oligosacharide biosynthesis galactose is incorporated at later stages after removal of glucosyl and mannosyl residues from the common precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (3Moremane K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4Trimble R.B. Verostek M.F. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1995; 7: 1-30Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These observations led one of the authors to present a hypothesis on the origin of elementary hexoses that galactose is a “latecomer” saccharide relative to glucose and mannose (5Hirabayashi J. Q. Rev. Biol. 1996; 71: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Galactose is exposed at outermost spaces of cells unless it is masked by sialic acids, so that it is easily recognized by various communication molecules by homophilic carbohydrate-carbohydrate (6Hakomori S. Histochem. J. 1992; 24: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or heterophilic carbohydrate-protein interactions (7Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Among galactose-specific lectins, galectins are unique in that all of the members belonging to this family are galactose-specific (8Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hirabayashi J. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9Google Scholar). In general, they are soluble and require no metal ion for their activity. Galectins bind most preferentially to lactosamine-containing saccharides of both glycoproteins and glycolipids. Although galectins had long been believed to occur in vertebrates only, they proved to be distributed in much lower organisms as well (10Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Klion A.D. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem.

Although the biological roles of galectins are not fully understood, they are supposed to play multiple roles basic to multicellular organisms, such as in development, differentiation, tumorigenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, etc. In this regard, if galectins are essential for these biological processes, they would be expected to exist in all animal species. However, there have been only few reports of galectins other than in two animal phyla representing deuterostomes and protostomes, i.e. Vertebrata and Nematoda, respectively. On the other hand, if this is not the case, a possibility emerges that some other galactose-binding lectins compensate for the absence of galectins in such animal phyla. We have undertaken screening of galectin-like proteins from the phylum Annelida, by employing the same purification strategy as that for galectins, i.e. lactose-specific extraction in the absence of detergent and metal ion, and affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-agarose. As a result, 29–31-kDa lectins were purified from four annelids as follows: earthworm, tubifex (both belonging to the class Oligochaeta), lugworm (Polychaeta), and leech (Hirudinea). These proteins immunologically cross-reacted with one another and had similar biochemical properties as galectins with respect to specificity, solubility, and metal independence. Detailed structural analysis including cDNA cloning was carried out for 29-kDa lectin from the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris. As a result, the earthworm 29-kDa lectin (designated hereafter EW29) 1The abbreviations used are: EW29, earthworm 29-kDa lectin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; bp, base pair; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: EW29, earthworm 29-kDa lectin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; bp, base pair; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. proved to be a “tandem repeat”-type lectin, which consists of two tandemly repeated homologous domains (14.5 kDa). Contrary to our expectation, it showed no sequence homology to the known galectins. However, it showed resemblance to some carbohydrate-relating proteins such as ricin B-chain, C. botulinum hemagglutinin, etc. It also contained conserved multiple repeats of short motifs. Earthworms (Allolobophora japonica andL. terrestris), tubifex (Tubifex hattai), and lugworm (Neanthes japonica) were purchased from local fishing shops. Leeches (Glossiphonia complanata) were harvested from shallow irrigation water in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. The worms were rinsed with cold PBS, weighed, and processed immediately for lectin purification. Lectins were extracted from worms by essentially the same procedure previously described for galectins (16Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 938-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Hirabayashi J. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); briefly, worms were disrupted by homogenization in a Polytron (Kinematica) with 5 volumes of cold EDTA-MEPBS (4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl). After the bulk of soluble proteins had been removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 4 °C, 25 min), the lectins were specifically extracted from the precipitate (ppt-1) with EDTA-MEPBS containing 20 mm lactose by shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation as above, the obtained extract (sup-2) was extensively dialyzed to remove lactose and then applied to a column of asialofetuin-agarose (bed volume, 10 ml) prepared according to De Waardet al. (18de Waard A. Hickman S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7581-7587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing of the column with EDTA-MEPBS (400 ml), bound protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 20 mm lactose. Protein concentration was determined by use of the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent. Protein-containing fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (14%) electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions, unless otherwise stated. Protein was visualized with a Wako Silver Stain Kit. The main component (29 kDa) of the affinity purified lectin fraction from earthworms (EW29) was further purified by high performance gel-permeation chromatography on a TSK-G2000SWXL column (7.5 × 300 mm). The column was equilibrated and eluted with EDTA-PBS both in the presence and absence of 20 mm lactose at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. For the subsequent hemagglutination assay, lactose was removed by extensive dialysis against EDTA-PBS. Basically, the conventional assay system described by Nowak et al. (19Nowak T.P. Haywood P.L. Barondes S.H. Bichem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 650-657Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was used; briefly, 25 μl of serially diluted samples was mixed in each well of a 96-well microtiter V plate with 25 μl of EDTA-PBS, 25 μl of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in saline, and 25 μl of trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. After the plate had stood at room temperature for 1 h, “dot” (no agglutination) or “mat” (agglutination) formation was judged. For assessment of the inhibitory effect of various mono- and oligosaccharides, 25 μl of maximally diluted lectin solution that gave mat formation and 25 μl of serially diluted inhibitor saccharides were used in place of serially diluted samples and EDTA-PBS, respectively. Minimum concentrations that gave negative dot formation under the above conditions were defined as I50. The effect of various saccharides on lectin extraction was investigated as described previously (12Hirabayashi J. Ubukata T. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2497-2505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); earthworm lectin was extracted from small portions of ppt-1 (equivalent to 1-g wet weight of the worm) in the presence of a 0.1 m concentration of various sugars. After centrifugation, the supernatant solutions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane. The lectin was stained by a conventional double antibody method using anti-tubifex lectin antiserum (described below) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo). Both antisera were used at a 1,000-fold dilution. For peroxidase detection, POD Immunostain Set or High Sensitive Immunoblotting Kit (both from Wako Chemicals, Tokyo) was used. Antisera were raised in rabbits against either affinity purified tubifex lectin or affinity and gel filtration-purified EW29 by injecting the animals several times at 10–14-day intervals with 0.1–0.2 mg of lectin emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. Titer of the produced antisera was evaluated by both dot and Western blotting analyses. The antisera were stored at 4 °C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3. Affinity purified lectins from earthworm, tubifex, and leech were further purified by reversed phase chromatography on a TSK TMS250 column (4.6 × 75 mm). Protein was eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile (20–60%, v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The separated lectin fractions were lyophilized, dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and digested withAchromobacter protease I (Wako Chemicals, Tokyo). Generated peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography on a TSK-ODS-80TM column (7.5 × 250 mm) and were analyzed by a protein sequencer (Applied 477A) as described (17Hirabayashi J. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The peptides were designated “Lys”-1, -2, -3 and so on, in the order of elution. In addition, in the case of earthworm 29-kDa lectin, reduction andS-carboxymethylation was also performed prior to the protease digestion. Thus derived peptides were prefixed “Cm-Lys.” Genomic DNA was prepared from two earthworm species, A. japonica andL. terrestris, by a conventional procedure (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A few worms were used for the preparation from A. japonica, and a single worm was used for that from L. terrestris to assess the observed gene polymorphism (described below). A probe DNA was prepared by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For amplification of a part of earthworm lectin gene, four sets of convergent oligonucleotide primers were synthesized based on the determined peptide sequences (Lys-4, Lys-7, Lys-8, and Lys-10), designated as Lys-4F/4R, Lys-7F/7R, Lys-8F/8R, and Lys-10F/10R (see Table IV for detail). PCR was performed by use of all combinations of the above forward (F) and reverse (R) primers and a Takara LA-PCR Kit (94 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 1 min, 72 °C, 3 min for 35 cycles, then 72 °C, 10 min). Genomic DNA prepared from the earthworm A. japonica was used as a template. The amplified DNA (155 bp) obtained with primers Lys-4F and Lys-7R was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen) on the basis of TA-cloning strategy according to the manufacturer's instruction, and the nucleotide sequence was confirmed with an Applied 373S DNA sequencer.Table ISummary of purification yields of galactose-specific lectins from four annelid speciesWorm (class)Starting material, wct weightPurified on ASF-agarose1-aASF-agarose is asialofetuin-agarose.Yieldgmgmg/g wormTubifex (Oligochaeta)270.5821Earthworm (Oligochaeta)301.5050Lugworm (Polychacta)100.1717Leech (Hiruidinia)4.40.17391-a ASF-agarose is asialofetuin-agarose.

For cloning of full-length cDNAs, a λZAP cDNA library (kindly provided by Dr. Giebing, Düsseldorf, Germany) was screened with the above 155-bp PCR fragment labeled with [α32P]dCTP by use of an Amersham Megaprime Kit. A standard plaque hybridization was performed for screening 3 × 105 phages as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Eight positive phages were obtained and converted into plasmid pBluescript (Stratagene) by an automatic in vivo excision system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids were cut withEcoRI and XhoI to confirm the insert size and subjected to sequence analysis using an Applied 373S sequencer. Expression plasmids for recombinant EW29 protein (Wh), N-terminal domain (Nh; meaning N-half), and C-terminal domain (Ch) were constructed by a PCR procedure; for the production of Wh, a pair of oligonucleotide primers were designed, i.e. G ATG GCT GGA AGG CCT TTT CTG (Met1-Ala-Gly-Arg-Pro-Phe-Leu; designated Wh-F; see Table IV) and CGAGTGGAGT TTA CTC GGA TTC G (antisense, Glu258-Ser-Glu-Ter; Wh-R), and a full-length fragment (794-bp) encoding 260 amino acids was amplified with a full-length plasmid (clone 5) used as a template. The derived fragment was cloned into pCRII in frame with β-galactosidase α-peptide, and the derived plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli TOP10F′ (Invitrogen). Positive clones were selected by colony immunoblot analysis using specific antiserum against EW29 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (21Hirabayashi J. Sakakura Y. Kasai K. Gabius H.-J. Lectins and Glycobiology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 474-481Crossref Google Scholar). The cloned E. coli was proliferated to full growth in 1 liter of LB medium in the presence of antibiotics at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was induced by adding isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside to give a final concentration of 0.2 mm and incubating the culture for 2 h at the same temperature. The cells were collected and lysed by sonication, and recombinant protein was adsorbed to asialofetuin-agarose, as described previously (10Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For construction of plasmids for expression of individual domains (Nh and Ch), pairs of oligonucleotide primers for an interdomain region were designed, i.e. C ATG AAG CCG AAG TTC TTC TAC ATC (Met129-Lys-Pro-Lys-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Ile; designated Ch-F; underline denotes introduced mutations) andTTA GAA GAA CTT CGG CTT CAA GTG (antisense, His128-Leu-Lys-Pro-Lys-Phe-Phe-Ter; Nh-R). For production of Nh and Ch, primer sets Wh-F/Nh-R and Ch-F/Wh-R were used, respectively. All other procedures were the same as those employed for Wh. In order to assess a cause for the polymorphism found in the earthworm lectin cDNAs (described under “Results”), genomic DNA was prepared from a single worm, and genomic PCR was performed with primers Wh-F and Wh-R to amplify a full-length region. After cloning of the derived fragments (0.8 kilobase pairs) into pCRII and transformation of E. coliTOP10F′, 9 independent genomic clones were selected and their nucleotide sequences were compared with one another and to those derived from the cDNA cloning. Based on the concept that galectins are bound to insoluble glycoconjugates but are solubilized with a competing sugar, lactose, we applied the same procedure to purify annelid lectins as employed for galectins (10Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A typical result of affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-agarose is shown for earthworm lectin in Fig.1 A, and the results of SDS-PAGE for all four annelid speceis, i.e. earthworm, tubifex, leech and lugworm, are shown in Fig. 1 B. Major molecular species observed after lactose elution from the column were the following: 29 kDa (earthworm), 31 kDa (tubifex), 30 kDa (leech), and 30 kDa (lugworm). The observed sizes were also similar to those reported for either mammalian chimera-type (29–35 kDa) (22Hughes R.C. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or nematode tandem repeat-type galectins (32 kDa; see Refs. 10Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1997; 86: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since these lectins were obtained in the absence of metal ion, they were considered not to be C-type lectins. The fact that no detergent was necessary for the extraction also excluded the possibility that the annelid lectins are membrane-bound proteins. The yields of purified lectins from the four annelid species are summarized in Table I. Beside major molecular species (29–31 kDa), earthworm, tubifex, and leech preparations also showed the presence of multiple smaller fragments of 15–17 kDa (Fig. 1 B). However, the following observations suggest that these fragments were derived by proteolysis of the 29–31-kDa species. (i) When purification of earthworm lectin was processed as rapidly as possible (e.g. within 2 days) and special care was taken for the maintenance of the homogenate at a low temperature, the proportion of the 16-kDa species in Fig.1 B was considerably decreased (data not shown). (ii) Among the four species of annelids, the amount of smaller fragments was highest in the most fragile worm, tubifex (see Fig. 1 B). (iii) The sizes of smaller fragments were almost half of those of the main species (29–31 kDa). To confirm the above possibility, we isolated the 16-kDa earthworm protein by reversed phase chromatography and compared its peptide sequences with those of EW29. Since both molecular species gave identical peptide sequences (data not shown), at least some of the smaller fragments were considered to be degradation products of the 29–31-kDa proteins, probably due to cleavage at the connecting region between tandemly repeated domains (described below). In order to elucidate the structural relationship between the annelid lectins, we first attempted Western blotting analysis by using anti-tubifex lectin antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2, all of the lectins purified from the other annelids were also positive, together with the smaller fragments described above. The degree of cross-reactivities with leech (Hirudinea) and lugworm (Polychaeta) proteins was relatively weak, probably reflecting phylogenic kinship between tubifex and earthworm (both belonging to the same class, Oligochaeta). When crude lectin extracts (sup-2) were used instead of purified fractions, only high molecular species (29–31 kDa) were observed. This is consistent with the above assumption that smaller fragments were digestion products. For more direct structural comparison, affinity purified lectins from earthworm, tubifex, and leech were further purified by reversed phase chromatography on a TSK-TMS250 (data not shown) and digested with lysine-specific Achromobacter protease I. The derived peptides were separated on a TSK ODS-80TM column and were analyzed by a protein sequencer. For earthworm lectin, we also carried out reduction and S-carboxymethylation to identify cysteine residues. The results of peptide analyses, summarized in TableII, strongly suggest that these annelid lectins are structurally related. In particular, most of the lectins had multiple similar sequences represented by “Gly-X-X-X-Gln-X-Trp.” Moreover, some of the sequences containing this short motif showed highest similarity; in case of earthworm lectin, these includedHis-Gly-Gln-Asp-Ala-Gln-Gln-Trp(Lys-4),His-Gly-Gly-Thr-Asn-Gln-Gln-Trp(Lys-7), and Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro-Asn-Gln-Ala-Trp(Lys-10; conserved residues underlined). This indicates that the annelid lectin contained a significant number of repeats.Table IISummary of peptide sequences derived by lysylendopeptidase digestion of annelid lectinsPeptideSequenceCommentEarthwormLys1SNTAPGAKLys22-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.D86VVHHRNDK(Mix)S138ELNGKLys3ENQRWRKLys4P71AEHG QDAQQWKUsed as a PCR primerLys5V144LDIEGQNPAPGSKLys62-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.H196QIETQPFDPNNPK(Mix)MAPHSGDxHSQWRFDGNKLys7Y116HGGTNQQWETVHLKUsed as a PCR primerLys8INHFx MDIENGQLSLRPFQHGUsed as a PCR primerLys9hsGIIALSANASGTPVVvSKLys10YQFNGGPNQAWTFEFVGGQAQPGYPSVUsed as a PCR primerCm-Lys1WVLNGHNDCm-Lys2PACHETDCm-Lys32-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.V144LDIEGQNPAPG=Lys5(Mix)E237AGAHIcawkCm-Lys42-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.V97FD1cRGSk(Mix)E196QIETQPFDPNNpk=Lys6Cm-Lys5D106VGAQVCm-Lys6Y116IIGGYNQQ=Lys7Cm-Lys7GVPNQTubifexLys1wKLys2xxxDKxGENREDGALys3IEYVwLxsYIAFLys42-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.NGANNQVFYVV(Mix)ANGDGEQLys5VQRREFYMTSELNGqaLys6GSANQHYIIIEYLys7NVHLQPFNGGATQQwVVDGTAKLys8NQLWYQDQQGFIRSALTDFALDGQs)LeechLys1MQPYNGNAKLys2HQWRIEGNKLys3REFMIKLys42-aThese fractions contained a mixture of two peptides.NQLwYQDQSG LIr(Mix)GxEIxAYtFKLys5NGPNQrxTIVYmtkLys6NQLwYQDQSGLIRSSLNDFVNumbers on the first amino acid residues of most earthworm peptides are the position numbers (initial Met as position 1).

https://openalex.org/W2025763272,"Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is a zinc finger transcription factor required for β-globin gene expression and is implicated as one of the key factors necessary for the fetal to adult switch in globin gene expression. In an effort to identify factors involved in the expression of this important erythroid-specific regulatory protein, we have isolated the mouse EKLF gene and systematically analyzed the promoter region. Initially, a reporter construct with 1150 base pairs of the EKLF 5′-region was introduced into transgenic mice and shown to direct erythroid-specific expression. We continued the expression studies in erythroid cells and have identified a sequence element consisting of two GATA sites flanking an E box motif. The three sites act in concert to elevate the transcriptional activity of the EKLF promoter. Each site is essential for EKLF expression indicating that the three binding sites do not work additively, but rather function as a unit. We further show that GATA-1 binds to the two GATA sites and present evidence for binding of another factor from erythroid cell nuclear extracts to the E box motif. These results are consistent with the formation of a quaternary complex composed of an E box dimer and two GATA-1 proteins binding at a combined GATA-E box-GATA activator element in the distal EKLF promoter.

These results are consistent with the formation of a quaternary complex composed of an E box dimer and two GATA-1 proteins binding at a combined GATA-E box-GATA activator element in the distal EKLF promoter. Over the past few years, several relatively specific erythroid transcription factors have been isolated and their functional activity defined. These transcription factors regulate the expression of globin genes as well as many other erythroid-specific genes (for reviews see Refs. 1Orkin S.H. Curr. Opin. Genet &. Dev. 1996; 6: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and 2Minie M. Clark D. Trainor C. Evans T. Reitman M. Hannon R. Gould H. Felsenfeld G. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1993; 16: 15-20Google Scholar). One of these erythroid-specific factors has been termed erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) 1The abbreviations used are: EKLF, erythroid Krüppel-like factor; TAL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; Lmo, LIM domain only; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: EKLF, erythroid Krüppel-like factor; TAL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; Lmo, LIM domain only; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; kb, kilobase pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction. (3Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). EKLF is a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that recognizes the CACCC motif in the human β-globin promoter. It has been shown that EKLF expression is restricted to the erythroid cell lineage, with initial expression in the yolk sac (4Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and predominant expression occurring later in erythroid development. As a transcription factor, EKLF appears to be specifically involved in adult β-globin gene expression (4Donze D. Townes T.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell.

Mice deficient in this gene exhibit lethal β-thalassemia (7Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This disease is very similar to the human β-thalassemia caused by point mutations in the CACCC sequence lending further support to the importance of the EKLF-CACCC interaction in vitro (9Feng W.C. Southwood C.M. Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1493-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other critical genes involved in hematopoiesis includeGATA-1, Tal1, and Lmo2/rbtn2. While targeted disruption of the mouse EKLF gene results in a failure in adult erythropoiesis, inactivation of any one of these three genes,GATA-1, Tal1, and Lmo2, produces a similar phenotype characterized by a block in hematopoiesis at an earlier yolk sac stage (10Warren A.J. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B.L. Evans M.J. Smith A.J.H. Rabbitts T.H. Cell. 1994; 78: 45-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 11Shivdasani R.A. Mayer E. Orkin S.H.

A. 1995; 92: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is a zinc finger transcription factor, and its expression is generally confined to erythroid cells. GATA-1-binding sites are present in all erythroid-specific genes examined to date (13Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Tal1 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor whose name is derived from its isolation at a common translocation site occurring in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (14Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). The protein is primarily produced in the same hematopoietic cells that also produce GATA-1. As a class B type of bHLH factor, Tal1 does not readily homodimerize but rather interacts with other HLH proteins, principally the E2A proteins, E12 and E47 (15Baer R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 341-347PubMed Google Scholar). These heterodimers are then able to bind DNA. The general consensus site for bHLH complexes is CANNTG and is referred to as an E box. The final erythroid-specific protein of this set, Lmo2, contains a LIM domain believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions (16Boehm T. Foroni L. Kennedy M. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1103-1105PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rabbitts T.H. Boehm T. Nature. 1990; 346: 418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas this particular class of proteins also has a zinc finger motif, no evidence for direct DNA binding has been obtained. The similar failure in erythropoiesis observed with the null mutations in each of these four genes, EKLF, GATA-1, Tal1, andLmo2, suggest some common role or regulatory interplay in hematopoietic development. Several associations and interactions between these proteins have indeed been demonstrated. GATA-1, for example, has been shown to physically associate with both EKLF and the ubiquitous SP1 protein (18Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is also involved in the regulation of EKLF expression through binding to a critical proximal promoter element (19Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent developments concerning the assembly of an erythroid-specific complex of transcription factors are particularly interesting. Lmo2 and Tal1 can be found as a complex in erythroid cells (20Valge-Archer V.E. Osada H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Li J. Baer R. Rabbits T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8617-8621Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was noted that Lmo2 will also assemble with GATA-1, whereas efforts to demonstrate a stable association between GATA-1 and Tal1 were unsuccessful (21Osada H. Grutz G. Axelson H. Forster A. Rabbits T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Evidence for a model in which Lmo2 interacts with both GATA-1 and Tal1 serving as a protein link between these two DNA-binding proteins has now been provided (22Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). One caveat with these experiments, however, is the absence of a target gene for which these proteins, excluding GATA-1, alone or as part of this large complex, have been shown to bind and effect transcriptional activity. In our studies of the regulatory elements and associated binding factors important for temporal and tissue-specific expression of the EKLF gene, we have identified an activator element in the distal promoter region. The element consists of two GATA sites flanking an E box motif. We have shown through mutational analyses that all three sites are required for the functional activity. Such a combined site and the data suggesting the binding of multiple proteins raise interesting issues concerning the mechanisms involved in erythroid-specific gene regulation. The basic constructs −1150EKLFCAT and −124EKLFCAT were prepared using PCR. Primers 5′-EKLFKpn, GCTTTCTCGAGGCCTGACTAGGTACC, and EKLFH3, GGAATTCAAGCTTGGCTGGCTGGTGTCCACC, were used to amplify the −1150-bp region. The EKLFH3 primer and EKLF124Kpn, CCTGGTACCGCACACCATACACATATCG, were utilized to amplify the −124-bp promoter region. For transgenic animal studies, the −1150-bp KpnI-HindIII fragment was ligated 5′ of the lacZ gene containing the SV40 poly(A) addition site. The KpnI-HindIII fragments of −1150EKLF and −124EKLF were ligated 5′ of a CAT reporter in pGEM7Zf (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield −1150EKLFCAT and −124EKLFCAT, respectively. The −1150EKLFCAT construct was then digested withPstI followed by religation creating Δ−928/−575EKLFCAT. A KpnI-SacI fragment was eliminated to yield −952EKLFCAT. −1150EKLFCAT was cut in the upstream polylinker at theSphI site and at KpnI, and a 436-bp fragment was cloned in to yield −1596EKLFCAT. This construct was subsequently cut with AvrII and SphI to produce −1385EKLFCAT. To create mutations in the −1150 construct, a double-stranded oligomer, SpMyb, spanning −647 to −567 and containing a 5′ApaI overhang adjacent to an XbaI site and 3′NcoI overhang, was ligated to the ApaI andNcoI sites of −1150EKLFCAT resulting in a −1150EKLFCAT without the GATA-E box-GATA site. This construct was restricted with ApaI and XbaI and oligomers GEG, GMEG, GEGM, GEMG, and GMEMGM (see Fig. 5) were inserted to make the −1150EKLFCAT mutants. To produce the −60GATA mutation primers H114D, CCTATGCATCTTTTGCTAAACAGCTCAG, and the −60GATAB mutation oligomer, GTCTTCCTCTAGAAGCACCCAGGC, were used to amplify −810 to −60 mutating the −60 GATA site. −60GATAT, GCCTGGGTGCTTCTAGAGGAAGAC, and EKLFH3 primers amplified the −60 to +62 region with the complementary GATA mutation. These two −60 GATA mutations were cut and ligated at the newly createdXbaI site, then cut 5′ with Tth111I and 3′ withHindIII and ligated into the Tth111I-HindIII sites of −1150EKLFCAT resulting in the −1150(−60GATAM)EKLFCAT. Additions to the −124 EKLFCAT construct included isolated fragments, PCR products, and double-stranded oligomers.PstI-HinfI (−928 to −814) andHinfI-PstI (−814 to −575) fragments were blunt end-ligated 5′ of −124EKLFCAT at the KpnI site yielding (114)-124EKLFCAT and (239)-124EKLFCAT, respectively. A fragment from −810 to −692 was amplified using primers 5′-239K, CTGGTACCTTTTGCTAAACAGCTCAG, and 5′-239KA, CTGGTACCGGGCCCAGAACAACCATGG and was ligated to the 5′ KpnI site of −124EKLFCAT to make (5′-239)−124EKLFCAT. Similarly, the −696 to 574 region was amplified with primers 3′-239KA, CTGGTACCGGGCCCCTACCTGATAG, and 3′-239KB, CTGGTACCAGATCTGCAGTTCTTACTCTCCC and also ligated to the 5′KpnI site of −124EKLFCAT to give (3′-239)-124EKLFCAT. This construct has a 5′ ApaI site and a 3′ BglII site designed into the primers. These sites were cut, and the double-stranded oligomers GEG, GMEG, GEGM, GEMG, and GMEMGM, and Sp (see Fig. 7) were ligated. All constructs were produced in or transferred to a modified pBKCMV vector (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) which had been cut with NsiI and NheI blunted and self-ligated to eliminate the cytomegalovirus promoter. The constructs were linearized at the MluI site for use in stable transfections. Genomic clones were sequenced with a model 377 DNA Sequenator and Taq Dye Deoxy sequencing protocol (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The nucleotide sequence of all subclones was also confirmed in a similar manner. Primers for this sequence analysis and other applications in this study were produced with a model 394 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). A strain 129 mouse genomic library was obtained (23Askew G.R. Doetschman T. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) that had been constructed using Lambda DASH vector (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The library was then screened with a reverse transcriptase-PCR product from nucleotides 852 to 1234 of the EKLF cDNA using MEL BB88 cell RNA as a template. Filters were washed with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Sixty-seven positive clones were selected of which 29 contained EKLF sequence. Transgenic mice were generated in strain FVB/N by injection of purified (Qiagen, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA) −1150EKLFβ-gal fragment into the male pronucleus (24Hagen B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). The putative transgenic animals were screened by PCR. Southern blot analysis was also performed with genomic DNA from F1 animals of each line to determine the transgene copy number and to ensure the transgene was intact and free of rearrangements. Tissue extracts from adult transgenic animals were prepared by homogenizing with a Brinkman Polytron model PT3000 (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) followed by three cycles of freezing on dry ice and thawing in a 37 °C water bath. β-Galactosidase assays were then carried out as described previously (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). For the in situ analysis, embryos were isolated at day 10.5 post-coitus, and whole-mount staining was performed as described (26McBurney M.W. Staines M.A. Boekelheide K. Parry D. Jardine K. Pickavance L. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 278-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) BB88 cells were transfected using a Bio-Rad GenePulser (Bio-Rad) set at 350 V and 960 microfarads. Approximately 5 × 107cells per 800 μl of serum-free RPMI media were used per transfection with a total of 45 μg of total DNA. In transient assays, this 45 μg was composed of 30 μg of the CAT reporter plasmid and 15 μg of an SV40-luciferase control plasmid (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Stable transfections were split into three pools and selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1200 μg/ml for 4 days then maintained on 400 μg/ml. CAT assays from stables were performed with 25 μg of protein for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (27Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Transient CAT assays utilized the entire transfection for 3 h at 37 °C and were normalized with luciferase activity. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). All EMSAs were carried out in a total volume of 30 μl containing 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2 × 105 cpm end-labeled probe, and 10 μg of nuclear extract. The GATA-1 binding was carried out under ionic conditions described by Lam and Bresnick (29Lam L.T. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32421-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the E box binding was performed under ionic conditions described by Prasad et al. (30Prasad K.S.S. Jordan J.E. Koury M.J. Bondurant M.C. Brandt S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11603-11611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at room temperature by incubating 15 min without probe and 15 min after the addition of the probe. The supershifts were carried out under the conditions described above for GATA-1 binding with 0.1 μg of GATA-1 rat monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) added at the time of the probe addition. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 120 V for 3–4 h. The EKLF genomic sequence diagrammed in Fig. 1 has been deposited in GenBankTM. The mouse EKLF gene was isolated from a genomic phage library using a fragment from the zinc finger region as a hybridization probe. Approximately 5.6 kb of genomic DNA was subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis; this includes 1.6 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, the 3.3-kb transcription unit, and approximately 0.7 kb of 3′-flanking region. A schematic diagram of the EKLF genomic organization is shown in Fig. 1,panel A. The gene consists of 3 exons, and a summary of the important structural features of the EKLF gene, along with the intron/exon boundary sequences, is included in panel B of Fig. 1. For the initial characterization of the promoter activity, we sought to demonstrate erythroid-specific expression of a heterologous reporter gene driven by EKLF promoter sequences. A construct was prepared using 1150 bp 5′ of the EKLF transcription start site attached to a β-galactosidase gene. Lines of transgenic mice were established expressing this construct. Tissues, including blood, brain, lung, kidney, spleen, and testis, were collected from adult animals and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Expression of the reporter gene was only detected in the blood samples from these mice. Bone marrow is a more active hematopoietic organ in mice (31Foster H.L. Small J.D. Fox J.G. The Mouse in Biomedical Research. 3. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando1983: 299-301Google Scholar) compared with the spleen, accounting for the lack of expression in young adult spleen. The 1150-bp region of the mouse EKLF promoter is thus sufficient to confer erythroid tissue-specific expression to a heterologous gene. Moreover, we mated these F1 transgenic mice to produce timed pregnancies and collected embryos at 11.5 days of gestation. The embryos were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase activity. Representative non-transgenic and transgenic embryos and yolk sac sections are shown in Fig. 2. β-Galactosidase activity is prominent throughout the embryonic circulation and in the fetal liver. Although we did observe background staining of yolk sac tissue in the non-transgenic animals, the circulating blood is clearly red in these yolk sacs andblue in the yolk sacs from transgenic embryos. Thus the 1150-bp EKLF promoter directs both tissue and developmentally specific expression of the reporter gene. To investigate further the regulatory elements in the EKLF promoter important for erythroid-specific expression, varying lengths of the 5′-flanking sequence have been attached to a CAT reporter gene. These constructs were introduced into MEL BB88 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, an approximately 5-fold increase in CAT activity is observed with the −1150 construct compared with our minimal promoter. We chose −124 as our basal element since Crossley et al. (19Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had previously shown the presence of a critical GATA site in this proximal promoter region and indicated that this was the principal cis element within 353 bp of the transcription start site. The fold enhancement we are reporting therefore corresponds to elevated expression compared with this 124-bp promoter with an active GATA-binding site. Comparison of the −1150 construct containing this newly described distal enhancer activity with a −77 EKLF promoter reported previously (19Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the GATA site has been mutated results in an approximately 80-fold enhancement over this background value. We will return to a direct comparison with this proximal GATA site in a later experiment. In addition, a non-erythroid cell line, mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, was also transfected with this series of EKLF-CAT constructs as a control to distinguish basal versus erythroid-specific expression. No expression has been observed with any EKLF-CAT construct in this non-erythroid cell line, indicating the tissue specificity evident in the transgenic mouse studies was recapitulated in our in vitro tissue culture system. Importantly, an internal 353-bp deletion in the −1150 construct severely compromises expression from the EKLF promoter. The region missing in the Δ−928/−575 construct corresponds to a 353-bpPstI fragment. The nucleotide sequence for this region is shown in Fig. 4, panel A. We performed a computer search of this region against a data base of transcription factor consensus binding sites and discovered three Sp1 sites, two GATA sites, an E box motif, a c-myb site, and an EKLF consensus site. In order to test the functional significance of these putative transcription factor binding sites, we prepared a series of CAT constructs with subfragments from this region attached to our basal −124 EKLF promoter. The designation of these clones is outlined in Fig. 4, panel B. This assay was developed as a complement to the loss-of-function analysis carried out with the −1150 internalPstI deletion. An up-regulation of activity from the EKLF −124 promoter upon inclusion of these sequences would indicate that the activator function can be added back to this basal promoter. As shown in Fig. 4, panel C, the presence of the 239-bp fragment results in a 9-fold increase in CAT activity, whereas the 114-bp fragment has no effect. This indicates that the 239-bp fragment accounts for all the activity in the element defined by deletion analysis and that this element can be moved relative to the transcription start site and still maintain its functional activity. The 239-bp fragment was subsequently further divided at theApaI site and analyzed in a similar manner. The majority of the enhancer activity resides in the 3′-half of this fragment (Fig. 4,panel C). We noted with interest the clustering of the GATA and E box motifs and considered that alone or in combination these elements may be responsible for the erythroid-specific activation of the EKLF-CAT constructs. Double-stranded oligonucleotides flanked by restriction enzyme sites to allow easy insertion 5′ of the −124 EKLF minimal promoter were therefore synthesized. Initially, two sequences, designated GEG and Sp and shown in Fig.5, panel A, were tested. GEG is a 49-bp oligomer and includes the GATA-E box-GATA configuration of sites. The Sp oligomer corresponds to the next 37 nucleotides of sequence and includes the Sp1 consensus site. As illustrated in Fig.5 , panel B, the GEG oligomer completely replicated the 5–8-fold enhancement observed with the 3′-239 control construct, whereas the Sp oligomer had no effect. Oligomers with point mutations in each of the GATA sites alone or in combination were subsequently synthesized. Additionally, double-stranded oligomers were prepared in which the core E box sequence was replaced with a restriction enzyme site. Finally, an oligomer was constructed with all three sites disrupted. Mutation of either GATA site or the E box abrogated the enhancer activity of this element. Moreover, we did not observe an additive effect whereby mutation of the GATA sites might have eliminated half the activity of this distal element, and alteration of all three sites would drop the activity to base line. Rather, disruption of either of the GATA sites or the E box was sufficient to abolish the activator effect. Multiple binding sites, including the E box motif and at least one of the GATA sites, are therefore necessary for the activity of this erythroid-specific enhancer element which appears to function as a unit. These experiments demonstrated that the activator could be removed from its normal position and still elevate expression from our basal EKLF promoter and that both a GATA and an E box site are important for this enhancer activity. It is possible, however, that placing this 49-bp element in the proximal promoter region allowed expression of an activity that was normally regulated by surrounding sequences, and thus our constructs did not accurately represent the impact of this element in the typical expression from the EKLF promoter. The GATA point mutations and E box replacement mutation were therefore moved into the −1150 EKLF CAT construct to test the effect of these small alterations in the wild-type context. In this series of experiments, the effect of mutating each site individually and in combination was examined. The analysis of CAT activity from stably transfected MEL cells is summarized in Fig. 6. A mutation in any single site, either the 5′- or 3′-GATA sites (GMEG or GEGM) or the E box motif (GEMG), is sufficient to reduce the EKLF promoter activity to the level observed with the −928 to −575 deletion that originally defined this proximal enhancer. Combinations including alterations in both GATA sites (GMEGM) or all three factor binding sites (GMEMGM) gave levels comparable to a single site mutation. All three sites thus appear to be required for the function of this distal activator. Although the significance of these GATA-binding sites in the regulation of expression from the EKLF promoter is a novel observation, an additional GATA site in the proximal promoter region has also been shown to be important for EKLF promoter activity, as mentioned previously (19Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the studies addressing this proximal GATA site had been carried out using constructs with only 77 bp of 5′-sequence, we wished to test the contribution of this site in the context of our −1150 EKLF-CAT reporter. A point mutation was therefore made in this GATA site, and the activity of this −1150(−60GM) construct was compared with the single GATA site mutations, −1150(GMEG) and −1150(GEGM). After stable transfection in MEL cells, the normalized CAT activity from cellular extracts is shown in Table I. Clearly, all three GATA sites are critical for expression of the EKLF promoter when considered in the context of this extended 5′-promoter sequence. That is, even in the presence of an intact GATA-E box-GATA distal activator, only minimal transcriptional activity is observed if the proximal GATA site is altered. Similarly, in the framework of the 1150-bp fragment, this proximal site by itself is insufficient to direct expression of the EKLF gene.Table IComparison of GATA site mutationsConstructPercent conversion−1150EKLFCAT38.9 ± 2.0−1150(−60GM)EKLFCAT4.6 ± 1.2−1150(GMEG)EKLFCAT2.5 ± 1.5−1150 (GEGM)EKLFCAT1.6 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab The previous experiments establish the functional importance of the GATA-E box-GATA motif as a regulatory element in the EKLF promoter. The fact that a mutation in any single site eliminated the enhancer effect suggested that several factors could be involved in the formation of a larger protein complex, each potentially contributing to the stability through contact with its DNA-binding site. We have begun investigating the character of this putative complex with electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using a nuclear extract from MEL cells. With the wild-type GEG double-stranded oligomer as a probe, we regularly observe three specific complexes, labeled A, B, and C in panel A of Fig. 7. Occasionally, slower mobility complexes are also detected, but not consistently under the particular buffer and temperature conditions used for this assay. The three major complexes can be specifically competed by the wild-type oligomer (GEG) or by any of the single mutation oligomers as shown in Fig. 7, panel A. The common factor with all these productive competitors is the presence of at least one intact GATA site. Although a single GATA site may"

The zinc-finger transcription factor genes Egr-1,Egr-2, and Egr-3 were identified. Northern blot analyses confirmed that mRNA levels of Egr-1, Egr-2, and Egr-3 increased readily after m1AChR stimulation and that a maximum was attained within 50 min. At that time, Egr-4 mRNA was also detectable. Western blots and electromobility shift assays demonstrated synthesis of EGR-1 and EGR-3, as well as binding to DNA recognition sites in response to m1AChR activation. Activation of m1AChR increased transcription from EGR-dependent promoters, including the acetylcholinesterase gene promoter. Activity-dependent regulation of Egr-1 mRNA expression and EGR-1 protein synthesis was also observed in cells expressing m2, m3, or m4AChR subtypes. Increased EGR-1 synthesis was mimicked by phorbol myristate acetate, but not by forskolin, and receptor-stimulated EGR-1 synthesis was partially inhibited by phorbol myristate acetate down-regulation. Together, our results demonstrate that muscarinic receptor signaling activates the EGR transcription factor family and that PKC may be involved in intracellular signaling. The data suggest that transcription of EGR-dependent target genes, including the AChE gene, can be under the control of extracellular and intracellular signals coupled to muscarinic receptors.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: AChR, acetylcholine receptor; mAChR, muscarinic AChR; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; luc, luciferase; kb, kilobase(s). are members of a superfamily of G protein-coupled cell surface receptors with seven transmembrane domain topology. Five subtypes of mAChRs (m1–m5) can be divided according to their signaling mechanisms: m1, m3, and m5 AChRs preferentially couple to the pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq/G11 proteins that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, whereas m2 and m4 subtypes couple to the Gi/Go proteins that predominantly inhibit adenylyl cyclase (1Bonner T.I.

In brain, mAChRs are involved in such functions as attention, learning, memory, and cognition (3Di Chiara G. Morelli M. Consolo S.

In contrast, m2 and m4 AChRs are predominantly present on axons of the large basal forebrain projection neurons that innervate cholinergic target cells throughout the cortex and the hippocampus. Activation of the postsynaptic m1/m3/m5 AChR family by acetylcholine triggers a large variety of distinct signaling cascades including phospholipase D, adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase A2, the generation of diacylglycerol which activates protein kinase C (PKC) and couples mAChRs to the ERK-MAP-kinase signaling cascade, activation of endoplasmic reticulum IP3 receptors, stimulation of ligand-operated cell-surface Ca2+ channels, and the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels (5Fukuda K.

We show here that the entire family of EGR transcription factors can be under the control of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and their related signaling mechanisms. Human HEK293 cells stably transfected with the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes m1, m2, m3 or m4 were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 500 μg/ml geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For experiments, the cells were subcultured onto tissue culture dishes and grown to an approximate density of 80–90%. 16 h before experiments, growth media were replaced by serum-free DMEM/F-12 without G418. Incubation of cells with test substances were performed by adding concentrated stock solutions of carbachol (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 mm, carbachol together with atropine (10 μm, Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm, Sigma), forskolin (100 μm, Calbiochem), or 8-bromo-cAMP (100 μm, Calbiochem) to the culture media. Identical cells generated in parallel from the same passage were used as unstimulated controls. Media were frozen and were used to ensure effective receptor responses by β-amyloid precursor protein ectodomain release assays (14Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from the cells by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA preparations were subjected to DNaseI digestion (Boehringer Mannheim), in the presence of the RNase inhibitor RNasin (Promega) for 30 min. RNA was extracted with phenol and precipitated in ethanol. Equal amounts of 0.2 μg of RNA each were transcribed to cDNA with ExpandTM Reverse Transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) by using one-base-anchor primers HT11A, HT11G and HT11C according to Liang et al. (43Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R.P. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The obtained cDNAs were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing the corresponding one-base-anchor oligonucleotides along with HAP-1 (TGCCGAAGCTTGATTGCC), HAP-3C (TGCCGAAGCTTTGGTCAC), or HAP-3T (TGCCGAAGCTTTGGTCAT) as random primers with a HindIII restriction site by using PCR conditions described by Zhao et al. (44Zhao S. Ooi S.L. Pardee A.B. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 842-850PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was performed with AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in the presence of [α-35S]dATP (2000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) along with dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PCR products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide urea sequencing gels and dried on Whatman 3MM paper, and x-ray films (DuPont) were exposed for 8–16 h. Differential bands were excised, and the contained cDNA was eluted in water, precipitated with glycogen in ethanol, and dialyzed against 10% glycerol. The obtained preparations were reamplified by 40 high-stringency cycles in 50-μl PCR mixtures containing the corresponding composite primer pairs as described by Zhao et al. (44Zhao S. Ooi S.L. Pardee A.B. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 842-850PubMed Google Scholar). Reamplified cDNAs were purified by agarose gel electrophoreses, gel extraction by using the QIAEX II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and were ligated into pBluescript IIKS+ (Stratagene) by using the HindIII restriction sites. Cloned cDNA fragments were sequenced on an automated ABI377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) by using T3- and T7-derived sequencing primers. 5–20 μg of RNA each were separated by agarose formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membranes (HybondTM-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membrane filters were probed with α[32P]dCTP random primed cDNA probes prepared from Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, and Egr-4 cDNA clones or from PCR products obtained in the differential display. Hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions and were subjected to autoradiography. Equal RNA loading was confirmed by probing the identical blots with a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe. Cells were washed twice with PBS, scraped from the plates in hypotonic buffer, swollen on ice, and lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted and extracted in 200 μl of ice-cold 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of pepstatin and aprotinin. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). 50 μg of nuclear protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST, and probed with polyclonal antisera against either EGR-1, EGR-2, or EGR-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at dilutions of 1:3000. Primary antisera were visualized with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to protein A and by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using x-ray films. A radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two copies of the consensus binding motif for EGR proteins (5′-GATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGAGATC-3′) was prepared with Klenow polymerase and by using α[32P]dCTP. 0.5 ng of the32P-labeled DNA was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 μm ZnCl, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor. In some cases, protein extracts were preincubated with polyclonal antisera against EGR proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA on 4% polyacrylamide gels using 0.5× TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) as running buffer. HEK293 cells stably expressing m1AChR, grown on poly-d-lysine, were transfected at 30–40% density with 4 μg of expression constructs precipitated by calcium phosphate. 24–48 h after transfection, cells were serum deprived and then treated with or without test substances; 19 h following stimulation, luciferase activity was quantitated with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold) (46de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. deLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). Expression constructs pTATA-luc/EGR and pTATA-luc/EGRmut encode an EGR responsive promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene. These plasmids were constructed by inserting one copy of either the EGR binding site 5′-GATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGACTAG-3′ or a mutant EGR binding site 5′- GATCCAGCTAGGGCGAGCTAGGGCGACTAG-3′ into pTATA-luc that includes the luciferase gene under control of the β-globin minimal promoter. pCMV/Krox24 together with either pTATA-luc/EGR or pTATA-luc/EGRmut was used as a positive control for the transfection. Expression construct pAChE-luc (construct A) (37Getman D.K. Mutero A. Inoue K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23511-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) consists of approximately 1.1 kb of DNA sequence upstream of the region similar to the mouse AChE gene exon 1 in addition to exon 1, and 1.5 kb of the putative intronic region between sequences corresponding to exons 1 and 2 in the AChE gene. The 3′ end includes the first 16 bases of exon 2 upstream of the ATG start codon. Cloning and sequence analysis of several clones derived from differential bands generated by the reverse transcription primer HT11G along with the PCR primer HAP1, and by the reverse transcription primer HT11A, along with the PCR primers HAP-3C and HAP-3T, revealed the zinc-finger domain transcription factor genes Egr-1 (48Suggs S.V. Katzowitz J.L. Tsai-Morris C. Sukhatme V.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 184283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Egr-2 (28Joseph L.J. Le Beau M.M. Jamieson G.A. Acharya S. Shows T.B. Rowley J.D. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7164-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), andEgr-3 (30Patwardhan S. Gashler A. Siegel N.R. Chang L.C. Joseph L.J. Shows T.B. Le Beau M.M. Sukhatme V.P. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 917-928PubMed Google Scholar). By using a probe generated from the reamplified differential band corresponding to Egr-1, we identified on Northern blots a message at 3.5 kb that was differentially up-regulated within 10–60 min of m1AChR stimulation. This message was undetectable in RNA preparations obtained from unstimulated cells. To verify that this message corresponded to the zinc-finger transcription factor Egr-1, Northern blot analyses of identical RNA preparations were done with a probe generated from a cDNA fragment of Egr-1. Again, we detected a major transcript at 3.5 kb (Fig.1 A) in the stimulated condition but not in the unstimulated control condition. Within 10 min of stimulation, a weak signal was detectable, and a maximum was attained after 50 min (Fig. 1 B). The time course of m1-induced Egr-1 expression was biphasic, and a second peak was observed after 240 min and after a minimum was reached 100 min after receptor stimulation. Northern blot analyses with probes generated from Egr-2 or Egr-3 cDNAs verified that m1AChR stimulation activated transcription of the Egr-2 and Egr-3 genes as suggested by the differential display (Fig. 2,A and B). Expression levels of Egr-1were the highest, and these of Egr-3 were one order of magnitude higher than those of Egr-2. In addition, a weak signal with an Egr-4-specific probe (32Müller H.J. Skerka C. Bialonski A. Zipfel P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) just above the detection limit showed that Egr-4, also, was up-regulated by m1AChR (Fig. 2 C). Together, these results demonstrate that all four members of the Egr transcription factor gene family are under the control of the m1AChR, with different induction levels. Stimulation of m1AChR with carbachol readily increased the synthesis of EGR-1 protein within 120 min, and protein levels remained high until 180 min after stimulation (Fig.3 A). Receptor-induced EGR-1 synthesis was completely blocked by atropine, indicating a specific and receptor-mediated action of carbachol. EGR-1 synthesis was also stimulated with PMA, a potent activator of PKC, suggesting that PKC may couple m1AChR to EGR-1 synthesis (Fig. 3 A). Down-regulation of PKC by 16 h of PMA pretreatment, however, was associated with only a partial block of the receptor-mediated induction, suggesting additional signaling mechanisms that are not responsive to PMA in the coupling of m1AChR to EGR-1 synthesis in HEK293 cells. To exclude cAMP as a signaling molecule for this response, we demonstrated that forskolin failed to influence EGR-1 synthesis (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with the absence of Egr-1 message, no EGR-1 protein was detectable on Western blots of nuclear proteins extracted from unstimulated cells (Fig. 3 A). EGR-3 protein was also detectable on Western blots of m1AChR cells 120 min after stimulation with carbachol or with PMA (Fig. 3 B). No EGR-3 protein was detectable in unstimulated cells or in cells treated with atropine/carbachol or 8-bromo-cAMP. Levels of EGR-3 protein were lower than those of EGR-1 with possible differences in affinity were even considering that different antibodies used for the detection of EGR-1 and EGR-3. EGR-2 protein was undetectable on Western blots using two different EGR-2 antibodies (data not shown). In order to establish that m1AChR activation leads to the binding of EGR-1 protein to its specific DNA recognition site, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig.4 A). We found that a nuclear protein from both carbachol- and PMA-treated cells, but not from control cells, formed a specific complex with an EGR recognition site and with the expected mobility of EGR-1. Carbachol-induced binding of this nuclear protein was completely blocked by atropine. It was partially abolished and supershifted by anti-EGR-1 antibodies, confirming specificity for the binding of EGR-1 to its DNA recognition sequence (Fig. 4 B). Down-regulation of PKC by 16 h of pretreatment with PMA resulted only in a partial inhibition of the mobility shift, suggesting redundant signaling pathways in coupling the response to the surface receptors. Again, elevating levels of cellular cAMP by forskolin failed to induce the mobility shift (Fig.4 A). Stimulation of the AChR subtypes m2 and m3 clearly induced a mobility shift with the EGR recognition site, and this interaction was also supershifted by EGR-1-specific antibodies (Fig.5 A). Stimulation of the AChR subtype m4 induced a mobility shift with a considerably lower magnitude as compared with the other mAChR subtypes (Fig. 5 A). These responses were also receptor-mediated, as evidenced by the complete atropine block in all cell lines. In the nontransfected parent HEK293 control cells, carbachol was ineffective in inducing a mobility shift (Fig. 5 A). Western blot analyses of nuclear proteins confirmed that stimulation of AChR subtype m2, m3, or m4 increased EGR-1 protein synthesis in an atropine-sensitive manner (Fig.5 B). Again, carbachol was ineffective in nontransfected parent HEK293 control cells. Transfection experiments with luciferase reporter constructs fused to an EGR-dependent minimal promoter demonstrated that both m1AChR and PMA effectively induced transcription from this promoter, suggesting downstream activation of genes that contain EGR responsive promoters (Fig.6 A). Again, the m1-induced response was blocked by atropine, and it was completely absent when control constructs were assayed that contain a mutated EGR binding domain (Fig. 6 B). 8-Bromo-cAMP failed to increase luciferase activity from the EGR-dependent promoter, confirming that cAMP is ineffective in its regulation. Stimulation of m1AChR in cells transfected with the AChE gene promoter (37Getman D.K. Mutero A. Inoue K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23511-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 49Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) fused to a luciferase reporter gene resulted in an activation of the transcription via the AChE gene promoter, as indicated by increased luciferase activity (Fig.7 A). Atropine blocked the increase in luciferase activity, indicating that this effect was caused specifically by m1AChR activation. Again, PMA mimicked the m1AChR activation of the AChE gene promoter, whereas 8-bromo-cAMP failed to induce transcription. Co-transfection of the pAChE-luc construct together with Krox24 demonstrated that EGR effectively induced the AChE gene promoter in our experimental system (Fig. 7 B). In brain, mAChRs are involved in long-term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, and higher cognitive functions, including learning and memory (50Hughes P. Dragunow M. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 51Huerta P.T. Lisman J.E. Nature. 1993; 364: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 52Lin Y. Phillis J.W. Brain Res. 1991; 551: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Such plastic alterations in neuronal structure and function are associated with rapid and transient transcription of activity-dependent genes (4Dragunow M. Behav.

Brain Res. 1994; 24: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 49Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol.

The results of our study show that mAChRs can increase the expression of the zinc-finger domain transcription factor genes Egr-1, Egr-2, Egr-3, and Egr-4, albeit to different extents. Egr-1 message was detectable within 10 min of m1AChR stimulation, a maximum was reached within 50 min, and EGR-1 protein was present within 120 and 180 min of stimulation. m1AChR-induced EGR-1 protein bound to an EGR-specific DNA recognition domain, as evidenced by mobility shift assays. In addition, luciferase reporter assays showed that m1AChR induced transcription from EGR dependent promoters. The carbachol-induced effects on transcriptional regulation were m1AChR-specific, as evidenced by complete atropine blocks, and they were mimicked by direct activation of PKC with PMA. Down-regulation of PKC, however, was associated with only partial inhibitions of the receptor responses, indicating that activation of PMA-dependent forms of PKC can be sufficient, but is not necessary, for coupling m1AChR to transcriptional activation of theEgr-1 gene. After PKC inhibition in PC12 cells, the remaining induction of Egr-1 by mAChR could be blocked by chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA (57Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of calcium influx as an additional signaling mechanism. To exclude cAMP in the coupling of m1AChR to Egr-1transcription, we used the potent adenylyl cyclase stimulators forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP, and we found that they failed to increaseEgr-1 expression. Our data suggest Egr-1 as a major target among members of the Egr gene family of m1 receptor, because competition experiments with EGR-1-specific antibodies almost completely blocked the binding of nuclear extracts to the EGR recognition sequence that is known to interact with all members of the Egr family. Higher amounts of EGR-1 protein, corresponding to the much higher expression level than that found in Egr-2 and Egr-3, may account for this result. This interpretation is underscored by the failure of EGR-2- and EGR-3-specific antibodies to induce a detectable supershift with the above preparation. Nevertheless, EGR-3 protein was detected unequivocally on Western blots, indicating that the transcription of the Egr-3 gene led to the generation of translation products. These results confirm and extend the observation that muscarinic AChRs increase Egr-1 message in PC12 (42Morita K. Wong D.L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 57Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 58Altin J.G. Kujubu D.A.

Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 3T3 cells transfected with m1 AChR cells (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Kalinec G. Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J. Gutkind S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Our data show that in addition to Egr-1, the expression of Egr-2, Egr-3, and Egr-4 is under the control of muscarinic AChRs. Moreover, our results show binding to, and activation of, EGR promoter sequences followed by the synthesis of functional protein as a result of mAChR stimulation. The muscarinic AChR subtypes used in our assays induced EGR-1 binding to EGR recognition domain with different efficacy: whereas m1, m2, and m3 AChRs caused a very clear induction of EGR-1 binding, m4AChR caused only subtle activation of EGR-1 binding in our cells. Stimulation of all analyzed mAChR receptor subtypes, including m4, increased EGR-1 protein synthesis, as verified by Western blot analyses of the same nuclear proteins used for the EGR binding assays. These results demonstrate that transcribed Egr-1 gene induced by mAChRs is followed by the synthesis of functional EGR-1 proteins. m2 and m4 AChRs efficiently inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity but activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis with only one-fifth of the efficacy of m1 and m3 AChRs (60Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). These levels of phosphoinositide turnover induced by m2 and m4 AChRs may be sufficient to mediate Egr-1expression. Alternatively, other second messenger pathways, including the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, may be involved in signaling. The ability of different muscarinic AChR subtypes to stimulateEgr-1 expression suggests that similar genes are controlled by acetylcholine in both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal populations. It is possible that these use distinct signaling mechanisms in the coupling of the surface receptors to Egr expression.In vivo experiments with intact neuroanatomical structures, however, are required to test this hypothesis. Egr-1expression is up-regulated also by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in a mammalian skeletal muscle cell line (61Abu-Shakra S.R. Cole A.J. Adams R.N. Drachman D.B. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 26: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), indicating that EGR transcription factors can be under the control of several distinct muscarinic and nicotinic surface receptor subtypes. Together, our data suggest that target genes with EGR-responsible promoters can be regulated by m1AChR. Candidate genes for EGR-mediated regulation include the AChE gene (37Getman D.K. Mutero A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22500-22506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of multiple cellular functions, including signaling, growth, and metabolism, may be coupled to muscarinic AChR activity via EGR transcription factors. EGR-1 increases the promoter activity of the AChE gene, a serine hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (49Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our data, generated by using the AChE gene promoter fused to a luciferase reporter, show that stimulated m1AChR specifically increased AChE gene promoter activity. Even though basal AChE gene promoter activity was found in all cell types examined so far, AChE message could be determined in only a small faction of these cells. HEK293 cells, in particular, have a very low endogenous promoter activity and no detectable AChE enzyme activity (37Getman D.K. Mutero A. Inoue K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23511-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect AChE mRNA in either unstimulated or stimulated m1AChR cells, possibly reflecting the absence of AChE mRNA stabilization known to occur during neuronal differentiation (47Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If confirmed for the subcortical cholinergic projection system in brain, EGR-dependent regulation of AChE gene transcription may be involved in a receptor-coupled feedback control of cholinergic transmission. Cholinergic signaling in Alzheimer's disease brain is heavily impaired as a result of the early and massive degeneration of the long basal forebrain projection neurons to brain hippocampus and cortex. Inasmuch as EGR-dependent genes in postsynaptic cholinergic target cells are regulated by muscarinic AChR activity, expression of such genes may be decreased in Alzheimer's disease brains. Postmortem studies are required to test this hypothesis. Drugs designed to activate muscarinic AChRs, including AChE inhibitors and m1 agonists, that are currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease may be expected to stimulate transcription of Egr genes along with EGR-dependent target genes. In vivo studies are required to test whether pharmacological treatments designed to stimulate brain muscarinic AChRs increase AChE gene expression, along with AChE enzyme activity and accelerated breakdown of acetylcholine. We thank Peter Zipfel for providing us with cDNA fragments of Egr-1, Egr-2 and Egr-4. We thank Palmer Taylor and Shelley Camp for the pAChE-luc construct."

Using three-dimensional modeling, we identified methionine 195 of the CCK-A receptor as a putative amino acid in interaction with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of CCK. We analyzed the role played by the two partners of this interaction. The exchange of Met-195 for a leucine caused a minor decrease (2.8-fold) on the affinity of the high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, a strong drop (73%) of their number, and a 30-fold decrease on the affinity of the low and very low affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9, with no change in their number. The mutation also caused a 54-fold decrease of the potency of the receptor to induce inositol phosphates production. The high affinity sites of the wild-type CCK-A receptor were highly selective (800-fold) toward sulfated versus nonsulfated CCK, whereas low and very low affinity sites were poorly selective (10- and 18-fold). In addition, the M195L mutant bound, and responded to, sulfated CCK analogues with decreased affinities and potencies, whereas it bound and responded to nonsulfated CCK identically to the wild-type receptor. Thus, Met-195 interacts with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine to correctly position the sulfated group of CCK in the binding site of the receptor. This interaction is essential for CCK-dependent transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state. Our data should represent an important step toward the identification of the residue(s) of the receptor in interaction with the sulfate moiety of CCK and the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern CCK-A receptor activation.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 295-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Post-translational processing of CCK involves sulfation of the tyrosine at position seven from the C-terminal and α-amidation of the C-terminal phenylalanine residue (1Rehfeld J.F. van Solinge W.W. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 63: 295-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using chemically synthesized fragments have shown that the C-terminal sulfated and amidated octapeptide Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 (Fig.1) exhibits the full spectrum of biological activity. However, fragments as small as the C-terminal tetrapeptide Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, which CCK has in common with the related peptide gastrin, retain biological activity (2Jensen R.T. Lemp G.F. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5554-5559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actions of CCK are mediated by membrane receptors that are divided into two subtypes, the CCK-A and the CCK-B/gastrin (3Silvente-Poirot S. Dufresne M. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The cloning of the cDNA coding for these receptors has shown that they belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors which are characterized by seven transmembrane domains connected by intracellular and extracellular loops with an extracellular N-terminal and intracellular C-terminal (4Ulrich C.D.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These pharmacological properties indicate that the location of the tyrosine at the seventh position from the C terminus of CCK and the sulfation of this tyrosine are crucial for full binding and biological activity of CCK at the CCK-A receptor. Accordingly, the CCK-A receptor should contain amino acids within its agonist binding site that specifically interact with the sulfated tyrosine moiety of CCK and are responsible for the binding and biological selectivities of this receptor for sulfated and nonsulfated CCK. Delineation of the agonist binding site of the CCK-A receptor requires identification of such amino acids. Previously, using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling, we had shown that two amino acids, Trp-39 and Gln-40 interact with the N-terminal region of CCK octa- and nonapeptides (12Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We present in this work an optimized three-dimensional model of the CCK agonist·CCK-A receptor complex, which enabled us to propose that the residue methionine 195, located in the second extracellular loop of the CCK-A receptor, may interact with the tyrosyl residue of CCK. Such interactions between an aromatic ring and neighboring functional groups have been previously found in several proteins and shown to contribute to the overall stability of biological structures (13Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that this interaction is required for agonist-dependent transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state, and for CCK's full binding and biological activity to the CCK-A receptor. The C-terminal nonapeptide of CCK, [Thr28,Ahx31]CCK-25–33 ([Thr,Nle]CCK-9, named sulfated CCK-9), was synthesized by Luis Moroder (Max Planck Institut für Biochimie, Munchen, Germany). The sulfated and nonsulfated C-terminal octapeptides, named sulfated CCK-8 and nonsulfated CCK-8, were from Neosystem, Strasbourg, France. The other analogues of CCK, namely (Phe)-CCK-8, (Ala)-CCK-8, JMV 180 and JMV 179, were synthesized by Jean Martinez's group. 1-(2-(4-(2-Chlorophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)aminocarbonyl indoyl) acetic acid (SR-27,897) and its tritiated derivative, [3H]SR-27,897 (31 Ci/mmol), were donated by Sanofi-Research (Toulouse, France) (14Gully D. Frehel D. Marcy C. Spinazze A. Lespy L. Neliat G. Maffrand J.P. Le Fur G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 232: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). 125INa was from Amersham, Les Ulis, France. [Thr,Nle]CCK-9 was conjugated with Bolton-Hunter reagent, purified, and radioiodinated as described previously (15Fourmy D. Lopez P. Poirot S. Jimenez J. Dufresne M. Moroder L. Powers S.P. Vaysse N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The specific activity of radioiodinated peptide was 1600–2000 Ci/mmol. Oligonucleotide primers were from Bioprobe Systems (Montreuil, France). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. The molecular model of the human CCK-A receptor was constructed as described previously (12Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The docking of CCK into the receptor was achieved using manual preliminary positioning inside the receptor grove guided by the inspection of the molecular electrostatic potential representations of the ligand and receptor. Then, the docking was improved by intensive annealing calculations. The resulting structure obtained for the ligand-receptor complex was further refined using molecular dynamics and energy minimization. All the annealing refinement and docking calculations were produced using the Biosym/MSI molecular modeling package. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Chameleon 228 double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The protocol is based on the method of mutagenesis by unique site elimination (16Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Mutation was introduced into the human CCK-A receptor cDNA cloned into pRFENeo vector (17Kennedy K. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Clerc P. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using mutagenic primer based on the published human CCK-A receptor cDNA sequence (4Ulrich C.D. Ferber I. Holicky E. Hadac E.

The mutation was confirmed by sequencing on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystem). Two receptor mutants were constructed: in the first the methionine 195 was substituted by a leucine, in the second, the methionine 195 was subtituted by a glutamine, which is the equivalent amino acid in the human CCK-B/gastrin receptor. COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (complete medium) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After an overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 2.5 μg/plate of pRFENeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK-A receptors, using a modified DEAE-dextran method. Approximately 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, and then seeded onto 24-well dishes in complete medium at a density of approximately 1 × 105 cells/well for binding assays. For inositol phosphates assay, the cells were resuspended in complete medium in the presence of 2 μCi/ml myo-2-[3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated overnight in 24-well dishes. Approximately 24 h after the transfer of transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, 0.1% BSA and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA with either 71 pm(wild-type receptor) or 350 pm (mutated receptors)125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 or 1.83 nm[3H]SR-27,897 and in the presence or absence of competing agonists or antagonists. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.95, containing 2% BSA, and cell-associated 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 or [3H]SR-27,897 was collected with NaOH 0.1 nadded to each well. Plasma membrane from COS-7 cells were prepared as described previously in detail. Aliquots of 10–20-μg protein (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) were incubated in binding buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA for 90 min at 25 °C (steady-state conditions) with 350 pm125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 in the presence or absence of competing agonist. The binding reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer, and bound radioligand was separated from the free fraction by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed two times more and the radioactivity was directly counted for radioiodinated ligands. Binding data were analyzed using the EBDA LIGAND program (19Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) or GraphPad Prism program (Software). Approximately 24 h after the transfer to 24-well plates and following overnight incubation in complete medium containing 2 μCi/ml ofmyo-2-[3H]inositol, the transfected cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated 30 min in 2 ml/well Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PI buffer at pH 7.45 (phosphate-buffered saline containing 135 mmNaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5% BSA. The cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of PI buffer with or without ligands at various concentrations. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of MeOH/HCl to each well, and the content was transferred to a column (Dowex AG 1-X8 formate form, Bio-Rad) to release the extraction of inositol phosphates. The columns were washed twice with 5 ml of distilled water and twice more with 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. The content of each column was eluted by addition of 4 ml of 1m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. A view of the three-dimensional model of the CCK-A receptor is presented in Fig.2. Besides the interactions that have already been described and involved the Trp-39 and Gln-40 residues of the CCK-A receptor and the N-terminal part of CCK octa- and nonapeptides (12Kennedy K. Gigoux V. Escrieut C. Maigret B. Martinez J. Moroder L. Frehel D. Gully D. Vaysse N. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2920-2926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), this three-dimensional model enabled us to identify another interaction, which may explain the high selectivity of the CCK-A receptor for sulfated versus nonsulfated CCK. The key amino acid of the receptor involved in this additional interaction is the methionine 195 located in the second extracellular loop of the CCK-A receptor. The sulfur atom of Met-195 side chain is shown on the model to interact with the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of the CCK agonist. In this interaction, the sulfur atom of Met-195 is positioned toward the center of the aromatic ring of the tyrosine at a distance of about 6 Å, and the methyl group attached to the sulfur atom is pointed away from the aromatic plane. Such positioning is typical of quadrupole/quadrupole interactions between a sulfur atom and the π electron cloud of an aromatic ring. Moreover, ab initio calculations performed on a model built from toluene and dimethylsulfur have clearly demonstrated that positioning of the aromatic ring and sulfur atom shown in the model of the CCK-A receptor·CCK complex is a favorable one (13Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the putative interaction between Met-195 of the CCK-A receptor and the tyrosine of CCK, we first exchanged Met-195 for a leucine in the CCK-A receptor. Such a substitution, which essentially consists of the removal of the sulfur from the side chain of the amino acid, should eliminate the quadrupole/quadrupole interaction and therefore hinder the correct positioning of the sulfated group in the receptor binding site. In a second mutant receptor, the methionine 195 was subtituted by a glutamine that is the equivalent positioned amino acid in the human CCK-B/gastrin receptor. Since the human CCK-A receptor exists in three different affinity states for sulfated CCK, we evaluated the contribution Met-195 to these different affinity states (8Talkad V.D. Fortune K.P.

We used the sulfated CCK-9 agonist,125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9, and the non-peptide antagonist, [3H]SR-27,897 as radioligands because they have the capability to detect the different affinity states of the receptor. Scatchard analysis of competition binding between125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 and sulfated CCK-9 to the wild-type receptor demonstrated two classes of binding sites, a high affinity site with a K d of 0.56 ± 0.19 nmand a maximal binding capacity (B max) of 0.086 ± 0.020 pmol/106 cells, and a low affinity site with a K d of 44 ± 16 nm and a maximal binding capacity of 2.0 ± 0.4 pmol/106 cells (Table I). On the other hand, the M195L mutant demonstrated a very low binding of125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 when the standard radioligand concentration (71 pm) was used. By contrast, significant binding was observed in the presence of 350 pm of radioligand, allowing Scatchard analysis of this binding. In fact, the M195L mutant demonstrated two classes of binding sites similar to the wild-type receptor. The binding parameters were modified, the high affinity sites had a K d of 1.59 ± 0.42 nm and a maximal binding capacity of 0.023 ± 0.005 pmol/106 cells, and the low affinity sites had aK d of 1,310 ± 362 nm and a maximal binding capacity of 2.35 ± 0.80 pmol/106 cells (TableI).Table IEffect of the mutation of methionine 195 of the CCK-A receptor on the binding of sulfated CCK125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9[3H]SR-27,897High affinityLow affinityVery low affinityWild-typeM195LFmutWild-typeM195LFmutWild-typeM195LFmutK d0.56 ± 0.19 (3)1.59 ± 0.42 (4)2.844 ± 16 (3)1,310 ± 362 (4)29.81,257 ± 119 (4)41,475 ± 11,421 (3)33.0nm,nB max,0.086 ± 0.0200.023 ± 0.0053.72.0 ± 0.42.35 ± 0.800.92.33 ± 0.22.16 ± 0.21.1pmol/106 cellsBinding experiments were realized on COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding the wild-type and the mutated M195L CCK-A receptor.

The effects of the mutation M195L on the binding affinities and maximal binding capacities are expressed by a mutation factor Fmut calculated asK d (mutant)/K d (wild-type) andB max (wild-type)/B max (mutant), respectively. The M195Q mutant demonstrated modified binding properties for sulfated CCK-9 similar to the M195L mutant. The high affinity sites had aK d of 2.17 ± 0.35 nm and a maximal binding capacity of 0.022 ± 0.002 pmol/106 cells, and the low affinity sites had a K d of 2,520 ± 917 nm and a maximal binding capacity of 3.45 ± 1.19 pmol/106 cells (not shown, mean of three experiments). The M195L mutant bound the nonpeptide CCK-A receptor antagonist [3H]SR-27,897 to a single class of binding sites that exhibited the same affinity as the wild-type receptor (K d, 2.4 ± 0.2 nm versus 2.5 ± 0.4 nm, not shown), and was expressed at the cell surface identical to the wild-type CCK-A receptor (B max, 3.6 ± 1.7 versus3.7 ± 0.7 pmol/106 cells, not shown). Competition binding using [3H]SR-27,897 indicated that M195L mutant bound sulfated CCK-9 to very low affinity sites as the wild-type CCK-A receptor (8Talkad V.D. Fortune K.P. Pollo D.A. Shah G.N. Wank S.A. Gardner J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1868-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 9Huang S.C. Fortune K.P. Wank S.A. Kopin A.S. Gardner J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26121-26126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, affinity of the low affinity sites of the M195L mutant for sulfated CCK-9 was 33-fold lower than that of the wild-type receptor (K i: 41,475 ± 11,421 nm versus 1,257 ± 119 nm, Table I). Therefore, the exchange of the methionine 195 for a leucine yielded a human CCK-A receptor having new pharmacological features; the affinity of the high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9 was slightly decreased (2.8-fold), but their number was greatly diminished (by 3.7-fold or 73%), and the affinity of the low and very low affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9 was identically decreased by 30- to 33-fold, whereas their number remained nearly constant (Table I). We then determined whether the remaining high affinity sites of the mutated receptor were still capable of coupling to G protein(s) and phospholipase-C. Binding of 125I-BH-(Thr, Nle)CCK-9 to the M195L mutant was totally inhibited by 10 μm GTPγS (not shown). The very low level of residual binding in presence of GTPγS suggested disappearance of the high affinity sites on behalf of low affinity sites, however the affinity of the latter could not be accurately determined in such experiments. Therefore, the high affinity sites of the M195L mutant remained able to couple to G protein(s). In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 3, sulfated CCK-9 induced a dose-dependent stimulation of inositol phosphate production to the same maximal increase 9- to 26-fold over basal values in COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type and mutant receptors. However, the concentrations giving half-maximal responses, (D 50) was 54-fold higher for the M195L mutant (25.5 ± 2.8 nm) than for the wild-type CCK-A receptor (0.5 ± 0.1 nm) demonstrating a decrease of the potency of the mutated receptor to induce inositol phosphate production after stimulation by sulfated CCK-9. The effects of the mutation of Met-195 on the decrease of the number of high affinity sites for sulfated CCK-9 suggested a role of Met-195 in the transition of the CCK-A receptor to a high affinity state. Moreover, the three-dimensional model suggested that the interaction between the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of CCK and Met-195 of the CCK-A receptor serves to correctly position the sulfated moiety of the ligand within the receptor binding site. We therefore analyzed the contribution of the different chemical functions of the sulfated tyrosine to CCK binding to the three affinity states of the wild-type CCK-A receptor. For this, we tested new CCK analogues modified at the seventh position from the C terminus for their ability to interact with the wild-type CCK-A receptor. Competition binding using 125I-BH-(Thr,Nle)CCK-9 showed that in contrast to sulfated CCK-9 or CCK-8, nonsulfated CCK-8 bound to the CCK-A receptor with a single affinity (K i, 447 ± 105 nm) that was 800-fold lower than the affinity of sulfated CCK-9 for the high affinity sites and 10-fold lower than the affinity of sulfated CCK-9 for the low affinity sites (Fig. 4 A). Competition binding using [3H]SR-27,897 showed that nonsulfated CCK-8 bound to the very low affinity sites of the CCK-A receptor with an affinity only 18-fold lower than the affinity of sulfated CCK-9 to these sites (Fig. 4 B, K i, 22,842 ± 4,776 nm. Thus, the sulfated moiety of sulfated CCK is highly important for binding to the high affinity sites of the human CCK-A receptor, whereas it is much less important for binding to the low and very low affinity sites. We then determined whether the aromatic ring of the sulfated tyrosine of CCK also contributes to the affinity of nonsulfated CCK for the high affinity sites of the CCK-A receptor. (Phe)-CCK-8 had a 459-fold lower affinity than sulfated CCK-9 and an affinity very close to that of nonsulfated CCK-8 (K i, 257 ± 14 nm versus 447 ± 105 nm). (Ala)-CCK-8 had an affinity (K i, 1,265 ± 67 nm) that was 2,259-fold lower than that of sulfated CCK-9 and 5-fold lower than that of (Phe)-CCK-8 (results are mean of three separate experiments, not illustrated). Thus, elimination of the sulfate moiety in CCK reduced the affinity of CCK by 800-fold. Further elimination of the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine did not cause any additional change, and elimination of the aromatic ring of the tyrosine reduced the affinity of CCK by 5-fold. Therefore, the aromatic ring of the tyrosine contributes poorly to CCK binding. This result together with the one showing the importance of Met-195 reinforces the hypothesis that the quadrupole/quadrupole interaction pointed out by the three-dimensional model probably serves to correctly position the sulfated moiety of the ligand within the receptor binding site. We attempted to experimentally verify that Met-195 of the CCK-A receptor was indeed in interaction with the sulfated tyrosine of CCK. We tested CCK-related peptides modified at the seventh position from the C terminus of CCK as well as JMV 179, JMV 180, (Phe)-CCK-8, and (Ala)-CCK-8 for their ability to bind to the M195L mutant. The two peptides, JMV 179 and JMV 180, possess the sulfated tyrosine but are antagonists of the human CCK-A receptor. We used [3H]SR-27,897 because this ligand bound identically to the M195L mutant and the wild-type receptor and could easily reveal the effect of the mutation on the affinity of the receptor for CCK.

https://openalex.org/W1970485654,"COS-7 cells expressing 1,360 residues from the amino terminus of porcine submaxillary mucin were used to determine whether this region, containing the D1, D2, and D3 domains, is involved in forming mucin multimers. Analysis of the proteins immunoprecipitated from the medium of transfected cells by reducing SDS-gel electrophoresis showed a single N-glycosylated protein with no indication of proteolytically processed forms. Without prior reduction, only two proteins, corresponding to monomeric and disulfide-linked trimeric species, were observed. The expressed protein devoid of N-linked oligosaccharides also formed trimers, but was secreted from cells in significantly less amounts than glycosylated trimers. Pulse-chase studies showed that the disulfide-linked trimers were assembled inside the cells no earlier than 30 min after protein synthesis commenced and after the intracellular precursors were N-glycosylated. Trimer formation was inhibited in cells treated with brefeldin A, monensin, chloroquine, or bafilomycin A1, although only brefeldin A prevented the secretion of the protein. These results suggest that trimerization takes place in compartments of the Golgi complex in which the vacuolar H+-ATPase maintains an acidic pH. Coexpression in the same cells of the amino-terminal region and the disulfide-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of the mucin showed that these structures were not disulfide-linked with one another. Cells expressing a DNA construct encoding a fusion protein between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the mucin secreted disulfide-linked dimeric and high molecular weight multimeric species of the recombinant mucin. The presence of monensin in the medium was without effect on dimerization, but inhibited the formation of disulfide-linked multimers. These studies suggest that disulfide-linked dimers of mucin are subsequently assembled into disulfide-linked multimers by the amino-terminal regions. They also suggest that the porcine mucin forms branched disulfide-linked multimers. This ability of the amino-terminal region of mucin to aid in the assembly of multimers is consistent with its amino acid identities to the amino-terminal region of human von Willebrand factor, which also serves to form disulfide-linked multimers of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2052642243,"Pulses of ecdysteroids direct Drosophila through its life cycle by activating stage- and tissue-specific genetic regulatory hierarchies. Here we show that an orphan nuclear receptor, DHR78, functions at the top of the ecdysteroid regulatory hierarchies. Null mutations in DHR78 lead to lethality during the third larval instar with defects in ecdysteroid-triggered developmental responses. Consistent with these phenotypes, DHR78 mutants fail to activate the mid-third instar regulatory hierarchy that prepares the animal for metamorphosis. DHR78 protein is bound to many ecdysteroid-regulated puff loci, suggesting that DHR78 directly regulates puff gene expression. In addition, ectopic expression of DHR78 has no effects on development, indicating that its activity is regulated posttranslationally. We propose that DHR78 is a ligand-activated receptor that plays a central role in directing the onset of Drosophila metamorphosis."
https://openalex.org/W2040575715,"We purified Myr3 (third unconventional myosin from rat), a mammalian “amoeboid” subclass myosin I, from rat liver. The heavy chain of purified Myr3 is associated with a single calmodulin light chain. Myr3 exhibits K/EDTA-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activity. The Mg-ATPase activity is stimulated by increasing F-actin concentrations in a complex triphasic manner similar to the Mg-ATPase activity of myosin I molecules from protozoa. Although purified Myr3 was observed to cross-link actin filaments, it bound in an ATP regulated manner to F-actin, and no evidence for a nucleotide-independent high affinity actin binding site that could explain the triphasic activation pattern was obtained. Micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ reversibly inhibit the Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 by binding to its light chain calmodulin, which remains bound to the Myr3 heavy chain irrespective of the free Ca2+ concentration. Polyclonal antibodies and Fab fragments directed against the tail domain were found to stimulate the Mg-ATPase activity. A similar stimulation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity is observed upon proteolytic removal of the very C-terminal SH3 domain. These results demonstrate that Myr3 is subject to negative regulation by free calcium and its own tail domain and possibly positive regulation by a tail-domain binding partner. We purified Myr3 (third unconventional myosin from rat), a mammalian “amoeboid” subclass myosin I, from rat liver. The heavy chain of purified Myr3 is associated with a single calmodulin light chain. Myr3 exhibits K/EDTA-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activity. The Mg-ATPase activity is stimulated by increasing F-actin concentrations in a complex triphasic manner similar to the Mg-ATPase activity of myosin I molecules from protozoa. Although purified Myr3 was observed to cross-link actin filaments, it bound in an ATP regulated manner to F-actin, and no evidence for a nucleotide-independent high affinity actin binding site that could explain the triphasic activation pattern was obtained.

Polyclonal antibodies and Fab fragments directed against the tail domain were found to stimulate the Mg-ATPase activity.

These results demonstrate that Myr3 is subject to negative regulation by free calcium and its own tail domain and possibly positive regulation by a tail-domain binding partner. Myosins are mechanoenzymes that convert chemical energy stored in the molecule ATP into directed force along actin filaments. They are heterooligomers consisting of one or two heavy chains and up to six light chains per heavy chain. The heavy chains exhibit an N-terminal head region, a light chain binding region, and a C-terminal tail region. The head region is relatively well conserved in all myosins and comprises ATP- and actin-binding sites and exhibits actin-activated ATPase activity (1Pollard T.D. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on phylogenetic analysis of the head domain sequences myosins can be divided into more than 10 classes. Class I myosin molecules are single headed with relatively short tail-domains that neither dimerize nor form filaments. This class contains numerous members that by sequence comparison can be grouped into subclasses. Members of the “amoeboid” subclass were first identified in Acanthamoeba castellanii (2Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Dictyostelium discoideum (3Côté G.P. Albanesi J.P. Ueno T. Hammer III, J.A. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4543-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, myosin molecules of this subclass have been identified from yeast to man (Refs. 4Goodson H.V. Spudich J.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1995; 30: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5McGoldrick C.A. Gruver C. May G.S. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and Knight and Kendrick-Jones, GenBank™ accession number X70400). So far, only members of this subclass fromA. castellanii and D. discoideum have been characterized biochemically. Their actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity and their ability to produce force is regulated by phosphorylation of a single serine/threonine residue located in the head region. The recently identified vertebrate members of this subclass lack this phosphorylation site. Therefore, their ATPase and motor activities are likely to be regulated in a different manner. Vertebrate members also differ in their tail regions from the biochemically characterized protozoan members in that they do not contain an extended GPA/GPQ (glycine, proline, and alanine/glutamine)-rich region. This region was reported to exhibit actin binding activity (8Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such an ATP-insensitive actin-binding site was used to explain the peculiar triphasic Mg-ATPase activation observed as a function of F-actin concentration. At low concentrations of F-actin, the Mg-ATPase reaches near maximal velocity. This is followed by a decrease of velocity at intermediate F-actin concentrations before getting reactivated to maximal velocity again at high F-actin concentrations (10Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4691-4697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of vertebrate amoeboid myosin I molecules could lead to a further clarification of the mechanism responsible for this complex triphasic activation kinetics. The heavy chain of the rat myosin I molecule Myr3, a vertebrate member of the amoeboid subclass of myosin I molecules, was recently identified by molecular cloning (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, the heavy chain of Myr3 contains a single light chain binding motif. This light chain binding motif was proposed to bind calmodulin. Myr3 is expressed in many tissues and cell lines. Due to its localization in cell-cell contact regions Myr3 was suggested to play a role associated with cell-cell contacts (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further define the function of Myr3 we attempted to characterize its enzymatic properties and their regulation. We now report the purification of Myr3 from rat liver, the characterization of its enzymatic activities, and their regulation by actin, free Ca2+, tail binding antibodies, and proteolysis. Myr3 was purified from rat liver. The livers of 40 adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, final volume: 2 liters) using a tight fitting motor driven Dounce homogenizer. To minimize proteolysis the protease inhibitors Pefabloc (50 mg/liter) and aprotinin (7.6 trypsin inhibitor units/liter) were added to the homogenate, and all purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged in a Sorvall GS3 rotor (E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Bad Homburg, Federal Republic of Germany) at 8500 rpm for 60 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final saturation of 35% and stirred for 20 min. The pellet resulting after centrifugation (GS3-rotor, 8500 rpm, 30 min) was resuspended in 400 ml of low-salt buffer (50 mm NaCl, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmEGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight to obtain an actomyosin pellet. Sometimes the resuspended pellet was incubated in low-salt buffer for 1 h and the dialysis step omitted. This shortened procedure reduced the amount of contaminating proteins in the actomyosin pellet but the actomyosin pellet was not consistently formed. The actomyosin pellet was collected by centrifugation (GS3-rotor, 8500 rpm, 45 min) and washed twice with 400 ml of low-salt buffer supplemented with 100 mm KCl. Myr3 was then extracted from the pellet with sodium pyrophosphate. The pellet was resuspended in 150 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm EDTA in low-salt buffer) and centrifuged in a Beckman 50.2 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 45,000 rpm for 45 min. The resulting extract was concentrated either by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Witten, Federal Republic of Germany) or ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% saturation) before loading onto a gel filtration column. The ammonium sulfate precipitate was directly resuspended in gel filtration buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmATP) and clarified by centrifugation (SS34 rotor, 16,000 rpm, 20 min). The concentrated extracts were chromatographed over a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany) preequilibrated in gel filtration buffer. Fractions containing Myr3 as monitored by immunoblotting were pooled and loaded onto a Mono S HR 5/5 ion-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA. The column was developed with a linear NaCl salt gradient (200 mm to 1 m). Myr3 eluted as a single peak at approximately 850–900 mm NaCl. Mg-ATPase activity was measured in solutions containing 15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, and ∼90 mm NaCl contributed by the Myr3 Mono S column fractions unless otherwise stated. Assays were started by the addition of 2 mm ATP from a concentrated stock solution containing [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The radioactivity release as Pi from [γ-32P]ATP was measured. Briefly, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 7 volumes of trichloroacetic acid/charcoal (7, 5%/8%). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the suspension was centrifuged and radioactivity in the supernatants determined by Cerenkov counting. Phosphate release was linear with time and less than 20% of the substrate became hydrolyzed. All activities were determined in triplicates and activities in the absence of Myr3 were subtracted. Free Ca2+ concentrations were adjusted according to calculations with the program Calcium V2.1 (created by K.-J. Foehr and W. Warchol). Myr3 antibodies in TBS, 2 mm NaN3 were preincubated with Myr3 for 20 min prior to the addition to the reaction mixture. K/EDTA-ATPase activity was assayed in a buffer containing 0.5 m KCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 15 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, as described above. Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (11Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and stored as G-actin at −70 °C. Actin was polymerized in a buffer of 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm NaN3. F-actin binding assays were performed as described previously (12Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) except that bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) was added to the assay mixture and centrifuge tubes were precoated with 5% non-fat dry milk. F-actin (50 μg/ml) incubated either with different amounts of purified Myr3 or buffer alone was adsorbed for 30 s on copper grids coated with a glow-discharged carbon film. Grids were negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate and examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. Purified Myr3 was separated by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and stained with Coomassie Blue. The light chain was excised from the gel and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C. Digested peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Superspher 60 RP select B column (Merck, Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany) and sequenced by N-terminal degradation using an automated sequencer (Porton 3600, Beckman Instruments). Polyclonal antibodies against Myr3 were raised and purified as described (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fab fragments were produced by papain digestion as described by Wallimann and Szent-Györgyi (13Wallimann T. Szent-Györgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1188-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A C-terminally truncated fragment of Myr3 was obtained by limited proteolysis of purified Myr3 with mercuripapain. The proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 5 mm iodoacetamide. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford colorimetric assay (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed according to Towbin et al. (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk to 2 μg/ml. Alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibody was diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Triton X-100. The phosphatase reaction was visualized by the ProtoBlot system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). For quantitative protein analysis, Coomassie-stained SDS gels were scanned and analyzed using the Image Master gel quantification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To characterize the biochemical properties of Myr3 we established a purification scheme for Myr3 from rat liver. Rat liver was chosen as starting material, because it contains high levels of Myr3, and the proteolytic breakdown of Myr3 in liver homogenate is less pronounced than in homogenates from other tissues. Myr3 was readily soluble at salt concentrations of 150 mm (>80%) and could be precipitated from the liver extract with ammonium sulfate reaching between 25 and 35% saturation. Since the bulk of proteins precipitated only at higher ammonium sulfate concentrations, the precipitation of Myr3 at 35% saturation represented a useful first purification step. Myr3 was further purified by the formation of an actomyosin pellet from which it could be quantitatively extracted by sodium pyrophosphate. The use of sodium pyrophospate as opposed to Mg-ATP reduced the amount of conventional myosin present in the extract. Myr3 was further purified by gel filtration and cation-exchange column chromatography. Purified Myr3 eluted from a Mono S cation-exchange column as a single sharp peak at relatively high salt concentrations of about 850–900 mm(Figs. 1 A and 10 A). Attempts to concentrate and/or desalt purified Myr3 consistently failed, because Myr3 exhibited a strong tendency to adhere to plastic surfaces. Therefore, we directly used the fractions from the Mono S column in most of our assays. The described purification protocol yielded between 150 and 300 μg of purified Myr3 from 40 rat livers.Figure 10Activation of Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity by C-terminal truncation of the tail domain. Myr3 (lane 1) and Myr3 truncated at its C terminus by limited digestion with mercuripapain (lane 2) were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (A). The corresponding aliquots were used for determination of Mg-ATPase activity (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together with the Myr3 heavy chain a protein of 17 kDa was copurified (Fig.1 A). The stoichiometry of the 17-kDa protein to the Myr3 heavy chain was determined to be 0.82 ± 0.03 by gel densitometry. This number is in good agreement with the prediction of a single light chain which binds to the single “IQ motif” in the neck region of the Myr3 heavy chain. We previously reported that calmodulin was present in Myr3 heavy chain immunoprecipitates and that calmodulin bound to the Myr3 heavy chain in a gel-overlay assay (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, the 17-kDa light chain comigrated with authentic calmodulin on SDS gels (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, the Myr3 light chain was resistant to boiling and demonstrated a calcium-dependent shift in electrophoretic mobility, two properties that characterize authentic calmodulin (Fig. 1 B). Additional proof for the identity of the Myr3 light chain with calmodulin was obtained by peptide sequencing. Two peptide sequences derived from the Myr3 light chain (9 and 16 amino acid residues in length) were identical to corresponding sequences in rat calmodulin (Fig. 1 C). By all these criteria, the Myr3 light chain is identical to calmodulin. To analyze myosin-like activities of purified Myr3, K/EDTA-ATPase and the physiologically relevant actin-activated Mg-ATPase activities were determined. Myr3 exhibited a K/EDTA-ATPase activity of 722 ± 22 nmol/min/mg and a Mg-ATPase activity that was stimulated by F-actin (Table I). Both, basal and actin-activated Mg-ATPase, activities of Myr3 increased with increasing salt concentrations (Fig.2, Table I). However, up to a salt concentration of approximately 200 mm NaCl the slope of the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity was smaller than the slope of the basal Mg-ATPase activity. At this salt concentration, there was no longer any actin activation of the Mg-ATPase detectable. Upon increasing the salt concentration further, the Mg-ATPase activity increased irrespective of the presence or absence of F-actin (Fig. 2). This salt-dependent increase in Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 was reversible as Myr3 was diluted into the assay mixtures from a buffer containing 900 mm NaCl. Addition of exogenous calmodulin to the assay mixtures did not influence the Myr3 ATPase activities.Table IEnzymatic activities of purified myr3ATPase activity−F-actin+F-actinnmol min−1 mg−1K/EDTA722 ± 22Magnesium (12 mm KCl)51 ± 21209 ± 36Magnesium (90 mm NaCl)130 ± 5243 ± 9Magnesium (590 mm NaCl)659 ± 29615 ± 28The K/EDTA-ATPase activity was determined in the presence of 500 mm KCl and 2 mm EDTA. The Mg-ATPase activity in the absence or presence of F-actin was determined in assay mixtures containing either 12 mm KCl, 90 mm NaCl, or 590 mm NaCl, respectively. Open table in a new tab The K/EDTA-ATPase activity was determined in the presence of 500 mm KCl and 2 mm EDTA. The Mg-ATPase activity in the absence or presence of F-actin was determined in assay mixtures containing either 12 mm KCl, 90 mm NaCl, or 590 mm NaCl, respectively. Next we determined the effect of the actin concentration on the Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3. As shown in Fig.3, the Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 was activated by F-actin at low concentrations of salt (12 and 35 mm KCl, respectively) in a triphasic manner. Measurements under standard conditions (90 mm NaCl) revealed no qualitative differences except for a higher basal activity and a smaller activation by F-actin due to the higher salt concentration. The Mg-ATPase activity increased up to a concentration of ∼1 μm actin, then decreased up to a concentration of ∼3.5 μm actin and finally increased again until it reached a plateau at actin concentrations higher than 7 μm. As mentioned above, the triphasic F-actin activation of the Mg-ATPase of amoeboid myosin I molecules from protozoa is explained by a mechanism that involves cross-linking of F-actin. To test whether Myr3 can cross-link actin filaments, we examined mixtures of F-actin and purified Myr3 by electron microscopy (Fig. 4). Bundles of cross-linked F-actin were observed in the presence of purified Myr3. This finding indicates that Myr3 is able to cross-link actin filaments, although it lacks a “GPA” region in its tail domain. To determine directly whether Myr3 contains an ATP-independent high affinity actin-binding site, which could explain the triphasic activation of its ATPase activity by increasing F-actin concentrations, we performed actin cosedimentation experiments at low Myr3 concentrations. Myr3 was found to specifically cosediment with actin filaments in the absence, but not in the presence, of ATP (Fig. 5), indicating that Myr3 does not contain a nucleotide-independent high affinity actin binding site.Figure 5Binding of purified Myr3 to F-actin. The F-actin binding of Myr3 was determined at 150 mm salt by cosedimentation in the absence (−) or presence (+) of actin (18.7 μm) and ATP (2 mm), respectively. Supernatants (S) and pellets (P) were analyzed for their content of Myr3 by immunoblotting with antibody Tü58.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since we have shown that the Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin serves as the single light chain of Myr3, we hypothesized that the activity of Myr3 might be regulated by Ca2+. Therefore, we examined the effect of free Ca2+ ions on its Mg-ATPase activity (Fig.6 A). Addition of micromolar free calcium ions reduced both the basal and actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 by a factor of 2–3. This inhibitory effect of free calcium on the Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 was reversible. Chelation of free calcium ions with EGTA after a 20-min incubation of purified Myr3 with free Ca2+ increased the Mg-ATPase activity again to the initial level (Fig. 6 A). A detailed analysis of the free calcium concentration needed to inhibit the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity revealed a marked inhibition for both the basal and actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity between a concentration range of 0.1–1 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 6 B). This concentration range exactly coincides with the affinity of calmodulin for calcium, strongly supporting the notion that the observed inhibition is due to the binding of Ca2+ to the Myr3 light chain calmodulin. This Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity could be explained either by an allosteric effect or by dissociation of calmodulin from the Myr3 heavy chain. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed an actin cosedimentation assay in the absence and presence of micromolar free Ca2+ (Fig.7). This experiment allows for the separation of free calmodulin from calmodulin bound to the Myr3 heavy chain. Comparable amounts of calmodulin were found to cosediment with Myr3 and F-actin irrespective of the free calcium concentration (Fig.7). This result demonstrates that calmodulin remains bound to the Myr3 heavy chain irrespective of the free Ca2+ concentration and hence that the regulation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase by Ca2+ is of allosteric nature. In further support of this notion, addition of exogenous calmodulin had no effect on the Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 (data not shown).Figure 7Association of calmodulin with Myr3 in the absence and presence of free Ca2+. Myr3 was incubated in the absence of free Ca2+ (4 mm EGTA) (lane 1) and in the presence of free Ca2+ (3 μm Ca2+) (lane 2), respectively. To determine the amount of calmodulin bound to Myr3, Myr3 was cosedimented with F-actin. The pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Bovine serum albumin was added to the assay to prevent unspecific binding and adhesion to the tube walls.HC, Myr3 heavy chain; LC, light chain (calmodulin).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a substitute for a physiological Myr3 tail binding partner, the antibody FML 6, which was raised against a fusion protein of the Myr3 tail domain (encompassing amino acids 821–1107; Ref. 7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was tested for potential regulatory effects on the Mg-ATPase of the Myr3 head domain. Interestingly, the antibody FML 6 caused in a concentration-dependent manner an increase of both basal and actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity (Fig.8 A). The basal Mg-ATPase activity was raised to values that were comparable to the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity. The actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity was also increased, but to a somewhat smaller degree. The observed activation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity by antibody FML 6 was not simply a result of cross-linking of Myr3 molecules by the antibodies. Monovalent Fab fragments also stimulated the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity and that to a similar extent as the FML 6 IgG antibodies (Fig.9). This activation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity was not observed with control antibodies (data not shown) and the previously described polyclonal antibody Tü 58 (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that recognizes a region in the myosin head domain of Myr3 (amino acids 326–342) corresponding to the so called ordered loop in the conventional myosin head (amino acids 400–416; Ref. 34Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Bäre K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Antibody Tü 58 specifically inhibited the F-actin activation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase (Fig. 8 B). Additive effects were observed when the two antibodies, Tü 58 and FML 6, were added simultaneously. ATPase measurements in the presence of both antibodies demonstrated an increase in the basal Mg-ATPase activity but no longer any activation by F-actin (data not shown). These results suggest that the two antibodies were affecting two independent regulatory mechanisms and they demonstrate the specificity of the activation of the Mg-ATPase by the Myr3 tail antibodies. Interestingly, a similar activation of the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity as with the tail binding antibodies was noticed upon proteolytic cleavage of the very C terminus of the Myr3 tail domain (Fig. 10). Limited digestion of Myr3 with mercuripapain produced a Myr3 fragment truncated at its C terminus by approximately 10 kDa (Fig. 10 A). A similar degradation product of Myr3 is also observed in tissue homogenates as described previously (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This C-terminally truncated Myr3 molecule exhibited a clearly increased Mg-ATPase activity as compared with the intact Myr3 molecule (Fig. 10 B), indicating that the C-terminal tail domain provides some inhibitory constraint for the Mg-ATPase activity located in the head domain.Figure 9Activation of Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity by tail binding Fab fragments.

Preparations of purified Myr3 contained in addition to the heavy chain as predicted from its sequence a single light chain in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This light chain was identified as calmodulin based on its electrophoretic mobility, heat stability, and partial peptide sequence. Calmodulin has been found to be associated with other vertebrate myosin I molecules (12Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J.

This difference in the identity of the light chain between Myr3 and other amoeboid myosin I molecules might reflect a difference in regulatory properties. This notion is supported by the fact that Myr3 does not contain the regulatory phosphorylation site present in the head domain of amoeboid myosin I molecules from protozoa. Myr3 displayed K/EDTA-ATPase and actin-activated Mg-ATPase activities that are characteristic of bona fide myosins. The K/EDTA-ATPase activity of Myr3 was higher than for other vertebrate myosin I molecules such as chicken brush border myosin I (17Conzelmann K.A. Mooseker M.S. J.

Chem. 1978; 253: 6297-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of Myr3 was comparable with that of other myosin I molecules from vertebrates (17Conzelmann K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,25Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the dephosphorylated myosin I molecules from protozoa (20Maruta H. Gadasi H. Collins J.H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6297-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was considerably lower as compared with the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of the phosphorylated myosin I molecules from protozoa. Myr3, like the amoeboid myosin I molecules from protozoa, exhibited a peculiar triphasic activation of its Mg-ATPase by F-actin. For the myosin I molecules from protozoa this complex kinetic behavior has been proposed to be due to a second ATP-insensitive high affinity F-actin binding site in their tail domains (26Albanesi J.P. Fujisaki H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11174-11179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11180-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ATP-insensitive F-actin binding site has been mapped to the GPA/GPQ-rich region in these myosin I molecules (8Rosenfeld S.S. Rener B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2322-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Doberstein S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The tail domain of Myr3 lacks such a GPA/GPQ-rich region. Nevertheless, in electron micrographs we observed bundling of actin filaments by Myr3. Similar bundling activity has also been reported for brush border myosin I (17Conzelmann K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), myr1, and myr2 (23Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which also lack a GPA/GPQ-rich region. Therefore, in vitrobundling of actin filaments by myosin I molecules does not necessarily require the presence of a GPA/GPQ-rich region. On the other hand, bundling does not automatically mean complex triphasic activation kinetics, because brush border myosin I and myr2 exhibit simple hyperbolic activation kinetics (17Conzelmann K.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether cross-linking of actin filaments by Myr3 is due to a nucleotide-insensitive actin binding site or rather self-association. This question is of relevance for understanding the mechanism of its complex activation by F-actin. However, in accordance with the lack of a GPA/GPQ-rich region in Myr3, we have not obtained any evidence for a high affinity ATP-insensitive F-actin binding site in actin binding experiments performed with purified Myr3. Therefore, alternative mechanisms for explaining the complex triphasic kinetics cannot be excluded. Surprisingly, the ATPase activity of Myr3 was found to be negatively regulated by micromolar free Ca2+ concentrations. This is exactly the opposite of what has been reported for other vertebrate myosin molecules, which contain calmodulin molecules associated as light chains. Micromolar free Ca2+ concentrations have been shown to activate the Mg-ATPase activities of brush border myosin I, myr1, myosin Iβ, and myosin V (25Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In brush border myosin I and myosin V elevation of free Ca2+ concentrations also led to a partial dissociation of calmodulin light chains (30Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that calmodulin is associated with the Myr3 heavy chain irrespective of the free Ca2+ concentration and, therefore, conclude that binding of Ca2+ to the light chain calmodulin regulates the Myr3 Mg-ATPase activity allosterically. This conclusion is supported by the lack of any modulation of the Mg-ATPase by an excess of exogenously added calmodulin. Binding of the antibody FML 6 or of monovalent Fab fragments to the tail-domain of Myr3 caused an increase in its Mg-ATPase activity. To explain how the binding of an antibody to the tail-domain of a myosin can affect its ATPase activity, further experimentation will be needed. However, one clue comes from the observation that a C-terminally truncated Myr3 fragment also exhibits increased Mg-ATPase activity. Therefore, it seems likely that both the tail binding antibody FML 6 and the truncation at the very C terminus of the tail domain neutralize an inhibitory constraint imposed by the tail domain. This inhibitory constraint might be imposed by the C-terminal SH3 domain that is missing in the truncated Myr3 molecule (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This SH3 domain could bind intramolecularly to proline-rich motifs present in the Myr3 tail domain and thereby inhibit Mg-ATPase activity. An inhibitory function for SH3 domains has already several precedents in protein kinases (33Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We reported previously that intact Myr3 in lung homogenates did not bind significantly to F-actin, whereas a C-terminally truncated Myr3 degradation product did bind to F-actin in an ATP-regulated manner (7Stöffler H.-E. Ruppert C. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now report that intact purified Myr3 binds in an ATP-regulated manner to F-actin. These seemingly contradictory findings might either be explained by removal of a factor(s) during purification interacting with or modifying the C terminus of Myr3 or by disruption of inhibitory intramolecular interactions. These previously reported results, however, are in agreement with our present findings of an inhibitory function of the Myr3 tail domain. Our results suggest that caution should be exercised when comparing data obtained from in vitro motility assays in which the tail domains have been immobilized with data obtained in solution. The mode of immobilization of the tail domain might critically affect the motor activity. Furthermore, these results suggest that in vivo binding partners of myosin tail domains might regulate the motor activity and suggest a novel approach for identifying myosin tail binding partners.

With CCK-8 in the vascular perfusate the rate of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose absorption decreased, whereas the rate of d-fructose absorption was unaffected. The substrate pool size within the tissue during steady-state transport, in the presence and absence of CCK-8, was estimated by compartmental analysis of the 3-O-methyl-d-glucose washout into the vascular bed. When CCK-8 was included in the vascular perfusate, the absorptive cell pool size decreased when compared with untreated tissue. Both the steady-state hexose absorption data and the washout studies indicated that the locus of action of CCK-8 was the SGLT1 transporter located in the brush-border membrane. The SGLT1 protein abundance in isolated brush-border membranes, as quantified by Western blotting, showed a decrease that paralleled the decrease in the steady-state transport rate induced by CCK-8. These results indicate that CCK-8 diminishes the rate of intestinal hexose absorption by decreasing SGLT1 protein abundance in the brush-border membrane of the rat jejunum and therefore provides evidence for acute enteric hormonal regulation of the rate of glucose absorption across the small intestine.

The systemic plasma glucose concentration is normally maintained within a fairly narrow range (4.5–6.5 mm) even during episodic eating. The regulation of this homeostatic process is provided by multiple systems in the body. One of the systems involved in delivering glucose to the systemic circulation through the absorption of carbohydrate-digested products is the small intestine. To this end, the rate at which hexoses are absorbed across the small intestine could be an important factor in influencing the plasma hexose concentration. The gastrointestinal peptide, CCK, 1The abbreviations used are: CCK, cholecystokinin; CCK-8, cholecystokinin octapeptide; 3-O-MG, 3-O-methyl-d-glucopyranose; BBM, brush-boarder membrane; BLM, basolateral membrane. is known to modulate intestinal glucose absorption indirectly by delaying gastric emptying (1Debas H.

Tsang R. Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar). Hormones known to increase intestinal hexose absorption are insulin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and glucagon-like peptide-2 (5Cheeseman C.I. Tsang R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G477-G482PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1965-R1971PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pennington A.M. Corpe C.P. Kellett G.L. J.

Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms involved in altering hexose transport rates include changes in the electrochemical gradient for sodium (8Hopfer U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the affinity of the transporter for glucose (9Debnam E.S. Levin R.J. J. Physiol. 1975; 252: 681-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the amount of functional transporter present in the membrane (10Debnam E.S. Smith M.W. Sharp P.A. Srai S.K. Turvey A. Keable S.J. Eur. J. Phys. 1995; 430: 151-159Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that rapid up-regulation of glucose transport in jejunal enterocytes occurs by a change in the abundance of SGLT1 in the apical membrane (6Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1965-R1971PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ishikawa Y. Eguchi T. Ishida H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The transcellular transport of aldoses (d-glucose, 3-O-MG, and d-galactose) across the absorptive epithelium (enterocytes) involves entry across the BBM using the Na+-dependent transporter (SGLT1) (12Crane R.K. Fed. Proc. 1962; 21: 891-895PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) followed by exit across the BLM via a Na+-independent transporter (GLUT2) (14Davidson N.O. Hausman A.M. Ifkovits C.A. Buse J.B. Gould G.W. Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C795-C800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). d-Fructose, a ketose, enters the enterocyte using a different carrier, a Na+-independent transporter (GLUT5) (14Davidson N.O. Hausman A.M. Ifkovits C.A. Buse J.B. Gould G.W. Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C795-C800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but exits using the same transporter (GLUT2) as the aldoses in the BLM (15Cheeseman C.I. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 1050-1056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Thus, by applying this model and monitoring both aldose and ketose absorption the results would allow for a better understanding of the specificity and locus of action of CCK-8 on hexose absorption. The dually perfused jejunal preparation has been useful in determining the effects of hormones responsible for regulating carbohydrate absorption (4Hirsh A.J. Tsang R. Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pennington A.M. Corpe C.P. Kellett G.L. J. Physiol. 1994; 478: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the locus of action of inhibitors of specific hexose transporters by compartmental analysis (16Boyd C.A.R. Parsons D.S. J. Physiol. 1978; 274: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the simultaneous measurement of aldose and ketose absorption (17Hirsh A.J. Yao S.Y.M. Young J.D. Cheeseman C.I. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To establish if the CCK-8-induced decrease in hexose absorption involves changing the number of transporters in the BBM we measured in each tissue the rate of hexose absorbed over time, using the dually perfused jejunum and then determined the abundance of SGLT1 in the BBM at the specific transport rates at the same perfusion times. In this report we demonstrate that CCK-8 specifically inhibits aldose absorption by decreasing the abundance of the SGLT1 protein located in the BBM of the rat small intestine. Our results establish that the rate at which the jejunum absorbs aldoses is subjected to rapid and specific enteric peptide control of the rate of entry across the BBM. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–350 g) were supplied by Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY. The rats were fed a standard chow diet (Purina PMI Rodent Food) and waterad libitum. Before the start of the experiment, food was withdrawn for approximately 24 h to minimize intestinal lumenal contents during surgery. The study was approved by the Health Sciences Animal Welfare Committee from the Faculty of Medicine. All rats were anesthetized prior to surgery using sodium pentobarbital given by intraperitoneal injection (60 mg/kg body weight) and placed on a heated (37 °C) surgical table. The techniques and apparatus used in these experiments were similar to those described previously (4Hirsh A.J. Tsang R. Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hirsh A.J. Yao S.Y.M. Young J.D. Cheeseman C.I. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After performing a laparotomy, the blood supply to the spleen, rectum, colon, cecum, stomach, and ileum were tied off and the tissues removed; the vasculature to the pancreas and duodenum were also ligated. A 35-cm segment of jejunum, starting 5 cm distal from the ligament of Trietz, was isolated and the lumenal contents removed by gently flushing with 20 ml of warm saline (0.9%), and the jejunum was cannulated at both ends. The lumen was perfused with a Krebs-bicarbonate saline solution (120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmCaCl2) using a GILSON Minipuls 2 pump (Mandel Scientific Ltd). The solution, containing 5 mm 3-O-MG or 5 mm 3-O-MG and 5 mmd-fructose, was maintained at 37 °C and gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Isotopically labeled hexoses, 10 μCi of either 3-O-methyl-d-[1-3H]glucose, or both 3-O-methyl-d-[1-3H]glucose and d-[U-14C]fructose (Amersham Canada Ltd.), were added to the lumenal circuit immediately after portal vein cannulation. The single-pass lumenal circuit was perfused at a flow rate of 1.6 ml/min, and the solution was segmented by 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas bubbles. The gas bubbles were introduced into the lumenal perfusate through a Y piece at a flow rate which ensured that bubbles occupied the diameter of the perfusion tube. This not only exposed the tissue to a saturating gas partial pressure, but also helped to mix the solution in the tissue lumen. After a single-pass through the segment of jejunum the lumenal perfusate was discarded. The aorta, proximal to the superior mesenteric artery, was ligated just prior to insertion of a cannula into the superior mesenteric artery. The single-pass vascular circuit was perfused at a rate of 1.6 ml/min with fresh Krebs-bicarbonate saline solution, containing 5 mmd-glucose, 0.034 mmstreptomycin sulfate, 5 mml-glutamine, 1120 USP units heparin, and 10% w/v Ficoll 70 (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd.) as a plasma expander, which was maintained at 37 °C and gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 maintaining the pH at 7.4. Once the vascular circuit was established, the rat was euthanized and the vascular perfusate was collected via a cannula placed in the hepatic portal vein. CCK-8 was added to the vascular perfusate at final concentrations described in the appropriate figure legend. The effluent was collected continuously for up to 80 min using a GILSON (Mandel Scientific Ltd) fraction collector. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (repeated measure). This procedure is similar to the one used by Boyd and Parsons (16Boyd C.A.R. Parsons D.S. J. Physiol. 1978; 274: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This washout model is useful for indirectly indicating the locus of CCK action. When the labeled 3-O-MG is washed out in the presence of an equimolar concentration of unlabeled mannitol in the lumen, the rate of washout into the vascular bed can be described by the sum of two exponential terms (assuming a two-compartmental model applies). The contributing compartments are a fast releasing (vascular flow rate dependent) and a slow releasing one (vascular flow rate independent), which represent: 1) Q 01 mucosal epithelium layer and 2) Q 02 deeper submucosal (muscle) layer. Assuming that each pool unloads independently, then each pool will have its own rate constant: the fast,K 1 and the slow, K 2. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student'st test. The frozen mucosal scrapings, taken from tissue used to measure hexose absorption after 25 min of perfusion with or without CCK-8 present in the vascular infusate, were thawed at room temperature and then placed in 40 ml of ice-cold mannitol/Tris buffer (300 mm mannitol, 5 mm EGTA, 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The tissue was homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (setting 5) for 2 min before addition of magnesium chloride to a final concentration of 12 mm. After stirring the solution on ice for 15 min the solution was centrifuged at 3,000 × g (Sorval RC5C) for 15 min to remove debris. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min and the pellet homogenized in a mannitol/Tris buffer (150 mm mannitol, 2.5 mmEGTA, 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a glass homogenizer before further addition of magnesium chloride (12 mm). After stirring on ice the centrifugation was repeated as before and the pellet was then washed with 300 mm mannitol, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, before repelleting. This vesicle preparation was diluted in 300 mm mannitol, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to an appropriate protein concentration, usually 8 mg/ml. Brush-border membrane vesicles (see above) (40 μg) from control and CCK-8 treated tissue were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and run on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel using a Mini-PROTEAN II cell (Bio-Rad, Canada). The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) by electrotransfer for 90 min, at 4 °C, using the Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad, Canada). Blocking of the membrane was carried out in 3% nonfat milk in PBST (0.05% Tween 20, phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4), pH 7.4, for 1 h. The blots were incubated in 3% nonfat dry milk in PBST with 1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat SGLT1 (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times in 3% nonfat dry milk, PBST for 15 min. The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with a secondary antibody, anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2,000 in 3% nonfat dry milk, PBST for 1 h. Three subsequent washes followed as described above. Finally, the membrane was treated with the ECL detection solution (Amersham Canada Ltd.) before exposing the Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen from 1 to 4 min. One distinct band was detected by this method with an apparent molecular mass of 71 kDa. Immunoblots were scanned with a Scanjet 4C flatbed scanner (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA), calibrated with a Kodak gray scale. Scanned images were quantified using NIH Image 1.60 software. Results are reported as percentage from protein abundance at steady state rate after 25 min of perfusion with 5 mm 3-O-MG. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. To determine the specificity of CCK-8's actions and to identify which of the transporter proteins are involved in the CCK-induced inhibition of intestinal hexose absorption, both the rates ofd-fructose and 3-O-MG absorption were measured simultaneously in dually perfused jejuna (Fig.2). After the steady-state rate of 3-O-MG transport was achieved (12 min), the rate significantly diminished after CCK-8, 8 pm (the maximum inhibitory concentration) (4Hirsh A.J. Tsang R. Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the vascular infusate. The steady-state rate of 3-O-MG in this preparation is normally maintained for a minimum of 90 min. in the absence of vascular CCK-8 (4Hirsh A.J. Tsang R. Kammila S. Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G755-G761PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state rate of fructose absorption was slower than that of 3-O-MG, and was achieved more slowly (23 min). Also, when CCK-8 was added to the vascular perfusate fructose transport was unaffected (Fig. 2). The fructose data indicates that the locus of CCK-8 action is specific for SGLT1 in the BBM (refer to Fig. 1) so we used compartmental analysis of six separate washout studies of 3-O-MG from the small intestine to confirm this observation. Addition of CCK-8 (8 pm) to the vascular perfusate caused a significant decline in the steady-state transport rate (Fig.3), and analysis of the washout using double exponential decay (Enzfitter software, Elseivier) showed CCK-8 significantly decreased the pool size, Q 01within the epithelium. In contrast the second pool,Q 02, and the rate constantsK 1 and K 2 were not significantly reduced by CCK-8 compared with control conditions (steady-state rate) (Fig. 4, Aand B, and Table I).Figure 4CCK-8 decreases the pool of 3-O-MG in the enterocytes.

Open table in a new tab Control values were obtained from animals when CCK-8 was not added to the vascular infusate, whereas CCK-8 values were from animals when 8 pm CCK-8 was included in the vasculature over 35 min. Values are recorded as mean ± S.E. from three animals (arbitrary values) and were calculated using double exponential decay (Enzfitter) where the initial values were the pool sizes Q 01,Q 02, and K 1 was the first rate constant and K 2 was the second rate constant (min−1). To determine the mechanism involved in the CCK-8-induced decrease in SGLT1-mediated transport, we monitored 3-O-MG absorption and then measured the abundance of SGLT1 protein in tissue after a 25-min perfusion either with or without CCK-8 (8 pm) present in the vascular infusate. A significant decrease in SGLT1 abundance (Fig.5 B) caused by the addition of CCK-8 (8 pm) to the vascular infusate was shown to parallel a decrease in the 3-O-MG absorption (Fig. 5 A), which occurred within 25 min of CCK-8 addition to the vascular circuit. To help make the comparison and determine statistical significance the data were converted to a percent of control values, the change in transport rate and SGLT1 abundance induced by the presence of CCK-8 (8 pm) was 25.2 ± 4 and 36 ± 6.7, respectively, and the changes induced by CCK-8 were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 5 C). Slowing the rate at which d-glucose enters the systemic circulation would improve the ability of the other glucose homeostatic systems to handle the substrate load and therefore contribute to the normalization of the plasma glucose concentration. The results from the simultaneous fructose and 3-O-MG absorption study suggests that GLUT5 in the BBM and GLUT2 in the BLM of the enterocyte, both of which transport fructose, are not affected by CCK-8 and supports the view that CCK acts specifically on SGLT1 (refer to Fig. 1). The only alternative explanation for this data could be that CCK selectively changes the affinity of GLUT2 in the BLM for aldoses and not fructose. What is also noteworthy from the hexose absorption measurements is the lower rate of fructose absorption (2.7-fold slower) compared with that of 3-O-MG (Fig. 2). This slower fructose absorption in rat jejunum is similar to that reported by Holloway and Parsons (18Holloway P.A. Parsons D.S. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a similar dual perfusion technique. The slower rate of fructose absorption we observed could be explained by the different transporters employed in aldose and ketose absorption. d-Fructose entry into the enterocyte is not driven by the Na+ gradient, but is apparently concentration driven, a consequence of the metabolism that occurs in the enterocytes. It is likely that the metabolic fate of fructose is one of the primary determinants in regulating absorption and therefore the rate ofd-fructose absorption depends significantly on the animal's ability to metabolize fructose (19Bismut H. Hers H.-G. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In order to support our hypothesis that CCK-8 acts specifically on the SGLT1 transporter, indicated by the fructose absorption studies, we used compartmental analysis of 3-O-MG washout in the dually perfused jejunum, which showed a significant decrease in the tissue pool size. This method was used previously to indicate the site of the rate-limiting step for hexose and amino acid transport across the enterocyte (16Boyd C.A.R. Parsons D.S. J. Physiol. 1978; 274: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Boyd C.A.R. Parsons D.S. J. Physiol. 1979; 287: 371-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,21Cheeseman C.I. J. Physiol. 1981; 317: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and our data parallel those of Boyd and Parsons (16Boyd C.A.R. Parsons D.S. J. Physiol. 1978; 274: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), who showed that phloridzin, which is known to act specifically on SGLT1, significantly decreased the Q 01 without affecting the washout rate constant. In these experiments CCK-8 also significantly reduced the tissue pool size of 3-O-MG which could only occur if entry across the BBM was reduced, or exit across the BLM was increased. If anything, CCK-8 slowed the exit as measured by the rate constant K 1, although the effect was not statistically significant. Therefore, the reduced tissue pool size most likely results from a decreased uptake across the BBM. Taken together, the compartmental analysis data and the unaffected fructose absorption indicate that CCK's action is to reduce the entry of aldoses across the BBM, i.e. substrates specific for SGLT1. The immunoblots showing a decrease in SGLT1 indicate that CCK is involved in a rapid post translational event which lowers SGLT1 abundance. This could mean that CCK regulates SGLT1 transporter translocation in a manner similar to that for GLUT1 and GLUT4, which occurs in fat and muscle tissue (22James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Additional evidence which supports this type of regulation in the intestine includes the fact that changes occur in the surface area of enterocytes when glucose absorption is increased with epidermal growth factor (23Hardin J.A. Buret A. Meddings J.B. Gall D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G312-G318PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GLP-2 and epinephrine have also been shown to increase SGLT1 abundance in this tissue (6Cheeseman C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R1965-R1971PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ishikawa Y. Eguchi T. Ishida H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is also some evidence, usingXenopus oocytes expressing SGLT1, that protein kinase A and C modulate exocytosis and endocytosis, respectively, of vesicles containing SGLT1 (24Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because the physiological effect of CCK occurs at the BBM, when the peptide is added to the vascular circuit, it is likely that this action is mediated by a cytosolic second messenger and does not occur directly through a receptor mediated endo or exocytosis. The decrease in SGLT1 abundance could result from a reduced rate of insertion of SGLT1 into the BBM, from an increased rate of removal from the BBM, or by decreasing a recycling step. However, the decrease in SGLT1 abundance indicates that the action is not likely to be mediated through the proposed regulatory subunit of SGLT1 (RS1), unless RS1 acts as a chaperone (25Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Puschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzche G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, evidence has suggested that regulation of SGLT1 in rat jejunum is mediated through a protein kinase A phosphorylation (11Ishikawa Y. Eguchi T. Ishida H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), however there are no apparent protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation sites on the rat SGLT1 (24Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This suggests that phosphorylation would likely involve another component involved in insertion or removal of SGLT1 from the BBM, as mentioned above. The establishment of a rapid negative feedback pathway involving CCK for controlling hexose absorption in the small intestine extends the role of the tissue in glucose homeostasis. Instead of an immediate and rapid absorption of all SGLT1 specific substrates, there is a slowing in the rate of transfer while the meal is passing along the small intestine. This would allow for a more gradual introduction of glucose into the body, and would give the other tissues more time to handle this nutrient and serve to help maintain a steady plasma glucose concentration. We are grateful to Dr. S. Barton for assisting in the preparation of this manuscript."

Wild-type and AZT-resistant reverse transcriptases show identical binding to a 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate (AZTMP)-terminated primer/RNA template. On DNA templates, the equilibrium dissociation constant (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub>) for primer/template and AZT-resistant reverse transcriptase (RT) (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> = 4.1 nm) is similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (<i>K</i> <sub>D</sub> = 6.2 nm). However, <i>k</i> <sub>off</sub> is 4–25-fold lower for the AZT-resistant enzyme than for the wild-type enzyme, depending on the nucleotide and the template. The kinetic decay of a wild-type RT/primer/AZTMP-terminated DNA template complex is biphasic. Seventy percent of the initial complex decays with a rate constant greater than 0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>, and 30% with a rate constant of 0.0017 s<sup>−1</sup>. Decay of an AZT-resistant RT/AZTMP-terminated primer/DNA template complex is monophasic, with a rate constant of 0.0018 s<sup>−1</sup>. The last two nucleotides at the 3′ end of the AZTMP-terminated DNA primer in complex with AZT-resistant RT, but not wild-type RT, and a DNA template are protected from exonuclease digestion, suggesting that enhanced binding of the 3′ end of the AZTMP-terminated DNA primer to reverse transcriptase is involved in the mechanism of AZT resistance by human immunodeficiency virus type 1."
https://openalex.org/W2054278017,"Binding of cyclic nucleotide to or autophosphorylation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activates this kinase, but the molecular mechanism of activation for either process is unknown. Activation of PKG by cGMP binding produces a conformational change in the enzyme (Chu, D.-M., Corbin, J. D., Grimes, K. A., and Francis, S. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 31922–31928; Zhao, J., Trewhella, J., Corbin, J., Francis, S., Mitchell, R., Brushia, R., and Walsh, D. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 39129–31936). In the present studies, activation of type Iβ PKG by either autophosphorylation or cGMP-binding alone causes (i) an electronegative charge shift on ion exchange chromatography, (ii) a similar increase (∼3.5 Å) in the Stokes radius as determined by gel filtration chromatography, and (iii) a similar decrease in the mobility of the enzyme on native gel electrophoresis. Consistent with these results, cGMP binding increases the rate of phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 catalyzed dephosphorylation of PKG which is autophosphorylated only at Ser-63 (not activated); however, dephosphorylation of PKG that is highly autophosphorylated (activated) is not stimulated by cGMP. The combined results suggest that activation of PKG by either autophosphorylation or cGMP binding alone produces a similar apparent elongation of the enzyme, implying that either process activates the enzyme by a similar molecular mechanism. Binding of cyclic nucleotide to or autophosphorylation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activates this kinase, but the molecular mechanism of activation for either process is unknown. Activation of PKG by cGMP binding produces a conformational change in the enzyme (Chu, D.-M., Corbin, J. D., Grimes, K. A., and Francis, S. H. (1997) J. Biol.

The combined results suggest that activation of PKG by either autophosphorylation or cGMP binding alone produces a similar apparent elongation of the enzyme, implying that either process activates the enzyme by a similar molecular mechanism. Protein phosphorylation plays key roles in regulating protein function in myriad biological processes. Activation of the protein kinases that catalyze these protein phosphorylations is certainly one of the major mechanisms by which cellular functions are controlled. A particular protein kinase not only phosphorylates one or more cellular proteins (heterophosphorylation), 1The term heterophosphorylation is derived in part from the Greek heteros (other, different), which is compared with the Greek autos (self). Thus, heterophosphorylation refers to phosphorylation of proteins, peptides, or substances other than the kinase itself or a subunit(s) of the kinase itself. The terms heterophosphorylation and autophosphorylation are related in the same way as are heterophagy and autophagy. but it commonly phosphorylates itself as well, a process termed autophosphorylation. Protein kinase autophosphorylation is functionally important, since it frequently alters kinase function, e.g.by increasing the catalytic activity, increasing the affinity for allosteric ligand binding, or increasing the kinase binding to cellular proteins such as those containing SH2 domains. Many protein kinases are activated by either allosteric ligand binding or autophosphorylation (1Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In some cases, ligand binding stimulates the rates of both autophosphorylation and heterophosphorylation. Furthermore, autophosphorylation of some protein kinases increases both the binding affinity for regulatory ligand(s) and the kinase catalytic activity. Therefore, in these instances ligand binding and autophosphorylation act in concert to produce an enhanced activation. The mechanisms of activation of protein kinases by these two processes are still unknown. Although these processes seem quite different, it seems reasonable that similar molecular perturbations may be involved to produce the final activation state for each process. Recently, activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) 2The abbreviations used are: PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; RIIα, regulatory subunit of type IIα PKA; 8-Br-PET-cGMP, β-phenyl-1,N 2etheno-8-bromo-cGMP. by cGMP binding was shown to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (2Chu D.-M.

Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The results show that an increased net negative surface charge and elongation of the enzyme occurs when PKG binds cGMP. These effects are apparently associated with a conformational change that relieves the interaction of the autoinhibitory domain with the catalytic site, thereby activating the protein kinase. Like many other protein kinases, PKG and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) undergo autophosphorylation, and this process affects the kinetic properties of each enzyme (4Erlichman J.

The type Iα or type Iβ PKGs are autophosphorylated at sites in or near their autoinhibitory domains, and this modification of the PKGs increases the kinase activity (minus cyclic nucleotide) (15Landgraf W.

However, the mechanism whereby autophosphorylation activates the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, as well as other protein kinases, is not known (19Colbran R.J. Smith M.K. Schworer C.M.

Whether or not autophosphorylation and allosteric ligand binding could activate the protein kinases by producing a similar conformational change has not been studied. Autophosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor causes a 3–5-Å increase in the apparent Stokes radius of this enzyme (21Cadena D.L. Chan C.-L. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the crystal structure of glycogen phosphorylase reveals that activation by phosphorylation or by the ligand activator, adenosine 5′-monophosphate, causes the same overall conformational change in this protein (22Lin K. Rath V.L. Dai S.C. Fletterick R.J. Hwang P.K. Science. 1996; 273: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the phosphate is not introduced by autophosphorylation in the case of phosphorylase, the same guiding principle will be applied for the present studies,i.e. that activation of PKG by a phosphorylation event,i.e. autophosphorylation, or cyclic nucleotide binding produces a similar conformational change in this enzyme. To assess possible conformational changes of type Iβ PKG produced by cGMP binding and/or autophosphorylation, four different techniques have been used: (i) determining the PKG elution position on ion exchange columns to detect potential difference in surface charge of the enzyme, (ii) determining the elution position of the PKG on gel filtration columns to detect potential difference in mass and shape of the enzyme, (iii) determining the PKG mobility on native gel electrophoresis to detect potential differences in surface charge and shape of the enzyme, and (iv) determining the sensitivity of autophosphorylated PKG to phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 action. The present studies provide the first evidence for a similar molecular activation of a protein kinase by ligand binding and autophosphorylation. Bovine aorta type Iβ PKG was purified to homogeneity as described by Franciset al. (23Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The heterophosphorylation kinase activity of PKG was determined by the phosphocellulose paper assay using heptapeptide substrate (RKRSRAE) as described previously (16Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7734-7741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dimeric regulatory subunit of bovine heart type IIα PKA (RIIα) was purified according to the method of Corbin et al. (24Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. West L. Flockhart D.A. Lincoln T.M. McCarthy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3997-4003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding activity of RIIα was measured by [3H]cAMP binding assay as described previously (25Rannels S.R. Beasley A. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Urea denaturation of RIIα to remove cyclic nucleotides was performed as described by Poteet-Smith et al.

Like native RIIα, this urea-treated cAMP-free RIIα exhibited two active cAMP-binding sites, inhibited the catalytic subunit of PKA stoichiometrically, and had a dimeric structure as verified by determination of the sedimentation coefficient. The cyclic nucleotide contents of the purified proteins were determined using the modified version of the cyclic nucleotide assay previously described by Corbin et al. (27Corbin J.D. Gettys T.W.

Autophosphorylated PKG was prepared by incubating purified type Iβ PKG (38 μg/ml) with 4.8 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 μm cAMP at 30 °C for various times. To assess32P incorporation, an aliquot (10 μl) of this reaction mixture was spotted onto phosphocellulose paper, washed with four changes of 75 mm phosphoric acid, dried, and counted. After incubation, 10 mm EDTA was added to stop the reaction. To remove [γ-32P]ATP and cAMP, the sample was chromatographed at 4 °C either on a Sephadex G-25 (superfine) column (0.9 × 11 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl or on a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.9 × 56 cm) equilibrated in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol (KPEM), and 40 mm NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Aliquots (10 μl) of each fraction were counted in 1 ml of aqueous scintillant to determine the radiolabeled phosphate content, and the protein content of each fraction was measured by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing the peak [32P]PKG were pooled for the experiments. To prepare autophosphorylated type II regulatory subunit of PKA (RIIα), the protein (10 μm) was incubated with 3.5 mmmagnesium acetate, 35 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μm cAMP at 30 °C for 20 min. The same procedures were performed as described above to remove reaction components and to determine 32P incorporation and purification of autophosphorylated RIIα. Purified RIIα contains a trace contamination of catalytic subunit of PKA, which is sufficient to obtain partially autophosphorylated RIIα at Ser-95 (6Rosen O.M. Erlichman J. Rubin C.S. Adv.

Under the conditions used, the phosphate incorporation was ∼0.75 mol of32P/mol of RIIα subunit. A mixture of purified unphosphorylated and 32P-labeled autophosphorylated PKG that had been preincubated in the absence or presence of cGMP was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (0.9 × 10 cm) equilibrated in KPEM at 4 °C and analyzed as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Aliquots of each fraction were counted to determine the phosphate content of the kinase. The unphosphorylated PKG was used as an internal control to normalize the elution position of 32P-autophosphorylated PKG or cGMP-bound PKG. For experiments utilizing cGMP-bound PKG, the column was pre-equilibrated with KPEM containing 100 μm cGMP, and the KPEM elution buffer also contained 100 μm cGMP to assure that the cGMP-binding sites of the enzyme remained saturated with cGMP during chromatography. The cGMP concentration in the KPEM buffer was determined by measuring absorbance (molar extinction coefficient for cGMP, ε252 = 13,700). Purified unphosphorylated or32P-labeled autophosphorylated PKG that had been preincubated in the absence or presence of 100 μm cGMP was combined with crystalline catalase (4 mg) in a total volume of 500 μl. The mixture was shaken gently to dissolve the catalase and then loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (0.9 × 168 cm) equilibrated with KPEM buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C. The catalase served as an internal standard for all of the gel chromatographies. Fractions were collected and analyzed as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine the phosphate content of the enzyme, the radiolabeled phosphate was measured in aliquots of each fraction by scintillation counting. In experiments in which PKG was presaturated with cGMP, the column was pre-equilibrated with 100 μmcGMP, and the column running buffer also contained 100 μmcGMP. Because cGMP in the column buffer interfered with the absorbance at 280 nm, absorbance at 400 nm was used to determine the elution position of catalase for those experiments involving cGMP-bound PKG. To compare the effect of different wavelength absorbances on the apparent elution position of catalase, absorbances at both 280 and 400 nm were compared for several purified PKG experiments, and the elution position of the catalase peak was the same by either technique. Apparent Stokes radii of purified unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated PKG in the presence and absence of cGMP were determined by the method described previously (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D.

The apparent molecular weights, frictional ratios, and axial ratios were calculated according to the method of Siegel and Monty (28Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), together with the procedures of Cohn and Edsall (29Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York1943: 424-425Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated PKG was produced by incubating 130 μl of 0.1 mg/ml type Iβ PKG in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 40 μm cAMP, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 μm[32P]ATP at 30 °C for 7 min (partially autophosphorylated) or 2 h (highly autophosphorylated). Partially autophosphorylated enzyme contained nearly stoichiometric phosphate at Ser-63, whereas highly autophosphorylated enzyme contained approximately stoichiometric amounts of phosphate at Ser-63 and was nearly saturated at Ser-79. The autophosphorylated PKG was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column (0.9 × 48 cm) equilibrated in 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the peak fractions of activity were pooled for use in the phosphoprotein phosphatase reaction. 0.025 unit/ml phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (Promega) was preincubated at 4 °C for 15 min in 400 μl of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, in the absence or presence of 15 μm cGMP or 50 μm cAMP. 192 μl of a final concentration of 1 μm partially or highly autophosphorylated PKG were added, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for varying amounts of time. 15-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were removed at certain time points and placed in a tube containing a final concentration of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10% trichloroacetic acid in a total volume of 540 μl. The tubes were vortexed, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. 450-μl aliquots of the supernatant were counted in the scintillation counter to determine the total amount of free phosphate present. 15-μl aliquots of the incubation mixture were counted at each time point to determine the total amount of phosphate present. The amount of free phosphate was divided by the total amount of phosphate to determine the percentage of phosphate released. The enzymes were electrophoresed on a 9.5% polyacrylamide gel and 4% stacking gel without sodium dodecyl sulfate at 4 °C using constant current (∼10 mA) for 5 h as previously described (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The proteins were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. All materials were obtained as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cAMP and cGMP contents of the purified type Iβ PKG were measured as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cyclic nucleotide occupancy of cGMP-binding sites of purified PKG used for the following experiments was less than 3%. Previous studies suggest that the purified PKGs are not significantly phosphorylated at the autophosphorylation sites that alter catalytic activity or cyclic nucleotide-binding affinity (18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The purified PKG also had a very low basal kinase activity ratio (−/+ cGMP ∼0.05). Therefore, the purified type Iβ PKG was considered to be cyclic nucleotide-free and not autophosphorylated. To prepare cGMP-bound PKG, the enzyme was incubated with unlabeled cGMP (∼500-fold excess of cGMP-binding sites) at 4 °C overnight, and equal occupation of the two intrasubunit cGMP-binding sites was verified as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For native gel electrophoresis experiments, purified PKG was incubated with unlabeled cGMP or cGMP analog, 8-Br-PET-cGMP, as described above to obtain cyclic nucleotide-bound PKG. Autophosphorylated type Iβ PKG was prepared by incubating purified enzyme in the presence of cAMP, magnesium acetate, and [γ-32P]ATP followed by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column to remove cAMP and other reactants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After overnight incubation (highly autophosphorylated), the enzyme contained ∼2 mol of 32P/mol of subunit with equal distribution of the phosphate between Ser-63 and Ser-79. The stoichiometry of 2 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of subunit indicated that these sites were largely in the dephosphorylated state in the purified enzyme before autophosphorylation. The increased phosphate content of the enzyme increased the basal heterophosphorylation activity in the absence of cGMP by ∼5-fold. When the PKG was incubated for only 7 min (partially autophosphorylated), the phosphate incorporation was ∼0.5 mol of 32P/mol of subunit, and basal heterophosphorylation activity did not increase. The results confirmed that autophosphorylation of type Iβ PKG at Ser-79, which is slowly autophosphorylated, causes the increase in kinase activity, whereas the rapid autophosphorylation at Ser-63 does not (18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since autophosphorylation of PKG was performed in the presence of cAMP, it was necessary to verify that cyclic nucleotide was removed by the gel filtration step. The measured cAMP and cGMP contents of autophosphorylated enzyme were calculated to be less than 10% occupancy of cGMP-binding sites of the protein so that the autophosphorylated PKG Iβ used for subsequent experiments was essentially cyclic nucleotide-free unless cGMP was purposely included. When a mixture of predominantly purified unphosphorylated PKG and a trace amount of purified 32P-radiolabeled autophosphorylated type Iβ PKG was chromatographed on a DEAE-Sephacel column as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the peak of autophosphorylated enzyme activity eluted at higher ionic strength and was partially separated from the bulk of the unphosphorylated enzyme activity (Fig.1). Fractions containing the32P-labeled enzyme showed a higher kinase activity ratio (−/+ cGMP ∼0.4) than did fractions containing unphosphorylatec enzyme (−/+ cGMP ∼ 0.1). The 32P-labeled enzyme eluting at the highest ionic strength had the highest phosphate content (1.5 mol/subunit) and also had the highest kinase activity ratio (Fig.1). The autophosphorylated PKG used for the experiment of Fig. 1 was not quantitatively phosphorylated at the two autophosphorylation sites, Ser-63 and Ser-79; furthermore, separation of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PKG forms was not complete. To achieve optimum resolution of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PKGs, the respective enzymes were first chomatographed on DEAE-Sephacel as described in Fig. 1. In a subsequent experiment, PKG in fractions that eluted at the lowest ionic strength as shown in Fig. 1 were used for the unphosphorylated enzyme, and the PKG in enzyme fractions that eluted at the highest ionic strength were used for the phosphorylated PKG. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a mixture of the unphosphorylated PKG and a trace amount of the32P-radiolabeled autophosphorylated type Iβ PKG was then rechromatographed on a DEAE-Sephacel column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The peak of autophosphorylated enzyme activity eluted at higher ionic strength and was well separated from the bulk of the unphosphorylated enzyme activity (Fig. 2, top panel). When the unphosphorylated PKG was preincubated with cGMP and chromatographed in the presence of buffer containing 100 μm cGMP, the peak of cGMP-bound enzyme activity also eluted at higher ionic strength (Fig. 2, compare kinase profiles in thetop and bottom panels). However, there was no additive effect resulting from a combination of cGMP and autophosphorylation (Fig. 2, compare 32P profiles in thetop and bottom panels). The shift in elution position did not occur when PKG was partially autophosphorylated using a 7-min incubation (data not shown). Partial autophosphorylation of type Iβ PKG is associated with the incorporation of phosphate at Ser-63 (18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and not associated with an increase in basal kinase activity. However, when this partially autophosphorylated enzyme was preincubated with cGMP and chromatographed in the presence of buffer containing 100 μm cGMP, the peak of PKG activity was shifted to a higher ionic strength (data not shown) that was similar to the elution position of the unphosphorylated PKG in the presence of 100 μm cGMP. The fact that autophosphorylated or cGMP-bound PKG eluted at higher ionic strength from the DEAE column than did the control enzyme indicated that either autophosphorylation or cGMP binding increased the net negative surface charge of the enzyme to produce an electronegative charge shift. Since the covalent phosphates or bound cGMP molecules possess negative charges, a surface location of either the phosphate introduced by autophosphorylation or the cyclic phosphate of the cGMP molecule could be responsible for this effect. However, several reports have suggested that negative charges of the bound cGMP molecules in PKG are not near the surface of the protein (30Su Y. Dostmann W.R.G. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.-H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 31Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 32Weber I.T. Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since the autophosphorylated enzyme eluted at noticeably higher ionic strength than did the cGMP-bound enzyme, it cannot be ruled out that some of the charge shift produced by autophosphorylation is due to surface phosphates per se. It seems plausible that activation of PKG by autophosphorylation and/or cGMP binding causes a similar conformational change that results in increased net surface electronegativity of each isoform, and that the greater DEAE column shift produced by autophosphorylation is due to extra surface charges contributed by the phosphates. The fact that the effects of cGMP and autophosphorylation were not additive is consistent with this proposal. Unphosphorylated and highly autophosphorylated type Iβ PKGs were chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column in the presence of the internal standard catalase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The highly autophosphorylated PKG eluted earlier from the column than did the unphosphorylated form of this enzyme (Fig.3, A and B). When the enzyme was preincubated with cGMP and chromatographed in the presence of buffer containing 100 μm cGMP, the kinase again eluted earlier than did the control, and there was no significant difference in elution position of this enzyme compared with the respective autophosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 3, compare B andC). There was no additional shift in elution position of the autophosphorylated PKG when chromatographed in the presence of cGMP (data not shown). Again, partial autophosphorylation (7-min incubation) of PKG did not produce a detectable shift in elution position on the S-300 column (data not shown). The results using gel filtration indicated that activation of PKG by autophosphorylation and/or cGMP binding produces a similar shift in elution position of the enzyme. As was shown for DEAE anion-exchange chromatography (see above), the combination of autophosphorylation and cGMP binding does not produce an additive shift. These results are consistent with in vitrokinase activation studies which indicate that in the presence of saturating concentration of cyclic nucleotides, autophosphorylation of PKG does not increase the kinase catalytic activity (18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Stokes radii of different forms of type Iβ PKG were calculated from the results of gel filtration as described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As can be seen in TableI, the Stokes radii of autophosphorylated and cGMP-bound PKGs were ∼3.5 Å larger than the Stokes radii of the unphosphorylated enzyme, and there was no significant difference in the sedimentation coefficients for these autophosphorylated and unphosphorylated enzymes. The calculated apparent molecular weights indicated that the shifts in elution position of the PKG were not large enough to be due to oligomerization of the dimeric enzyme. Furthermore, the added mass of either the four bound cGMP molecules (367 Da each) or four phosphate groups (80 Da each) to the dimeric PKG would be insufficient to produce a size shift of this magnitude. The axial ratios (Table I) suggested that the autophosphorylated and cGMP-bound forms are more elongated proteins when compared with the unphosphorylated or cyclic nucleotide-free enzyme, and this elongation is reflected in an increase in the apparent Stokes radius. The findings from both anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography indicated that activation of type Iβ PKG by autophosphorylation or cGMP binding produces a similar apparent conformational change with elongation of the enzymes and increased net negative surface charge.Table IPhysical parameters of type Iβ unphosphorylated and autophosphorylated cGMP-dependent protein kinase in the absence and presence of cGMPEnzymeStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientCalculatedM r1-aMolecular mass is calculated from Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient (see text).Frictional ratioAxial ratioÅs20,wf/f0length/widthcGMP-free47.8 ± 0.27.1 ± 0.1141,0001.406.0Phospho-form50.7 ± 0.31-bSignificantly greater than cGMP-free PKG Iβ value (p < 0.005).6.8 ± 0.1143,0001.466.9cGMP-bound51.3 ± 0.11-bSignificantly greater than cGMP-free PKG Iβ value (p < 0.005).6.9 ± 0.1147,0001.477.0Phospho-form + cGMP-bound51.3 ± 0.21-bSignificantly greater than cGMP-free PKG Iβ value (p < 0.005).6.9 ± 0.1147,0001.477.0For Stokes radii or sedimentation coefficients, values are mean ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab For Stokes radii or sedimentation coefficients, values are mean ± S.D. (n > 3). Native gel electrophoresis was also used to detect differences in molecular parameters of unphosphorylated, autophosphorylated, and cyclic nucleotide-bound type Iβ PKG according to the method described by Chu et al. (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both highly autophosphorylated and 8-Br-PET-cGMP-bound PKGs exhibited the same mobility on native gels, and this mobility was less than that of the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme (Fig.4 A). PKG has a high affinity for 8-Br-PET-cGMP, and this analog has been shown to remain bound to the enzyme during native gel electrophoresis (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the enzymes were presaturated with cGMP (or 8-Br-PET-cGMP) and then electrophoresed in the presence of 100 μm cGMP, the mobility of the PKGs was the same irrespective of each treatment (Fig. 4 B). This mobility was also the same as that obtained for either the autophosphorylated or cGMP analog-bound PKG in Fig. 4 A. Both autophosphorylation and cGMP analog together did not produce an additive effect on mobility (Fig. 4 B). The apparent increase in the surface electronegativity of autophosphorylated or cGMP-saturated PKG using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography would be predicted to increase the mobility of the enzyme toward the anode using native gel electrophoresis. However, the mobility of the type Iβ PKG in the gel is decreased and is consistent with a conformational change that increases the apparent size of the protein upon activation by either autophosphorylation or cyclic nucleotide binding. These results confirm the interpretation of the previous results from gel filtration analysis. As described earlier (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the cAMP-free RIIα of PKA was used as a control for each of the three approaches described above. The cAMP-free, autophosphorylated RIIα and the cAMP-bound RIIα were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then subjected to DEAE ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, as well as native gel electrophoresis. Neither autophosphorylation nor cAMP binding produced a detectable electronegative charge shift on DEAE chromatography (data not shown). There was also no shift in elution position of autophosphorylated or cAMP-bound RIIα on gel filtration chromatography, and no mobility shift on native gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that introduction of extra charge or mass by addition of the phosphates or four cAMP molecules is not sufficient to change the surface charge or increase the mass to produce a shift of the RIIα using these procedures. A similar conformational change caused by autophosphorylation or cGMP binding is a more reasonable explanation for the findings using PKG. Type Iβ PKG contains two autophosphorylation sites (Ser-63 and Ser-79) (17Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20748-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of Ser-63 occurs first, but significant enzyme activation occurs only after subsequent autophosphorylation of Ser-79 (18Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20756-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of partially autophosphorylated (Ser-63 only) and highly autophosphorylated (Ser-63 and Ser-79) type Iβ PKG by phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 in the presence and absence of cyclic nucleotide was compared. It can be seen that both cGMP and cAMP sharply increased the rate of dephosphorylation of partially autophosphorylated (Ser-63 only) enzyme (Fig.5 A), but neither cGMP nor cAMP significantly altered dephosphorylation of the highly autophosphorylated enzyme, i.e. enzyme that was autophosphorylated at both Ser-63 and Ser-79 (Fig. 5 B). The dephosphorylation of PKG that was autophosphorylated only at Ser-63 was stimulated 3–5 fold in 0.5–1.5 min. (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, using highly autophosphorylated PKG (Fig. 5 B), it is unlikely that the stimulatory effect of cGMP on phospho-serine 63 would be masked by the absence of an effect of cGMP on dephosphorylation of phospho-serine 79. When highly autophosphorylated PKG was used as substrate, the relative rates of dephosphorylation of phospho-serine 63 and phospho-serine 79 by phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 were comparable as assessed by thin layer chromatography of the phosphopeptides (not shown). It is of interest that the dephosphorylation rate appears to be greater when using the partially autophosphorylated PKG as substrate, but whether this is due to an inhibitory effect of phospho-serine 79 on the dephosphorylation rate requires further study. The data suggest that activation of the PKG by ligand binding (cGMP or cAMP) or by autophosphorylation (both Ser-63 and Ser-79) produces a similar conformational change. Thus, an effect of either cGMP or cAMP on dephosphorylation would be expected only when using the enzyme that is in the inactive conformation (phosphorylated at Ser-63 only). These results using a predominantly enzymatic approach are consistent with those using the chromatographic and electrophoretic approaches. It should be emphasized that the techniques developed here to resolve cGMP-bound and -free PKG, or phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PKG, could be used for crude systems as well as for purified PKG. The approach of measuring changes in the protein phosphatase sensitivity of the PKG that has been activated by different processes is also novel. Therefore, the techniques offer new approaches for studies of interconversion of these forms of PKG in intact tissues treated with various modulators. These techniques may also be useful in studying other proteins (33Francis S.H. Chu D.-M Thomas M.K. Beasley A. Grimes K. Busch J.L. Turko I.V. Haik T.L. Corbin J.D. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 14: 81-92Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including homologous protein kinases that are activated by ligands or autophosphorylation. In the present studies, autophosphorylation of PKG caused an apparent conformational change that is similar to the elongation of PKG that is produced by cGMP binding (2Chu D.-M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R.

The finding that cGMP does not enhance the protein phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 sensitivity of the highly autophosphorylated PKG is consistent with this conclusion. Either autophosphorylation or cyclic nucleotide binding, or a combination of these processes, can activate catalysis in cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (4Erlichman J. Rosenfield R.

This induced structural change in the PKG is associated with conversion of the enzyme from a more compact inactive conformation to a more elongated active conformation and may represent the classical interconversion of enzymes between two states, i.e. an inactive T state that has low affinity for substrates and the active R state that has high affinity for substrates (34Monod J. Wyman J. Changeaux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase provides one example of the conversion of an enzyme from the T state to the R state, and this is effected by either a phosphorylation event or by ligand binding, i.e. 5′-AMP (35Johnson L.N. Barford D. Owen D.J. Noble M.E.M. Garman E.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 11-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active conformation that is produced by either process is essentially the same. It is suggested that either cGMP binding or autophosphorylation produces a similar perturbation to cause activation in each monomer of dimeric PKG. This perturbation within the monomers results in an elongation of the dimeric structure. The results of the present study are consistent with such an interconversion in PKG. Since many protein kinases are activated by both ligands and autophosphorylation, these findings could be relevant to the activation mechanism for some of these enzymes as well.

In this study, we show that the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans possesses two ASMs, termed ASM-1 and ASM-2 encoded by two distinct genes, but lacks detectable neutral sphingomyelinase activity. The C. elegans ASMs are about 30% identical with each other and with the human and murine enzymes. The conserved regions include a saposin-like domain, proline-rich domain, and a putative signal peptide. In addition, 16 cysteines distributed throughout the molecules, and selected glycosylation sites, are conserved. The expression of these genes in C. elegansis regulated during development. Asm-1 is preferentially expressed in the embryo, whereas asm-2 is predominantly expressed in postembryonic stages. When transfected as Flag-tagged proteins into COS-7 cells, ASM-1 is found almost entirely in a secreted form whereas only 20% of ASM-2 is secreted. Only the secreted forms display enzymatic activity. Furthermore, ASM-2 requires addition of Zn2+ to be fully active, whereas ASM-1 is active in the absence of cation. C. elegans is the first organism to display two ASMs. This finding suggests the existence of an ASM gene family.

The sphingomyelin pathway is an ubiquitous signaling system linking a specific set of cell surface receptors and environmental stresses through to the intracellular signaling apparatus (1Testi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This pathway is initiated by hydrolysis of the phospholipid sphingomyelin (N-acylsphingosine-1-phosphocholine) which is preferentially concentrated in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (2Spiegel S. Merrill A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin hydrolysis occurs via the action of sphingomyelin specific forms of phospholipase C, termed sphingomyelinases (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases; EC 3.1.4.12). Ceramide, generated by this reaction, acts as a second messenger and initiates cell type specific signaling. Sphingomyelinases are categorized as alkaline, neutral, or acid according to their pH optima. Alkaline sphingomyelinase is found mostly in intestinal mucosa and bile (3Duan R.D. Nyberg L. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4Duan R.D. Hertervig E. Nyberg L. Hauge T. Sternby B. Lillienau J. Farooqi A. Nilsson A. Dig. Dis.

Alkaline sphingomyelinase possesses an optimum pH at 9 and is Zn2+- and Mg2+-independent. Alkaline sphingomyelinase may play a role in the digestion of dietary sphingomyelin. A neutral sphingomyelinase is found in many, if not all, tissues. The neutral sphingomyelinase is membrane-bound, Mg2+-dependent, and displays a pH optimum of 7.4 (6Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-48PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding the mammalian neutral sphingomyelinase is yet to be identified. In addition to the membrane-bound form, a cytosolic cation-independent form of neutral sphingomyelinase has been described (7Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASM, 1The abbreviations used are: ASM, acid sphingomyelinase; hASM, human ASM; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NPD, Niemann-Pick disease; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. possessing optimum pH between 4.5 and 5.5, is found in all mammalian cells (8Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The human and murine ASMs are the products of a conserved gene and at the amino acid level share 82% identity. The hASM gene encodes a 629-amino acid glycoprotein with a calculated molecular mass of 64 kDa (9Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human ASM contains a signal sequence at the N terminus comprised of five leucine-alanine repeats. This signal peptide may present a hydrophobic core and play a role in targeting the ASM into the endoplasmic reticulum. There are six potential N-linked glycosylation sites (amino acids 86, 175, 335, 395, 503, and 520, respectively) in hASM. Site-directed mutagenesis studies show that five of these sites (amino acid 86, 175, 335, 395, and 520) are glycosylated in COS-1 cells (10Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Elimination of any of these sites results in various degrees of decreased enzyme activity. A similar result is found in the murine ASM (11Newrzella D. Stoffel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32089-32095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An N-terminal region of the hASM (residues 89–165) is found to be highly homologous to the sphingolipid activator protein saposin and may possess lipid-binding and/or sphingomyelinase activator properties (12Ponting C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Within this saposin-like domain are six cysteine residues (residues 89, 92, 120, 131, 157, and 165) that may participate in formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges. A proline-rich domain (amino acid 182–197) is located immediately after the second glycosylation site and may act as a flexible hinge region linking the activation domain (saposin-like domain) and the C-terminal putative enzymatic domain. ASMs are found in cellular and secreted forms in mammalian cells (13Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This appears to reflect post-translational processing of the primary gene product. The secreted form of ASM is Zn2+ stimulated. In contrast, the lysosomal form is not Zn2+ stimulable, which may result from acquisition of cellular Zn2+ during the lysosomal targeting process (13Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mammalian ASM is subject to substantial post-translational proteolysis. Sandhoff and co-workers (14Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Vielhaber G. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) found that the sphingomyelinase gene product manifests an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa in SDS-PAGE, and is subsequently processed to a 72-kDa form or alternately to a 57-kDa form. All three forms are found in COS-1 cell lysates. Tabas and co-workers (15Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) found that macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells secrete substantial amounts of the high molecular weight form of ASM. Secretion of this form is increased by cytokine stimulation, perhaps by increasing the flux of the ASM precursor through the Golgi-secretory pathway. There is emerging evidence suggesting that caveolae, putative plasma membrane microdomains, may be important sites for ligand-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis via ASM (16Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). ASM has been shown to be involved in cytokine and cellular stress signaling cascades. A number of studies showed that CD95 and the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor activate ASM during induction of apoptosis, perhaps via a mechanism requiring the death domain of these receptors (17Cai Z. Bettaieb A. El Mahdani N. Legres L.G. Stancou R. Masliah J. Chouaib S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6918-6926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In vitro, lymphoblasts from patients with Niemann-Pick disease (NPD), a genetic deficiency of ASM, andin vivo, endothelium from ASM knock-out mice, fail to generate ceramide and undergo apoptosis upon radiation exposure (19Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Furthermore, retroviral transfer of the hASM cDNA into NPD lymphoblasts restored ASM activity into the normal range, and conferred radiation-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. Similarly, Debatin and co-workers (18Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) found that NPD fibroblasts were deficient in UV- and anthracycline-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis, and linked ceramide generation to transcriptional up-regulation of CD95 ligand (18Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In this regard, Dong and co-workers (20Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) found that ASM activity is essential for UV-induced c-Jun kinase activation, which may be involved in transcriptional regulation of the apoptotic response. It should be noted, however, that ceramide can also signal apoptosis in a transcriptionally independent fashion since ceramide signals mitochondrial permeability transition, reactive oxygen species generation and release of apoptosis initiating factor in cytoplasts from murine 2B4.11 T cells (21Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Macho A. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 512-521PubMed Google Scholar). This latter event is inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Whether the secreted form of ASM may play a role in stress signaling is presently uncertain (22Schissel S.L. Jiang X.-C. Tweedie-Hardman J. Jeong T. Camejo E.H. Najib J. Rapp J.H. Williams K. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2738-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model for studying signal transduction. C. elegans and mammalian cells share numerous genes encoding proteins involved in conserved signal transduction pathways. Some of these pathways, such as the those involved in vulval development or programmed cell death, are well defined in C. elegans. However, the existence of a sphingomyelinase signaling system has not yet been demonstrated. In fact, no gene or biochemical activity corresponding to a C. elegans sphingomyelinase has been described. In this study, we show that C. elegans possesses two distinct, evolutionarily related, ASMs. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and rTth DNA polymerase, XL were from Perkin-Elmer (Branchburg, NJ). Genomyx Δ-Genozyme Cycle Sequencing Kit was from Genomyx (Foster City, CA). Random Primers DNA Labeling System was from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaitherburg, MD). Bristol (N2) C. elegans was used throughout these studies and maintained as described previously (23Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, worms were grown at 22 °C in 60-mm plates containing 3 ml of nematode growth medium agar carrying a lawn of OP50, a leaky uracil-requiring strain of Escherichia coli. Worms were harvested by washing them off the plates with ice-cold 0.1 m NaCl. Dead worms were separated by centrifugation in 30% (w/w) sucrose at 600 × g for 5 min. Live worms were resuspended in 0.1 m NaCl at 22 °C for 30 min to allow the complete digestion of bacteria remaining in the nematode guts and then washed three times with 0.1 m NaCl. Generally, 60 mg of worms can be recovered from a 60-mm plate. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaitherburg, MD) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. To measure ASM activity, cells or worms were suspended in 0.2% Triton X-100 and disrupted at 4 °C using a hand held homogenizer (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) for 2 min. Cells debris was removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. Lysates were incubated in ASM assay buffer (250 mmsodium acetate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 5.0) containing various concentrations of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (47 mCi/mmol, Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL) in a final volume of 60 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. Radioactive phosphorylcholine was extracted with 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) into the upper aqueous phase and analyzed by scintillation counting. To measure neutral sphingomyelinase activity, cells or worms were suspended in a buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mmNa2MoO4, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 750 μm ATP, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 0.2% Triton X-100), and homogenized and centrifuged as above. Lysates were incubated in neutral sphingomyelinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing various concentrations of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin, and sphingomyelinase activity was determined as described for ASM assay. By searching theC. elegans genomic sequence data base for homologs of the hASM gene, we identified two regions of genomic DNA that showed significant sequence similarity to hASM. These regions were contained within two predicted genes, B0252.2 (asm-1) and ZK455.4 (asm-2), defined by the C. elegans sequencing project at Washington University. The cDNA of asm-1 andasm-2 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR with primer pairs flanking the predicted start and stop codons. Briefly, total RNA from mixed stages of N2 C. elegans was purified using RNAzol (Biotecx, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcriptase using oligo(dT) as primer (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.11-8.13Google Scholar) and then used as template in PCR using primers flanking the predicted start and stop codon (asm-1, GAAACTCTGGAAATGAGGATAA and TGTACAAGGTCTTTGAAATGAT; andasm-2, TGAAAATACATCTGAGAA and ATGCAGCAGCCTCTCATTATT). The PCR products were fractionated in agarose gels, excised, and extracted using the QIAEX GEL Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Chatsworth, CA). The resulting DNA was cloned into pCRII using the TA cloning system from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). The DNA inserts were sequenced using SP6 and T7 primers (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The Flag epitope tag was introduced at the C terminus of asm-1 cDNA by PCR using T7 primer as the 5′ primer and CGGGATCCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAAAAGTTGGACAAAG as the 3′ primer. The PCR products generated from pCRII/asm-1 were digested with BamHI and NotI, and the resulting fragment was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For constructing the asm-2expression vector, 5′ primer (GGGGTACCGCCACCATGCAGCAGCCTCTCATTATT) containing the asm-2 start codon and 3′ primer (CCGCTCGAGTCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTTTTGTTAAATGATCA) with the Flag sequence following the C terminus sequence of asm-2were used in PCR to generate the Flag-tagged asm-2. The Flag-asm-2sequence was subcloned into pCEP4 usingXhoI and KpnI sites. Mixed stages worms and eggs, prepared by the method of Sulston and Hodgkin (25Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 603-605Google Scholar), were used for isolation of total RNA. For Northern blot analysis, 30 μg of RNA was fractionated on a 1.0% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide to determine the adequacy of RNA loading. The RNA was transferred to a BA-85 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) with 10 × SSC. Hybridization was carried out using ExpressHyb fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Pine Alto, CA) with [32P]dCTP-labeled full-length asm-1 andasm-2 cDNA as probes. The membrane then was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Molecular weights of the asm transcripts were determined by comparison to RNA molecular weight markers (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according the manufacturer's protocol. At 48 h post-transfection, cell culture medium was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the secreted Flag-tagged ASM was immunoprecipitated. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% deoxycholate) containing the protease inhibitor mixture tablet Complete (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). The homogenate was spun at 16,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation. Flag-tagged ASM-1 and ASM-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the medium or cell lysate using the anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Scientific Imaging System, New Haven, CT) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed six times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) containing the protease inhibitor mixture tablet. Beads then were resuspended in sphingomyelinase assay buffer to measure acid or neutral sphingomyelinase activities. To estimate the protein content in the enzymatic reaction, the immunoprecipitate was fractionated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with colloidal silver. Then the protein content was estimated by comparison to known quantities of bovine serum albumin standard. Prior studies demonstrated that sphingomyelin accounts for 8% of the total phospholipid in C. elegans, suggesting that enzymes capable of sphingomyelin hydrolysis might exist in these animals. Table I shows, using an assay optimized for the mammalian enzyme, that mixed stages C. elegans possesses ASM activity. The specific activity of theC. elegans ASM was similar to that of hASM found in HL-60 cells. This ASM activity is from C. elegans and not due to contamination with E. coli, since E. coli does not manifest any sphingomyelinase activity under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, Zn2+ (0–10 mm) did not significantly increase ASM activity in lysates of N2 mixed stages worms (data not shown). In contrast, C. elegans did not display neutral sphingomyelinase activity in lysates (Table I) or in isolated microsomal membrane whether or not ATP, Mg2+, or various protease or phosphatase inhibitors were included in the reaction buffer (data not shown).Table IC. elegans possesses acid but not neutral sphingomyelinase activityEnzyme sourceSphingomyelinase activitypH 5.0pH 7.4nmol/mg/hC. elegans11.7 ± 1.00HL-605.7 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2Lysates were prepared from mixed stages C. elegans (N2) and HL-60 cells, and sphingomyelinase activity was determined at pH 5.0 and pH 7.4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Lysates were prepared from mixed stages C. elegans (N2) and HL-60 cells, and sphingomyelinase activity was determined at pH 5.0 and pH 7.4 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found two regions in the C. elegans genomic DNA containing deduced open reading frames with significant identity to the human and murine ASM genes. These regions, found in cosmid B0252.2 located on chromosome II and in cosmid ZK455.4 located on chromosome X, were designated as asm-1 and asm-2, respectively. The cDNAs of asm-1 and asm-2 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The asm-1and asm-2 cDNAs contain single large open reading frames which encode polypeptides of 564 and 619 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). Several lines of evidence suggest that these two coding sequences are complete. 1) Northern blot analysis using asm-1 orasm-2 cDNA as probes identified both 1.8 and 2.0 kilobase mRNAs, respectively, which correspond to the lengths of the cloned cDNAs (see below, Fig. 2); 2) Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody generated in rabbits against full-length hASM, shows that the endogenous ASM-1 and ASM-2 in C. elegans exhibit the same size as their recombinant counterpart expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown); 3) reverse transcription-PCR of the asm-1 mRNA indicated that the 5′ end of this transcript is trans-spliced to a SL1 leader sequence 12 bases upstream of the putative start codon (data not shown). Although asm-2 RNA was not trans-spliced to SL1 or SL2, there was no other potential start codon in the genomic sequence upstream of the predicted initiating methionine (data not shown). Comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences revealed that bothasm-1 and asm-2 consist of 11 exons.Figure 2Sphingomyelinase gene expression in C. elegans. Thirty μg of total C. elegans RNA from mixed stages (A) and embryos (B) was electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. For Northern analysis, RNA was probed with the indicated cDNA probes and subjected to autoradiography. Data represent one of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proteins encoded by asm-1 and asm-2 are 32% identical with each other. Furthermore, ASM-1 and ASM-2 share 30 and 33% identity with hASM, respectively. ASM-1 and ASM-2 share several functional domains with hASM. As in the hASM, there is a putative secretory signal peptide at the N terminus of both ASM-1 and ASM-2 (Fig. 1, italicized). Furthermore, 16 cysteine residues dispersed throughout the protein sequence are highly conserved between the hASM, ASM-1, and ASM-2 (in red). Similar to the hASM, ASM-1 and ASM-2 possess a saposin-like domain (bracketed) in the N terminus followed by a proline-rich domain (underlined; truncated in ASM-1). Seven putativeN-linked glycosylation sites are found in ASM-1, whereas five are found in ASM-2. Among these N-linked glycosylation sites, site 351 in ASM-1 and sites 159 and 523 in ASM-2 are conserved with respect to the human sequence. Although the human and murine ASM genes have been cloned, their developmental pattern remains largely unknown. To study ASM gene expression inC. elegans, we isolated total RNA from wild type (either embryos or mixed stages) animals and performed Northern blot analysis using asm-1or asm-2cDNA as probe. Theasm-1probe detected a 1.8-kilobase transcript that was expressed at a higher level in embryos than in the mixed stages samples (Fig. 2, top). In contrast, the 2.0-kilobaseasm-2 transcript appears to be preferentially expressed during post-embryonic development, as it was not detectable in embryos (Fig. 2, middle). Smaller bands, observed below the primaryasm-1 and asm-2 bands, may represent alternative spliced transcripts. In order to study whether the gene products of asm-1 and asm-2exhibit sphingomyelinase activity, these cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 and overexpressed as Flag-tagged proteins in COS-7 cells. Mammalian ASM can be detected as intracellular and secreted forms (13Schissel S.L. Schuchman E.H. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18431-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Vielhaber G. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore checked whether ASM-1 or ASM-2 might also be secreted. Flag-ASM-1 was found exclusively in the cell culture medium by Western blot analysis (Fig.3). In contrast, only one-fifth of the Flag-ASM-2 was secreted. Similar to the mammalian enzymes, the form of Flag-ASM-2 found in the cell culture medium exhibited higher apparent molecular weight than its intracellular counterpart. Furthermore, the apparent molecular weights in SDS-PAGE of both Flag-ASM-1 and Flag-ASM-2 are higher than their calculated molecular weights, consistent with post-translational modification such as glycosylation. The overexpressed recombinant proteins from cell culture medium were immunoprecipitated and the enzymatic activities assayed under various conditions. Eadee-Hofstee transformation of kinetic data shows that at pH 5.0, both ASM-1 and ASM-2 hydrolyzed sphingomyelin to ceramide (Fig.4). However, sphingomyelinase activity was not found at pH 7.4 or pH 9.0, indicating these two enzymes are ASMs, as anticipated from their primary sequence similarity to hASM (Table II). Whereas theK m of Flag-ASM-2 is 3-fold higher than that of Flag-ASM-1, the V max of Flag-ASM-1 is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of Flag-ASM-2 (Table II). It should be noted that these kinetic data were obtained using 2.0 mmZnCl2. In the presence of 10.0 mmZnCl2 the V max of ASM-2 is approximately 60% higher.Table IIASM-1 and ASM-2 are acid sphingomyelinasespH 5.0pH 7.4pH 9.0V max2-aV max units are mmol/mg/h.Km2-bK m units are μm.VmaxKmVmaxKmASM-12.9920NA2-cNA, not applicable.0NAASM-24.8 × 10−32880NA0NACOS-7 cells were transfected with pCEP4/ASM-1 or pCEP4/ASM-2.

To exclude the possibility of a selective inhibitory effect of the sodium acetate buffer used in the assay on the intracellular form of ASM-2, we repeated the assay in a sodium citrate buffer which also did not yield any activity (data not shown). Furthermore, neither ATP, Zn2+, Mg2+, nor Ca2+ conferred ASM activity onto the intracellular form of ASM-2. To test whether COS-7 cells contain an inhibitor of ASM-2, we added a lysate of COS-7 cells to the assay containing immunoprecipitated secreted Flag-ASM-2. Whether or not 10 mm Zn2+ was included in the buffer, the lysate failed to inhibit the activity of secreted Flag-ASM-2 (data not shown). In fact, the lysate minimally enhanced ASM-2 activity. Thus, the inability to detect intracellular ASM-2 activity does not result from an endogenous inhibitor in COS-7 cells. These studies suggest that either the intracellular form of ASM-2 is inactive or a necessary co-factor specific for C. elegans ASM-2 is absent. Furthermore, at all Zn2+ concentrations (0–10 mm), embryo lysates manifested 1.78 ± 0.12 (mean ± S.E.)-fold higher ASM activity than mixed stages lysates, consistent with the apparent specific activities and developmental expression ofasm-1 and asm-2. Previous investigations showed that the secreted form of hASM was quite sensitive to EDTA due to Zn2+ depletion (26Spence M.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B.S.C. Cook H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5358-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of ASM-1 and ASM-2 revealed that Zn2+ increased the ASM-2 activity in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on ASM-1 (Fig.5). The effects of four other cations on ASM-1 and ASM-2 activity were tested, none of which showed stimulatory effects (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effects of divalent cations on C. elegansASM activity. ASMs from COS-7 cells, transfected with pCEP4/asm-1 (solid bars) or pCEP4/asm-2 (stippled bars), were immunoprecipitated as in Fig. 4. Sphingomyelinase activity was determined in the presence of 20.0 mm of cations as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have shown that C. elegans possesses two distinct ASMs, encoded by two separate but homologous genes. These enzymes are about 30% identical with each other and with the human and murine enzymes. The expression of these two genes in C. elegans is regulated during development. asm-1 is preferentially expressed in embryos whereas asm-2is preferentially expressed during post-embryonic development. This suggests that in addition to any housekeeping function which might be involved in lipid metabolism, these sphingomyelinases may play distinct roles in signaling. C. elegans is the first organism to display two ASMs. Despite extensive investigation into the role of ASM in signaling and NPD, little is known about the relationship between the structure and function of this enzyme. Human and murine ASM share 82% identity, which limits the use of an alignment analysis to define functional domains. Alternately, phospholipases C from inStaphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, andBacillus cereus, which exhibit some activity toward sphingomyelin (27Yedgar S. Cohen R. Gatt S. Barenholz Y. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Mollby R. Wadstrom T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 321: 569-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Otnaess A.B. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 202-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), share no homology with their mammalian counterparts. The presence of conserved signal peptides, cysteine residues, proline-rich regions, and N-linked glycosylation sites between mammalian and nematode enzymes suggest these regions are critical for these enzymes to function as ASMs. Tabas and co-workers reported that ASM is secreted from various cell types and that secretion is regulated by cytokine stimulation (15Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with their findings, as Flag-ASM-1 and Flag-ASM-2 are both secreted from COS-7 cells. Furthermore, Flag-ASM-2, like the secreted mammalian enzyme, appears to be activated by Zn2+. In contrast, Flag-ASM-1 is fully active upon secretion independent of Zn2+ suggesting that activation of Flag-ASM-1 occurs by an alternate mechanism. Prior to the present investigation, there existed only one ASM gene conserved between mouse and man. The present investigations add two new ASMs, suggesting the possible existence of a gene family. By comparing the action of the two C. elegans sphingomyelinases to their mammalian counterpart, it may be possible to delineate important information concerning the relationship of structure to function, as well as mechanisms regulating ASM activity. Finally, C. elegans should provide a powerful genetic model to study the role of ASM in signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2050736361,"Bacterial peptide synthetases have two common features that appear to be strictly conserved. 1) The enzyme subunits are co-regulated at both transcriptional and translational level. 2) The organization of the different enzymatic domains constituting the enzyme fulfills the “colinearity rule” according to which the order of the domains along the chromosome parallels their functional hierarchy. Considering the high degree of conservation of these features, one would expect that mutations such as transcription uncoupling and domain dissociations, deletions, duplications, and reshuffling would result in profound effects on the quality and quantity of synthesized peptides. To start testing this hypothesis, we designed two mutants. In one mutant, the operon structure of surfactin synthetase was destroyed, thus altering the concerted expression of the enzyme subunits. In the other mutant, the thioesterase domain naturally fused to the last amino acid binding domain of surfactin was physically dissociated and independently expressed. When the lipopeptides secreted by the mutant Bacillus subtilis strains were purified and characterized, they appeared to be expressed approximately at the same level of the wild type surfactin and to be identical to it, indicating that specific domain-domain interactions rather than coordinated transcription and translation play the major role in determining the correct assembly and activity of peptide synthetases.

A number of peptides with highly variable structures and a broad range of biological activities are produced in bacteria and fungi as secondary metabolites via a nonribosomal mechanism. The synthesis involves large multienzyme complexes called peptide synthetases that are organized in structural domains and utilize the thiotemplate mechanism first described by Lipmann (1Lipmann F. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1980; 21: 227-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and recently revised (2Stein T Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittman-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, each domain recognizes a specific amino acid that, after activation to the corresponding acyladenylate derivative, is covalently bound via a thioester bond to the phosphopantetheine cofactor present on each domain. The growth of the polypeptide chain occurs through a series of thioester bond cleavages and simultaneous formation of amide bonds. At the end of the synthesis, the peptide is supposed to be released from the enzyme by a thioesterase activity localized within the synthetase complex. All prokaryotic peptide synthetases share highly conserved features (3Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). First of all, they are organized in protein subunits consisting of one or more amino acid binding domains. At the DNA level, the order with which these domains are aligned along the chromosome parallels the sequence of the amino acids in the peptide (colinearity rule). For example, if the peptide has the sequence ABC, the domain recognizing amino acid A will be first on the chromosome, followed by the domains binding amino acids B and C. Secondly, the protein subunits coding genes are located within operon-type structures, with their expression coordinated at transcriptional level. Finally, fused at the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding domain, there is a thioesterase-like domain, the function of which is most probably involved in the release of the peptide from the enzyme. Although the striking conservation of these structural features would suggest their crucial role in enzyme assembly and functioning, no direct evidence of such a role has been reported so far. In the present communication, we address two main questions. 1) Is transcription coordination strictly required for proper enzyme assembly and activity? 2) Can the thioesterase domain be physically dissociated from the last amino acid binding domain without impairing peptide synthesis? To answer these questions we used surfactin synthetase as a model system. This enzyme, produced by Bacillus subtilis (5Kakinuma A. Hori M. Isono M. Tamura G. Arima K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1969; 33: 973-976Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 6Zuber P. Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1993: 897-916Google Scholar), is responsible for the synthesis of the seven-amino acid lipopeptide surfactin and is organized in three protein subunits, the first two ( srfAORF1 and srfAORF2) carrying three amino acid binding domains each and the third subunit (srfAORF3) having a single amino acid binding domain fused to a thioesterase moiety (TE) 1The abbreviations used are: TE, thioesterase-like domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: TE, thioesterase-like domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame. (7Cosmina P. Rodriguez F. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. van Sinderen D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We constructed two B. subtilis mutants in which the surfactin synthetase was modified at chromosomal level. In the first mutant, a constitutive promoter was positioned upstream from srfAORF3, encoding the third enzyme subunit, thus making its synthesis transcriptionally dissociated from the other two subunits, which are in turn transcribed from the native, growth-regulated, srfpromoter (8Hahn J. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nakano M.M. Xia L. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5487-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 10Nakano M.M. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3188-3191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the second construct, the DNA region encoding the thioesterase domain was separated from the upstream region of the leucine binding domain of srfAORF3 and expressed independently by adding appropriate regulatory elements. The data presented here demonstrate that the coordinate transcription of enzyme subunits and the physical linkage between amino acid binding and thioesterase modules are not strictly required for the correct assembly of a functional surfactin synthetase. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the feasibility of independent expression of modules and/or subunits in bacterial peptide synthetases. These results might have important implications in the engineering of peptide synthetases. Restriction enzymes were from N. E. Biolabs (Schwalbach/Taunus, Germany) and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For polymerase chain reaction amplifications, the recombinant Tth DNA polymerase XL from Perkin-Elmer was used after the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized using the DNA synthesizer ABI 394 and the reagents from Applied Biosystem. The Escherichia coli B. subtilis shuttle vector pSM214G, a derivative of pSM214 (11Franchi E. Maisano F. Astrua Testori S. Galli G. Toma S. Parente L. De Ferra F. Grandi G. J. Biotechnol. 1991; 18: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was used for cloning the fragments amplified from the surfactin synthetase locus ofB. subtilis JH642+ strain (7Cosmina P. Rodriguez F. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. van Sinderen D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12Perego M. Hoch J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2514-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli XL1 blue strain (Stratagene) was used as the host for intermediate cloning experiments and for plasmid amplification. The suicide plasmid pDIA5304 (13Glaser P. Kunst F. Arnaud M. Coudart M-P. Gonzales W. Hullo M-F. Ionescu M. Lubochinnsky B. Marcellino L. Moszer I. Presecan E. Santana M. Schneider E. Schweizer J. Vertès A. Rapoport G. Danchin A Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was used for the construction of the surfactin synthetase mutants of B. subtilis JH642+. Transformation into E. coli and B. subtilis were carried out as already described (14Van Sinderen D. Galli G. Cosmina P. de Ferra F. Withoff S. Venema G. Grandi G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). LB agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol were used for colony isolation and rapid identification of surfactant-producing B. subtilis colonies. Typically, bacterial cultures were grown at 37 °C in VY liquid medium (25 g/liter Difco veal infusion broth, 5 g/liter yeast extract). For surfactin production, Landy medium was used (20 g/liter glucose, 5 g/liter glutamate, 0.5 g/liter MgSO4, 0.5 g/liter KCl, 1 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.15 g/liter FeSO4·7H2O, 5 mg/liter MnSO4, 0.16 mg/liter CuSO4·5H2O, 0.1% yeast extract), and cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C. The chromosomal regions spanning position 21327 to 21639 (fragment I) and from position 24496 to 24790 (fragment II) of the srf locus (7Cosmina P. Rodriguez F. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. van Sinderen D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) were amplified using the following oligodeoxynucleotides: srfA-FOR (5′-GGGGTACCCCGGTTTGTGCTTTCCTGCTCC-3′), srfA-REV (5′-AACTGCAGCCCTTCCTGCA-TCGGCGATAGG-3′), TE-FOR (5′-CGGAATTCATGGAAGAAACAATCGCACAAAT-3′) and TE-REV (5′-CCCCGGGCCATAGCCCAGAACCGGCGG-3′). The amplification products were purified on MicroSpin S-400 high resolution columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and finally inserted into plasmid pSM214 asKpnI-PstI and EcoRI-XmaI fragments, respectively, after further purification on agarose gel using the Quiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Fragment I was excised from pSM214 by either XbaI-PstI (promoter-carrying fragment) or KpnI-PstI (promoterless fragment) digestions and inserted into the suicide, integrative plasmid pDIA5304, generating plasmids pDIA-ΔsrfA3 and pDIA-srfA3, respectively. Anal-ogously, fragment II was isolated from pSM214 by double digestion with either XbaI andXmaI or with EcoRI and XmaI, and the two fragments were cloned in pDIA5304, obtaining the plasmids pDIA-ΔTE and pDIA-TE, respectively. Mutants were isolated by transforming B. subtilis JH642+ with the four suicide plasmids and selecting for chlor-amphenicol-resistant colonies. The correctness of plasmid integrations was verified by polymerase chain reaction using two oligos hybridizing in the chloramphenicol resistance gene (CmI, 5′-ACAATAGCGACGGAGAGTTAGGTTATTGGG-3′ and CmII, 5′-GCCAGTCA-TTAGGCCTATCTGACAATTCC-3′) and three oligos hybridizing in the srfA region at positions 24459–24477 (S3FOR, 5′-TGATCAGGATCAGCTGGCGGAA GAATGG-3′), 24908–24881 (S3REV: 5′-TCCGGCTGCAGCTTCTGGATCAAATCCG-3′) and 20853–20873 (SRFAFOR: 5′-AGATGTTCATCAGCCATATGG-3′) (see Fig. 1). Total cell proteins were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 2-ml culture samples were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by resuspending them in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, an equal volume of gel loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) was added, and 20 μl of each sample was loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide after a 10-min heating at 100 °C. Protein separation was carried out at 25 mA for 3 h. For TLC analysis, surfactin was precipitated from B. subtilis culture supernatants by adding HCl until pH 2.0 was reached. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 mm sodium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, to a final volume of 1 ml/1 A 600 of culture before acid precipitation. Samples (1 and 2 μl) were spotted on a silica plate (Silica gel 60, 0.25-mm thickness, Merck), and surfactin was chromatographed using butanol:ethanol:H2O (4:4:1) as the mobile phase. Surfactin was detected by spraying water on the silica plate. For HPLC and mass spectroscopy analysis of surfactin, the supernatants of bacterial cultures were concentrated in an Amicon concentration cell using a YM 30 membrane (Millipore) and acidified to pH 2 by adding 3n HCl. The resulting precipitate was separated by centrifugation (8,000 × g) and suspended in chloroform, extracted with water, and precipitated by acidification with 3n HCl. After centrifugation, it was resuspended in a propanol-H2O 1:1 (v/v) mixture containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a C8 Acquapore RP 300 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 7-μm inner diameter, Applied Biosystems) using a Beckman System Gold 126. The elution was performed using a solvent gradient obtained by mixing solvent A (0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water) with solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN-propanol 4:1 (v/v)). After 1 min of isocratic elution with 30% solvent B, the concentration of solvent B reached 55% in 7 min and then 95% in 15 min. Finally, after 2 min of isocratic elution, the initial conditions were restored. The flow rate was 1.2 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Peaks were manually collected and lyophilized. Peptides were analyzed by electron spray mass spectrometry using a Platform single-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, UK). Samples (50 pmol in 10 μl) were injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The spectra were scanned from 1200 to 400m/z at 10 s/scan. Mass scale calibration was carried out using the multiple charged ions of a separate introduction of myoglobin. Mass values are reported as average masses. Two pairs of constructs in the surfactin synthetase locus were generated by using the strategy shown in Fig. 1 and described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” In the first pair, srfAORF3 was separated from the rest of the srfA operon by inserting a suicide plasmid at the end of srfAORF2. In the second pair, the suicide plasmid insertion occurred at the end of the leucine binding domain of srfAORF3, thus physically dissociating the thioesterase domain from the rest of the subunit. The constructs of each pair differ for the presence or absence of a constitutive promoter in the suicide plasmid used for integration. Therefore, the integration of the promoter-containing plasmid led to the expression of thesrfA region located downstream from the integration site (in one case the region is the entire srfAORF3; in the other the region is the thioesterase domain of srfAORF3), whereas the promoterless plasmid prevented the expression of the same regions. Fig. 2 schematically represents the genetic organization of the srfA locus in the four mutants. The figure also shows the nucleotide sequence of the regions flanking the integration sites in srfA::pDIA-srfA3 and srfA::pDIA-TE, the two mutants obtained with the promoter-harboring plasmid. In srfA::pDIA-srfA3, the translation of srfAORF3 took place from its natural shine-Dalgarno sequence and ATG, whereas in srfA::pDIA-TE the shine-Dalgarno sequence and the start codon for the independent expression of the TE domain were artificially created (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The correctness of plasmid integration in the four mutants was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Two sets of primers were used, each set having one primer complementary to the vector sequence and the other complementary to the chromosomal region located either upstream or downstream from the integration site (Fig. 2). As judged by gel electrophoresis, the sizes of the fragments generated by polymerase chain reaction were in agreement with the expected theoretical sizes. The three surfactin synthetase subunits, srfAORF1, srfAORF2, and srfAORF3, are readily visible by Coomassie Blue staining after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the total cell proteins from B. subtilis JH642+ (16Galli G. Rodriguez F. Cosmina P. Pratesi C. Nogarotto R. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Biochem. Biophs. Acta. 1994; 1205: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression of the surfactin synthetase subunits in the four srfA mutants can be followed by analyzing the soluble proteins from bacterial cultures grown in rich liquid medium. As shown in Fig.3 A, the three subunits were clearly visible when total proteins from a 24-hour culture of srfA::pDIAsrfA3 were analyzed. On the contrary and as expected, srfAORF3 was absent in srfA::pDIAΔsrfA3 strain. Furthermore, in agreement with the fact that in srfA::pDIAsrfA3 srfAORF3 transcription is under the control of a constitutive promoter, the expression of this subunit could be detected at the very beginning of the bacterial growth when the other two subunits were still not visible on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). As for the other two mutants, srfA::pDIAΔTE and srfA::pDIA-TE, plasmid integration in srfAORF3 gene was confirmed by the disappearance of the protein species migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 144 kDa and corresponding to srfAORF3 (Fig.3 A). However, although plasmid integration in srfA::pDIA-TE should result in the expression of two protein species, one having a molecular mass of 122 kDa and corresponding to the leucine binding domain and the other of 32 kDa carrying the TE activity, under the experimental conditions used, such protein species were not visible on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This was probably due to the fact that other predominant proteins migrated in the 120- and 30-kDa range, thus making the identification of the two Srf domains impossible. When the four srfA mutants were grown on blood agar plates, the colonies of srfA::pDIAsrfA3 and srfA::pDIA-TE strains were surrounded by typical lysis halos, indicating that a surfactin-like lipopeptide was secreted. The other two mutants, both obtained with the promoterless suicide plasmid, did not produce halos around their colonies. To quantify the amount of lipopeptide produced by srfA::pDIAsrfA3 and srfA::pDIA-TE, the surfactant was acid-precipitated from the culture supernatants of the two strains as well as from the supernatant of the wild type B. subtilisJH642+ and analyzed by TLC. Since we found that the strain carrying the srfA::pDIA-TE integration grew very poorly in liquid minimal medium, for the quantitative analysis of surfactin production, a two-medium growth was used in which the three strains were first cultured in VY-rich medium until an A 600 value of 1.5 was reached, and then the cells were transferred to Landy medium, and the surfactant production analyzed 24 h later. As shown in Fig. 4, srfA::pDIAsrfA3 produced approximately the same amount of surfactant as the wild type strain, whereas in srfA::pDIA-TE, the surfactant was approximately 50% less than the wild type. The fact that the surfactants had the same R F value on TLC strongly suggested that the three strains produced identical products. To characterize the surfactants produced by the mutant strains, the lipopeptides were isolated from the extracellular material by a procedure involving membrane filtration, precipitation under acidic conditions, and reverse phase HPLC fractionation of redissolved material. The peaks observed in the chromatographic profiles were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig.5, the extracts from the parent strain JH642+ and from the mutant strains srfA::pDIA-srfA3 and srfA::pDIA-TE show nearly identical chromatographic profiles. The cluster of the peaks eluting with retention time between 18 and 21 min was shown to correspond to the known four isoforms of surfactin, which differ in the length of the acyl side chain (MH+ 994, 1008, 1022, 1036), as judged by mass spectroscopy analysis. The results of these analyses provide the clear demonstration that the mutant strains produce the same surfactant as the wild type strain. The genetic organization, synthesis, and assembly of bacterial synthetases are schematically represented in Fig.6 A. As shown in this figure, the amino acid binding domains, generally located in more than one subunit and aligned along the chromosome according to the colinearity rule, are tightly coordinated at both the transcriptional and translational level. The highly conserved overall genetic and structural organization could be indicative of the relevant role this organization has in the proper synthesis and assembly of the enzymatic complex. For example, the colinearity rule, according to which the order of the amino acid binding domains parallels the order of the amino acids in the peptide, might lead to the assumption that by simply changing the order of the domains, different peptides can be generated. This assumption is further sustained by the strong homology existing at the amino acid level among different domains (3Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cosmina P. Rodriguez F. de Ferra F. Grandi G. Perego M. Venema G. van Sinderen D. Mol.

Franchi E. Magistrelli C. Colombo E. Colombo E. Cosmina P. Grandi G. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the coordinated transcription and translation found in bacterial peptide synthetases could suggest that the stoichiometry among subunits needs to be finely regulated. In fact, an excess of a particular subunit in a multisubunit enzyme not only could be energetically disadvantageous but, and more importantly, could result in an incorrect interaction among subunits with the consequent generation of undesired peptides. With the present work, we started to question to what extent this conserved organization of peptide synthetases is truly indispensable for proper enzyme synthesis and assembly or rather represents the result of peculiar mechanisms of duplication, insertion, and translocation, through which these interesting enzymes have evolved (19Smith D.J. Burnham M.K.R. Bull J.H. Hodgson J.E. Ward J.M. Browne P. Brown J. Barton B. Earl A.J. Turner G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 20Davidson J.N. Peterson M.L. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 281-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In particular, we asked ourselves what might happen to the peptide synthesis if 1) subunit transcription is driven by different, independently regulated promoters and, 2) enzymatic domains located on the same protein subunit are physically dissociated and independently expressed (Fig. 6 B). Our mutant strain, pDIA-srfA3, where the srfA operon was interrupted after the ORF2, thus leading ORF3 to be expressed constitutively and independently, was still able to produce wild type surfactin. This demonstrates that the coexpression and coregulation of the different subunits of the surfactin synthetase complex are not a prerequisite for the production of an active enzyme. Moreover, it would suggest that the order by which the amino acid binding domains are aligned at the DNA level is not strictly required for the correct assembly of the multienzyme complex. In fact, since ORF3 appears in pDIA-srfA3 cells well before the other two synthetase subunits (Fig. 3 B) and is synthesized about 5 kilobase pairs apart from the rest of the surfactin synthetase operon, the subunit would have equal chances to interact with either ORF1 or ORF2, unless structural constraints exist. The fact that only wild type surfactin could be purified from the supernatant of pDIA-srfA3 and the fact that its productivity was comparable to the wild type strain would suggest that such structural constraints play the most relevant role in the correct assembly of the enzyme. Obviously, a more direct demonstration that the colinear organization of domains in peptide synthetases is not essential for enzyme assembly would be to change the order of domain coding sequences. Such experiments are currently in progress. The data presented here also suggest that the functional domains of peptide synthetase subunits can be physically dissociated without impairing their subsequent assembly and their concerted activities. Our mutant pDIA-TE, in which the TE domain was separated from the leucine binding domain and expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter, was still able to synthesize surfactin. Again, as in the case of pDIA-ORF3 mutant, surfactin was the only peptide formed in the supernatant of pDIA-TE culture, indicating that TE cannot proficiently interact with any other amino acid binding domain apart from the leucine binding domain of ORF3. Therefore, specific protein-protein interactions rather than the ordered position and the progressive expression of the enzyme domains/subunits dictate the way in which peptide synthetases correctly assemble. This might appear to contradict our recently published results on the engineering of surfactin synthetase in which, when the TE domain was moved next to either the fourth or the fifth domain of the enzyme, functional recombinant peptide synthetases were obtained that led to the synthesis of a four-amino acid and a five-amino acid lipopeptide, respectively (21de Ferra F. Rodriguez F. Tortora O. Tosi C. Grandi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 25304-25309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in these experiments, for the thioesterase to release the four- and five-amino acid peptides, the C-terminal end of the seventh amino acid binding domain going from the pantheteine cofactor binding motif to the beginning of the thioesterase (102 amino acids) had to be included in the thioesterase sequence. This C-terminal end replaced the corresponding regions of the fourth and fifth domains in the reported surfactin synthetase fusions. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that the thioesterase-like domain found at the end of the six-module polyketide synthetase DEBS ofSaccharopolyspora erythraea can be repositioned next to the second module generating a recombinant enzyme that synthesizes a short chain polyketide (22Cortes J. Wiesmann K.E.H. Roberts G.A. Brown M.J.B. Staunton J. Leadley P.F. Science. 1995; 268: 1487-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Also in these experiments, the grafting of the thioesterase domain was carried out maintaining the C-terminal region of the preceding acyl carrier protein domain to which it is naturally fused. Taken together these data lead us to hypothesize that for the thioesterase to function, a specific protein-protein interaction with the preceding amino acid binding domain must be established. The region of the amino acid binding domain involved in the interaction with the thioesterase maps within the sequence spanning from the cofactor binding motif (amino acid position 1015) to the residue next to thioesterase domain (amino acid position 1117). This interaction specificity prevents the thioesterase from binding to other amino acid binding domains when the enzyme is physically separated from the domain to which it is naturally fused. In all bacterial peptide synthetases so far characterized, why is TE constantly found fused to the C-terminal end of the last amino acid binding domain even though not strictly required for enzyme assembly and activity? The most probable explanation is provided by our finding showing that pDIA-TE mutant in which TE has been dissociated from the last leucine binding domain of surfactin synthetase is severely impaired in growth. This could indicate that when freed from the enzyme, TE can interfere with other important enzymatic functions involved in cell metabolism. The detrimental effect of free TE is supported by our failure in cloning and expressing TE both in E. coli and B. subtilis using multicopy plasmids (data not shown). The fact that the specific interaction among domains rather than genetic organization guides the correct assembly of peptide synthetases has emerged from a number of recent observations. First of all, Marahiel and co-workers (23Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), in their publication describing the successful engineering of surfactin synthetase, showed that functional enzymes could be obtained when the internal core region of the leucine binding domain was replaced with the corresponding regions of other amino acid binding domains. The sequences flanking the core region, most likely involved in domain-domain interactions, were rigorously kept unchanged in these experiments. Secondly, our attempts to obtain shorter surfactin-like lipopeptides by deleting whole amino acid binding domains have mostly failed so far. 2G. Grandi, unpublished observations. Third, we have recently completed the characterization of the syringomycin synthetase coding region, which in Pseudomonas syringae is responsible for the synthesis of the nine-amino acid-long plant virulence factor syringomycin (24Zhang J-H. Quigley N.B. Gross D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4009-4020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of the organization of syringomycin synthetase has shown that this enzyme is composed of two subunits, one carrying eight amino acid binding domains and one having a single domain that recognizes the last amino acid of the peptide. The single domain subunit is encoded upstream from the eight-domain subunit, and the two coding genes are expressed under the control of different promoters. 3E. Guenzi, G. Galli, and G. Grandi, manuscript in preparation. Our findings deliver two messages to those interested in peptide synthetase engineering. From one side, for the engineered peptide synthetase to function, reconstitution of operon-type structures and/or fused domains do not appear to be required. This may facilitate the manipulation of these enzymes, especially in consideration of the fact that large pieces of DNA generally need to be inserted in highly conserved, repeated regions. On the other hand, particular attention has to be paid to the regions involved in domain-domain interactions. Structural perturbation of these domain regions should most likely result in the failure of enzyme complex formation. The recent elucidation of the 3D structure of the phenylalanine binding domain of gramicidin synthetase (25Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) will be of great help in defining the regions involved in amino acid specificity and in elucidating the structural features of domain interaction.

The stages of development for these ants are as follows: egg, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar larvae, prepupae, pupae, and adult. The 4th instar larvae plays an important role in the survival of the colony in that it is totally responsible for the digestion of solid foods and the source of nutrients for the queen and adult workers. In our studies we have been successful in purifying and characterizing four proteinases from the 4th instar larvae.

Such compounds may prove useful for the development of insecticides to control fire ant infestation. The imported red fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is a major pest which, over the past 50 years, has spread across and infested the southern United States, while virtually eradicating the indigenous species (1Holldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1990Crossref Google Scholar). This organism is also a major nuisance to man and other animals since it possesses a powerful, painful sting from which its name was acquired and which, in some cases, can result in anaphylactic shock (2Lockley R.F. Advances in Allergology and Clinical Immunology. Pergamon Press, New York1979: 441-448Google Scholar). Together with its medical impact, fire ants also impose a large economical effect. This is due to loss of cultivable land, damage to roads, farm, and electrical equipment, and cost incurred in attempting to control pests (3Lofgren C.S. Economic Impact and Control of Social Insects. Praeger Publishers, New York1986: 227-256Google Scholar). Clearly, fire ants impose a large economical and medical impact and, therefore, require adequate control and/or total eradication. The maturation of the adult fire ant involves nine stages of development of which the 4th instar larvae appears to be the most vital to the survival of the colony in that it is not only the single source of enzymes which are utilized for the digestion of solid foods but also a unique resource for the sharing of digested materials with the remainder of the colony (tropholaxis) (4Vinson S.B. Sorensen A.A. Imported Fire Ants: Life History and Impact.. Texas Department of Agriculture, Austin, Texas1986Google Scholar). To date, the enzymes from the 4th instar larvae, which are required for protein digestion, have not been characterized. However, it seems clear that affecting their function through the addition of specific proteinase inhibitors could interfere with colony survival, primarily through starvation of the queen for essential amino acids. This report describes results obtained for the purification and characterization of four proteinases isolated from the 4th instar larvae of S. invicta, as well as inhibition profiles for each enzyme isolated (TableI).Table IPurification of S. invicta 4th instar larvae proteinasesProteinaseFraction stepTotal activity1-aBased on enzymatic activity using MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA or Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, where 1 unit = 1 nmol of pNA released per min.Total protein1-b3 g of larvae extracted.Specific activityPurificationYield1-cBased on initial activity in crude extract.unitsmgunits/mg−fold%Soli E1Crude extract26,1001861401100Acetone precipitation23,7001102151.591Peak I from Q-Sepharose10,90041.52601.842Mono S, FPLC6,8400.58611,7008426Soli E2Crude extract26,1001861401100Acetone precipitation23,7001102151.591Peak II from Q-Sepharose9,38022.74102.935Mono Q, FPLC4,1900.8594,9003516Superdex 75, FPLC1,5000.13211,400816Soli C1Crude extract41,6001862201100Acetone Precipitation38,7001103501.693Peak III from Q-Sepharose19,4006.43,03013.847Mono Q, FPLC11,7000.72516,1007328Soli C2Crude extract41,6001862201100Acetone precipitation38,7001103501.693Peak III from Q-Sepharose19,4006.43,03013.847Mono Q, FPLC1,0100.1307,77035.32.4Superdex 75, FPLC7200.03024,0001091.71-a Based on enzymatic activity using MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA or Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, where 1 unit = 1 nmol of pNA released per min.1-b 3 g of larvae extracted.1-c Based on initial activity in crude extract.

The colonies of S. invictawere maintained according to Petralia and Vinson (5Petralia R.S. Vinson S.B. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1978; 71: 643-648Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with the 4th instar larvae being collected by manual separation from the rest of the colony with an aspirator. Larvae were extracted in a 1:10 (w/v) ratio of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). The mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 24 h and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g, for 15 min at 4 °C, with the lipid layer on top being removed physically by pipette and the supernatant retained. Chilled acetone was added at a 2:1 (v/v) ratio over a period of 15 min at 4 °C. This produced a precipitate that was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The precipitate was redissolved in 0.1 of its original volume in buffer A, and this was applied to a Q Sepharose (Sigma) column (2.5 × 15 cm, 75 ml) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A at a flow rate of 50 ml/hr. A gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A was then applied to the column over 750 ml. At this stage, three peaks of activity were seen (see Fig. 1 A). The first (peak I) was present in the flow-through and had activity against MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA. Peak II also had activity on this substrate but was present in fractions eluted by the salt gradient. Peak III, also eluted in the salt gradient, had activity against N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA. Peak I, whose activity was designated E1, was pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration to 10 ml, using a 3K membrane (Filtron), and applied to a Mono S FPLC column HR 5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was first washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A at 1.0 ml/min., followed by a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A, to elute bound proteins. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for activity against MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA. Those with this activity were then applied to and separated on a SuperdexTM 75 gel filtration column HR 10/30, previously equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled and used for further analysis. The purification of the enzymes present in peaks II and III were essentially identical. Fractions from each peak were pooled, dialyzed (MWCO 3,500, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.) for 4 h at 4 °C against buffer A, and concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration, using a 3K membrane (Filtron). These samples were then separately applied to a Mono Q FPLC column HR 5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), previously equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was then washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in buffer A. All fractions were assayed for activity against, either MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (peak II) or Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (peak III), as described above. The enhanced resolution offered by Mono Q separated the activity in peak III into two separate proteins both of which hydrolyzed Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA (see Fig. 1 B). These are, therefore, referred to as C1 and C2, while a single activity was recovered from peak II (E2). All active fractions from this purification step were individually pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml, by ultrafiltration, using a Filtron 3K MicrosepTM. For final purification each concentrated fraction was loaded onto and eluted from a SuperdexTM 75 gel filtration column HR 10/30, previously equilibrated with buffer A. Active fractions were pooled and used for further analysis. Generally, the amidolytic activities of each proteinase were measured with the substrates MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA andN-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, in 0.05 mTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, (assay buffer). Enzyme inhibition assays by protein inhibitors were conducted in the same assay buffer using an inhibitor concentration ranging from 0.02–50 nm with a 10-min preincubation time and with the final enzyme concentration being 1.0 nm. All kinetic studies with substrates and inhibitors were performed at the optimum pH of the individual proteinases, utilizing the following buffers: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (E1); 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm CHES, pH 9.5 (E2 and C2); and 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm CHAPS, pH 10.0 (C1). The SDS-PAGE method devised by Shagger and von Jagow (6Shaggar H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 168-379Google Scholar), using a Tris-HCl/Tricine buffer system, was used throughout this study. The determination of pH optimum and stability for each enzyme was performed using a Universal Phosphate Buffer system. V maxand K m values were determined using substrates or synthetic inhibitors at concentrations ranging from 10 nmto 5 mm, with the final concentration of each enzyme being 10 nm in the specific optimum buffers utilized.V max and K m values were measured by using Hyperbolic Regression Analysis. 2The hyperbolic Regression Analysis program written by J. S. Easterby (University of Liverpool, United Kingdom) was obtained as a shareware program. Isoelectrofocusing of the purified proteinases was performed on Servalyt Precotes™ precast isoelectric focusing gels (pH 3–10). Sample preparations and isoelectrofocusing were carried out following instructions provided by Pharmacia and using the Pharmacia Flatbed Electrophoresis Unit. Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using 10 mm CHAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol (7Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was washed thoroughly with water and stained with Coomassie Blue G250. The blot was air-dried, and the bands containing enzymes were cut out and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis with an Applied Biosystems Procise Protein Sequencer, using the program designed by the manufacturer. Acetone precipitation proved to be an excellent first step, as opposed to ammonium sulfate or acid precipitation, both of which caused drastic losses of all enzymatic activities. Indeed, the utilization of acetone effectively removed 40% of the unwanted proteins from the crude extract, while it had little negative effect on the activity of Soli C and limited loss of activity for both Soli E1 and Soli E2 (10–20%). Significantly, the use of Q Sepharose as a second step then separated the four enzymes into three peak fractions, with Soli E1, which failed to bind to Q Sepharose, being readily purified by the use of Mono S (Fig.1 A). The sample from this step was 98% pure. Minor bands were seen only when the sample was well overloaded on an SDS-PAGE gel. Therefore, gel filtration chromatography was utilized to obtain >99% purity. Anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q increased the specific activity of Soli E2 about 12-fold and, more significantly, separated Soli C1 and Soli C2 into distinct activities (Fig. 1 B). After Mono Q, the level of purity for both Soli E2 and Soli C2 was only near 65% while Soli C1 was judged to be 90% pure. Thus, gel filtration was again utilized which again achieved 99% purity for Soli E2, Soli C1, and Soli C2. SDS-PAGE of all four purified enzymes gave single bands with molecular masses of 23, 24, 25, and 28 kDa, respectively, for Soli E1, Soli E2, Soli C1, and Soli C2 (Fig. 2). A duplicate gel of that shown in Fig. 1, in which all of the samples were treated with3H-DFP, was exposed to x-ray film with the radiolabeled proteins, confirming the fact that the purified products were the target enzymes for this serine proteinase inhibitor. The testing of numerous synthetic para-nitroanilide substrates against each of the four isolated proteinases supported the hypothesis that two were chymotrypsin-related in specificity while two had activities indicative of a relationship to pancreatic elastase (Table II). Both Soli C1 and Soli C2 were broadly specific in that they readily hydrolyzed substrates with P1 Leu and Phe residues, whereas Soli E1 and Soli E2 had narrow specificity toward P1 Ala or Val, with Soli E2 being particularly more active with the latter amino acid residue. However, the activity of each of the four enzymes was also affected by residues in the P2 to P4 positions of the substrates tested.Table IIAmidolytic activity of S. invicta proteinasesSubstrateV max/K mC1C2E1E2Suc-Ala-Phe-Leu-pNA84<1<1<1MeOSuc-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA56<1<1<1Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA362<1<1<1Suc-Phe-Leu-Phe-pNA134896<1<1Suc-Gln-Pro-Phe-pNA1051<1<1<1Suc-Leu-Pro-Phe-pNA338<1<1<1Suc-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA61227<1<1Suc-Phe-Val-Phe-pNA77929<1<1Suc-Ala-Pro-Ala-pNA<1<112134Suc-Ala-Ala-Val-Ala-pNA<1<111252Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA4059<1<1Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-pNA25179<1<1Suc-Phe-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA438280<1<1Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA1125630<1<1Suc-Ala-Leu-Pro-Phe-pNA270301<1<1Suc-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-pNA621582<1<1Suc-Glu-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA23952<1<1Suc-Leu-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA2041099<1<1Suc-Met-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA7901271<1<1Suc-Phe-Val-Pro-Phe-pNA381138<1<1HCl-Ile-His-t-Pro-Phe-pNA722558<1<1MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA<1<111127The assay was performed at 25 °C in 20% Me2SO, optimum buffer for each enzyme. Open table in a new tab The assay was performed at 25 °C in 20% Me2SO, optimum buffer for each enzyme. In accordance with the fact that all four enzymes were serine proteinases, each was readily inhibited by DFP but not by other class-specific proteinase inhibitors, including E-64, EDTA, and pepstatin. Nevertheless, the serine proteinase inhibitor, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, only inhibited Soli E1 and Soli E2 but not Soli C1 or Soli C2, except after long incubation periods. Testing of synthetic inhibitors including coumarins, peptidyl chloromethyl ketones and organophosphates (TableIII) gave results that were in parallel with substrates' specificities, as described above. Those inhibitors with P1 Phe residues inhibited Soli C1 and Soli C2 most efficiently while those possessing P1 Val were most effective on Soli E1 and Soli E2.Table IIIEffect of peptide inhibitors on the amidolytic activity of S. invictaMax inhibition rate/IC50C1C2E1E2TLCK<0.10<0.1<0.10<0.10TPCK2.350.8<0.10<0.10Z-Ala-CK0.57<0.1<0.10<0.10Z-Phe-CK3.781.3<0.10<0.10Z-Trp-CK0.67<0.1<0.10<0.10Ac-Ala-Leu-CK0.58<0.1<0.10<0.10Ac-Gly-Phe-CK0.95<0.1<0.10<0.10Ac-Leu-Phe-CK8.500.4<0.10<0.10IsoVal-Phe-CK7.690.90.480.53Ac-Val-Phe-CK0.73<0.1<0.10<0.10Z-Gly-Leu-Ala-CK0.38<0.10.40<0.10Ac-Ala-Pro-Ala-CK<0.10<0.10.71<0.10Z-Gly-Gly-Phe-CK2.160.1<0.10<0.10Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CK44.513.1<0.10<0.10Ac-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala-CK<0.10<0.10.23<0.10Ac-Ala-Ala-Phe-Ala-CK<0.10<0.10.180.27Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CK<0.10<0.11.460.68Ac-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ile-CK<0.10<0.10.1924.97MeOsuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CK<0.10<0.10.6132.59Z-Phe-p(OPh)229.4194.8<0.10<0.10Z-Phe-Phe-p(OPh)2246.67266.0<0.10<0.10Z-Leu-Phe-p(OPh)2150.69198.8<0.10<0.10Z-Phe-Leu-Phe-p(OPh)21116.803694.8<0.10<0.10Z-Val-p(OPh)2<0.100.32.246.36Z-Ala-Val-p(OPh)2<0.100.21.4127.23Z-Pro-Val-p(OPh)20.110.21.1736.57Z-Val-Val-p(OPh)21.214.725.9376.81Boc-Ala-Pro-Val-p(OPh)20.710.7395.91665.86Boc-Val-Pro-Val-p(OPh)26.802.2790.05735.43DCIC0.240.73.7732.42Results are for 10-min incubation at 25 °C, 10% Me2SO, optimum buffer for each enzyme.

Testing of natural protein inhibitors of serine proteinases on the four enzymes further substantiated the specificities of the two pairs of proteinases (Table IV), with members of the ovomucoid family being particularly specific toward Soli E1 and Soli E2 but showing no activity against Soli C1 or Soli C2. In contrast, Trasylol was only active against Soli C1 and LBTI against Soli C1 and Soli C2.

Soli C1 was found to be stable for several days between the pH range of 7 to 9 at 37 °C. Soli C2, Soli E1, and Soli E2 on the other hand, lost their activities fairly quickly over all pHs but were most stable at pH 8.0, 7.0, and 8.5, respectively. Based on Serva Test Mix 9 IEF standards, the proteinases migrated to the following pI values: Soli E1, 10.0; Soli E2, (3 isoforms) 6.9, 8.3, and 8.5; Soli C1, 4.7; and Soli C2, 4.2. The N-terminal sequences of the enzymes indicated some degree of conservation between the enzymes, especially with regard to an Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-consensus sequence at the amino terminus, which is also highly conserved in most serine proteinases. Aside from these first four residues, all four enzymes proved to be novel in that they shared no identity with each other or with other proteinases, at least in the first 20 amino acid residues when compared with those in GenBank™ (TableV).Table VAmino-terminal sequence of S. invicta 4th instar larvae proteinasesSoli C1 - Ile-Val-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Pro-Val-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Gln-Val-Ser-Leu-Arg-Leu-Ser-Gly-Soli C2 - ----------------Glu-Pro-Ala-Pro-----Gly-Ala-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Ile-Val-Ser-Leu-Gln-Val-Soli E1 - ----------------Gln-Pro-Ala-Thr-Pro-Gly-Glu-Phe-Pro-His-Gln-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg-Val-Soli E2 - ----------------Gln-Asp-Ala-Ala-Pro-Gly-Glu-Phe-Pro-His-Gln-Gly-Ser-Leu-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-Ile- Open table in a new tab As shown in Table VI, extracts of each stage of larval development showed only limited production of the two enzyme forms until the 4th instar larvae stage. Significantly, no activity was present in subsequent stages of development, supporting the hypothesis that the 4th instar larvae played major roles in the digestion and distribution of food and food products, respectively, to other larvae and to the adult insects. It is also possible that some of the early larval stages, which apparently contained some enzyme activity, may have been contaminated with the 4th instar larvae during separation of the various developing forms.Table VIAmidolytic activity of developmental stages of S. invictaChymotrypsin-like activity6-aPercent activity relative to that found in 4th instar larvae.Elastase-like activity6-aPercent activity relative to that found in 4th instar larvae.Egg001st Instar24122nd Instar27133rd Instar36434th Instar100100Prepupae00Pupae00Adult00Assay was performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4.6-a Percent activity relative to that found in 4th instar larvae.

It is thought to have been accidentally introduced into the United States from dirt used in the ballast of ships, which was taken from the riverbanks of these regions (8Buren W.F. J. Ga. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1972; 7: 1-27Google Scholar). Due to suitable climate and conditions, this species quickly spread over and infested 13 Southeastern and Southwestern states, easily out competing the indigenous species because of their aggressive behavior (9Tschinkel W.R. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1987; 81: 76-81Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As S. invicta has invaded the Southern states, it has virtually eliminated S. xyloni, and greatly reduced the populations of Pogonomyrex badius (harvesting ant) andS. geminata (1Holldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1990Crossref Google Scholar). The venom of fire ants is 95% 2,6-dialkylpiperidine, and this compound is responsible for the wheal-and-flare reaction that occurs after stinging (10MacConnell J.G. Blum M.S. Fales H.M. Tetrahedron. 1971; 261129Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Brand J.M. Blum M.S. Fales H.M. MacConnell J.G. Toxicon. 1972; 10: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Aside from this alkyloid, 0.1% of the venom is comprised of four highly allergenic proteins, which in 0.5% of sting victims result in an immune response that can lead to anaphylactic shock (12Baer H. Lui T.-Y. Anderson M.C. Blum M. Schmidt W.H. James F.J. Toxicon. 1979; 17: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Hoffman D.R. Dove D.E. Jacobson R.S. J. Clin. Immunol. 1988; 82: 818-827Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Currently, the most common methods of treating fire ant infestation are with toxicants (amidohydrozones), juvenile hormone analogs, or avermectin B1a (1Holldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1990Crossref Google Scholar, 3Lofgren C.S. Economic Impact and Control of Social Insects. Praeger Publishers, New York1986: 227-256Google Scholar). However, in order to eliminate the colony completely, it is necessary to kill the queen and with the emergence of polygyne (multiple queen) colonies, this becomes more difficult (14Glancey B.M. Craig C.H. Stringer C.E. Bishop P.M. J. Ga. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1973; 8: 237-238Google Scholar, 15Hung A.C.F. Vinson S.B. Summerlin J.W. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 1974; 67: 909-912Crossref Google Scholar). Juvenile hormone analogs do interfere with the development of the brood but the entire colony brood must be reached, or it will quickly rebound (16Porter S.D. Bhatker A.W. Mudler R. Vinson S.B. Clair D.J. J. Econ. Entomol. 1991; 84: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Drees B.M. Vinson S.B. J. Entomol. Sci. 1990; 25: 317-324Crossref Google Scholar). It has been observed that sometimes the colony will relocate in response to physical disturbance or stress if members of the colony suddenly die. Therefore a more subtle and less invasive means of control would be useful. The stages of development for ants are as follows: egg, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar larvae, prepupae, pupae, and adult. As in other social insects, each caste has a particular role. Foragers locate and bring foods to the colony. Boluses of food are then given to nursemates which are responsible for caretaking of the brood. These ants, in turn, place the bolus on the anteroventral opening of the 4th instar larvae which digest the solid food and thus play an important role in the survival of the colony (1Holldobler B. Wilson E.O. The Ants. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1990Crossref Google Scholar). By tropholaxis, which is the sharing of food among social insects, digested food is distributed throughout the colony. This provides essential free amino acids to all members and, in particular, to the queen (4Vinson S.B. Sorensen A.A. Imported Fire Ants: Life History and Impact.. Texas Department of Agriculture, Austin, Texas1986Google Scholar). Thus, attempts to interfere with the digestive enzymes from the 4th instar larvae could be a useful mechanism for developing a more effective means of controlling this pest. Previously, there has been very little description and certainly no purification of proteinases from the 4th instar larvae of S. invicta, aside from that reported by Sorensen in which general proteolytic activity was ascribed based on radial diffusion assays (18Sorensen A.A. Kamas R.S. Vinson S.B. J. Insect Physiol. 1983; 29: 163-168Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the current study, we were able to purify and characterize four distinctly different enzymes. Since secreted fluids from the anteroventral opening of the 4th instar larvae possessed the same amidolytic activity as the proteinases, it is likely that they are involved in the digestion of food for the colony. However, it cannot be ruled out that any of the proteinases might also play a role in the larval development. In the same context, it is also important to point out that egg, prepupae, pupae, and adults when analyzed for these same putative digestive enzymes were found to be devoid of these proteinases, while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar larvae possessed significantly lower levels of enzyme activity relative to the 4th instar larvae (Table VI). Although it has been documented that adult ants do have a small amount of digestive enzymes in their midguts (18Sorensen A.A. Kamas R.S. Vinson S.B. J. Insect Physiol. 1983; 29: 163-168Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is thought that their presence is likely due to tropholaxis. In the current study we were able to identify and purify four major proteinases, each of which could be easily localized to the 4th instar larvae. Characterization of these enzymes indicated a strong relationship toward other members of the pancreatic proteinase family, including M r, substrate specificity, inhibition profile, and N-terminal sequence. Curiously, we did not identify any trypsin-like activity in larvae extracts, only enzymes that could be classified as related to elastase and chymotrypsin. While each of the purified enzymes was identified, primarily through the use of synthetic substrates, all were also able to degrade both azo-casein and gelatin, thereby supporting the fact that they are, indeed, proteinases. Perhaps of most importance is the fact that all of the larvae-derived proteinases could be regulated by both synthetic and natural inhibitors, with the latter being from both plant and animal sources. Whether either class of inhibitor (natural or synthetic) could be utilized in proper bait to control S. invicta remains to be established, and experiments to examine such possibilities are currently in progress."
https://openalex.org/W1994594217,"We recently described the pre-steady state enzymatic binding kinetics of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (AP endo). In this report we describe the domain structure of the enzyme in solution determined by mild protease digestion in the presence and absence of substrate, product, and an efficient competitive inhibitor (HDP). AP endo is a 35.5-kDa protein with a high degree of homology to its prokaryotic counterpart, exonuclease III (Exo III), except for the amino terminus, which is lacking in the prokaryotic enzyme. The entire conserved region plus an additional 20 residues unique to the eukaryotic enzyme was inaccessible to trypsin and V8 protease, indicating that it forms a tight globular structure. In contrast, the amino-terminal 35 residues were readily accessible to all the proteases investigated, leading us to conclude that they associate poorly with the rest of the structure and constitute a highly fluid region. When AP endo was boiled with SDS and cooled prior to the addition of V8 protease, several acidic residues within the globular domain became protease-accessible, indicating rapid renaturation except along the nuclease fold with restoration of globular conformation for the carboxyl two-thirds of the molecule. Of all the proteases tested, only chymotrypsin was able to cleave internal to the globular portion without prior denaturation. Although AP endo cleaved with chymotrypsin retained full enzymatic activity, the activity was lost when the digested peptides were recovered after denaturation by heat and/or boiling in SDS, precipitation, and renaturation or when fragments were recovered from an SDS gel and renatured. Thus, the protein is probably held together strongly by noncovalent interactions that maintain enzymatic function after protease nicking. The three major chymotrypsin cleavage sites, Tyr-144, Leu-179, and Leu-205, became strikingly less accessible to protease digestion in the presence of abasic site-containing DNA. Since the three residues form a spherical triangle on the surface of the molecule on one side of the nuclease fold, there must be multiple means by which DNA containing an abasic site associates with the enzyme. The most likely explanation is that substrate and product, both of which were present during proteolysis, bind differently to the enzyme. Finally, the two cysteine residues thought to be involved in the redox reaction of AP endo with Jun protein were entirely inaccessible to proteolysis even after prolonged exposure of AP endo to reducing agents. Consequently, if AP endo plays a role in the physiological function of Jun, it must undergo major conformational changes in the process. Alternatively, the two cysteines could maintain an appropriate conformation such that other residues participate directly in the redox activity."
https://openalex.org/W1984269112,"The sorting of membrane proteins to the lysosome requires tyrosine- or dileucine-based targeting signals. Recycling receptors have similar signals, yet these proteins seldom enter the latter stages of the endocytic pathway. To determine how lysosomal and internalization signals differ, we prepared chimeric molecules consisting of the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 γ-chain, lysosomal acid phosphatase, and lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein-1, each fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the transferrin receptor (TR). Each chimera was expressed on the cell surface and rapidly internalized. Metabolic pulse-chase experiments showed that the CD3 γ-chain and lysosomal acid phosphatase chimeras, unlike the lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein chimera, were rapidly degraded in a post-Golgi compartment following normal glycosylation. Transplantation of signals from CD3 γ-chain and lysosomal acid phosphatase into the TR cytoplasmic tail in place of the native signal, Y20TRF23, indicated that each signal was sufficient to promote endocytosis but not lysosomal targeting of the resulting mutant. Transplantation of two CD3 signals at specific sites in the TR cytoplasmic tail or a single tyrosine-based signal in a truncated TR tail, however, was sufficient to promote lysosomal targeting. Our results therefore suggest that the relative position of the signal within the cytoplasmic tail is a critical feature that distinguishes lysosomal targeting signals from internalization signals.

The trafficking of integral membrane proteins to lysosomes occurs independently of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (1Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

Newly synthesized lysosomal membrane proteins are delivered to lysosomes either by a direct intracellular route or by an indirect route via the plasma membrane (3Green S.A. Zimmer K. Griffiths G.

Membrane proteins that traffic to lysosomes by the direct intracellular route are thought to be sorted from the constitutive biosynthetic pathway in the trans-Golgi via clathrin-coated vesicles (9Honing S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins that are delivered to the lysosome from the cell surface cluster in clathrin-coated pits and internalize in a manner indistinguishable from recycling receptors. In the sorting endosome, however, lysosomally directed membrane proteins segregate from recycling receptors (10Futter C.E. Felder S. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C.R. J.

Studies on the transferrin receptor recycling pathway demonstrate that recycling receptors and lipids recycle back to the cell surface with the same kinetics, suggesting that recycling of membrane proteins occurs by a bulk flow process (12Mayor S.

Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of LAMP-1 mutants clearly demonstrate that modifications in the cytoplasmic tail convert a lysosomally targeted protein into a protein trapped in the recycling pathway (11Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional targeting information is required for entry to the later stages of the endocytic pathway and recycling receptors lack this information. Analysis of the trafficking of mutant lysosomal membrane proteins with altered cytoplasmic tails has identified two classes of sorting signals involved in lysosomal targeting. One class contains a critical tyrosine residue that is structurally related to tyrosine-based internalization signals, while the other contains two adjacent leucine or related large hydrophobic residues (for reviews, see Refs. 15Trowbridge I.S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive series of studies described above, the structural requirements for lysosomal targeting have not been clearly defined. For example, whereas the published literature underscores the close relationship between tyrosine-based internalization signals and lysosomal targeting signals, the structural features which distinguish the two classes of signal have not been revealed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The most striking example of this is the recent analysis of the structural requirements for lysosomal targeting, endocytosis and basolateral sorting of rat Lgp120 (LAMP-1) (5Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Complete alanine scanning of the 11-residue cytoplasmic tail of rat Lgp120 indicated that alteration of only two residues, Tyr-8 and Ile-11, to alanine decreased the efficiency of lysosomal targeting, endocytosis, and basolateral sorting, with each sorting step being equally affected. Mutation of Gly-7 to alanine resulted in a loss of direct targeting, but not indirect targeting, to the lysosome (5Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the structural requirements for lysosomal targeting by analyzing chimeras consisting of the cytoplasmic tail of LAP, LAMP-1, or the CD3 γ-chain each fused to the transmembrane region and external domain of the TR. We have also transplanted putative internalization and lysosomal-targeting signals from each of these proteins into the TR in place of the native TR internalization signal, YTRF. Tyrosine-based signals from LAMP-1 and LAP were also transplanted into a truncated TR cytoplasmic domain, Δ3–18, 29–59. Our studies demonstrate that the position of the signal within the cytoplasmic tail is a critical feature that distinguishes lysosomal targeting signals from internalization signals. Mutant human TR constructs were prepared as described previously (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) by the method of Kunkel (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Mutants were selected either by differential hybridization or by restriction mapping and cloned into the expression vector, BH-RCAS (32Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hughes S.H. et al.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 41: 39-49Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52749) Google Scholar, 35Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Google Scholar) of the BH-RCAS constructs using the Sequenase kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's directions. LAMP-TR and LAP-TR chimeras (Fig. 1 A) were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the tailless (Δ3–59) TR mutant phagemid as a template (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The CD3 γ-chain-TR chimera (Fig.1 A) was constructed using the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (36Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction was performed on the CD3 γ-chain cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Bob Hyman, Department of Cancer Biology, Salk Institute). Our polymerase chain reaction-generated construct did not contain the carboxyl-terminal three residues (Arg-Lys-Lys) of the CD3 γ-chain since these residues had previously been shown to be unnecessary for lysosomal targeting, and in the context of a type I membrane protein, acted as an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal (21Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Unique NheI andAflII sites were introduced in the 5′ (5′-CAT-GCT-AGC-CAG-GAT-GGA-GTT-CGC-3′) and 3′ (5′-CAT-CTT-AAG-CAG-TTG-GTT-TCC-TTG-3′) primers, respectively. This polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment was then subcloned into pBluescript SK+ with a human TR insert containing these two sites (ATG-ATG-GCT-AGC-CTT-AAG-AGG) encoding a seven residue cytoplasmic tail with the sequence Met-Met-Ala-Ser-Leu-Lys-Arg ((37); kindly provided by Greg Odorizzi and Albert Lai (Department of Cancer Biology, The Salk Institute)). The addition of the two restriction sites adds three residues, Ala, Ser, Leu to the tailless TR (Δ3–59; (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J.

The TR mutants containing transplanted signals were prepared by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1, B andC). The Y20QTI23, the Y20RHV23, the D18KQTLL23, and the Y20QLPK24 mutants were prepared using the wild-type TR phagemid as template. The Y4QTI7and Y4RHV7 mutants (Fig. 1 D), were prepared using the Δ3–18, 29–59 mutant TR phagemid as template (38Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35mutant was prepared using the D18KQTLL23 mutant phagemid as template (Fig. 1 C). Preparation of the Y9TRF12 mutant, the Y31TRF34 mutant, and the Y47TRF50 mutant has been previously described (36Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TR chimeras and mutants were expressed in CEF as described previously (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Surface expression levels of wild-type TR and TR chimeras and mutants were determined by measuring the binding of 125I-labeled human transferrin (Tf) at 4 °C (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Apparent internalization efficiencies of the wild-type TR, TR chimeras, and TR mutants were estimated from measurement of the steady-state distribution of receptors at 37 °C (39Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (28Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The internalization efficiencies of the wild-type TR and TR chimeras and mutants were also determined by measuring their ability to mediate iron uptake as described previously (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CEF were plated at 7.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well Costar tissue culture plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min and then incubated with 125I-labeled Tf (4 μg/ml) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, DMEM at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was removed after 1 h, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold 0.1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with prewarmed DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 μg/ml unlabeled Tf for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. After incubation, the medium was removed, the protein was precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-soluble and acid-insoluble radioactivity was counted in a gamma counter. The surface-bound and internalized Tf in CEF was determined by the acid wash procedure described in the steady-state distribution assay. Cells were plated 24 h before the assay at 2 × 106 cells into 6-cm plates. The next day, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed (37 °C) methionine-free DMEM. Cells were then pulse-labeled for 30 min in 2 ml of methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 0.12 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and 2% dialyzed, defined calf serum. Pulse-labeled cells were chased for various times up to 24 h in complete medium. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h in medium containing 50 mm NH4Cl, and this inhibitor concentration was maintained throughout the course of the pulse-chase experiment. At the end of each time point, cells were solubilized on ice with 1% Nonidet P-40, phosphate-buffered saline. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using the B3/25 monoclonal antibody and analyzed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (40Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dried gels were exposed on XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantitation of immunoprecipitates was performed on a model 425 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). CEF and CEF expressing the CD3 γ-chain-TR, LAP-TR, and LAMP-TR chimeras and the wild-type TR were plated onto glass coverslips and cultured overnight. Analysis by indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (28Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine if the cytoplasmic tails of lysosomal membrane proteins were sufficient to promote TR internalization, we constructed three chimeric proteins consisting of the cytoplasmic domains of LAMP-1, LAP, or the CD3 γ-chain, fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the human TR (Fig.1 A). Each of these chimeras was expressed in CEF using BH-RCAS, a replication-competent retroviral vector derived from the Rous sarcoma virus (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 33Hughes S.H. et al.J. Reprod. Fertil. 1990; 41: 39-49Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of each chimera was confirmed using 125I-labeled Tf binding at 4 °C (data not shown). Internalization efficiencies of the chimeras were determined by measuring the steady-state distribution of internalized Tf and their ability to mediate iron uptake (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, all of the chimeras were rapidly internalized with relative activities ranging from 50 to 131% (compared with the wild-type TR). These data are consistent with previous studies showing that the cytoplasmic tails of LAMP-1, LAP, and the CD3 γ-chain contain internalization signals (4Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J.

They also suggest that the cytoplasmic tails from type I membrane proteins are sufficient to promote internalization of type II membrane proteins, as has been previously shown for the β-amyloid precursor cytoplasmic tail (37Lai A.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the cytoplasmic tails of CD3 γ-chain, LAP, and LAMP-1 were sufficient to target the chimeras to the prelysosomal/lysosomal compartment, metabolic pulse-chase experiments were performed. CEF expressing the TR chimeras and the wild-type TR were each pulse-labeled with Tran35S-label for 30 min and chased for various time periods; wild-type TR and TR chimeras were then isolated by immunoprecipitation using an antibody to the TR extracellular domain and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR chimeras were more rapidly degraded (t½ < 2 and 10 h, respectively) than the wild-type TR (t½ ∼24 h) and the LAMP-TR chimera (t½ ∼ 22 h), suggesting that only the CD3 γ-chain and LAP tails were sufficient to target the TR to the lysosomal compartment. After 2 h (Fig. 2), the M r of the wild-type TR and each of the chimeras increased to that of the mature glycoprotein (40Omary M.B. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12888-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that all of the chimeras traverse the Golgi compartment where oligosaccharide processing is completed before degradation occurs. To confirm that degradation was occurring in a lysosomal compartment, we monitored the rate of degradation in the presence of a lysosomotrophic agent, ammonium chloride. As shown in Fig.3 the half-lives of the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR chimeras were extended from 1.5 h to 21 h and 5.5 h to 21 h, respectively, in the presence of 50 mm NH4Cl. Addition of 100 μg/ml protease inhibitor, leupeptin, also increased the half-lives of the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR chimeras (data not shown). Next, we compared the intracellular distribution of the chimeras to LEP100, an endogenous chicken lysosomal integral membrane protein (6Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar,7Mathews P.M. Martinie J.B. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1027-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Lippincott-Schwartz J. Fambrough D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The CD3 γ-chain-TR and the LAP-TR chimeras both showed significant co-localization with LEP100 (Fig.4, A and B, respectively), whereas the LAMP-TR chimera and wild-type TR did not (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively), suggesting that the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR traffic along the prelysosomal segment of the endocytic pathway. The low levels of co-localization of the wild-type TR and LAMP-TR with LEP100 are consistent with previous results using gold label immunocytochemistry, which demonstrated that ∼11% of the wild-type TR is found in the LEP100-containing compartment (28Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To determine the minimum sorting information required for lysosomal targeting, we transplanted the tyrosine-based signals from LAMP-1 (the amino acid residues YQTI) (5Honing S. Hunziker W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 42Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1941-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), LAP (residues YRHV) (18Lehmann L.E. Eberle W. Krull S. Prill V. Schmidt B. Sander C. von Figura K. Peters C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and CD3 γ-chain (residues YQPLK) (21Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and the dileucine-based signal (residues DKQTLL) from the CD3 γ-chain (21Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) into the TR cytoplasmic tail in place of the native TR internalization signal, YTRF (Fig.1 B). As shown in Table II, each of the transplanted signals, DKQTLL (CD3 γ-chain), YQPLK (CD3 γ-chain), YQTI (LAMP-1), and YRHV (LAP) were effective at promoting TR internalization (relative activities of 153, 109, 46, and 80%, respectively, compared with the wild-type TR), demonstrating that the dileucine signal was the most effective internalization signal.Table IIComparisons of steady-state distributions and 59Fe uptake efficiencies of human TR chimerasHuman TR constructsInternalized human TR at steady stateInternalization efficiency2-aCalculated from steady-state assays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Iron uptakeInternalization efficiency2-bCalculated from iron uptake assays.%%atoms/receptor/h%Wild-type (Y20TRF23)64 ± 0.82-cMean value ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab To determine if the transplanted signals were sufficient to promote lysosomal targeting of TR, metabolic pulse-chase experiments were performed. The results demonstrate that CD3 γ-chain dileucine signal, DKQTLL, in contrast to the CD3 γ-chain-TR chimera, is degraded slowly (t½ = 16 h; Fig.5). Similarly, the rate of degradation of the mutant TRs containing the LAP signal, YRHV, or the CD3 γ-chain signal, YQPLK, were slow (t½ = 15.5 h and >24 h, respectively) like the wild-type TR (t½ > 24 h). This indicated that none of the individual signals were sufficient to deliver the TR to the prelysosomal/lysosomal compartment. Since the CD3 γ-chain tail was sufficient for delivery of the TR to the lysosomal compartment, but the individual signals were not, we next asked if insertion of two CD3 γ-chain signals into the TR tail would reconstitute lysosomal targeting. To perform this experiment, we took advantage of the fact that introduction of a YTRF internalization signal at position 31–34 in the TR cytoplasmic tail restores endocytosis of an internalization-defective mutant receptor to wild-type levels, suggesting that a signal in this position is efficiently recognized at the cell surface (36Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were reported by Pytowskiet al. (43Pytowski B. Judge T.W. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9067-9073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that introduction of a tyrosine residue for the first or last residue at position 31–34 created an effective internalization signal. Based on these two studies, we introduced the CD3 γ-chain signal, YQPLK, at position 31–35 of the D18KQTLL23 mutant, and analyzed the resulting mutant, D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35(Fig. 1 C), in a metabolic pulse-chase experiment. As shown in Fig. 6, the D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35mutant was similar to the CD3 γ-chain-TR chimera in that it was rapidly degraded (t½ = 2 h) and its degradation could be inhibited in the presence of NH4Cl (t½ = 17 h). Unexpectedly, the internalization rate of this mutant was twice that of the CD3 γ-chain-TR chimera (Table II). Since the D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35mutant promoted lysosomal targeting, we next asked if two tyrosine-based signals could provide the same sorting information. To test this, we examined the half-lives of three previously described mutants that contain an additional copy of the YTRF sequence inserted at different locations within the TR cytoplasmic domain (36Collawn J.F. Lai A. Domingo D. Fitch M. Hatton S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21686-21692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C). As shown in Fig. 7, the Y31TRF34 mutant had a half-life of 6 h, whereas the Y9TRF12 and Y47TRF50 mutants had half lives of 17 h and >24 h, respectively (Fig. 7). Treatment with NH4Cl increased the half-life of the Y31TRF34 mutant to 14 h (data not shown). These results suggest that having a second signal at position 31–34 or 31–35 in the TR cytoplasmic tail restores lysosomal targeting and that placement of a second signal at other cytoplasmic tail positions does not. Because a number of lysosomal membrane proteins have short cytoplasmic tails with tyrosine-based signals in close proximity to the transmembrane region, we next asked if transplantation of signals into a truncated TR cytoplasmic tail, Δ3–18, 29–59, promoted lysosomal targeting (Fig.1 D). Δ3–18, 29–59 TR has previously been shown to promote efficient internalization (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, each of the truncation mutants, Y4QTI7 and Y4RHV7, promoted TR internalization. Furthermore, metabolic pulse-chase experiments revealed that each was rapidly degraded (t½ = 3.5, 3, and 3 h, for the Y4QTI7, Y4RHV7 and Δ3–18, 29–59 mutants, respectively) (Fig.8). These results suggest that even the wild-type TR signal, YTRF, is sufficient for lysosomal targeting if presented in the proper context. Although the metabolic pulse-chase experiments indicated that several of the TR chimeras were rapidly degraded in a post-Golgi compartment, we wanted to determine if the chimeras that reached the cell surface were also delivered to the lysosomal compartment. To address this, we performed the following experiment. Cells expressing the chimeras were incubated with125I-labeled Tf at 37 °C for 1 h to load the endocytic pathway with receptor-ligand complexes (28Odorizzi C.G. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The cells were then rapidly washed and the reappearance of intact and labeled Tf in the medium was determined by measuring trichloroacetic acid-insoluble and soluble radioactive counts. For the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP chimeras, 31 and 20% of Tf bound, respectively, were degraded before being released into the medium (trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts; Fig. 9 A), whereas only 2.6% of Tf bound to the wild-type TR was. Thus, a substantial fraction of CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR chimeras are directly targeted to lysosomes after internalization. Analysis of the D18KQTLL23 mutant, the D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35mutant, and Δ3–18, 29–59 TR indicated that 5, 12, and 16% of Tf bound was degraded before being released into the medium (Fig.9 B). This result suggested that the D18KQTLL23,Y31QPLK35mutant and Δ3–18, 29–59 TR were delivered to the lysosomal compartment from the cell surface, albeit less efficiently than the CD3 γ-chain chimera. The studies reported here were undertaken to define more precisely the properties of lysosomal targeting signals. Our data indicate that the addition of the CD3 γ-chain and LAP cytoplasmic tails onto a type II membrane protein, the TR, is sufficient for efficient targeting of the chimeras to the lysosomal compartment. Interestingly, the LAMP-1 cytoplasmic domain did not confer this same targeting specificity. Williams and Fukuda (17Williams M.A. Fukuda M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that the addition of the 11-residue cytoplasmic tail of LAMP-1 to a reporter molecule, the soluble human gonadotropin α-chain spliced to the VSV-G protein transmembrane domain, was sufficient to deliver the chimera to the lysosomes. They also demonstrated that a tyrosine was a critical part of the signal and that the position of the tyrosine residue within the cytoplasmic tail was critical for lysosomal targeting. Studies by Guarnieri et al. (42Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1941-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the murine LAMP-1 extended these findings to show that the lysosomal targeting signal consisted of the last 4 residues in the 11-residue tail that formed the pattern Y-X-X-hydrophobic. Furthermore, there appeared to be a strict requirement for the placement of this motif relative to the transmembrane region since a 7-residue spacer was necessary for proper recognition (42Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1941-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rohrer et al. (11Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the spacer requirement was important for sorting in the sorting endosome and less so at the cell surface. In our studies, placement of this 4-residue signal, YQTI, in 61-residue TR tail as well as placement of the entire 11-residue LAMP-1 tail in a 4-residue “tailless” TR tail all produced chimeras that were efficiently internalized but not lysosomally targeted. Interestingly, the only case in which this motif was recognized as a lysosomal targeting signal was in a truncated TR cytoplasmic tail, placing the YQTI motif 7 residues from the transmembrane region. This suggested that the spacer requirement found in type I membrane proteins (11Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 42Guarnieri F.G. Arterburn L.M. Penno M.B. Cha Y. August J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1941-1946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also true for type II membrane proteins such as the TR. The same spacing requirement, however, was not important for endocytosis, since chimeras containing the YQTI motif were internalized with the same efficiency when the motif was placed at 2, 7, or 38 amino acids from the transmembrane region. The evidence that both the CD3 γ-chain and LAP chimeras are efficiently delivered to the lysosome comes from both biochemical and morphological experiments. First, metabolic pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the chimeras were rapidly degraded in a post-Golgi compartment. Clearly, formation of the maturely glycoslyated chimeras confirmed that they were not simply misfolded proteins that failed to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Second, degradation of the chimeras occurred in a lysosomal compartment since the degradation could be inhibited with the weak base, ammonium chloride. Third, ∼31% of the CD3 γ-chain TR chimeras that were displayed on the cell surface were degraded after internalization. Fourth, the intracellular distribution of the CD3 γ-chain-TR and LAP-TR chimeras overlapped significantly with a marker of the prelysosomal/lysosomal compartment, LEP100, whereas the wild-type TR and LAMP-TR chimera did not. Our results on the CD3 γ-chain-TR chimeras are consistent with those of Letourneur and Klausner (21Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1143-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) who reported that the CD3 γ- and δ-chains of the T cell antigen receptor cytoplasmic tails contained two lysosomal-sorting signals. Using chimeras consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the Tac antigen (Il-2 receptor α-chain) spliced to the cytoplasmic tails of these subunits, they identified a tyrosine-based motif, YQLPK, and a dileucine motif, DKQTLL, that functioned to deliver the chimera to the lysosome without going to the cell surface. Mutants that contained only one of these signals were delivered to the cell surface, rapidly internalized, and subsequently delivered to the lysosomes. The dileucine motif alone, therefore, served as an effective internalization signal as well as a lysosomal targeting signal in the context of the CD3 γ-chain. Our studies show that the DKQTLL sequence is also sufficient to mediate rapid internalization of the TR, indicating that tyrosine-based signals and dileucine signals appear to be functionally equivalent. Our results, however, differ in that the dileucine motif alone was not sufficient to target the TR to the lysosome. The half-life of this chimera was 18 ± 2.0 h (mean ± S.E. for five independent experiments), suggesting that additional targeting information is required. The other mutant that was delivered to the lysosome, the LAP-TR chimera, was not as efficiently delivered to the lysosomal compartment as the CD3 γ-chain chimera (t½ = 8.2 ± 0.6 h (mean ± S.E. of six independent experiments)). Insertion of the LAP cytoplasmic tail into a “tailless” TR tail (Fig. 1) placed the YRHV signal 9 residues from the transmembrane. Interestingly, placement of this signal in the truncated TR tail, positioned this signal 7 residue from the transmembrane and resulted in a more rapid degradation (t½ = 5.3 ± 1.8 h, mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments). In the context of the wild-type LAP protein, this signal is 8 residues from the transmembrane region. That this sequence, YRHV, was not specifically required for lysosomal targeting in the context of the truncated TR cytoplasmic tail was demonstrated by the fact that the LAMP-1 targeting signal, YQTI, as well as the native TR internalization signal, YTRF, were also sufficient for this sorting process. Several studies have shown that the direct intracellular route used by newly synthesized cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors is from the trans-Golgi to the early endosomal compartment (4Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar,44Beaumelle B.D. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1811-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This may represent the pathway taken by lysosomal membrane proteins, implying that the sorting signals for lysosomal targeting would need to be recognized at the sorting endosome, as was suggested in the studies by Rohrer et al. (11Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) on LAMP-1. Our data support this idea since all of the mutants successfully reached the endosome, yet many failed to be delivered further into the endocytic pathway. For efficient lysosomal delivery, our chimeras contained one of the following structural features: 1) a dileucine-based signal and a tyrosine-based signal separated by 5–7 residues, 2) two tyrosine-based signals separated by 7 residues, or 3) a single tyrosine-based signal 7–9 residues from the transmembrane region. Interestingly, however, not all two-signal chimeras conferred lysosomal targeting specificity, suggesting that there was a strict positional requirement of these signals for proper targeting. In conclusion, our data support the following model. Constitutively recycling receptors contain internalization signals that allow them to enter the endocytic pathway. Once they reach the sorting endosome, another sorting decision is made. Since the TR lacking a cytoplasmic domain recycles to the cell surface as effectively as a wild-type TR (Jing et al. (13Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)), then recycling would be expected to be the default pathway. The results presented here demonstrate that the same signal types that function as efficient internalization signals can function as lysosomal targeting signals, but the cytoplasmic tail positional requirements for lysosomal signals appear to be much more restricted. This suggests that similar motifs have been adapted for use in endocytosis and lysosomal targeting (and perhaps trans-Golgi network sorting), and that positional changes of the motif within the cytoplasmic tail affect recognition at each site differently."

A. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 2679–2687). Scanning the surface of this region identified three basic amino acids Lys249, Arg307, and Lys311 flanking a small crevice on the p66 thumb subdomain outside the primer-template binding cleft. To assess an interaction of this region with the tRNA anticodon loop, these p66 residues were altered to Glu or Gln. p66 subunits containing K249Q, K311Q, K311E, and a dual R307E/K311E mutation formed a stable dimer with wild type p51. All mutants showed reduced affinity for tRNALys-3 and supported significantly less (−)-strand DNA synthesis from this primer than the parental heterodimer. In contrast, these variants efficiently synthesized HIV-1 (−)-strand strong-stop DNA from oligonucleotide primers and had minimal effect on RNase H activity, retaining endonucleolytic and directed cleavage of an RNA/DNA hybrid. Structural features of binary RT·tRNALys-3 complexes were examined by in situ footprinting, via susceptibility to 1,10-phenanthroline-copper-mediated cleavage. Unlike wild type RT, mutants p66K311Q/p51 and p66K311E/p51 failed to protect the tRNA anticodon domain from chemical cleavage, indicating a significant structural alteration in the binary RT·tRNA complex. These results suggest a crevice in the p66 thumb subdomain of HIV-1 RT supports an interaction with the tRNALys-3 anticodon loop critical for efficient (−)-strand DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2036546313,"Abstract Coagulation factor XIIIa, plasma transglutaminase (endo-γ-glutamine:e-lysine transferase EC2.3.2.13) catalyzes isopeptide bond formation between glutamine and lysine residues and rapidly cross-links fibrin clots. A monoclonal antibody (5A2) directed to a fibrinogen Aα-chain segment 529–539 was previously observed from analysis of end-stage plasma clots to block fibrin α-chain cross-linking. This prompted the study of its effect on nonfibrinogen substrates, with the prospect that 5A2 was inhibiting XIIIa directly. It inhibited XIIIa-catalyzed incorporation of the amine donor substrate dansylcadaverine into the glutamine acceptor dimethylcasein in an uncompetitive manner with respect to dimethylcasein utilization and competitively with respect to dansylcadaverine. Uncompetitive inhibition was also observed with the synthetic glutamine substrate, LGPGQSKVIG. Theoretically, uncompetitive inhibition arises from preferential interaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme-substrate complex but is also found to inhibit γ-chain cross-linking. The conjunction of the uncompetitive and competitive modes of inhibition indicates in theory that this bireactant system involves an ordered reaction in which docking of the glutamine substrate precedes the amine exchange. The presence of substrate enhanced binding of 5A2 to XIIIa, an interaction deemed to occur through a C-terminal segment of the XIIIa A-chain (643–658,GSDMTVTVQFTNPLKE), 55% of which comprises sequences occurring in the fibrinogen epitope Aα-(529–540) (GSESGIFTNTKE). Removal of the C-terminal domain from XIIIa abolishes the inhibitory effect of 5A2 on activity. Crystallographic studies on recombinant XIIIa place the segment 643–658 in the region of the groove through which glutamine substrates access the active site and have predicted that for catalysis, a conformational change may accompany glutamine-substrate binding. The uncompetitive inhibition and the substrate-dependent binding of 5A2 provide evidence for the conformational change."
