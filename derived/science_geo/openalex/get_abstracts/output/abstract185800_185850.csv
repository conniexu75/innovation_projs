https://openalex.org/W2116586125,"In March 2003, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was discovered in association with cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS). The sequence of the complete genome of SARS-CoV was determined, and the initial characterization of the viral genome is presented in this report. The genome of SARS-CoV is 29,727 nucleotides in length and has 11 open reading frames, and its genome organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and sequence comparisons showed that SARS-CoV is not closelyrelated to anyof the previouslycharacterized coronaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2169198329,"We sequenced the 29,751-base genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus known as the Tor2 isolate. The genome sequence reveals that this coronavirus is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins indicates that the virus does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses. The genome sequence will aid in the diagnosis of SARS virus infection in humans and potential animal hosts (using polymerase chain reaction and immunological tests), in the development of antivirals (including neutralizing antibodies), and in the identification of putative epitopes for vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2074382743,"We summarize the findings of a recently completed study of the productivity impacts of international crop genetic improvement research in developing countries. Over the period 1960 to 2000, international agricultural research centers, in collaboration with national research programs, contributed to the development of “modern varieties” for many crops. These varieties have contributed to large increases in crop production. Productivity gains, however, have been uneven across crops and regions. Consumers generally benefited from declines in food prices. Farmers benefited only where cost reductions exceeded price reductions."
https://openalex.org/W2134530067,"A major pathway of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) turnover begins with deadenylation, followed by decapping and 5' to 3' exonucleolytic decay. We provide evidence that mRNA decapping and 5' to 3' degradation occur in discrete cytoplasmic foci in yeast, which we call processing bodies (P bodies). First, proteins that activate or catalyze decapping are concentrated in P bodies. Second, inhibiting mRNA turnover before decapping leads to loss of P bodies; however, inhibiting turnover at, or after, decapping, increases the abundance and size of P bodies. Finally, mRNA degradation intermediates are localized to P bodies. These results define the flux of mRNAs between polysomes and P bodies as a critical aspect of cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism and a possible site for regulation of mRNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1977135603,"Continuation of mammalian species requires the formation and development of the sexually dimorphic germ cells. Cultured embryonic stem cells are generally considered pluripotent rather than totipotent because of the failure to detect germline cells under differentiating conditions. Here we show that mouse embryonic stem cells in culture can develop into oogonia that enter meiosis, recruit adjacent cells to form follicle-like structures, and later develop into blastocysts. Oogenesis in culture should contribute to various areas, including nuclear transfer and manipulation of the germ line, and advance studies on fertility treatment and germ and somatic cell interaction and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2018465482,"Polarized infrared optical emission was observed from a carbon nanotube ambipolar field-effect transistor (FET). An effective forward-biased p-n junction, without chemical dopants, was created in the nanotube by appropriately biasing the nanotube device. Electrical measurements show that the observed optical emission originates from radiative recombination of electrons and holes that are simultaneously injected into the undoped nanotube. These observations are consistent with a nanotube FET model in which thin Schottky barriers form at the source and drain contacts. This arrangement is a novel optical recombination radiation source in which the electrons and holes are injected into a nearly field-free region. Sucha source may form the basis for ultrasmall integrated photonic devices."
https://openalex.org/W2053585782,"Images of the assembly of surfactants and synthetic lipids on the surface of carbon nanotubes were obtained by transmission electron microscopy. Above the critical micellar concentration, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) forms supramolecular structures made of rolled-up half-cylinders on the nanotube surface. Depending on the symmetry and the diameter of the carbon nanotube, we observed rings, helices, or double helices. Similar self-assemblies were also obtained with several synthetic single-chain lipids designed for the immobilization of histidine-tagged proteins. At the nanotube-water interface, permanent assemblies were produced from mixed micelles of SDS and different water-insoluble double-chain lipids after dialysis of the surfactant. Such arrangements could be further exploited for the development of new biosensors and bioelectronic nanomaterials."

https://openalex.org/W2051395442,"Correction of gene defects in human somatic cells by targeting as has been used in murine embryonic stem cells (1, 2) has been precluded by the low spontaneous rate of gene targeting (3). However, creation of a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) in the genomic target (DSB-GT) can stimulate homologous recombination by over 1000-fold (4). 

We can rapidly and quantitatively measure gene targeting by correcting a mutation in a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene that has been stably integrated into the genome (5) (fig. S1). With an optimized GFP gene targeting system, the introduction of a DSB by I–Sce I (Sce) stimulated GT >40,000-fold and the absolute rate of gene targeting reached 3 to 5% (fig. S2). Such a system, however, depends on the prior introduction of a Sce binding site into the target gene and cannot be used for endogenous genes. Chimeric nucleases (CNs) have the potential to create sequence-specific DSBs (6). CNs—fusions between zinc finger binding DNA binding domains and the endonuclease domain of Fok I—can sitespecifically cleave naked DNA in vitro (6), extrachromosomal DNA in Xenopus oocytes (7), and chromosomal DNA in Drosophila (8). CNs work as dimers, and their efficiency depends on the spacing and orientation of the zinc finger binding sites with respect to the length of the amino acid linker between the DNA binding and endonuclease domains (7, 9). 

QQR is an artificial zinc finger DNA binding domain that recognizes the sequence 5′-GGGGAAGAA-3′ with nanomolar affinity (10). We modified QQR chimeric nucleases (QQR-CNs) (7, 9) (Fig. 1A) and tested whether they stimulated gene targeting (Fig. 1B). The background rate of gene targeting was 0.71 events per million transfected cells (fig. S1C). QQRL18-CN stimulated gene targeting 17-fold on target QQR6 and 260-fold on target QQR8 (Fig. 1B). QQRL0-CN did not stimulate gene targeting on target QQR8, but it was as efficient as Sce in stimulating gene targeting by over 2000-fold on target QQR6 (Fig. 1B). QQRL18-CN showed some preference for an 8–base pair (bp) spacing between binding sites whereas QQRL0-CN preferred 6-bp spacing. Thus, removing the linker between the zinc spacfinger and the nuclease domains increased the activity and specificity of the fusion protein in mammalian cells. As controls, we showed that the CNs did not stimulate gene targeting if (i) they lacked a nuclear localization signal, (ii) there was a single binding site rather than an inverted repeat binding site in the target, and (iii) the cognate binding site was changed. Thus, homodimers of CNs are potent stimulators of gene targeting in human somatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083889661,"Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) can efficiently bind and transfer HIV infectivity without themselves becoming infected. Using live-cell microscopy, we found that HIV was recruited to sites of cell contact in MDDCs. Analysis of conjugates between MDDCs and T cells revealed that, in the absence of antigen-specific signaling, the HIV receptors CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 on the T cell were recruited to the interface while the MDDCs concentrated HIV to the same region. We propose that contact between dendritic cells and T cells facilitates transmission of HIV by locally concentrating virus, receptor, and coreceptor during the formation of an infectious synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2110029962,"Degenerative disorders of motor neurons include a range of progressive fatal diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Although the causative genetic alterations are known for some cases, the molecular basis of many SMA and SBMA-like syndromes and most ALS cases is unknown. Here we show that missense point mutations in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain result in progressive motor neuron degeneration in heterozygous mice, and in homozygotes this is accompanied by the formation of Lewy-like inclusion bodies, thus resembling key features of human pathology. These mutations exclusively perturb neuron-specific functions of dynein."
https://openalex.org/W2168467995,"Human cerebral cortical function degrades during old age. Much of this change may result from a degradation of intracortical inhibition during senescence. We used multibarreled microelectrodes to study the effects of electrophoretic application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the GABA type a (GABAa) receptor agonist muscimol, and the GABAa receptor antagonist bicuculline, respectively, on the properties of individual V1 cells in old monkeys. Bicuculline exerted a much weaker effect on neuronal responses in old than in young animals, confirming a degradation of GABA-mediated inhibition. On the other hand, the administration of GABA and muscimol resulted in improved visual function. Many treated cells in area V1 of old animals displayed responses typical of young cells. The present results have important implications for the treatment of the sensory, motor, and cognitive declines that accompany old age."
https://openalex.org/W2086820490,"Earthquake mitigation efforts in the United States currently use long-term probabilistic hazard assessments and rapid post-earthquake notification to reduce the potential damage of earthquakes. Here we present the seismological design for and demonstrate the feasibility of a short-term hazard warning system. Using data from past earthquakes, we show that our Earthquake Alarm System (ElarmS) could, with current TriNet instrumentation, issue a warning a few to tens of seconds ahead of damaging ground motion. The system uses the frequency content of the P-wave arrival to determine earthquake magnitude, an approach that allows magnitude determination before any damaging ground motion occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1975036248,"The reaction of [Cp*Fe(eta5-P5)] with Cu(I)Cl in solvent mixtures of CH2Cl2/CH3CN leads to the formation of entirely inorganic fullerene-like molecules of the formula [[Cp*Fe(eta5:eta1:eta1:eta1:eta1:eta1-P5)]12[CuCl]10[Cu2Cl3]5[Cu(CH3CN)2]5] (1) possessing 90 inorganic core atoms. This compound represents a structural motif similar to that of C60: cyclo-P5 rings of [Cp*Fe(eta5-P5)] molecules are surrounded by six-membered P4Cu2 rings that result from the coordination of each of the phosphorus lone pairs to CuCl metal centers, which are further coordinated by P atoms of other cyclo-P5 rings. Thus, five- and six-membered rings alternate in a manner comparable to that observed in the fullerene molecules. The so-formed half shells are joined by [Cu2Cl3]- as well as by [Cu(CH3CN)2]+ units. The spherical body has an inside diameter of 1.25 nanometers and an outside diameter of 2.13 nanometers, which is about three times as large as that of C60."
https://openalex.org/W2007361012,"In keratinocytes, UVB light stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Lysates of these cells were found to possess a non-dialyzable, trypsin- and heat-sensitive material capable of generating ROS in response to UVB light. Using ion exchange, metal affinity, and size exclusion chromatography, a 240-kDa protein was isolated with ROS generating activity. The protein exhibited strong absorption in the 320–360 nm range with additional soret peaks around 400–410 nm, suggesting the presence of heme. Sequencing using liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry identified the protein as catalase. Using purified catalases from a variety of species, the ROS generating activity was found to be temperature- and O2-dependent, stimulated by inhibitors of the catalatic activity of catalase, including 3-aminotriazole and azide, and inhibited by cyanide. A marked increase in the production of ROS was observed in UVB-treated cells overexpressing catalase and decreased generation of oxidants was found in UVB-treated keratinocytes with reduced levels of catalase. Our data indicate that catalase plays a direct role in generating oxidants in response to UVB light. The finding that catalase mediates the production of ROS following UVB treatment is both novel and highly divergent from the well known antioxidant functions of the enzyme. We hypothesize that, through the actions of catalase, high energy DNA damaging UVB light is absorbed by the enzyme and converted to reactive chemical intermediates that can be detoxified by cellular antioxidant enzymes.

Chronic exposure to sunlight is a significant causative factor in the development of skin cancer. Modifications of DNA and other critical cellular macromolecules by the higher energy shorter solar wavelengths comprising the UVB spectra (290–320 nm) are the most damaging to the skin (for reviews, see Refs. 1Matsumura Y.

During this process several components of this cascade, including mutation of critical genes, can be mediated by the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (9Gocke E. J. Environ. Pathol.

When generated in excess, reactive oxygen species can also induce tissue injury and contribute to the development of skin cancer (16Droge W. Physiol.

In the present studies we report that human skin expresses an enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species in response to UVB light; unexpectedly, this enzyme was identified as catalase. The conversion of DNA damaging solar radiation into less energetic oxidant species by catalase is a novel and previously unrecognized activity of this antioxidant enzyme. Cells, UVB Light Irradiation, Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species— PAM 212 keratinocytes were kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Yuspa (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Human keratinocytes were from Clonetics (Gaithersburg, MD). HA-1 and catalase-overexpressing OC5 Chinese hamster fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Douglas Spitz (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IO). Bovine and mouse liver catalase, twice crystallized bovine liver catalase, and all chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Bovine catalase was processed as indicated below to confirm that the protein was purified to homogeneity. Repurified material was used to characterize the oxidant generating activity of the enzyme. Polyclonal anti-catalase antibodies were from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio-Rad. For anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography, an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatograph (Amersham Biosciences) fitted with a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and a Superose HR 10/30 column were used. Samples were applied to the columns in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 supplemented with 5% glycerol. Catalase eluted at ∼0.3 m NaCl using a linear salt gradient on the anion exchange column. Catalase eluted from the size exclusion column with a molecular mass of 240 kDa, which corresponds to the tetramer form of the enzyme. Metal affinity chromatography is a highly efficient method to purify catalase (20Yang Q. DePierre J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and we used a 1-ml HiTrap Chelating HP column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni(NO3)2 according to the manufacturer's instructions for these studies. Catalase was eluted using a 100 mm linear imidazole gradient. Purified material was analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and appeared as a single 60-kDa band following silver staining. For ultraviolet light treatment, cells or reaction mixtures were irradiated in uncovered 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY) with UVB light emitted from two Westinghouse FS20 light tubes as described previously (21Sur R. Heck D.E. Mariano T.M. Jin Y. Murphy W.J. Laskin J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The UVB lights were calibrated with an IL 442A Phototherapy Radiometer (International Light, Newburyport, MA). To generate dose responses, reaction mixes were either treated with UVB for increasing periods of time at a fixed distances from the light source (25 cm) or by increasing the intensity of the light source. Results from both methods were expressed as mJ/cm2 and produced similar results. Unless otherwise indicated, intracellular reactive oxygen species were detected using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in conjunction with flow cytometry as described previously (21Sur R.

For standard in vitro assays, reaction mixes contained 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 4.3 μm catalase in a reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the fluorescent probe (5 μm, final concentration). Fluorescence was quantified using an HTS 7000 plus bio-assay reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, UK) with 495 nm excitation and 520 nm emission filters. In some assays, peroxides were detected using 1,2,3-dihydrorhodamine (1,2,3-DHR, Molecular Probes). To determine the effects of pH on UVB light-stimulated hydrogen peroxide production, the reaction was performed in buffers ranging in pH from 3.5 to 10.0 (sodium acetate, pH 3.5 and 4.5; sodium citrate, pH 5.5 and 6.0; potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 7.4; sodium borate, pH 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 10.0). Cytochrome c assay and nitro blue tetrazolium assays were used to measure superoxide anion production in reaction mixes (23Bors W. Saran M. Michel C. Oberly L. Superoxide Dismutase. II.

Western blots were run as previously described (21Sur R. Heck D.E. Mariano T.M. Jin Y. Murphy W.J. Laskin J.D. Biochem.

Briefly, lysates containing catalase were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% BSA in tTBS buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, membranes were incubated with anti-catalase antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Catalase-antibody complexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Protein fragments derived from tryptic digests of purified protein were analyzed using a Finigan LCQ DECA XP mass spectrometer interfaced with a Thermo separation system. Fragments were aligned and sequences compared using NCBI Blast algorithms (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). Catalase morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized that contained nucleotide bases linked to a six-membered morpholino ring (Gene-Tools, Philomath, OR). Morpholino oligonucleotides were delivered to the keratinocytes using an ethoxylated polyethylenimine delivery system according to the manufacturer's directions. In some experiments oligos were biotinylated and transfection efficiency evaluated using fluorescent labeled streptavidin. In these experiments, ∼80–85% of the cells contained morpholino oligos. The 25-base morpholino probes, designed in conjunction with Dr. Shannon Knuth (Gene-Tools) were targeted to positions 57–81 of the cDNA sequence encoding murine catalase 1. In our initial studies, we analyzed the effects of UVB light on the generation of intracellular oxidants in human and mouse keratinocytes. We found that UVB light, in the range of 1–100 mJ/cm2, caused a marked increase in the formation of reactive oxygen species in both of these cell types (Fig. 1 and data not shown). This response was dependent on the dose of UVB light. To defend against damaging free radical-mediated reactions, cells possess enzymes and small molecular weight molecules with antioxidant activity (16Droge W. Physiol.

We found that depleting keratinocytes of glutathione using buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (Fig. 1, center panel). Moreover, glutathione-depleted cells were significantly more sensitive to the oxidant-generating effects of UVB light (Fig. 1, center panel). These results demonstrate that glutathione is critical for limiting the accumulation of potentially damaging reactive oxygen species in UVB-treated keratinocytes. To analyze mechanisms by which UVB light induces the formation of reactive oxygen species in keratinocytes, we determined whether intact cells were required for this process. Lysates, prepared by successive freeze thawing of mouse keratinocytes, were found to retain UVB light-induced oxidant generating activity. Following low speed centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min), ∼80% of the activity remained in cell supernatants. This was reduced to 30% by subsequent higher speed centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min). Thus, ∼70% of the oxidant generating activity was found in the resulting cell pellet. This fraction was largely comprised of actin and other insoluble polymers, intracellular organelles including peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum. We found that the reactive oxygen species generating activity was non-dialyzable, denatured by heating, and trypsin-sensitive, suggesting that the material was a protein (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Material generating reactive oxygen intermediates in response to UVB light was purified using ion exchange, metal affinity, and size exclusion chromatography. An example of the purification using an ion exchange column and a representative Western blot are shown in Fig. 2A. On the size exclusion column, this activity eluted with a molecular mass of 240 kDa and exhibited strong absorption in the range of 320–360 nm with additional soret peaks at 400–410 nm indicating the potential presence of iron-bound heme (not shown). Trypsin digests of the material were analyzed by liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry and found to contain peptide fragments that were highly homologous with the amino acid sequence predicted for catalase (residues Gly48–Arg68 and Gly78–Arg93 of mouse catalase 1, Cancer Genomics Office, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Interestingly, these peptide sequences were 99.6% homologous with catalase sequences from Rattus norvegicus, 97.2% homologous with human erythrocyte catalase, 95.6% homologous with bovine liver catalase, and 89.9% homologous with the sequence of Danio rerio catalase 1, reflecting the significant similarities found in vertebrate catalases and consistent with a protein containing an iron-ligated heme. These data suggested that the oxidant generating protein was catalase. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the column fractions using catalase-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, A and B, not shown). Moreover, commercially available catalase proteins, including twice crystallized bovine liver catalase and purified bovine and mouse liver catalase, produced reactive oxidant species when stimulated by UVB light (Fig. 2B). Taken together these data indicate that catalase is responsible for the UVB light-induced reactive oxygen species generating activity in keratinocytes. In further studies, we investigated this activity using highly purified bovine liver catalase. We found that the ability of the enzyme to generate reactive oxidants was dependent on the dose of UV light utilized and the concentration of catalase (Fig. 2C). It was also temperature- and oxygen-dependent and inhibited by heat denaturation (Fig. 2C and not shown). These experiments were performed using DCFH-DA as the probe for peroxide. Similar results were also found using the peroxide sensitive probe 1,2,3-DHR (Fig. 2C). In further experiments, we found that Met (30 mm) did not inhibit peroxide production by UVB-treated catalase when either DCFH-DA or 1,2,3-DHR was used as a probe suggesting that singlet oxygen was not formed (data not shown). At the doses of UVB used (<1–100 mJ/cm2), the superoxide anion could not be detected by cytochrome c and nitro blue tetrazolium assays, suggesting that it may not be an intermediate in the reaction under these conditions. However, we were able to detect superoxide anion at doses of UVB greater that 200 mJ/cm2 (data not shown). At the present time, we cannot rule out the possibility that the superoxide anion is formed in the reactions at low concentrations and/or that it is rapidly degraded. As observed in intact keratinocytes, the production of reactive oxygen species by purified catalase in response to UVB light was diminished in the presence of reduced glutathione (Figs. 3, lower panel, and not shown). The optimum pH for oxidant generation was 7.1 (Fig. 2C). Although the reaction was carried out under aqueous conditions, no additional substrates were required. The temperature dependence and pH sensitivity of the activity indicate that UV-mediated reactive oxygen species production is limited by the intracellular environment and the conformation of the protein. It is well established that catalase possesses an activity responsible for degrading hydrogen peroxide via the reaction: 2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2, a process also referred to as catalatic activity (31Chance B.

In addition, in the presence of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (<10–6m), catalase exhibits peroxidatic activity. In this reaction, oxygen containing electron donors such as ethanol and low molecular weight phenolic compounds are oxidized (for reviews, see Refs. 32Oshino N. Oshino R. Chance B. Biochem.

The mechanisms mediating the ability of catalase to function in catalatic and peroxidatic reactions have been the subject of numerous investigations (31Chance B. Oshino N. Biochem.

Rouxhet P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In early studies, the requirement for iron-bound heme in the protein was established using cyanide, which binds heme, inhibiting enzyme activity (45Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 168: 354-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). More recently, a 1.5-Å resolution structural analysis of catalase demonstrated that cyanide blocks substrate access to the heme iron (42Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A second component required for both the catalatic and peroxidatic activities of the enzyme is a specific hydrogen peroxide binding site. This site functions to optimally position peroxide molecules for heterolytic cleavage by catalase, an early step required for both reactions. The enzyme inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) has been reported to inactivate catalase by disrupting this binding site (42Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 43Ko T.P. Safo M.K. Musayev F.N. Di Salvo M.L. Wang C. Wu S.H. Abraham D.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Recent studies indicate that catalatic and peroxidatic enzymatic activity may also require a charge-relay network that stabilizes reaction intermediates and facilitates the heterolytic cleavage of peroxide. This network has been hypothesized to regulate catalase activity at the metal site by minimizing the charge of a porphyrin π-cation radical and an electron-deficient oxyferryl moiety at Tyr358 (42Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although increased electron density formed by the presence of cyanide at the heme iron may serve to alter this charge relay network, interactions between amino acid residues forming this network, and azide moieties that disrupt channel activity, are likely to account for the competitive inhibition of the enzyme by sodium azide (33Deisseroth A. Dounce A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1970; 50: 319-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 42Putnam C.D. Arvai A.S. Bourne Y. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Our observations that the effects of UVB light on catalase were highly pH-sensitive and oxygen-dependent, but did not require additional substrates, suggest that reactive oxygen species may be formed by the transfer of water-derived protons and subsequent interactions with molecular oxygen. To investigate this possibility, inhibitors of the catalatic and peroxidatic activity of catalase were used. We found that sodium cyanide induced a biphasic response, enhancing catalase activity at low concentrations but inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species at higher concentrations (Fig. 3). In contrast, both sodium azide and 3-AT enhanced UVB light-mediated reactive oxygen species production (Fig. 3). The distinct actions of these inhibitors on the different activities of catalase suggest that the mechanism mediating UVB light-induced responses is unique. The increases in production of reactive oxygen species at low concentrations of sodium cyanide, or in the presence of 3-AT or sodium azide, may result from inhibition of a competing hydrogen peroxide degrading activity of catalase, potentially through disruption of peroxide binding. However, in the presence of higher concentrations of cyanide, interaction of the anion with catalase heme is likely to block access to heme iron and to limit the activity of the charge relay network, rendering both structures unable to participate in the UVB-induced production of reactive oxygen species. The increased generation of reactive oxygen species that is observed in the presence of 3-AT and sodium azide suggests that the presence of reactants at the peroxide binding site, and the activity of the charge relay network, are both important in UVB light-mediated oxidant production. Analysis of our findings prompted us to hypothesize that, similar to 3AT, UVB light-induced effects alter the peroxide binding site allowing water molecules to access the heme iron. In our scheme, proton extraction from water molecules is also facilitated by azide-induced disruption of the charge relay network. Therefore, acting as substrates, water molecules provide a source for the generation of protons, which subsequently interact with O2 to generate reactive oxygen species. A question arises as to the significance of catalase as a mediator of oxidant production in keratinocytes exposed to UVB light. We reasoned that if catalase is important in this activity, then modulating expression of the enzyme should alter quantities of reactive oxidants produced by the cells. To test this we initially reduced levels of catalase protein in cells by transfecting morpholino-stabilized antisense oligonucleotides specific for murine catalase into PAM 212 keratinocytes. We found that antisense oligonucleotides effectively reduced both intracellular levels of catalase and the production of reactive oxygen species in response to UVB light (Fig. 4, lower panel). This was not observed in cells that were mock-transfected or in cells transfected with oligonucleotides specific for the inverted sequence or with random oligonucleotides. We also examined oxidant production in response to UVB light using a catalase expressing fibroblast cell line (HA-1 cells) and a variant clone adapted to hydrogen peroxide (OC5) that overexpresses catalase ∼30-fold (Fig. 4, upper panel) (47Spitz D.R. Li G.C. McCormick M.L. Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Radiat. Res. 1998; 114: 114-124Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both the parental and OC5 cells produced peroxides in response to UVB light treatment. However, significantly greater amounts of hydroperoxides were produced by OC5 cells in response to UVB light. Taken together these data indicate that intracellular catalase mediates oxidant formation in cells exposed to UVB light. Our observation that, in response to UVB light, catalase generates reactive oxygen intermediates is both novel and highly divergent from the well known antioxidant functions of this enzyme. We hypothesize that, depending on the intracellular oxidant status, catalase activity in response to UVB light can be either protective or cytotoxic. Thus, through the actions of catalase, high energy DNA-damaging short wave ultraviolet light is absorbed by the enzyme and converted to reactive chemical intermediates that can be further metabolized and detoxified by cellular antioxidant enzymes. However, when antioxidant moieties are limited, UVB light-induced oxidants formed through the actions of catalase can cause cellular damage and tissue injury. We speculate that reactive peroxides produced in excessive or inappropriate quantities through the actions of catalase have the capacity to induce oxidative stress in keratinocytes, damage critical cellular molecules including DNA, and contribute to the development of skin cancer."

Two mutations, glycine-708 to asparagine-708 (G708N)and methionine-701 to asparagine-701, in the transmembrane helix of the β3 subunit enabled integrin αIIbβ3 to constitutively bind soluble fibrinogen. Further characterization of the G708N mutant revealed that it induced αIIbβ3 clustering and constitutive phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. This mutation also enhanced the tendency of the transmembrane helix to form homotrimers. These results suggest that homomeric associations involving transmembrane domains provide a driving force for integrin activation. They also suggest a structural basis for the coincidence of integrin activation and clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2078629577,"Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the present investigation, treatment of human fibroblasts with AMPK activators such as 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside, antimycin A, and sodium azide inhibited cell growth and lowered the expression of proliferative genes. As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a “young cell” phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. We therefore postulated that AMPK activation in human fibroblasts might contribute to the implementation of the senescence phenotype through mechanisms that included a reduction in HuR cytoplasmic presence. Indeed, AMP:ATP ratios were 2–3-fold higher in senescent fibroblasts compared with young fibroblasts. Accordingly, in vitro senescence was accompanied by a marked elevation in AMPK activity. Evidence that increased AMPK activity directly contributed to the implementation of the senescent phenotype was obtained through two experimental approaches. First, use of AMPK activators triggered senescence characteristics in fibroblasts, such as the acquisition of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity and increased p16INK4a expression. Second, infection of cells with an adenoviral vector that expresses active AMPK increased senescence-associated β-gal activity, whereas infection with an adenovirus that expresses dominant-negative AMPK decreased senescence-associated β-gal activity. Together, our results indicate that AMPK activation can cause premature fibroblast senescence through mechanisms that likely involve reduced HuR function.

Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), was discovered two decades ago. However, details of its molecular composition, regulation, and function are only now beginning to be elucidated. Structurally, mammalian AMPK is a heterotrimer of three subunits: one catalytic (α) and two regulatory (β and γ) subunits (2Cheung P.C. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 3Stapleton D. Woollatt E. Mitchelhill K.I. Nicholl J.K. Fernandez C.S. Michell B.J. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Sutherland G.R. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). AMPK activity is ubiquitous, although different isoforms of AMPK subunits display tissue-specific distribution, as well as preferential subcellular localization. AMPK is activated directly by elevations in AMP and inhibited by high concentrations of ATP. Conditions that elevate the AMP:ATP ratio in cells, such as growth factor depletion, hypoglycemia, ischemia in heart muscle, exercise in skeletal muscle, as well as treatment with arsenite, azide, oxidative agents, and the pharmacological agent AICAR (which mimics the effect of AMP), can cause activation of AMPK (4Hardie D.G.

BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In turn, AMPK inhibits biosynthetic pathways, thus conserving energy while it activates catabolic pathways, thereby generating more ATP (reviewed in Ref. 4Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar).AMPK has been shown to influence gene expression in a variety of ways (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). AMPK-mediated transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated in yeast, where the AMPK homologue SNF1 is a pivotal regulator of glucose-related gene expression at times of low fuel availability (4Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 6Hardie D.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of AMPK on gene transcription in mammalian cells has also been documented. Recently, AMPK was shown to phosphorylate the transcriptional coactivator p300, thereby modulating its ability to interact with many nuclear receptors (7Yang W. Hong Y.H. Shen X.Q. Frankowski C. Camp H.S. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38341-38344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). AMPK has also been proposed to influence the levels of transcription factor forkhead FKHR (8Barthel A. Schmoll D. Kruger K.D. Roth R.A. Joost H.G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3183-3186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to alter the transcription of various genes, including GLUT4 (9Zheng D. MacLean P.S. Pohnert S.C. Knight J.B. Olson A.L. Winder W.W. Dohm G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 3: 1073-1083Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK was recently reported to have an inhibitory effect on protein synthesis, associated with decreased activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin signal transduction pathway and its effectors (10Bolster D.R.

Finally, AMPK has been shown to influence mRNA turnover by inhibiting the cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR (11Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J.

Because HuR is predominantly (>90%) localized in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, it has been proposed that the mRNA-stabilizing influence of HuR requires its translocation to the cytoplasm (12Atasoy U.

Using two different human fibroblast models of in vitro senescence, we recently reported the influence of the RNA-binding protein HuR in regulating the expression of several genes whose expression decreases during senescence (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that HuR levels, HuR binding to target mRNAs, and the half-lives of such mRNAs were lower in senescent cells. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a “younger” phenotype, whereas a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J.

These studies highlighted a critical role of mRNA turnover during the process of replicative senescence and specifically implicated HuR in the regulation of such events. In the present study, we set out to test the hypothesis that AMPK activity might be elevated with senescence. Upon discovering that indeed AMP:ATP ratios are higher in senescent cells, we found that AMPK activity was accordingly elevated in senescent cells. Given the influence of AMPK on HuR function, we further assessed whether differences in AMPK function could modulate the process of in vitro senescence. Activation of AMPK led to an enhancement of the senescent phenotype associated with reduced cytoplasmic HuR levels, HuR binding to target mRNAs, and target mRNA half-life. By contrast, reduced AMPK function brought about a young, proliferative phenotype. Our findings strongly support a role for AMPK in the implementation of the senescence phenotype and suggest that AMPK-regulated HuR may be a critical factor in this process.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Transfection, Infection, and Assessment of Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Activity—Human IDH4 fibroblasts were generously provided by J. W. Shay (31Wright W.E. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Early passage (∼15–20 population doublings (pdl)) and late passage (50–53 pdl) human diploid IMR-90 fibroblasts as well as early passage (25–30 pdl) and late passage (54–58 pdl) human diploid WI-38 fibroblasts were from Coriell Cell Repositories (Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ). All of the fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Unless otherwise indicated, IDH4 cell culture medium was further supplemented with 1 μm dexamethasone (Dex) for constitutive expression of SV40 large T antigen to suppress senescence and stimulate proliferation (31Wright W.E. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To induce senescence of IDH4 cells, Dex was removed from the culture medium, regular serum was replaced with charcoal-stripped serum, and the cells were assessed at different times thereafter. Actinomycin D, dexamethasone, AICAR, 5′-AMP, antimycin A, and sodium azide were from Sigma.Adenoviruses expressing either the control gene GFP (AdGFP), a dominant-negative isoform of the α1 subunit of AMPK (Ad(DN)AMPK), or a constitutively active isoform of the AMPK α1 subunit (Ad-(CA)AMPK) (32Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) were amplified and titered in 293 cells using standard methodologies. The infections were carried out in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h. Infection efficiency was determined by infection with AdGFP at various plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell, and assessment of the percentage of GFP-expressing cells 48 h later. For >90% infection of IDH4 and IMR-90 cells, 300 PFU/cell was required.Assessment of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity was carried out as previously described (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E.

Briefly, the cells were seeded in 30-mm dishes, cultured in medium without Dex for different lengths of time, and fixed with a 3% formaldehyde solution. The cells were then washed and incubated with senescence-associated β-gal staining solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm ferrocyanide, 5 mm ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) for 12–18 h to visualize senescence-associated β-gal activity (33Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5618) Google Scholar).Northern and Western Blot Analysis and Subcellular Fractionation— Northern blot analysis was carried out as previously described (34Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An oligomer complementary to 18 S (34Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was 3′ end-labeled using terminal transferase enzyme, whereas PCR-generated fragments of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and β-actin cDNAs were random primer-labeled using Klenow enzyme (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar); all of the labeling reactions were carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. Signals on Northern blots were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Ca).For Western blotting, whole cell (20 μg) or cytoplasmic (40 μg) lysates were prepared as previously described (17Wang W. Furneaux H Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Monoclonal antibodies were used to detect HuR (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), histone deacetylase 1, and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Following secondary antibody incubations, the signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, quantitated by densitometry, and normalized against a loading control (β-Actin for cytoplasmic and whole cell samples, histone deacetylase 1 for nuclear protein samples). The quantitative values are presented as the percentage of untreated cells or the percentage of Ad(GFP).Preparation of Radiolabeled Transcripts—For in vitro synthesis of radiolabeled transcripts, RNA from IDH4 cells was reverse transcribed, and the cDNAs generated were used as templates in PCRs to amplify the 3′-UTRs of cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin E, and c-Fos cDNAs, as described (17Wang W. Furneaux H Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 35Wang W. Lin S. Caldwell M.C. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). All 5′ oligonucleotides contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence CCAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA(T7). To prepare the cyclin A 3′-UTR template, oligonucleotides (T7)CCAGAGACACTAAATCTGTAAC and GGTAACAAATTTCTGGTTTATTTC (region 1499–2718) were used. To prepare the cyclin B1 3′-UTR template, oligonucleotides (T7)GTCAAGAACAAGTATGCCA and CTGAAGTGGGAGCGGAAAAG (region 1369–1702) were used. To prepare the cyclin E 3′-UTR template, oligonucleotides (T7)CACAGAGCGGTAAGAAGCAG and GGATAGATATAGCAGCACTTAC (region 1169–1714) were used. PCR fragments served as templates for the synthesis of corresponding RNAs (36Gorospe M. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11845-11851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were used at a specific activity of 100,000 cpm/μl (2–10 fmol/μl).RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (REMSA) and Supershift Assay—Reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 1 μg of tRNA, 2–10 fmol of RNA, and 5 μg of protein in reaction buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and digested with RNase T1 (500 units/reaction) for 15 min at 37 °C. The complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through native gels (7% acrylamide in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA buffer). The gels were subsequently dried, and radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of antibody was incubated with lysates for 1 h on ice before the addition of radiolabeled RNA; all of the subsequent steps were as described for REMSA. For supershifts, anti-HuR (Molecular Probes) and anti-p38 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) antibodies were used.AMPK Assay and Determination of AMP:ATP Ratios—AMPK was assayed as described (37Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AMPK was immunoprecipitated from 5 μg of cell lysate using 1 μg of anti-α1 and 1 μg of anti-α2 polyclonal antibodies in AMPK immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer plus 1 m NaCl and then with a buffer containing 62.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 62.5 mm NaCl, 62.5 mm NaF, 6.25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1.25 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. AMPK activity in immunocomplexes was determined by phosphorylation of peptide HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR (SAMS) (37Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar) in reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Brij-35, 0.25 mm SAMS, 0.25 mm AMP, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 10 min at 30 °C. The assay mixtures were spotted onto P81 filter paper and rinsed in 1% (v/v) phosphoric acid with gentle stirring to remove free ATP. Phosphorylated substrate was measured by scintillation counting. Measurement of AMP and ATP was carried out as previously described (38Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25226-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence—Proliferating IDH4 cells were seeded on coverslips and either left untreated or treated with AMPK activators. At the end of the treatment period, HuR was detected by immunofluorescence as previously described (11Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The nuclei were visualized using Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). The signals were detected using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss; 63× lens) using separate channels for the analysis of phase contrast images, red fluorescence (HuR), and blue fluorescence (Hoechst). Representative photographs from three independent experiments are shown.RESULTSTreatment with AMPK Activators Causes Growth Arrest and Decreased Expression of Proliferative Genes in Human IDH4 Fibroblasts—In the IDH4 human fibroblast cell model developed by Shay and co-workers (31Wright W.E. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), constitutive, Dex-driven SV40 large T antigen expression allows IDH4 cells to suppress senescence and to continue to proliferate as young cells. Treatment of proliferating IDH4 cells with the AMPK activators AICAR, antimycin A, and sodium azide caused up-regulation of AMPK activity (Fig. 1A), cessation of cell growth (Fig. 1B), and a marked reduction in the expression levels of proliferative proteins such as cyclin A and cyclin B1 (Fig. 1C). These reductions in protein abundance were further assessed by monitoring mRNA levels. As seen in Fig. 2A, treatment with either AICAR, antimycin A, or sodium azide led to a corresponding reduction in the levels of mRNAs encoding cyclin A and cyclin B1. Given our earlier findings that cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNA turnover changed according to the proliferative status of the cell (35Wang W. Lin S. Caldwell M.C. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether such gene expression differences were influenced by changes in the stability of the corresponding mRNAs. We used an actinomycin d-based approach to assess the relative mRNA half-lives following treatment with AMPK activators. As shown in Fig. 2B, IDH4 cells showed significant differences in the half-lives of mRNAs encoding cyclin A and cyclin B1. For these mRNAs, treatment with actinomycin D resulted in faster transcript loss in the populations treated with AMPK activators, revealing that their stability was lowered by the treatments. Such differences in mRNA stability were specifically seen for cyclin A mRNA and cyclin B1 mRNA, because the stability of other mRNAs studied, such as that encoding β-actin, was unchanged (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect of AMPK activators on the expression and half-life of mRNAs encoding cyclin A and cyclin B1. A, Northern blot analysis to assess the abundance of mRNAs encoding cyclin B1, cyclin A, and β-actin in IDH4 cells following treatment with 2 mm AICAR, 5 μm antimycin A, or 2 mm sodium azide for 5 h. B, stabilities of mRNAs encoding cyclin A, cyclin B1, and β-actin in IDH4 cells that were cultured in the presence of AMPK activators as indicated for A. Half-lives were assessed after adding 2 μg/ml actinomycin D during the continuous presence of the AMPK activators, preparing RNA at the times indicated, measuring cyclin A, cyclin B1, and β-actin Northern blot signals, normalizing them to 18 S rRNA, and plotting them on a logarithmic scale. Dashed horizontal lines, 50% of untreated. The data represent the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Treatment of IDH4 Cells with AMPK Activators Reduces Cytoplasmic HuR Levels and Decreases Binding of HuR to Cyclin A, Cyclin B1, and c-Fos 3′-UTRs—Cyclin A and cyclin B1 are encoded by mRNAs that are targets of HuR binding in proliferating cells (35Wang W. Lin S. Caldwell M.C. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). To assess whether the AMPK-triggered reduction in expression of cyclin A and cyclin B1 might be linked to the ability of HuR to bind to the 3′-UTRs of these transcripts, REMSA were carried out. IDH4 cells were either left untreated or treated with AMPK activators, whereupon cytoplasmic lysates were prepared and incubated with radiolabeled RNAs encompassing the 3′-UTRs of the cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNAs, as described (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). REMSA was also carried out using transcripts corresponding to the 3′-UTR of c-Fos, a proliferative gene whose mRNA was previously reported to be a target of HuR (30Wang W. Yang X. Cristofalo V.J. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5889-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the proteins present in cytoplasmic lysates prepared from untreated IDH4 cells revealed much more extensive binding to radiolabeled transcripts than did proteins present in cytoplasmic lysates from IDH4 cells treated with AMPK activators. Evidence that HuR was part of the REMSA complexes and that HuR abundance was indeed greater in the untreated populations was revealed through use of an anti-HuR antibody to supershift the protein-RNA associations. HuR-containing supershifted complexes (Fig. 3, arrowheads) were most abundant when lysates from untreated populations were used and were markedly reduced following treatment with AMPK activators. The specificity of the assay was tested using antibodies directed to control proteins (such as p38MAPK, which lacks RNA binding ability), which did not produce supershifts (Fig. 3). For each transcript and treatment group tested, nuclear lysates were assayed similarly and revealed no change in binding patterns or signal intensities after treatment with AMPK activators (not shown), in agreement with earlier findings (11Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Additional control REMSAs using non-HuR target transcripts such as those corresponding to each coding region (previously shown (35Wang W. Lin S. Caldwell M.C. Furneaux H. Gorospe M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2340-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and therefore not shown here) and that encompassing the cyclin E 3′-UTR (Fig. 3) served to further assess the specificity of these associations. Taken together, the reduced association of HuR with cyclin A and B1 3′-UTR transcripts under conditions that cause destablization of the encoded mRNAs is in keeping with the reported ability of HuR to stabilize and enhance the expression of such proliferative genes"
https://openalex.org/W2129312022,"Transcription elongation is responsible for rapid synthesis of RNA chains of thousands of nucleotides in vivo. In contrast, a single round of transcription performed in vitro is frequently interrupted by pauses and arrests that drastically reduce the elongation rate and the yield of the full-length transcript. Here we demonstrate that most transcriptional delays disappear if more than one RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecule initiates from the same promoter. Anti-arrest and anti-pause effects of trailing RNAP are due to forward translocation of leading (backtracked) complexes. Such cooperation between RNAP molecules links the rate of elongation to the rate of initiation and explains why elongation is still fast and processive in vivo even without anti-arrest factors."
https://openalex.org/W2075645766,"We have identified two new human genes that encode proteins with tandem pleckstrin homology-phosphotyrosine binding (PH-PTB) domains at their amino termini. Because the other known PH-PTB proteins (insulin receptor substrates: IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4, and the downstream of kinases: DOK-1, DOK-2, and DOK-3) are substrates of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptors, we asked whether these new proteins, termed IRS5/DOK4 and IRS6/DOK5, might also have roles in insulin and IGF-1 signaling. Northern analyses indicate that IRS5/DOK4 is ubiquitously expressed but most abundant in kidney and liver. IRS6/DOK5 expression is highest in skeletal muscle. Both proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to insulin and IGF-1 in transfected cells, although the kinetics differ. Insulin receptor-phosphorylated IRS5/DOK4 associates with RasGAP, Crk, Src, and Fyn, but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85, Grb2, SHP-2, Nck, or phospholipase Cγ Src homology 2 domains, and activates MAPK in cells. IRS6/DOK5 neither associates with these Src homology 2 domains nor activates MAPK. IRS5/DOK4 and IRS6/DOK5 represent two new signaling proteins with potential roles in insulin and IGF-1 action."

https://openalex.org/W2024630506,"The ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) family has recently generated much interest in the scientific community, as it is implicated to play important regulatory roles via novel protein-protein modification. FAT10 (diubiquitin) belongs to this family of proteins, comprising two ubiquitin-like moieties fused in tandem, and has been implicated to be involved in the maintenance of spindle integrity during mitosis. As FAT10 may play a role in the regulation of genomic stability, we examined if there is an association between FAT10 expression and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or other cancers. Northern blot analyses revealed upregulation of FAT10 expression in the tumors of 90% of HCC patients. In situ hybridization as well as immunohistochemistry utilizing anti-FAT10 antibodies localized highest FAT10 expression in the nucleus of HCC hepatocytes rather than the surrounding immune and non-HCC cells. FAT10 expression was also found to be highly upregulated in other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and female reproductive system. In conclusion, we demonstrated upregulation of FAT10 expression in various gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers. Its overexpression is unrelated to the general increase in protein synthesis or a general immune/inflammatory response to cancer. Rather, FAT10 may modulate tumorigenesis through its reported interaction with the MAD2 spindle-assembly checkpoint protein."

In the present study, treatment of chondrocytes with the 110-kDa FN-f or an activating antibody to the α5β1 integrin was found to increase tyrosine autophosphorylation (Tyr-402) of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (PYK2) without significant change in autophosphorylation (Tyr-397) of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A9, shown previously to block a PYK2-dependent pathway, blocked the FN-f-stimulated increase in MMP-13, whereas tyrphostin A25 did not.

Because of their potent ability to degrade the extracellular matrix and the undesirable consequences of excess matrix degradation, the production and activation of MMPs must be tightly regulated. In articular cartilage, excess production of MMPs results in destruction of the cartilage matrix (2Dean D.D. Martel-Pelletier J. Pelletier J.P. Howell D.S. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Clin.

A better understanding of the cellular mechanisms responsible for regulating MMP expression could lead to the development of novel therapies aimed at controlling excess matrix degradation. Signals generated from the extracellular matrix and mediated through the integrin family of matrix receptors can regulate MMP expression. Treatment of cultured synovial fibroblasts with the 120-kDa fibronectin fragment (FN-f), which binds the α5β1 integrin, or with antibodies to the α5β1 integrin was shown to stimulate expression of collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin (MMP-3) (7Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Google Scholar). Similar FN-fs have been identified in arthritic cartilage and synovial fluid (8Xie D.L. Meyers R. Homandberg G.A. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1448-1452Google Scholar, 9Homandberg G.A. Wen C. Hui F. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 1998; 6: 231-244Google Scholar) and have been found to stimulate chondrocyte-mediated cartilage matrix degradation (10Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Google Scholar, 11Homandberg G.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D713-D730Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the 120-kDa FN-f stimulated human articular chondrocytes to express high levels of MMP-13 (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). The increase in MMP-13 was accompanied by an increase in expression of IL-1β, although IL-1β was not required for the initial FN-f stimulation of MMP-13 expression. These studies suggest that FN-f stimulation of integrin signaling could play an important role in mediating cartilage matrix degradation through stimulation of MMP and cytokine production. The intracellular signaling pathways responsible for regulating MMP expression are incompletely understood. Integrinmediated signals that stimulated MMP-1 expression by synovial fibroblasts required Rac activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species (13Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Google Scholar). MAP kinase activation has been linked to MMP-13 expression in response to IL-1β in chondrocytes (14Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Google Scholar) and in response to fibroblast culture in collagen gels (15Ravanti L. Heino J. Lopez-Otin C. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Google Scholar). Both the N-terminal 29-kDa FN-f (16Gemba T. Valbracht J. Alsalameh S. Lotz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 907-911Google Scholar) and the 120-kDa FN-f (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar) were found to stimulate chondrocyte MAP kinase phosphorylation, and inhibition of either MEK, JNK, or p38 inhibited the FN-f-stimulated MMP-13 production (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). Importantly, the upstream signals that mediate MAP kinase activation and subsequent MMP-13 expression have not been identified. Depending on the cell type and the stimulus, both focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the closely related proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (PYK2) have been shown to mediate signals from integrins that can lead to MAP kinase activation (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Google Scholar, 18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

PYK2 was identified as a calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (20Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar) and has also been called RAFTK (22Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Google Scholar) or CAKβ (23Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Google Scholar). Although a role for FAK has been demonstrated for MMP secretion in response to concanavalin A (24Sein T.T. Thant A.A. Hiraiwa Y. Amin A.R. Sohara Y. Liu Y. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Hamaguchi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5539-5542Google Scholar) and hyaluronan (25Zhang Y. Thant A.A. Hiraiwa Y. Naito Y. Sein T.T. Sohara Y. Matsuda S. Hamaguchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1123-1127Google Scholar), to our knowledge the possibility that activation of either FAK or PYK2 might be required for integrin signaling which regulates MMP expression has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to determine whether activation of FAK and/or PYK2 was required for the stimulation of chondrocyte MMP-13 expression in response to treatment with FN-f. Because PYK2 can be activated by increases in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar, 20Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar), inhibitors or activators of these pathways were tested. Experiments were performed using primary human articular chondrocytes and, for transfection experiments, an immortalized human chondrocyte cell line C-28I2. We have shown previously that C-28I2 cells demonstrate chondrocyte phenotypic features including expression of type II collagen and expression of the α5β1 integrin at levels similar to primary chondrocytes (26Loeser R.F. Sadiev S. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2000; 8: 96-105Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate a role for PYK2 in mediating FN-f-induced signals that stimulate MMP-13 expression. Both increases in intracellular calcium and activation of PKC are required. Reagents and Plasmids—The α5β1 integrin activating antibody (JBS5) and the 120-kDa fibronectin fragment were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-phospho-PYK2 (Tyr-402) was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The 110-kDa fibronectin fragment, anti-phospho-FAK-(Tyr-397), and anti-FAK were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-PYK2(CADTK) was a gift from Dr. Shelley Earp (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). The PKC antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The MEK inhibitor PD98059, PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) and rottlerin, tyrphostins A9 (AG 17) and A25 (AG 82), and calcium inhibitors nifedipine and BAPTA-AM were purchased from Calbiochem. The p38 inhibitor SB203580 was purchased from Sigma, and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was a gift from Signal Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). IL-1β was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Sheep polyclonal MMP-13 antibody L2916 was generously provided by Dr. Gillian Murphy (Norwich, UK). The PYK2 expression plasmids (wild type and dominant negative mutants Y402F and K457A) used in transient transfection experiments were provided by Drs. Archana Sanjay and Roland Baron (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The cDNAs encoding wild type and the same dominant negative mutant forms of PYK2 used for construction of replication-defective adenoviruses (described below) were kindly provided by Dr. Tom Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville). The dominant negative FAK construct FRNK was provided by Dr. Michael Schaller (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill); the ERK1(K71R), ERK2(K52R), and JNK(K-R) dominant negative constructs were provided by Dr. Shu Chien (University of California San Diego, La Jolla), and the p38 dominant negative (pcDNA3-dn-p38) was provided by Dr. Francis Berenbaum (Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France). Adenoviral Constructs—cDNAs encoding wild type and dominant negative mutants of PYK2 were subcloned in-frame into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The GFP-PYK2 inserts were then sequentially subcloned into pShuttle-CMV plasmid and then pAdeno-X™ viral DNA (Clontech) for the preparation of replication-defective adenoviruses. Linearized pAdeno-X+GFP-PYK2 sequences were introduced into HEK293 cells using a liposome-based transient transfection procedure (SuperFect, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Resulting wild type and mutant GFP-PYK2 adenoviruses were amplified from cell extracts and purified by double CsCl gradient centrifugation. The multiplicity of viral infection was determined by viral dilution assay in HEK293 cells grown in 96-well clusters. An adenovirus expressing GFP alone (Adv-GFP) was used to control for nonspecific effects of adenoviral infection. Chondrocyte Culture—Normal human ankle cartilage was obtained from tissue donors through a joint agreement between Rush Medical College and the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Network under a protocol approved by the Rush University institutional review board. Each donor specimen was graded for gross degenerative changes based on a modified version of the 5-point scale of Collins (see Ref. 27Muehleman C. Bareither D. Huch K. Cole A.A. Kuettner K.E. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 1997; 5: 23-37Google Scholar). Samples used for this study were grade 0 or 1. Chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion using Pronase followed by overnight digestion with collagenase-P as described previously (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). Isolated cells were resuspended in media at 1 × 106 cells per ml and added to 60-mm plates (6 ml/plate) or 6-well plates at 2 ml/well. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (complete media) for 5–7 days before use. Immortalized human chondrocytes (C-28I2 cells), described in detail previously (26Loeser R.F. Sadiev S. Tan L. Goldring M.B. Osteoarthr. Cartil. 2000; 8: 96-105Google Scholar), were also cultured in complete media. Chondrocyte Stimulation and Immunoblotting—Media were changed to serum-free DMEM/F-12 with antibiotics 18 h (overnight) and again 2 h before each experiment. For inhibitor studies, cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 30 min before stimulation. Although preliminary studies were performed with a 120-kDa FN-f, similar results were noted using the 110-kDa FN-f which was used in the experiments reported here because of greater availability. FN-f or α5β1 integrin activating antibody were added directly to the culture media for the indicated periods. In a previous study (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar), non-activating integrin antibodies and intact fibronectin were tested as controls and found not to stimulate MAP kinase activation or MMP-13 expression in this system and so were not repeated here. Experiments were terminated with removal of media and cell lysate preparation. The conditioned media was aliquoted and stored at –70 or 4 °C with 0.1% NaN3. Cell lysates were prepared using modified cell lysis RIPA buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). For PYK2 and FAK immunoblotting experiments, 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate was included as an additional protease inhibitor. Cold RIPA buffer was added to cells; dishes were scraped, and lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The soluble lysate protein concentration was determined with BCA reagent (Pierce). Lysate samples containing equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Conditioned media were concentrated (10:1) and analyzed by immunoblotting for MMP-13 as described (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). All immunoblotting experiments were repeated at least three times. Densitometric scanning of blots was analyzed using 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). PKC Analysis—Cytosolic and particulate membrane fractions were isolated from cells stimulated with FN-f in order to determine translocation of specific PKC isoforms as a measure of PKC activation. After stimulation, cells were washed once for 3 min with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Cells were scraped and briefly sonicated in a small volume of a hypotonic lysis buffer (1 ml of buffer/1 × 107 cells) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 14 μm E-64, 130 μm bestatin, 1 mm leupeptin, and 0.3 μm aprotinin. Cell extracts were then gently placed on top of a 15% sucrose cushion (4 ml) and centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 45 min. The clear supernatant at the top of the sucrose was collected and used as the cytosolic fraction. After careful removal of the remaining sucrose, the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was solubilized with brief sonication in the above lysis buffer (0.5 ml buffer/pellet) with the addition of 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 (final concentration). This lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. The clear supernatant was collected and used as the particulate membrane fraction. Total protein was measured, and the samples were processed for immunoblotting as described above. Transfection Studies—MMP-13 (SacI/BglII) and MMP-1 (XhoI/HindIII) promoter regions, kindly provided by Drs. Yubo Sun and Herman Cheung (University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL), were subcloned into a firefly luciferase promoterless vector, pGL2-Enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI), generating –1600MMP-13, –736MMP-13, –370MMP-13, –186MMP-13, and –562MMP-1 promoter luciferase reporter constructs. Details of these constructs including their promoter sites are reported elsewhere. 2H.-J. Im, C. Pacione, S. Chubinskya, A. J. van Wijnen, Y. Sun, and R. F. Loeser, submitted for publication. For transient transfection studies, immortalized human chondrocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h in complete media. The cells were then transfected with 2 μg of the specific promoter-reporter constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. The promoterless vector, pGL2-Enhancer, was used as a control, and a Renilla luciferase construct was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency. For co-transfection of dominant negative constructs, 500 ng of the dominant negative construct was used except for the PYK2 constructs that were used at 150 ng. For controls, the same amount of empty vector, pcDNA3.1 Zeo(–) (Invitrogen), was co-transfected in place of the dominant negative plasmid constructs. The cells were incubated for 24 h in complete media after transfection and then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and changed to serum-free conditions for 20–24 h prior to stimulation. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h, and then cell lysates were prepared. Luciferase activity was assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). All transfection experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. For adenovirus infection, primary human chondrocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h in complete media. The cells were then infected with a replicationdefective adenovirus encoding PYK2 wild type and the PYK2 dominant negative constructs kinase dead-PYK2 and Y402F-PYK2 at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Four hours after the transduction, the cells were fed with complete media and incubated for 10 h at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. The cells were then changed to serum-free conditions and incubated for 18 h prior to removal of the media for MMP-13 analysis and preparation of cell lysates for PYK2 immunoblotting as described above. The 110-kDa Fibronectin Fragment and Antibodies to the α5β1Integrin Stimulate PYK2 Phosphorylation—In a previous study we found that treatment of chondrocytes with FN-f stimulated expression of MMP-13 which was associated with MAP kinase activation (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). Integrin signals upstream of MAP kinases can include FAK and/or PYK2 (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Google Scholar, 18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J.

When human articular chondrocytes in primary monolayer culture were treated with the 110-kDa FN-f, a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of PYK2 at the autophosphorylation site (Tyr-402) was noted (Fig. 1, A and C). Phosphorylation returned to base line by 24 h (not shown). A similar increase in PYK2 phosphorylation was seen when chondrocytes were treated with an α5β1 integrin antibody (Fig. 1B). In contrast, there was a constitutive level of FAK phosphorylation at the autophosphorylation site (Tyr-397) that did not appear to change after the addition of FN-f (Fig. 1, A and C) or anti-α5β1 (Fig. 1B). No effect of FN-f was noted on total PYK2 or FAK (data not shown). Activation or Inhibition of PYK2 Is Associated with Parallel Changes in Fibronectin Fragment-stimulated MMP-13 Expression—In order to determine further a role for signaling through PYK2 in the fibronectin fragment-mediated expression of MMP-13, we next tested known activators and inhibitors of PYK2 for their ability to affect MMP-13 expression. PYK2 activation has been shown in some systems to be downstream of PKC activation (18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar, 28Wu S.S. Chiu T. Rozengurt E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1432-C1444Google Scholar, 29Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Google Scholar). Consistent with a similar pathway in chondrocytes, treatment of chondrocytes with the PKC activator PMA stimulated PYK2 phosphorylation which was similar to the effects of FN-f and IL-1β (Fig. 2, A and C). As expected, both PMA and IL-1β also stimulated an increase in MMP-13 protein production (data not shown). The broad spectrum PKC inhibitor BIM at 10 μm and the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin at 4 μm both inhibited FN-f-stimulated PYK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, A and C). Likewise, both PKC inhibitors blocked FN-f-stimulated MMP-13 production (Fig. 2, B and D). In order to further confirm a role for PKC in FN-f-stimulated signaling in chondrocytes, activation of specific PKC isoforms was examined by determining translocation from the cytosol to the membrane after FN-f treatment. Whereas PKCα appeared in the membrane fraction 60 min after addition of FN-f, PKCδ appeared much earlier at 5 min (Fig. 3). There was a very low level of PKCβ expression without movement to the membrane as well as no apparent translocation of PKCϵ. These results taken together with the inhibitory effect of rottlerin suggest that PKCδ is part of the initial signal that activates PYK2 and subsequent MMP-13 expression, whereas activation of PKCα could be part of an autocrine loop acting further downstream from PYK2. PYK2 has been shown to be activated by increases in intracellular calcium (18Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar, 20Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). Treatment with BAPTA-AM to reduce intracellular calcium levels inhibited FN-f-induced PYK2 phosphorylation and likewise inhibited the FN-f-stimulated increase in MMP-13 (Fig. 4). A more modest inhibition of the FN-f stimulation of PYK2 phosphorylation and MMP-13 production was noted when the cells were pretreated with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine suggesting that much of the calcium-dependent activation of PYK2 in this system was from intracellular calcium stores. In a study of tumor necrosis factor-α-stimulated neutrophils, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin A9 (AG-17) was the most selective of 51 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in blocking the PYK2 signaling pathway (30Fuortes M. Melchior M. Han H. Lyon G.J. Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 327-335Google Scholar). When tested with FN-f-stimulated chondrocytes, tyrphostin A9 dose-dependently inhibited MMP-13 production (Fig. 5A). In contrast, tyrphostin A25 (AG-82), which has been shown in some cell types to inhibit FAK activity (31Tsuda T. Kusui T. Jensen R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16328-16337Google Scholar), had no affect on FN-fstimulated MMP-13 (Fig. 5B). Because these results and the results of our previous study (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar) suggested a link between PKC and PYK2 activation, activation of one or more of the MAP kinases, and increased MMP-13 expression, we determined whether inhibition with rottlerin or tyrphostin A9 affected MAP kinase activation. Treatment of chondrocytes with FN-f resulted in phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK as we had reported previously (12Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Google Scholar). Pretreatment with rottlerin or tyrphostan A9 but not tyrphostan A25 inhibited the FN-f stimulation of JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 6). The FN-fstimulated phospho-p54(JNK2) band was not visible in samples from cells pretreated with rottlerin or tyrphostan A9, and the lower phospho-JNK1 and -JNK3 bands were reduced by about 65%. Inhibition of ERK or p38 phosphorylation was not observed.Fig. 6Inhibition of fibronectin fragment induced JNK phosphorylation by tyrphostin A9 (AG-17) and rottlerin. Human articular chondrocytes were pretreated for 30 min with the indicated inhibitors: 4 μm rottlerin, 10 μm tyrphostin A9 (AG-17), or 10 μm tyrphostin A25 (AG-82). The cells were then treated with 1 μm FN-f or control media without FN-f or inhibitors for 30 min at which time cell lysates were prepared. Chondrocyte lysates were immunoblotted with phosphospecific (phospho-) and non-phosphospecific (total) antibodies to JNK, p38, and ERK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Adenoviral Overexpression of PYK2 Stimulates Chondrocyte MMP-13 Production—In order to provide additional evidence for PYK2 in the stimulation of MMP-13 expression by chondrocytes, primary chondrocytes were treated with adenoviruses expres"
https://openalex.org/W2047841749,"Grx5 is a yeast mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur biogenesis that belongs to a recently described family of monothiolic glutaredoxin-like proteins. No member of this family has been biochemically characterized previously. Grx5 contains a conserved cysteine residue (Cys-60) and a non-conserved one (Cys-117). In this work, we have purified wild type and mutant C60S and C117S proteins and characterized their biochemical properties. A redox potential of –175 mV was calculated for wild type Grx5. The pK a values obtained by titration of mutant proteins with iodoacetamide at different pHs were 5.0 for Cys-60 and 8.2 for Cys-117. When Grx5 was incubated with glutathione disulfide, a transient mixed disulfide was formed between glutathione and the cystein 60 of the protein because of its low pK a. Binding of glutathione to Cys-60 promoted a decrease in the Cys-117 pK a value that triggered the formation of a disulfide bond between both cysteine residues of the protein, indicating that Cys-117 plays an essential role in the catalytic mechanism of Grx5. The disulfide bond in Grx5 could be reduced by GSH but at a rate at least 20 times slower than that observed for the reduction of glutaredoxin 1 from E. coli, a dithiolic glutaredoxin. This slow reduction rate could suggest that GSH may not be the physiologic reducing agent of Grx5. The fact that wild type Grx5 efficiently reduced a glutathiolated protein used as a substrate indicated that Grx5 may act as a thiol reductase inside the mitochondria.

Glutaredoxins (Grx) 1The abbreviations used are: Grx, glutaredoxin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid; HED, β-hydroxyethyl disulfide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; HPLC, High performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. are small proteins with thiol reductase activity that are required for maintaining protein cysteines in reduced form. In contrast to thioredoxins, glutaredoxins require the reduced form of glutathione, GSH, as the electron donor (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Herrero E. Ros J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previously characterized glutaredoxins contain an active site that includes two conserved cysteine residues with two non-conserved residues between them (4Nikkola M. Gleason F.K. Saarinen M. Joelson T. Bjornberg O. Eklund H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16105-16112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yang Y.F. Wells W.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mutagenic studies have shown that both residues are required for reducing protein disulfides. However, only the amino-terminal cysteine may be essential for the reduction of mixed disulfides of proteins with glutathione (6Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 7Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five different glutaredoxins have been described. Two of them (Grx1/2) are classic dithiolic glutaredoxins containing both conserved cysteine residues and have already been biochemically characterized (9Gan Z.R. Sardana M.K. Jacobs J.W. Polokoff M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol.

J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence analysis, a new family of monothiolic glutaredoxins has been described recently. These proteins are highly homologous to glutaredoxins but contain only one cysteine residue in its putative active site (12Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Members of this family are found elsewhere, from bacteria to mammals, including human (13Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. De La Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37590-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To date, none of them has been biochemically characterized properly. Three monothiolic glutaredoxins are found in yeast (Grx3/4/5). No clear phenotypes have been described in yeast cells lacking Grx3 and Grx4 and, consistent with this, no specific role has been assigned to any of these proteins. In contrast, the absence of Grx5 induces severe growth defects (12Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Grx5 are not able to grow on minimal medium or in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources; they accumulate iron in the mitochondria and show decreased activities of iron-sulfur-containing enzymes. These characteristics are common to other genes involved in the synthesis and assembly of Fe-S clusters such as SSQ1, JAC1, ATM1, NFU, YAH1, ARH1, ISU1–2 (14Lill R. Kispal G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 352-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), ISA1–2 (15Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), NFS1, YFH1 (16Chen O.S. Hemenway S. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that Grx5 is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur biogenesis (18Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional model of Grx5 was recently presented based on the known structure of several dithiolic glutaredoxins (13Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. De La Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37590-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Grx5 shows a classic thioredoxin fold structure, with the putative catalytic cysteine (Cys-60) lying opposite to another conserved motif that could be involved in the formation of a glutathione cleft. Beside this motif, another non-conserved cysteine is found (Cys-117). Site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that this cysteine is not essential for the biological activity of the protein (13Belli G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. De La Torre M.A. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37590-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, there is no evidence that Grx5 works as a thiol reductase. Also, the specific role of Grx5 in iron-sulfur biogenesis is still not clear. Shenton et al. (19Shenton D. Perrone G. Quinn K.A. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16853-16859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that, in cells lacking Grx5, the cytosolic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase was glutathiolated, and they suggested that Grx5 could work as a deglutathiolase. However the recent finding that Grx5 is a mitochondrial enzyme (18Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) suggests that this glutathiolation may be related to the oxidative stress conditions generated by iron accumulation in Δgrx5 cells rather than to the direct effect of Grx5, a mitochondrial protein, on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, a cytosolic enzyme. In this work we address the biochemical characterization of Grx5, including determination of the cysteine pK a value and redox potential. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism of action for the Grx5 protein. This is the first characterization of a monothiolic glutaredoxin and constitutes the first evidence that these proteins can work as thioloxidoreductases. Materials—GSH, GSSG, cystine, dehydroascorbate, iodoacetamide, glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, and trifluoroacetic acid were from Sigma. Glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) from Escherichia coli was from Calbiochem, and 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) was from Aldrich. Rat carbonic anhydrase III was a kind gift of Dr. Rod Levine (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Strains and Plasmids—Plasmid pMM192 contains the GRX5 open reading frame without the region coding from amino acids 2–29 (PCR-amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA), cloned between the NdeI and BamH I unique sites of the E. coli expression vector pET-21a (Novagen). Point mutations in GRX5 that yielded the different amino acid replacements were constructed by the ExSite method (20Weiner M.P. Costa L. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 613-621Google Scholar), using pMMM192 as template. Oligonucleotides for the introduction of the point mutations were designated in such a way that a restriction site that did not alter the translation product was introduced near to the desired point mutation and used as a marker for the DNA sequencing. Plasmids were maintained and amplified in E. coli BL21 cells (Novagen). Purification of Grx5 Wild Type and Mutant Proteins—E. coli cells carrying the previously described plasmids coding for Grx5 wild type and mutant proteins were grown at 30 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the A 600 reached a value of 0.4, expression of Grx5 was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside. After 4 h of growth, the cells were centrifuged, washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Purification of the enzyme was made at 4 °C. The cells (3 g) were suspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and sonicated. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant solution (5 ml, 35 mg of protein/ml) was applied on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus 100 mm NaCl. After void volume, 4-ml fractions were analyzed for the presence of Grx5 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing Grx5 were pooled and applied to a DEAE-15HR column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. After a washing step of 20 min with the same buffer, elution was carried out by a linear gradient from 100 to 500 mm NaCl over 40 min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Grx5 eluted at 300 mm NaCl. Salt was diluted 30 times by several steps of concentration/dilution of the protein using an Amicon 8010 ultrafiltration cell. Protein was stored at –80 °C at concentrations above 20 mg/ml. Protein was 99% pure as examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analyses—Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Titration of free sulfhydryl groups with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) was performed as described (22Cabiscol E. Aguilar J. Ros J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6592-6597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20–50 μg of protein were incubated for 10 min in a solution containing 200 μm DTNB in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 0.1 ml. A molar extinction coefficient of 14,150 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the number of titrated sulfhydryl groups. Activities—Reduction of the mixed disulfide formed between HED and glutathione (low molecular weight mixed disulfide reduction assay or HED assay) was assayed as described in Ref. 2Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar. Dehydroascorbate reductase activity and glutathione peroxidase activities were performed according to Refs. 23Collinson E.J. Wheeler G.L. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. Determination of Thiol pK a Value—The rate of carboxymethylation of Grx5 was determined by incubation of reduced Grx5 (25 μm), either wild type or mutant proteins, with 0.6 mm iodoacetamide in 23 μl of 10 mm Tris, 10 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm MES, and 0.2 m KCl at pH values between 3 and 10. At desired incubation times, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol. Reduced and carboxymethylated Grx5 proteins were separated by HPLC in a DeltaPak HPI C18 column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 40 to 50% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Proteins were detected and quantified from their corresponding peak areas at 276 nm. Reaction of Grx5 with GSSG—Preparations (23 μl) containing 25 μm of either wild type or mutant proteins in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer were incubated with different concentrations of GSSG at 20 °Cin sealed tubes under nitrogen. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The pH dependence of the rate of glutathiolation was assayed under the same conditions, except that GSSG was always present at 250 μm, and Tris-HCl buffer was replaced by a mixture containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MOPS, 10 mm MES, and 0.2 m KCl at pH values between 3 and 10. Reaction products were separated and quantified by HPLC as described above. Preparation of Oxidized Proteins—The fully oxidized form of WTGrx5 (disulfide bond) was prepared by incubation of 1 mg of reduced protein (150 μm concentration) with 0.5 mm GSSG for 30 min at 20 °C in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Excess glutathione was removed by size exclusion chromatography using a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentration of the protein using a Centricon 10K (Amicon). After this treatment, HPLC analysis showed that 95% of the protein was in the oxidized form (disulfide bond, see “Results”), and the remaining 5% was in the reduced form. WT-Grx5 glutathiolated at Cys-60 was obtained after incubation of 30 μg of reduced protein (90 μm concentration) with 1 mm GSSG at pH 5.0. This preparation was separated by HPLC, and the peak corresponding to protein glutathiolated at Cys-60 (see “Results”) was collected and dried in a Speed Vac. Molecular Weight Determination of Modified Forms of Grx5—Peaks obtained by incubation of Grx5 with GSSG were separated by HPLC as described above, collected, dried in a Speed Vac, and solubilized in 20 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteins were mixed 1:1 with matrix solution (saturated 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A 0.7-μl aliquot of this mixture was deposited onto a stainless steel MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Samples were measured on a Bruker Reflex IV MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUT source in positive ion linear mode using delayed extraction (200 ns). A nitrogen laser (337 nm) was employed for desorption/ionization, and the ion acceleration voltage was 20 kV. The equipment was externally calibrated employing protonated mass signals from horse cytochrome c. Determination of the Redox Potential—The redox potential of Grx5 was determined by direct protein-protein redox equilibration (25Aslund F. Berndt K.D. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30780-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of a preparation containing 50 μm reduced S. cerevisiae Grx5 and 50 μm oxidized E. coli Grx1 (and vice versa) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, plus 1 mm EDTA were incubated in small plastic tubes attached to a manifold and purged with a constant flux of moist nitrogen. At different times, 23 μl of the preparation were removed through the septum of the tubes using a degassed 25-μl Hamilton gas-tight syringe and mixed with 2 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Protein mixtures were analyzed by HPLC as described above, except that a linear gradient of 30–50% acetonitrile was used. Expression and Purification of Grx5 Proteins—In a previous work we had shown that Grx5 isolated from yeast cells was a processed form lacking the first 29 amino acids cleaved during import of the protein into mitochondria (18Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To obtain enzymes resembling as much as possible the mature form of Grx5, all proteins used in this study were prepared without their mitochondrial targeting signals. It should be noted, however, that for a better comprehension and comparison with previous articles, original sequence number positions have been maintained throughout the text. The wild type and mutant Grx5 proteins were overexpressed in E. coli cells and purified by a two-step method that includes size exclusion and ionic exchange chromatography. The resulting proteins were >99% pure and showed an apparent molecular mass of 15.5 kDa. The same size was determined for the mature form present in yeast extracts detected by Western blot (18Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Belli G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The theoretical mass of the protein (13,478 Da) was used for the determination of the molar concentration of the proteins. After purification, proteins were obtained in reduced form, as indicated by cysteine titration with DTNB (Table I).Table IBiochemical characterization of Grx5 proteinsProteinFree cysteinesaNumber of free cysteine residues after purification, determined with DTNB.pK a value50% oxidationbGSSG concentration producing oxidation of half of the protein after incubation with Grx5 for 30 minutes at 20°C at pH 8.0.Redox potentialcRedox potential determined by direct equilibria with Grx1 from E. coli.Cys-60Cys-117mMWT2.20.098-175 ± 3 mVC60S1.18.2 ± 0.11.34C117S1.25.0 ± 0.10.206a Number of free cysteine residues after purification, determined with DTNB.b GSSG concentration producing oxidation of half of the protein after incubation with Grx5 for 30 minutes at 20°C at pH 8.0.c Redox potential determined by direct equilibria with Grx1 from E. coli. Open table in a new tab Grx5 Is Not Active in the HED Assay—Several reactions can be catalyzed by dithiolic glutaredoxins. The most widely used form to asses glutaredoxin activity is the glutathione:HED transhydrogenase assay. In this assay, glutaredoxin catalyzes the reduction of a mixed disulfide between glutathione and HED (2Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Dithiolic glutaredoxins lacking one of the two conserved cysteines are still capable of catalyzing this reaction (6Bushweller J.H. Aslund F. Wuthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin activity of WT Grx5, C117S Grx5, and C60S Grx5 was assayed with the HED assay. No activity could be detected even when a wide range of pH values (7–9.5) and GSH concentrations (0.6–40 mm) were used. Additionally, dehydroascorbate reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities, which have been described for dithiolic glutaredoxins (23Collinson E.J. Wheeler G.L. Garrido E.O. Avery A.M. Avery S.V. Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16712-16717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Washburn M.P. Wells W.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were also tested. None of the Grx5 variants showed detectable activity in these assays. Determination of Cys-60 and Cys-117 pK a Value—Reactivity of thiol groups in proteins depends highly on its pK a value. Active cysteines from dithiolic glutaredoxins have pK a values close to 4 (9Gan Z.R. Sardana M.K. Jacobs J.W. Polokoff M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Foloppe N. Sagemark J. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nilsson L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Mieyal J.J. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Dothey C. Chung J.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6088-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine the pK a value of both cysteine residues in Grx5, we measured the rate of alkylation of Grx5 with iodoacetamide at different pHs. This reaction occurs only when cysteines are in the ionized thiolate anion state (28Reckenfelderbaumer N. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17548-17555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced WT, C117S, and C60S Grx5 proteins were incubated with 0.6 mm iodoacetamide at pH values between 3 and 11. Reaction was stopped at different times by the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol, and samples were analyzed by HPLC. The concentrations of reduced (Grx5red) and carboxymethylated glutaredoxin (Grx5cmc) were calculated from the peak area of the HPLC profile (shown in Fig. 1A). Plots of 1/[Grxred] versus time yielded straight lines, indicating that the reaction of iodoacetamide with Grx5 follows a second order reaction with a single rate constant. The second order rate constants were calculated according to Equation 1, Kapp=[Grx5cmc]/(t×[Grx5o]×[Grx5red])(Eq. 1) and plotted against pH (Fig. 1B) ([Grx0] = initial concentration of Grx5). Reaction rates showed a sigmoidal dependence on pH value at pH values of ∼5 (WT and C117S) and 8 (WT and C60S). From these data it can be deduced that the increases in reaction rates at low and high pH were respectively a consequence of the ionization of Cys-60 and Cys-117. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (28Reckenfelderbaumer N. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17548-17555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), thiol pK a values of 5.0 ± 0.1 and 8.2 ± 0.1 were calculated for Cys-60 and Cys-117, respectively (Table I). Reaction of Grx5 with GSSG—Reactivity of reduced Grx5 with GSSG was tested at pH 8.0 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, because mitochondrial pH is close to this value (30Llopis J. McCaffery J.M. Miyawaki A. Farquhar M.G. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). WT Grx5 was incubated with increasing concentrations of GSSG for 15 min at 20 °C, and the products of the reaction were separated by HPLC. Fig. 2A shows that four new peaks corresponding to oxidized forms of the protein appeared. When the mutant proteins were incubated with GSSG, only one new peak appeared (Fig. 2, B and C). The characterization of these peaks is summarized in Table II. From mass spectrometry data it can be deduced that two additional glutathione molecules were present in peak 1 compared with peak 5 (reduced form), whereas only one additional glutathione molecule was present in both peak 3 and peak 4. Peak 1 corresponded to a protein glutathiolated at both cysteines, whereas peak 2 was a protein presenting a disulfide bond between both cysteines. This was deduced from the following observations. (i) No free thiols were detected when the peak 2 protein was incubated with DTNB. (ii) Peak 2 presented a mass of 13,484 Da (as the reduced form). (iii) Peak 2 was also the major peak obtained when reduced Grx5 was incubated with several oxidants such as H2O2, cystine, or oxidized proteins. (iv) Peak 2 was the end product obtained either from peak 3 or peak 4 when these peaks were collected, dried, and solubilized at pH 8.0; and (v) reduced Grx5 (peak 5) was obtained by incubation of peak 2 with dithiothreitol. Concerning the monoglutathiolated forms of the protein, our results indicate that peak 3 corresponded to a protein glutathiolated at Cys-60, whereas peak 4 corresponded to a protein glutathiolated at Cys-117. According to the pK a values previously calculated for Cys-60 and Cys-117, the pH dependence of the appearance of peaks 3 and 4 was consistent with this assumption (Fig. 3A). This was confirmed by analyzing the rate of glutathiolation of C117S and C60S mutant proteins at different pHs (Fig. 3B).Table IIBiochemical characterization of peaks obtained after incubation of Grx5 with GSSGProteinRetention timeaRetention time in minutes.MassbMasses in daltons, as determined by mass spectrometry.Free cysteinescNumber of free thiols determined with DTNB after collecting, drying, and solubilizing the corresponding peak in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0.Redox statedRedox state of the corresponding Grx5 protein.

The rate of formation of the glutathiolated and oxidized forms of the WT protein is shown in panel A, whereas that of the glutathiolation of the C60S (•) and C117S (⋄) proteins is shown in B.

Thus, introduction of the first glutathione in the WT protein may increase the reactivity of the Cys-117. This suggested the idea that one glutathione molecule could be transferred from Cys-60 to Cys-117 in the wild type protein during the reaction, and glutathiolation of Cys-117 would be an intermediate step before formation of the disulfide bond. To test this hypothesis peak 4 was collected, dried, rehydrated with Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0, and incubated at 4 °C. Fig. 4 shows the percentage of each peak found at different incubation times as determined by HPLC analysis. It can be observed that peak 3 appeared mainly at"

Recent studies have demonstrated that Plexin-B1 activates RhoA and induces growth cone collapse through Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor PDZ-RhoGEF. Here we show that Rnd1, a member of Rho family GTPases, directly interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1. In COS-7 cells, coexpression of Rnd1 and Plexin-B1 induced cell contraction in response to semaphorin 4D (Sema4D), a ligand for Plexin-B1, whereas expression of Plexin-B1 alone or coexpression of Rnd1 and a Rnd1 interaction-defective mutant of Plexin-B1 did not. The Sema4D-induced contraction in Plexin-B1/Rnd1-expressing COS-7 cells was suppressed by dominant negative RhoA, a Rho-associated kinase inhibitor, a dominant negative form of PDZ-RhoGEF, or deletion of the carboxyl-terminal PDZ-RhoGEF-binding region of Plexin-B1, indicating that the PDZ-RhoGEF/RhoA/Rho-associated kinase pathway is involved in this morphological effect. We also found that Rnd1 promoted the interaction between Plexin-B1 and PDZ-RhoGEF and thereby dramatically potentiated the Plexin-B1-mediated RhoA activation. We propose that Rnd1 plays an important role in the regulation of Plexin-B1 signaling, leading to Rho activation during axon guidance and cell migration.

The actin cytoskeleton mediates a variety of essential cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and axon and dendrite formation, and it is already well known that Rho family small GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton in various cell types (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar). Like other GTPases of the Ras superfamily, they serve as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and once activated, they can interact with their specific effectors, leading to a variety of biological functions. Activation of the Rho family proteins requires GDP-GTP exchange catalyzed by various guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; LARG, leukemia-associated Rho GEF; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; Rho-kinase, Rho-associated kinase. whereas the activation of the GTPases is down-regulated by GTPase-activating proteins, which stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activities. In addition, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors interact with the GDP-bound form of Rho GTPases and inhibit the exchange of GDP for GTP. Presently, at least 14 mammalian Rho family proteins have been identified: Rho (A, B, and C), Rac (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, and 3Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), Cdc42, RhoD, RhoG, RhoH/TTF, TC10, and Rnd (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Among them, the functions of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been extensively characterized. In neuronal cells, activation of Rac and Cdc42 induces the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia of the growth cone, respectively, whereas activation of Rho causes the collapse of the growth cone, and recent studies have revealed their involvement in the downstream signaling pathways of several guidance molecule receptors to regulate the actin cytoskeleton during axon outgrowth and guidance (2Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Semaphorins are a large family of secreted and transmembrane molecules that play a central role in axon guidance in developing nervous system (3Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 4Kolodkin A.L. Matthes D.J. Goodman C.S.

In addition to the nervous system, they are widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues and are thought to mediate diverse processes such as cardiac and skeletal development (6Behar O. Golden J.A. Hashimoto H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1996; 383: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), tumor growth and metastasis (7Christensen C.R. Klingelhofer J. Tarabykina S. Hulgaard E.F. Kramerov D. Lukanidin E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1238-1290PubMed Google Scholar), and the immune response (8Spriggs M.K. Curr. Opin.

The function of semaphorins in the nervous system is mediated by Plexins, which can be classified into four subfamilies: Plexin-A1–4, Plexin-B1–3, Plexin-C1, and Plexin-D1 (10Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M.

Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The most characterized member of the semaphorins is semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), and a variety of molecules have been shown to be involved in the intracellular signaling pathway for the actions of Sema3A (12Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Goshima Y. Ito T. Sasaki Y. Nakamura F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although most other semaphorins appear to bind to and directly activate Plexins, Sema3A requires receptor complexes consisting of Plexin-A1/2 and neuropilins (10Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H.

Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that Plexin-B1 directly interacts with PDZ-RhoGEF/leukemia-associated Rho GEF (LARG) through its carboxyl-terminal PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-binding motif to induce RhoA activation and growth cone collapse in response to Sema4D (15Swiercz J.M.

PDZ-RhoGEF was originally identified as a Rho-specific GEF with the PDZ domain in its amino terminus that interacts with activated α subunits of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins and can link G protein-coupled receptors to RhoA activation (20Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition to RhoA activation, Plexin-B1 directly interacts with Rac in a GTP-dependent manner (21Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12457-12462Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Driessens M.H.E. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and this interaction appears to inhibit Rac-dependent actions by sequestering active GTP-bound Rac (23Hu H. Marton T.F. Goodman C.S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Vikis H.G. Li W. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, precise mechanisms by which the activity of Plexin-B1 is regulated remain unclear. Rnd GTPases, Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3 (also known as RhoE), comprise a distinct branch of Rho family GTPases in that they have a low affinity for GDP and very low intrinsic GTPase activities (25Foster R. Hu K.-Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2689-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, transient expression of Rnd1 or Rnd3 leads to loss of stress fibers, retraction and rounding of the cell body, and production of extensively branching processes (27Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.-G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and a part of these morphological effects of Rnd1 or Rnd3 is mediated by a novel Rnd GTPase-interacting protein, Socius (28Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, Rnd3 regulates cell migration speed and is involved in the alteration of the actin cytoskeleton associated with oncogenic transformation (26Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 29Hansen S.H. Zegers M.M.P. Woodrow M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Chardin P. Mostov K.E. Mcmahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9364-9375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Among Rnd GTPases, Rnd1 and Rnd2 are abundantly expressed in the nervous system (27Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.-G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawa K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and Rnd2 induces neurite branching through its novel effector Rapostlin (31Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, Rnd1 has been shown to interact with Plexin-A1 and appears to be involved in the signaling pathway of Plexin-A1 (32Rhom B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Püschel A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 33Zanata S.M. Hovatta I. Rohm B. Püschel A.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role of Rnd1 in the Plexin-mediated actions remains unknown. Here we provide evidence that Rnd1 directly interacts with the cytoplasmic region of Plexin-B1 and that this interaction potentiates RhoA activation by Plexin-B1 and induces contraction of COS-7 cells. We propose a role of Rnd1 in the Plexin-B1 signaling pathway leading to Rho activation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Plasmid Constructions and Antibodies—Plexin-A1 and Plexin-A2 cDNAs, Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B2 cDNAs, and PDZ-RhoGEF (KIAA0380) cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. H. Fujisawa (Nagoya University), Dr. L. Tamagnone (Torino University), and Dr. K. Nagata (Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute), respectively. The expression plasmid encoding a soluble form of Sema4D fused to human IgG1 Fc fragment was a generous gift from Dr. H. Kikutani (Osaka University). To generate recombinant proteins, the cytoplasmic domains of Plexin-A1 (Plexin-A1-cyt, amino acids 1296–1894) and Plexin-A2 (Plexin-A2-cyt, amino acids 1281–1884) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences), and the cytoplasmic domains of Plexin-B1 (Plexin-B1-cyt, amino acids 1543–2136) and Plexin-B2 (Plexin-B2-cyt, amino acids 1255–1841) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-1. To generate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Plexin-B1-cyt1 and Plexin-B1-cyt2, PCR-amplified fragments of Plexin-B1 (cyt1, amino acids 1724–1915; cyt2, 1916–2136) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2. Plexin-B1-GGA (L1849G,V1850G,P1851A) was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (34Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Plexin-B1-ΔC (lacking the last seven carboxyl-terminal amino acids) was generated by PCR amplification. All Plexin-B1 constructs for expression in mammalian cells included a Myc tag at the amino terminus, and were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Rnd1, Rnd2, Rnd3, Rnd1A45, RhoAN19, Rac1N17, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Rnd1 were obtained as described previously (28Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Aoki J. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rac1L61 was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF (amino acids 1–231) was obtained by PCR amplification, and the full length and the PDZ domain of PDZ-RhoGEF were subcloned into p3×FLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). Antibodies used were as follows: a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody 9E10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); a rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (MBL); a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science); a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma); a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO); and Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A rat brain cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain of the pACT2 vector (Clontech) was screened using pAS2–1/Rnd3S241 as a bait in the yeast strain Y190 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interaction between the bait and library proteins activates transcription of the reporter gene HIS3 and lacZ. From 107 transformants, 218 colonies grew on selective medium lacking histidine and were also positive for β-galactosidase activity. One of these, clone 179, was found to encode the carboxyl-terminal 438 amino acids of Plexin-B2. For the β-galactosidase filter assay, colonies of yeast transformants were transferred onto Hybond-N filter papers (Amersham Biosciences) and permeabilized in liquid nitrogen. Each filter was placed on a Whatman No. 2 filter paper that had been presoaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 37.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.33 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and was incubated at 30 °C for 8 h. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin under humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfections were carried out with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by 10 or 12.5% SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding Assays—All GST-fused proteins were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (28Katoh H. Harada A. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2952-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Nonfused Rnd1 was recovered by incubation with 10 units/ml thrombin (Sigma) for4hat4 °C, and then thrombin was removed by absorption to p-amino-benzamidine-agarose beads (Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by comparing with bovine serum albumin standards after SDS-PAGE and by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For pull-down assays, COS-7 cells (7 × 105 cells) transfected with HA-tagged Rnd GTPases were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST fusion proteins and subsequently incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. To examine direct interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Plexins and Rnd GTPases, an overlay assay was performed according to the modified method of Manser et al. (36Manser E. Leung T. Lim L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E. coli cell lysates expressing GST-fused cytoplasmic domains of Plexins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was soaked for 5 min in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride dissolved in buffer A (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 4 °C, and the buffer was diluted with an equal volume of buffer A and agitated for a further 5 min. This process was repeated four times. The membrane was then agitated for 10 min five times in buffer A; transferred to PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT; and incubated in GAP buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm DTT, and 100 μm GTP) containing [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-loaded Rnd1. After washing with wash buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton-X-100), the membrane was dried, and bound radioactivity was visualized with an FLA-3000 image analyzer (Fuji). Nonfused Rnd1 (1 μg) were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP by incubation in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2) at 30 °C for 10 min. Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells (7 × 105 cells) cotransfected with Myc-tagged Plexin-B1 and HA-tagged Rnd1 were lysed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody for 1 h and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells (2 × 104 cells) were seeded onto round 13-mm glass coverslips, and then they were transfected with expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged Plexin-B1 and GFP-Rnd1. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding. Then cells were incubated with anti-Myc antibody in PBS for 1 h, followed by the incubation with Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. For the COS-7 cell contraction assay, a soluble form of Sema4D expressed as a fusion protein with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 (9Kumanogoh A. Watanabe C. Lee I. Wang X. Shi W. Araki H. Hirata H.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 621-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) was harvested from the medium of transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Stimulation with Sema4D was performed by incubation of the cells with Sema4D-Fc-containing medium for 5 min at 37 °C. A specific inhibitor for Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) Y-27632 (10 μm; a generous gift from Welfide Corp.) was added immediately after transfection. The size of transfected cells was determined from digital images acquired at × 20 magnification by using a Leica DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and an Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). Measurement of RhoA Activity—Measurement of RhoA activity was performed as described previously (37Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi Y. Katoh H. Yasui H. Mori K. Negishi. M. J. Biol.

Briefly, COS-7 cells (7 × 105 cells) were transfected with an expression vector encoding HA-tagged wild-type RhoA together with Myc-tagged Plexin-B1 and GFP-tagged Rnd1 and were serum-starved for 16 h. Then they were stimulated with Sema4D-Fc for 5 min at 37 °C, and the cells were washed with the ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, the cells were lysed with the cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 16 μg of GST-fused Rho-binding domain of mouse Rhotekin pre-bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Rnd1 Directly Interacts with the Cytoplasmic Domain of Plexin-B1—To isolate proteins that interact with Rnd GTPases, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening with a rat brain cDNA library by using Rnd3S241, a mutant of Rnd3 lacking the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif, as a bait. Approximately 107 clones were screened, and one of the positive clones encoded the carboxyl-terminal 425 amino acids of Plexin-B2. Plexin-B2, together with Plexin-B1 and Plexin-B3, constitutes a subfamily of Plexins, transmembrane receptors for semaphorins (10Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G. Song H. Chedotal A.

This clone also interacted with Rnd1 and Rnd2 in yeast (data not shown). To examine whether the interaction between the Plexin-B family and Rnd GTPases is observed in vitro, we performed an overlay by using recombinant Rnd1 preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1A, the GST-fused cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 (GST-Plexin-B1-cyt) showed strong binding to [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rnd1 on a nitrocellulose membrane, indicating that the interaction between Rnd1 and Plexin-B1 is direct. The interaction between Rnd1 and GST-Plexin-B2-cyt was not observed in the same condition, but a very weak signal was seen after a longer exposure (data not shown). A previous study showed the interaction between Rnd1 and Plexin-A1 (32Rhom B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Püschel A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), but we failed to detect the interaction of Rnd1 with GST-Plexin-A1-cyt or GST-Plexin-A2-cyt in this assay even after a much longer exposure. Similar results were obtained by using [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rnd3 as a probe (data not shown). Therefore, we further examined the interaction between Rnd1 and Plexin-B1. By using the overlay assay, the Rnd1 binding site in the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 was shown to be located between amino acids 1724 and 1915 (Plexin-B1-cyt1; Fig. 1A). To confirm the interaction between Plexin-B1 and Rnd GTPases, HA-tagged wild-type Rnd1, Rnd2, or Rnd3 was expressed in COS-7 cells, and a pull-down assay was performed with purified GST-fused Plexin-B1-cyt1. All Rnd subfamily GTPases interacted with GST-fused Plexin-B1-cyt1, whereas Rnd1A45, a mutant of Rnd1 containing a T45A substitution in the effector domain, did not (Fig. 1B), indicating that the effector domain of Rnd1 is important for the interaction with Plexin-B1. It has been reported that Rac directly interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 and that mutation of three amino acid residues, L1849G, V1850G, and P1851A, in Plexin-B1 abolishes the interaction of Plexin-B1 with Rac (21Vikis H.G.

Therefore, we created GST-fused Plexin-B1-cyt1 containing L1849G, V1850G, and P1851A substitutions (Plexin-B1-cyt1-GGA) and performed a pull-down assay. HA-tagged Rnd1 expressed in COS-7 cells was precipitated with GST-fused Plexin-B1-cyt1 but not with GST Plexin-B1-cyt1-GGA (Fig. 1C), indicating that this mutation completely abolishes the interaction of Plexin-B1 with Rnd1. The in vitro interaction studies were performed with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1. Therefore, we next examined whether Rnd1 interacts with the full length of Plexin-B1 in vivo in the presence or the absence of Sema4D, a ligand for Plexin-B1. Myc-tagged full-length Plexin-B1 and HA-tagged Rnd1 were expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Stimulation of the cells with Sema4D was performed by the incubation with the medium from cells expressing the extracellular region of Sema4D fused with the Fc fragment of human IgG1 (9Kumanogoh A.

As shown in Fig. 2, HA-tagged Rnd1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged Plexin-B1, and this interaction was not affected by the addition of Sema4D, indicating that Rnd1 shows a constitutive, ligand-independent interaction with Plexin-B1 in vivo. On the other hand, we could not detect the interaction between Rnd1 and the full length of Plexin-B1-GGA or between Plexin-B1 and Rnd1A45 by immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 2). These results were consistent with those of in vitro binding studies. Interaction of Rnd1 with Plexin-B1 Induces COS-7 Cell Contraction in Response to Sema4D—To inve"
https://openalex.org/W2128649422,"Annexin A2 (p36) is a highly α-helical molecule that consists of two opposing sides, a convex side that contains the phospholipid-binding sites and a concave side, which faces the extracellular milieu and contains multiple ligand-binding sites. The amino-terminal region of annexin A2 extends along the concave side of the protein and contains the binding site for the S100A10 (p11) subunit. The interaction of these subunits results in the formation of the heterotetrameric form of the protein, annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer (AIIt). To simulate the orientation of AIIt on the plasma membrane we bound AIIt to a phospholipid bilayer that was immobilized on a BIAcore biosensor chip. Surface plasmon resonance was used to observe in real time the molecular interactions between phospholipid-associated AIIt or its annexin A2 subunit and the ligands, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen, and plasmin. AIIt bound t-PA (K d = 0.68 μm), plasminogen (K d = 0.11 μm), and plasmin (K d = 75 nm) with moderate affinity. Contrary to previous reports, the phospholipid-associated annexin A2 subunit failed to bind t-PA or plasminogen but bound plasmin (K d = 0.78 μm). The S100A10 subunit bound t-PA (K d = 0.45 μm), plasminogen (K d = 1.81 μm), and plasmin (K d = 0.36 μm). Removal of the carboxyl-terminal lysines from the S100A10 subunit attenuated t-PA and plasminogen binding to AIIt. These results show that the carboxyl-terminal lysines of S100A10 form t-PA and plasminogen-binding sites. In contrast, annexin A2 and S100A10 contain distinct binding sites for plasmin.

Plasminogen binds with moderate affinity and high capacity to protein and non-protein receptors via its kringle domains. These kringle domains typically interact with lysine residues of the plasminogen receptors (1Felez J. Miles L.A. Fabregas P. Jardi M. Plow E.F. Lijnen R.H. Thromb.

It is now apparent that t-PA and urokinase-type plasminogen activator utilize fundamentally different mechanisms to activate plasminogen. Although t-PA and plasminogen share common cellular binding sites, urokinase-type plasminogen activator binds to a specific receptor, uPAR (5Ellis V. J. Biol.

The annexin A2-S100A10 heterotetramer (AIIt) is a Ca2+-binding protein that is composed of two annexin A2 (p36) and two S100A10 (p11) subunits (for review, see Refs. 7Choi K.S. Fogg D.K.

Biometals. 1998; 11: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The annexin A2 subunit is a planar, curved molecule with opposing convex and concave sides. The convex side faces the biological membrane and contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites. The concave side faces the extracellular milieu and contains both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein. The carboxyl-terminal region consists of multiple ligand-binding sites including binding sites for F-actin, fibrin, and heparin. A high resolution crystal structure of the AIIt complex has not been determined. However, a low resolution structure of the complex bridging two phospholipid membranes has been determined by cryo-electron microscopy. This structure shows that the S100A10 subunits are positioned in the center, with an annexin A2 molecule on either side, in contact with the membrane surfaces. The high resolution crystal structure of the S100A10 dimer in complex with a peptide to the amino terminus of annexin A2 shows that the annexin A2-binding site consists of the amino terminus of one S100 molecule and the carboxyl terminus of the other molecule within the S100A10 dimer. Thus, it is well established that the amino terminus of annexin A2 binds to both amino- and carboxyl-terminal helices of S100A10 (12Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Sopkova-De Oliveira S.J. Gerke V.

Although originally identified as an intracellular protein, a large number of studies demonstrate the presence of both annexin A2 and S100A10 on the extracellular surface of many cells (20Yeatman T.J.

Extracellularly, the S100A10 subunit functions as the plasminogen regulatory subunit of AIIt (27Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The penultimate and ultimate carboxyl-terminal lysines of this subunit have been shown to participate in the stimulation of t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation by AIIt (28Fogg D.K. Bridges D.E.

We originally reported that AIIt stimulated t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation about 77-fold compared with about 2- or 46-fold for recombinant annexin A2 or S100A10 subunit, respectively (25Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because the S100A10 subunit possesses two lysines at its carboxyl terminus, we postulated that the carboxyl-terminal lysines of S100A10 played a key role in the stimulatory activity of AIIt (27Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To support this hypothesis we have shown that the loss of the two carboxyl-terminal lysines of S100A10 blocks the ability of AIIt to stimulate t-PA-dependent plasminogen activation (28Fogg D.K. Bridges D.E. Cheung K.T. Kassam G. Filipenko N.R. Choi K.S. Fitzpatrick S.L. Nesheim M. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4953-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the present report we have directly addressed the issue of which subunit of AIIt contains the t-PA- and plasminogen-binding site. The development of a BIAcore biosensor chip with an immobilized phospholipid bilayer has allowed analysis for the first time of the interaction of annexin A2 and AIIt, which are bound to this phospholipid bilayer with components of the plasminogen regulatory system. This methodology also has the advantage that because these interactions are studied by surface plasmon resonance, kinetic parameters are determined rapidly and in real time. Using this novel approach and the traditional method of covalent immobilization of proteins on the biosensor chip, we found that AIIt bound t-PA, plasminogen, and plasmin. Analysis of the activities of the individual subunits has shown that the annexin A2 subunit bound plasmin but not t-PA or plasminogen. In contrast, the S100A10 subunit bound t-PA, plasminogen, and plasmin. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal lysines of the S100A10 subunit formed the binding sites for t-PA and plasminogen. Materials—Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were a generous gift from Dr. K. Patel (University of Calgary). HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture collection. Gluplasminogen and plasmin were purchased from American Diagnostica. The wild-type annexin A2, wild-type S100A10, and S100A10desKK deletion mutant (lacking the last two lysine residues of the carboxyl terminus) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (28Fogg D.K. Bridges D.E. Cheung K.T. Kassam G. Filipenko N.R. Choi K.S. Fitzpatrick S.L. Nesheim M. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4953-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This recombinant annexin A2 was used in the binding experiments. AIIt and other annexins were purified from bovine lung as described in Khanna et al. (29Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-annexin A2 and anti-annexin A2 light chain antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Streptavidinagarose was purchased from Sigma. Mutant AIIt composed of wild-type annexin A2 and S100A10desKK subunits was produced as follows. Both subunits were combined with an equal molar ratio, and the resultant mutant, AIIt, was isolated by gel permeation chromatography and characterized according to Kang et al. (30Kang H.M. Kassam G. Jarvis S.E. Fitzpatrick S.L. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2041-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Studies comparing the interaction of the wild-type and mutant AIIt to heparin, phospholipid, and F-actin established that the structure of the mutant recombinant AIIt was identical to the wild-type recombinant AIIt. Recombinant yeast annexin A2 was produced in the yeast strain W303–1B with the expression vector pYeAxII, a generous gift from Dr. Jesus Ayala-Sanmartin (Unite de Biologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire de la Secretion, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France). Annexin II was subjected to limited chymotrypsin digestion as described previously (27Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE confirmed the loss of the amino-terminal region of the protein. AIIt was digested with carboxypeptidase B, and the loss of the carboxyl-terminal lysines was confirmed as previously described (28Fogg D.K. Bridges D.E. Cheung K.T. Kassam G. Filipenko N.R. Choi K.S. Fitzpatrick S.L. Nesheim M. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4953-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK 293 Cells with the Annexin A2 Gene—Human annexin A2 was obtained by PCR using primers containing unique restriction enzyme sites for NotI and BglII. The cDNA was digested, gel-purified, and cloned into a NotI- and BglII-cut retroviral vector, pLin (provided by Dr. L.-J. Chang, Powell Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). The orientation of the insert was verified by sequencing. The vector harboring annexin A2 was termed pLin-p36. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pLin and pLin-p36 by using LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) as described in Choi et al. (31Choi K.S. Fogg D.K. Yoon C.S. Waisman D.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cells were selected with 200 μg/ml G418, and clonal cell lines were screened by annexin A2 protein expression levels as assessed by Western blot analysis. Real Time Binding Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance—The BIAcore 3000 system and reagents, including sensor chips, flow buffers, the amine coupling kit, and the thiol coupling kit were obtained from BIAcore (BIAcore inc., Piscataway, NJ). The HBS-EP flow buffer consisted of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 filtered through 0.2-μm filter and degassed before use. The HBS-Ca2+ buffer used with the phospholipid surface was 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. Annexin II, t-PA, and Gluplasminogen were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips by primary amine coupling according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the chip surface was activated with a 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide solution followed by the injection of ligand at a concentration between 5 and 50 μg/ml in acetate buffer (pH 5.0). When the desired level of binding was achieved, unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride. Wild-type and mutant S100A10 were coupled to CM5 chips using the ligand thiol method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensor chip was treated with N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide solution as above followed by treatment with 80 mm pyridinyldiethaneamine. Ligand was bound to the desired level, and unreacted sites were blocked with 100 mm cysteine in 1 m NaCl. Sensorgrams (response units versus time) were recorded by the BIA-core 3000 at 25 °C with a typical flow rate of 30 μl/min and injection times between 60 and 120 s. Controls for the contribution of the change in bulk refractive index were performed in parallel with flow cells derivitized in the absence of ligand (or coated with phospholipid vesicles in the case of sensor chip L1) and subtracted from all binding sensorgrams. Regeneration conditions varied with the interactions studied: 2 mm EGTA for calcium-dependent binding, 10 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid for lysine-dependent binding, and 10 mm glycine (pH 1.5) for all other interactions. The binding of the various analytes (annexin A2, S100A10, AIIt, plasminogen, plasmin, and t-PA) was examined by multiple injections of the analyte diluted in flow buffer over a concentration range between 0.003 and 2.0 μm. Because the mechanism of interaction between t-PA, plasminogen, or plasmin with AIIt is not known, it is not possible to identify an exact binding model. For example, there are likely two binding sites for plasminogen on AIIt (composed of the carboxyl-terminal lysine of each of the two S100A10 subunits) and potentially several lysine binding kringles on plasminogen. Furthermore, plasminogen is heterogeneous and consists of two glycoforms (N-linked plasminogen-1 and O-linked plasminogen-2 glycosylation variants), with each glycoform consisting of six to eight additional isoforms varying in the sialic acid content. It is therefore impossible at this time to identify a binding model to explain these complex interactions. Consequently, we did not attempt to determine the association and dissociation rate constants. We obtained an approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) by measuring the equilibrium resonance units (R eq) at several ligand concentrations at equilibrium. Binding data were analyzed by Scatchard analysis using the BIA evaluation software according to the relationship R eq/C = K a R max – K a R eq, where R max is the resonance signal at saturation, C is the concentration of free analyte, and K a is the equilibrium association constant. Preparation of Phospholipid Surfaces on Biosensor Chips—In a 12 × 75-mm test tube, 10 μl of 20 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol (all dissolved in chloroform) were shelled by N2 gas and dried under vacuum for 2 h. The resultant residue of lipids was resuspended in 0.5 ml of HBS-Ca2+ buffer and subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by passing the resulting suspension through polycarbonate filters (100 nm pore diameter) in a LiposoFast™ Basic apparatus (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, ON). The large unilamellar vesicle solution was then injected over a BIAcore Pioneer L1 sensor chip at a flow rate of 3 μl/min for 15 min. Unbound material was removed with an injection of 50 mm NaOH. Typically, this procedure resulted in the immobilization of about 10,000–12,000 RU of phospholipid on the chip surface. Bovine serum albumin binds strongly to the dextran matrix of the L1 biosensor chip but only weakly to the phospholipid bilayer. Because we did not observe significant binding of bovine serum albumin to the biosensor chip (data not shown) we concluded that the dextran surface was completely covered by the phospholipid bilayer. Ca2+-dependent Binding of AIIt to the Phospholipid Surface Formed on the Biosensor Chip—The interactions between the hydrophobic chains of phospholipid liposomes and the lipophilic alkyl groups covalently attached to the dextran-coated surface of the L1 biosensor chip results in the fusion and immobilization of the vesicles on the surface of the L1 biosensor chip. Analysis of the structure of the immobilized phospholipid has shown that under these experimental conditions a flexible phospholipid bilayer is formed on the surface of the biosensor chip (32Saenko E. Sarafanov A. Ananyeva N. Behre E. Shima M. Schwinn H. Josic D. J. Chromatogr. A. 2001; 921: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Erb E.M. Chen X. Allen S. Roberts C.J. Tendler S.J. Davies M.C. Forsen S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Phospholipid liposomes composed of phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol were injected onto the surface of a L1 biosensor chip (Fig. 1A). Typically about 10,000–12,000 RU of phospholipid was immobilized on the biosensor chip. Because injection of 50 mm NaOH did not change the mass immobilized to the biosensor chip, it was concluded that a stable phospholipid bilayer had formed on the chip. The surface plasmon resonance signal was stable for at least 12 h and was not changed upon washing with any of the incubation buffers (data not shown). Next we examined the interaction of AIIt with the phospholipid surface. Phospholipid was immobilized on the biosensor chip, and the interaction of AIIt with the phospholipid-coated biosensor chip was measured in real time by recording the changes in surface plasmon resonance upon injection of AIIt. A typical binding curve (sensorgram) is presented in Fig. 1B. We observed that AIIt bound to the phospholipid-coated surface that was generated from liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine/cholesterol. Although the association of AIIt with this phospholipid surface was rapid, dissociation was extremely slow and could not be measured over the time course of our experiments. Over a time period of 2 h, AIIt formed a stable complex with the phospholipid surface (data not shown). AIIt also bound to this phospholipid surface in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). AIIt is known to bind only to anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine and, therefore, does not bind to phosphatidylcholine (34Evans T.C. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13231-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Blackwood R.A. Ernst J.D. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Glenney Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When we examined the interaction of AIIt with a phosphatidylcholine surface we could measure only a minimal interaction when a high concentration of AIIt was injected. Therefore, the phospholipid specificity and Ca2+ dependence of the AIIt-phospholipid interaction observed in our experiments suggested that the binding of AIIt to the phospholipid surface formed on the L1 biosensor chip resembled the well characterized interaction of AIIt with intact phospholipid liposomes. Next we quantitated the interaction of annexin A2 and AIIt with the phospholipid surface. For these experiments annexin A2 or AIIt (100 nm) was injected followed by buffer. This procedure allowed for control of the amount of these proteins immobilized on the biosensor chip. Typically we did not exceed 20% of the binding capacity of the biosensor chip. As shown in Fig. 1C, annexin A2 also showed a fast association with the phospholipid surface but remained bound to the phospholipidcoated biosensor chip during the course of our experiments. About 300 RU of annexin A2 and 640 RU of AIIt bound to the phospholipid-coated biosensor chip, which corresponds to about 300 pg (7.9 fmol/mm2) of annexin A2 and 640 pg (7.1 fmol/mm2) of AIIt. This level of immobilization was subsequently utilized in the binding experiments. Interaction of Plasminogen with AIIt and Its Subunits—To observe the interaction of plasminogen with AIIt, we began by injecting AIIt onto the phospholipid-coated biosensor chip followed by buffer. Once a stable base line was obtained, plasminogen was subsequently injected. We observed that plasminogen bound to the phospholipid-associated AIIt (Fig. 2A). The equilibrium resonance units at several ligand concentrations were determined, and equilibrium binding data were subjected to Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 2B). We determined a K d of 0.11 μm for the interaction of AIIt with plasminogen. The interaction of AIIt with plasminogen was inhibited by 10 mm aminocaproic acid (data not shown), suggesting that this interaction was dependent on the binding of plasminogen to a lysine residue of AIIt. To establish which subunit of AIIt contained the plasminogen-binding site, we immobilized each subunit on a biosensor chip and examined the plasminogen binding kinetics. S100A10 does not bind phospholipid; therefore, S100A10 was immobilized by thiol-coupling the protein to a CM5 biosensor chip. We then examined the interaction of the thiol-coupled S100A10 with plasminogen. We observed that S100A10 bound plasminogen with moderate affinity (K d of 1.81 μm) (Fig. 2, C and D). The binding of plasminogen to the immobilized S100A10 was also blocked by 10 mm aminocaproic acid (data not shown). Next we injected annexin A2 on the phospholipid surface of the L1 biosensor chip followed by buffer. Once a stable base line was established, plasminogen was then injected. Surprisingly, we found that phospholipid-associated annexin A2 failed to bind plasminogen over a concentration range of 50 nm to 1 μm plasminogen. The annexin A2 used in these experiments was human recombinant protein expressed in E. coli. Similarly, the annexin A2 purified from bovine lung or human recombinant annexin A2 (expressed in yeast) also failed to bind plasminogen (data not shown). In contrast, S100A10 bound to the phospholipid-associated annexin A2 (Fig. 2E), suggesting that the annexin A2 was not denatured upon interaction with the phospholipid surface. These results conclusively show that annexin A2 is not a plasminogen-binding protein. The inability of phospholipid-associated annexin A2 to bind to plasminogen was difficult to reconcile with the published observation that annexin A2, immobilized on the surface of a polystyrene plate, bound plasminogen (37Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a second approach to investigating the interaction of plasminogen with annexin A2, we prepared a plasminogen surface by aminecoupling plasminogen to a CM5 biosensor chip. We then flowed annexin A2 over the immobilized plasminogen surface. We observed that annexin A2 also failed to bind to the immobilized plasminogen (Fig. 2F). AIIt or S100A10 were also injected onto the surface of the chip followed by buffer. As shown in Fig. 2F, AIIt and S100A10 bound to the immobilized plasminogen surface under these conditions. Interestingly, the mutant S100A10, S100A10desKK, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal lysines, did not bind plasminogen. Thus, these data confirm that the carboxyl-terminal lysines form the plasminogen-binding site of S100A10. As a third approach to determining if an interaction existed between annexin A2 and plasminogen, we amine-coupled annexin A2 directly to the CM5 biosensor chip. We observed that plasminogen failed to bind to the immobilized annexin A2 (Fig. 2G). In contrast, S100A10 bound to the amine-coupled annexin A2, suggesting that the S100A10-binding site of annexin A2 remained intact in the amine-coupled annexin A2. Similar results were obtained with the thiol-coupled annexin A2 (data not shown). Thus, by three independent approaches we were unable to demonstrate an interaction between annexin A2 and plasminogen. We also examined the interaction of plasminogen with a mutant AIIt that consisted of a wild-type annexin A2 subunit and the mutant form of S100A10 in which the carboxyl-terminal lysines were deleted (AIItdesKK). This allowed us to directly evaluate the importance of the carboxyl-terminal lysines of S100A10 within the AIIt heterotetramer. Previous data from our laboratory had shown that the loss of the two carboxyl-terminal lysines from the S100A10 res"

We previously reported that the up-regulation of caveolin attenuates the growth factor response and the subsequent downstream signal cascades in senescent human diploid fibroblasts. Therefore, in the present experiment, we investigated the modulation of caveolin status in senescent cells to determine the effect of caveolin on mitogenic signaling efficiency and cell cycling. We reduced the level of caveolin-1 in senescent human diploid fibroblasts using its antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA, and this resulted in the restoration of normal growth factor responses such as the increased phosphorylation of Erk, the nuclear translocation of p-Erk, and the subsequent activation of p-Elk upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. Moreover, DNA synthesis and the re-entry of senescent cells into cell cycle were resumed upon epidermal growth factor stimulation concomitantly with decreases in p53 and p21. Taken together, we conclude that the loss of mitogenic signaling in senescent cells is strongly related to their elevated levels of caveolin-1 and that the functional recovery of senescent cells at least in the terms of growth factor responsiveness and cell cycle entry might be achieved simply by lowering the caveolin level.

Caveolae are vesicular organelles that represent a subdivision of the plasma membrane (1Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). They are most abundant in terminally differentiated cell types, i.e. adipocytes, endothelial cells, and muscle cells. Moreover, it has been suggested that caveolae may function as subcellular compartments for the storage of inactive signaling molecules to regulate activation and to facilitate cross-talk between distinct signaling cascades (3Engelman J.A.

Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is the principal component of caveolae, and the caveolin gene family consists of caveolin-1, -2, and -3. Caveolin-1 and -2 are co-expressed, form a hetero-oligomer in the plasma membrane, and exist in many cell types (5Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl.

Moreover, recent studies have suggested a regulatory role for caveolin in addition to its structural function. For example, the stable expressions of the caveolin-1 or -3 genes in caveolin-deficient mammalian cells induced the formation of caveolae structures (9Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The caveolin functions as scaffolding protein within the caveolae membrane and interacts with signaling proteins such as EGFR, 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; HDF, human diploid fibroblast; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; AS-ON, antisense oligonucleotide; S-ON, sense oligonucleotide; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

In addition, a short cytosolic N-terminal region of caveolin is involved in the formation of oligomers and mediates the interaction with signaling molecules, which result in the their inactivation (4Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y.H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 is sufficient to drive cell transformation and hyperactivates the Erk kinase cascade (16Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). And caveolin levels in most tumor tissues are significantly lower than in normal tissues, suggesting the circumvention of signal suppression by caveolin. Moreover, the co-expression of EGFR, Raf, MEK-1, or Erk-2 with caveolin-1 dramatically inhibits signaling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in vivo (3Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Many cell types, such as human diploid fibroblast, show cellular senescence in vitro. Senescent cells enter into irreversible growth arrest when they contain increased levels of cell cycle inhibitory molecules (17Chang B.D. Xuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B.

Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In consequence, senescent cells show lower levels of p-Erk in the nucleus, despite its high level in the cytosol, and lack transcription factor (Elk-1) activation (9Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Zurzolo C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the hyporesponsiveness of senescent fibroblasts to EGF stimulation might be related to the up-regulation of caveolins with aging and that the overexpression of caveolin-1 in young HDF cells could down-regulate EGF signaling (21Park W.Y.

However, it is not known whether the reduced caveolin-1 in senescent cells might restore the signaling cascades and cellular cycling in response to growth factors. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to test the possibility of recovery of growth factor responsiveness by reducing the level of caveolin-1 in senescent HDFs by use of antisense oligonucleotide and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Reagents—Human diploid fibroblasts were isolated from newborn foreskin (48Park S.C. Yeo E.-J. Han J.-A. Hwang Y.-C. Choi J.-Y. Park J.S. Park Y.-H. Kim K.-O. Kim I.-G. Seong S.-C. Kwak S.-J. J.

Monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (C43420), monoclonal anti-caveolin-2 antibody (C57820), and monoclonal anti-caveolin-3 antibody (C38320) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody (sc-03), polyclonal anti-phospho-Erk antibody (sc-7383), polyclonal anti-Erk-1/2 antibody (sc-94), anti-p53 antibody (sc-126), and anti-p21 antibody (sc-6246) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals. Other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma and Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Human diploid fibroblasts were kept in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and subculture at a ratio of 1:4. We defined young cells as those resulting from <25 population doublings, and old cells were from >60 population doublings. Cellular senescence of all of the old cells was confirmed by their delayed population doubling times and by a senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity assay as described by Dimri et al. (26Roa V.N. Huebner K. Maria S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1502-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). After being grown in a semi-confluent state, senescence-associated β-galactosidase, pH 6.0, activity was examined. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with β-galactosidase reagent (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide/potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 by Antisense Oligonucleotide and siRNA—HDF cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Twenty-four hours later, 100 nm each of antisense caveolin-1 oligonucleotide (TTTGCCCCCAGACAT, complementary to the 15-base initiation sequence of human caveolin-1) was transfected into HDF cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). Three hours later, the medium was discarded and replaced with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A sense caveolin-1 oligonucleotide (ATGTCTGGGGGCAAA) corresponding to 15-bases of the initiation sequence of caveolin-1 was used as a control (27Gille R. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). For monitoring purposes, we conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate in the N-terminal of oligonucleotides. Double-stranded siRNA molecules were designed to target the human caveolin-1 mRNA. 21-nucleotide siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) as duplexed 2′-unprotected, desalted, and purified siRNA. We targeted 5 regions of caveolin-1 mRNA. The target sequence of C1 is AACACCTCAACGATGACGTGG; that of C2 is AACCAGAAGGGACACACAGTT; that of C3 is AATACTGGTTTTACCGCTTGC; that of C4 is AACAGGGCAACATCTACAAGC; and that of C5 is AACAUCUACAAGCCCAACAAC. A GL2 luciferase oligonucleotide was used as a negative control. Senescent HDF cells were grown to 40% confluence in 10-cm dishes and transfected with annealed siRNA using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 6 h as recommended by the manufacturer. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 30% fetal bovine serum and 3% penicillin-streptomycin was added to each dish to a final concentration of 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were harvested 48 h later for further assays. Western Blot and Erk Activation Analysis—Whole cell extracts were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell) using standard techniques. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-p-Erk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-p-Elk (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-Elk (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat polyclonal anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-p21 (Oncogene). The immune complexes were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody and finally visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL kit, Amersham Biotechnology). Electron Microscopic Analysis—Sense and antisense oligonucleotide-treated senescent HDFs were pelleted and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. After washing with 0.2 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, the cell pellets were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 1 h. Cells were then dehydrated in graded ethanol through propylene oxide and embedded in epoxy resin (Polyscience Co.). Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were observed using a transmission electron microscope (H-600, Hitachi). Subcellular Fractionation—To prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, 1–2 × 108 cells were harvested by trypsin, washed three times with calcium-deficient phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 2.5 × 108 cells/ml in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. Resuspended cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 min and then transferred into a tube in ice for 5 min with Triton X-100 added to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cell lysates were separated by several passages through a 260-gauge needle and examined under a phase-contrast microscope. The nuclei were isolated from the cytosol by centrifugation at 300 × g at 4 °C for 10 min in a Sorvall RC-5B centrifuge using a SS-34 rotor. Isolated nuclei were washed with 10 ml of buffer and resuspended in a nuclear extraction buffer containing 20 mm of Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Resuspended nuclei were incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional shaking to extract the nuclear proteins and finally were spun down in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. Immunocytochemistry and Quantification—Each of the transfected senescent HDFs was cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates and treated with EGF and BrdUrd for 24 h. Cultures were processed for immunocytochemistry as described previously (23Lim I.K. Won H.K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: BrdUrd (1:100, mouse; Roche Applied Science), p-Elk (1:200, rabbit; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc), caveolin-1 (1:500, rabbit; Transduction Laboratories), phalloidin (1:1000; Molecular Probes), and DAPI (1:1000; Sigma). Detection was performed using a Bio-Rad confocal system at a magnification of ×40 with individual filter sets for each channel, and images were assembled using Adobe PhotoShop. Fluorescent-labeled cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. Positive cells were quantified in at least 10 fields systematically across the coverslips from three independent experiments conducted in parallel. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Down-regulation of Caveolin Expression—Senescent HDF cells showed high level of caveolin expression and decreased response upon EGF stimulation. The overexpression of caveolin-1 level in young HDF cells had been found to reduce Erk phosphorylation (21Park W.Y. Park J.S. Cho K.A. Kim D.I. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20847-20852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the signal attenuating effect of caveolin in senescent cells could be primarily responsible for their hyporesponsiveness to EGF stimulation and that the modulation of caveolin-1 level in these cells could modify Erk signaling effects. To modulate the intracellular caveolin level of senescent cells, an antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ON) complementary to the 15-base initiation sequence of human caveolin-1 was prepared, whereas a sense oligonucleotide (S-ON) corresponding to the 15 bases of the initiation sequence was used as a control (27Gille R. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To monitor oligonucleotides efficiency, we used conjugated fluorescent oligonucleotides. We found that the expression of caveolin-1 was abnormally high (Fig. 1A) and that was primarily localized to the membrane domain of senescent HDF cells. To identify the effect of antisense oligonucleotide, we examined the dose responsiveness by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides could effectively penetrate senescent HDF cells in the presence of LipofectAMINE reagent (Fig 1B). Interestingly, the antisense oligonucleotide of caveolin-1 was localized to the nucleus and could inhibit caveolin-1 expression level in senescent HDFs, whereas the sense oligonucleotide was localized mainly to the cytosol and had no effect. The expression of caveolin-1 was dose-dependently reduced by antisense oligonucleotide in senescent cells (Fig 1B). Therefore, the expressions of caveolin-1 were found to significantly decrease by AS-ON in senescent HDFs. Caveolin-1, a key constituent of caveolae structures, forms caveolae structures in senescent HDFs. Electron microscopic experiments upon the plasmalemmal profiles of senescent (S-ON-transfected cells) HDFs revealed the presence of numerous non-clathrin-coated vesicular structures 50 –100 nm in diameter that were juxtaposed to the plasma membrane and morphologically indistinguishable from caveolae (Fig. 2A). In contrast, profiles of AS-ON-transfected cells contained significantly fewer caveolae-like structures. Quantitative analysis of multiple plasmalemmal profile revealed that AS-ON-treated senescent HDF cells contained over five times less caveolae-like structure than S-ON-treated senescent HDF cells (Fig. 2B). From these results, the antisense oligonucleotide to caveolin-1 was found to be active not only in terms of caveolin reduction but also in terms of the inhibition of caveolae structures in senescent HDFs. To confirm the specificity of AS-ON effect, we designed five siRNA for caveolin-1 and tested their efficiency. As shown in Fig. 4A, C2 and C5 of siRNA for caveolin-1 significantly reduced the level of caveolin-1 in senescent HDFs compared with the control. For further experiment, we used C2 siRNA and we observed that siRNA effect could maintain until 72 h (Fig. 4B). Recovery of Downstream Signal Transduction Cascade in Senescent HDF Cells—Despite the elevated p-Erk level in cytosol, the translocation of p-Erk and the phosphorylation of Elk failed upon EGF stimulation in senescent HDFs (24Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Tresin I.M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the expression levels of EGFR and Erk were not significantly different in young and senescent HDFs (Fig. 3A). Despite the high basal level of p-Erk, no mitogenic response was observed upon EGF stimulation in senescent HDFs (Fig. 3B). As a consequence of adjusting the caveolin-1 levels in senescent cells, basal p-Erk was decreased by AS-ON treatment but not by S-ON treatment (Fig. 3C). We further tested the functional recovery of the Erk system in response to EGF stimulation by modulating the caveolin-1 level in senescent HDFs. No significant changes in the level of Erk phosphorylation by EGF stimulation in S-ON-treated senescent HDFs were observed, whereas Erk activation significantly resumed in AS-ON-treated senescent HDFs, and this was similar to that observed in young cells (Fig. 3D). To confirm this recovery of Erk activation by down-regulation of caveolin-1 using AS-ON, we used siRNA for this experiment. No significant changes in the level of Erk phosphorylation by EGF stimulation in control-transfected senescent HDFs were observed, whereas Erk activation was resumed in C2-transfected senescent HDFs (Fig. 4C). Therefore, these data show that the recovery of EGF signaling in senescent HDF cells was due to reduction of the caveolin-1 expression level by siRNA as well as antisense oligonucleotide. Activated Erk translocates into the nucleus and subsequently activates several target transcriptional factors, including members of the transcription factor family (25Tresin I.M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Roa V.N. Huebner K. Maria S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B.

Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is known that the abundance of serine-phosphorylated Elk is reduced in senescent cells (25Tresin I.M. Lorenzini A. Frisoni L. Allen R.G. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 269: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our experiment, we checked the mode of Elk activation in response to EGF in caveolin-reduced senescent HDF cells and determined the basal levels of p-Erk and p-Elk by subcellular fractionation in young and senescent HDFs. Despite the high level of p-Erk, Elk was very weakly phosphorylated in nuclei, suggesting that it would be inactive in senescent cells (Fig. 5A). To confirm this result, we determined the phosphorylation status of Erk and Elk in young and senescent HDFs and found that EGF stimulation strongly phosphorylated Elk within 30 min in young HDFs but weakly in senescent HDFs (Fig. 5B). We also examined Elk phosphorylation in senescent HDFs upon EGF simulation after S-ON or AS-ON treatment (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the treatment of senescent HDFs with AS-ON restored EGF-induced Elk phosphorylation, although partially and slowly, it reached maximum activity only after 60 min. Moreover, immunocytochemical analysis showed that Elk was phosphorylated only in young and AS-ON-treated senescent HDFs and very weakly in senescent and S-ON-treated cells (Fig. 6B).Fig. 6Recovery of Elk activation in the nucleus of senescent HDFs. Young, senescent, and transfected HDFs were starved of fetal bovine serum and treated with EGF at 100 ng/ml for 30 and 60 min. A, cells were treated with EGF at 100 ng/ml for indicated time and analyzed by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-phospho-Elk, polyclonal anti-Elk antibody, and anti-caveolin-1 (Cav-1) antibody, respectively.

Therefore, we examined the cell cycle-associated molecules. Certain members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/cyclin family, which are responsible for cell cycle progress, are expressed but are inactive in the senescent state (29Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This lack of CDK activity and arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is attributed to the induction of the G1-S CDK/cyclin inhibitors p21 (WAF1) (30Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) and p16 (INK4a) (31Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2229-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the levels of p53 and p21 in AS-ON- and S-ON-treated senescent HDFs and found that the levels of p53 and p21 are significantly attenuated in AS-ON-treated senescent HDFs (Fig. 7A). To monitor the G1-S transition, we examined changes in the BrdUrd incorporation rate in response to EGF stimulation. Since the BrdUrd index is a measure of the DNA synthesis rate, it can be used to monitor S phase activity. As a results, almost 60% AS-ON-transfected senescent HDFs showed DNA synthesis in contrast to the negligible activity shown by S-ON-transfected HDFs as monitored using anti-BrdUrd antibody (Fig. 7, B and C). Senescent fibroblasts are generally resistant not only to extrinsic noxious stimuli (36Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 37Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar) but also to growth factor stimulation (38Matsuda T. Okamura K. Sato Y. Morimoto A. Ono M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Seshadri T. Campisi J.

A. 1992; 89: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that the hyporesponsiveness of senescent fibroblasts to EGF stimulation might be related to the up-regulation of caveolins with aging (21Park W.Y. Park J.S. Cho K.A. Kim D.I. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20847-20852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of the caveolin family has been confirmed in vivo to increase in the tissues of aged rat such as in the brain, heart, spleen, and liver. These results suggest that caveolin might play a major role in the aging process in vivo (21Park W.Y. Park J.S. Cho K.A. Kim D.I. Ko Y.G. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20847-20852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, the high level of caveolins in the brain tissues of old animals might provide a clue to the susceptibility of elderly people to Alzheimer's disease (41Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 42El-Deiry W.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 121-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to show that the down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression could recover the attenuated Erk signaling and the consequent cell cycling of senescent HDFs. Accordingly, we reduced the expression of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1) and the formation of caveolae structures (Fig. 2) successfully using the antisense oligonucleotide of caveolin-1 in senescent HDFs. We found that the down-regulation of caveolin-1 in senescent HDFs could recover the signaling from EGF to Erk-1/2 in the cytosol with respect to Erk phosphorylation to a considerable degree (Fig. 3D). Over the last few years, RNA interference has been recognized as a major mechanism of posttranscriptional gene silencing in various systems (43Xia H. Mao Q. Paulson H.L. Davidson B.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1006-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 44Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). To verify the effect of AS-ON, we used siRNA of 21 nucleotides for down-regulation of caveolin-1 in senescent HDFs. As seen in Fig. 4, the effect of recovery of Erk activation by siRNA of caveolin-1 was correlated well with the effect of AS-ON. Our results suggest that the down-regulation of caveolin-1 by AS-ON as well as siRNA can lead to the recovery of signaling in senescent HDFs. Senescent HDF cells and Ha-Ras mutant-expressed HDFs did not respond to EGF stimulation in the MAPK activation system (20Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Kokkonen G.C. Mock Y.D. Roth G.S. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 16: 3604-3607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the accumulated cytosolic p-Erk-1/2 failed to translocate to nuclei on EGF stimulation (23Lim I.K. Won H.K. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 119: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Lim I.K. Hong K.W. Kwak I.H. Yoon G. Park S.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our data also confirmed that the translocation of p-Erk was diminished in senescent HDFs, regardless of the elevated level of p-Erk in the cytosol (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we found that the down-regulation of caveolin-1 by antisense oligonucleotide and siRNA treatment reduced the basal p-Erk level (Figs. 3C and 4C) and resumed Erk activation upon EGF stimulation (Figs. 3D and 4C), which resulted in Elk phosphorylation in senescent HDFs (Fig. 6). These results suggest that a simple reduction of the caveolin level in senescent HDF cells can induce the restoration of the Erk signaling system upon EGF stimulation, not only in terms of its phosphorylation but also its translocation into and activation of transcriptional factors in the nuclei. Recently, it was reported that caveolin-1-mediated cell cycle arrest occurs through a p53/p21-dependent pathway (35Galbiati F. Volonte D. Liu J. Capozza F. Frank P.G. Zhu L. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2229-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). p53 is directly involved in G1 phase arrest through the induction of p21 (42El-Deiry W.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 121-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p21 mediates p53-dependent G1 arrest by inhibiting the activity of CDKs, which phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene product as well as other substrates. p21 also induces growth arrest by preventing proliferating cell nuclear antigen from activating DNA polymerase σ, which is essential for DNA replication (45Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). Moreover, p21-deficient fibroblasts show impairment of G1 arrest (46Deng C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar), confirming a key role for p21 in cell cycle arrest. Our experiment showed that the down-regulation of caveolin-1 in senescent HDF also reduced the level of the cell cycle inhibitors p53 and p21 (Fig. 7A). The reduction of p53 and p21 by antisense oligonucleotide to caveolin-1 gene in senescent HDF cells indicated the strong possibility of deregulation of the senescence-associated cell cycle inhibition. Therefore, the cell cycle reentry of the senescent cells was examined by monitoring BrdUrd incorporation in response to EGF stimuli after reduction of caveolin status. Because BrdUrd index is the measure of DNA synthesis rate, it indicates the S phase activity. Actually, in our experiment, almost 60% antisense-oligonucleotide-treated senescent HDF cells showed the BrdUrd incorporation in contrast to the negligible activity in the control senescent HDF cells (Fig. 7, B and C). These data strongly suggest that the cell cycle reentry into S phase can be induced by the reduction of caveolin status in the senescent cells. These results indicate that a simple adjustment of the caveolin level in senescent cells can profoundly influence the aging phenotype. Moreover, evidence of the role of caveolin in cancer cells have been well documented (47Razani B. Schlegel A. Liu J. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), wherein caveolin was suggested to be a tumor suppressor gene. Therefore, it is apparent that caveolin plays an important role in the regulation of both aging and cancer. Taken together, we suggest that the growth factor responsiveness of senescent cells can be resumed to a considerable degree by reducing caveolin levels. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the accepted nature of the senescent phenotype, i.e. irreversible growth arrest and irresponsiveness to growth factors, may be at the point of redefinition. These results imply that the functional recovery of senescent cells can be probably achieved, which may extendable to the functional restoration of aged organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1984671783,"We developed a microsome-based, cell-free system that assembles newly formed triglyceride (TG) into spherical lipid droplets. These droplets were recovered in the <i>d</i> ≤ 1.055 g/ml fraction by gradient ultracentrifugation and were similar in size and appearance to those isolated from rat adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. Caveolin 1 and 2, vimentin, adipocyte differentiation-related protein, and the 78-kDa glucose regulatory protein were identified on the droplets from the cell-free system. The caveolin was soluble in 1% Triton X-100, as was the caveolin on lipid droplets from 3T3-L1 cells. The lipid droplets from the cell-free system, like those from 3T3-L1 cells, contained TG, diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. The assembly of these TG-containing structures was dependent on the rate of TG biosynthesis and required an activator present in the 160,000 × <i>g</i> supernatant from homogenized rat adipocytes. The activator induced phospholipase D (PLD) activity, and its effect on the release of the TG-containing structures from the microsomes was inhibited by 1-butanol (but not 2-butanol) or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The activator could be replaced by a constitutively active PLD or phosphatidic acid. These results indicate that PLD and the formation of phosphatidic acid are important in the assembly of the TG-containing structures."

After fusion, SNARE complexes must be disassembled to regenerate individual SNAREs for use in subsequent fusion reactions. Proteins responsible for this disassembly are the ATPase NSF and its adaptor protein soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP). Insight into this process is important to understanding how membrane trafficking is controlled in the cell. α-SNAP (a ubiquitous SNAP isoform) serves as the requisite link between NSF and SNARE complexes. It binds to SNARE complexes, and together they recruit NSF (4Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). SNARE-bound α-SNAP stimulates ATP hydrolysis by NSF, leading to conformational changes and concomitant disassembly of the SNARE complex (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

Each 20 S complex consists of one SNARE complex, three α-SNAPs, and one NSF hexamer. Interestingly, α-SNAP only binds NSF in the absence of SNARE complex when forced into an oligomeric form by fusion to an intrinsically trimeric protein (5Wimmer C. Hohl T. Hughes C.A. Muller S.A.

Electron micrographs of α-SNAP bound to SNARE complex and an antibody specific for the N terminus of α-SNAP show that α-SNAP binds SNARE in an antiparallel orientation. This positions its N terminus near the membrane and its C terminus away from the membrane, where it can interact with NSF (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E.

SNARE complexes are stable α-helical structures containing specific combinations of four SNARE helices (for review, see Ref. 15Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of the synaptic and late endosomal SNARE complexes show that these two complexes are rod-shaped and held together by interactions among conserved, mostly hydrophobic residues within the core of the complex (16Sutton R.B.

Parlati F. Wimmer C. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Engelhardt H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), a significant portion of α-SNAP is thought to participate in its interaction with the SNARE complex. The structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-SNAP orthologue, Sec17p (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), provides some clues to where the interfaces between SNAPs and SNARE complexes might be. Sec17p is a 14-helix α/α protein with two principal domains, an N-terminal twisted sheet (nine α-helices arranged in antiparallel to form a sheet-like structure) and a C-terminal globular bundle (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Each helix in the twisted sheet is slightly askew from its neighbors, giving the domain a concave face whose curvature complements that of the convex surface of the SNARE complex. One edge of the twisted sheet is longer than the other and curved in a way that could allow it to fit into the shallow grooves that lie between individual helices of the SNARE complex (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both the concave face and the longer edge of the twisted sheet contain residues that are conserved among SNAP orthologues (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Shape complementarity, sequence conservation, and overall surface charge distribution led to the proposal that either the concave face or longer edge of the Sec17p (or the α-SNAP) twisted sheet domain might be responsible for SNARE complex binding (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whether this is the case and, if so, how α-SNAP actually contacts SNARE complexes has not been experimentally examined. In this report, we present evidence showing that the SNARE complex binding surface α-SNAP is the concave face of its twisted sheet domain. In a coimmunoprecipitation-based binding assay, point mutations in charged residues on this surface strongly affect SNARE complex binding, whereas mutations elsewhere do not. Most of these mutations similarly affect the ability of α-SNAP to promote SNARE complex disassembly by NSF. Based on these results we present a model of how α-SNAP interacts with SNARE complexes and discuss its implications for SNARE complex disassembly. Materials—Bovine α-SNAP in pQE-9 was a gift from J. E. Rothman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). All chemicals were reagent grade or better from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Bovine α-SNAP DNA (from pQE-9 α-SNAP) was cloned into NdeI/HindIII-digested pET28 (Novagen) to generate a His6-α-SNAP expression construct. The resulting protein had the sequence MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH at its N terminus. During sequencing we found that the sequence of pQE-9 α-SNAP differed from the published bovine α-SNAP sequence (PubMed 228 accession number AAB25812; Ref 26Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) at residues 70–71 (HV → QL) and 243–244 (RI → LM). With these changes, the bovine α-SNAP sequence matches human α-SNAP at all four residues and bovine β-SNAP at two residues. All sequencing was performed using a cycle-sequencing kit (Big Dye version 2; ABI Systems) and processed by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Laboratory (Washington University). Eleven α-SNAP mutants (F32G, E39A, E43A, K56A, D87A, K93A, R116A, K140A, E155A, K163A, and Y200K) were generated by PCR using an overlap extension method with pQE-9 α-SNAP as template and subcloned into pET28. The remaining mutants (E39K/E40K, R47A, K53A, K53E, Q74A, D80A, K94A, E99A, E109A, K122A, E129A, E132A, E134A, D150A, E156A, K167A, K203A, and D273R) were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with wild-type pET28 α-SNAP as template. Because of a PCR error, some of the α–SNAP mutants (E39K/E40K, Q74A, K94A, E99A, E109A, E129A, D150A, K203A, and D273R) contained a C84S mutation. However, wild-type and C84S α-SNAP were functionally equivalent in our assays (data not shown), and the mutation was, therefore, left in place. Protein Expression and Purification—α-SNAP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. 1–2 liters of Terrific Broth cultures were grown 10–14 h at 30 °C to A 600 = ∼2 and induced for 2–4 h with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% glycerol, pH 7.4) and stored at –20 °C. After thawing, pellets were sonicated (2 × 30 s), Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 18,500 × g. α-SNAP was purified from the supernatant by binding to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and eluting with imidazole. After dialysis into Mono Q buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) α-SNAP was further purified on a Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing α-SNAP were pooled and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 280 nm (ϵ = 40,200 m–1cm–1 in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; determined by quantitative amino acid analysis). Typical preparations had a concentration of 50–100 μm and were snap-frozen and stored at –70 °C. Full-length His6-tagged CHO NSF was expressed and purified as previously described (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). SNARE complex was assembled by mixing three purified SNAREs (rat His6-synaptobrevin II (1–96) (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), mouse SNAP-25b-His6-Myc (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), and rat syntaxin1a (184–265)-His6) together at equimolar ratios in Mono Q buffer. After overnight assembly, SNARE complex was separated from unincorporated individual SNAREs by chromatography on a Mono Q column. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE either with or without boiling; fractions containing SDS-resistant complex were pooled, quantitated using a Bradford assay with BSA as standard, and snap-frozen for storage. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected on a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter; each spectrum was the average of five scans from 190 to 250 nm in 0.4-nm increments at 50 nm/min. Wild-type and mutant α-SNAP proteins were diluted to 2.9 μm in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Measurements were taken at room temperature using a quartz cell with a 1-mm path length. Mean residue ellipticity (degree × cm2/dmol) was calculated after subtracting the signal from buffer alone. α-Helical content was calculated using the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (Θ222 nm) and the assumption that for 100% α-helix, Θ222 nm = –39,500 (1–2.57/n), where n is the average number of residues per helix (27Chen Y.-H. Yan J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Based on homology with the Sec17p structure (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), n for α-SNAP is 15 residues. Immunoprecipitation-based SNARE Complex Binding Assay—α-SNAP (concentrations are noted in Figs. 1 and 3), Myc-tagged SNARE complex (1 μm), and anti-Myc IgG (0.04 mg/ml final concentration (28Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar)) were combined in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) and mixed with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for a total volume of 100 μl in silane-treated polypropylene tubes. After 40 min of shaking at room temperature, samples were washed twice in 1 ml of binding buffer for a total washing time of ∼30 s. Samples lacking SNARE complex were used to measure nonspecific binding. 10 μl of gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to the beads in each tube, tubes were boiled for 3 min, and each reaction was loaded onto an 11% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel, modified from Schagger and Von Jagow (29Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad acrylamide solution 37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide or 30% total monomer, 2.6% cross-linker). Gels were run in standard Tricine buffers (anode 0.2 m Tris, pH 8.9; cathode 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m Tricine (Serva), 0.1% SDS), placed in 10% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid to strip SDS from the gel, incubated 30 min in 0.05% SDS, and finally stained with SYPRO Red (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were collected using a STORM 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics); fluorescence was detected using a 635-nm diode laser and a 650-nm long-pass filter. Staining was quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).Fig. 3α-SNAP sequence alignment and mutations.

M. Lauer and P. I. Hanson, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin 1A (1–265)-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), synaptobrevin II (1–96)-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and SNAP-25b was assembled and purified using a Mono Q column as for the SNARE complex above. SNARE complex fluorescence was monitored using a SPEX Fluorolog 3 with excitation at 433 nm and emission at 477 nm (CFP emission) and 527 nm (YFP emission). Slits were 3 nm. The ratio of YFP to CFP emission (YFP527/CFP477) was monitored as a function of time. Fully assembled SNARE complex had a YFP/CFP ratio of 2.2, whereas dissociated SNAREs had a YFP/CFP ratio of 0.6. To examine the requirements for α-SNAP in SNARE disassembly, SNARE complex (50 nm) was incubated with α-SNAP (250 nm) for 10 min at 30 °C in 500 μl of fluorimetry buffer (30 mm Hepes, 100 mm glutamic acid, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.6). A kinetic scan was then started. After obtaining a base line, disassembly was initiated by adding NSF (0.5 μg = 2nm). The ratio of YFP/CFP emission was measured every 3 s. The initial rate of SNARE complex disassembly was derived by fitting a straight line to the first 10 data points collected. α-SNAP Structure Model—A structural model of bovine α-SNAP was constructed with the SWISS-MODEL Protein Homology Modeling Server (30Guex N. Pietch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar) (www.expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) using the coordinates of S. cerevisiae Sec17p (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1QQE) and a sequence of bovine α-SNAP adjusted to compensate for a shorter N-terminal sequence in Sec17p, gaps and insertions in loops between helices, and a loop between helices 11 and 12 that is disordered in the Sec17p structure. α-SNAP-SNARE Complex Binding Model—Protein Data Bank files for the α-SNAP comparative homology model and the synaptic SNARE complex (one of the three in the unit cell, PDB code 1SFC) were combined using the Swiss Protein Data Bank Viewer (30Guex N. Pietch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar). Basic residues in α-SNAP whose mutations reduced SNARE complex binding were manually aligned with three sets of conserved acidic residues on the SNARE complex surface (Fig. 7). Side chain torsion angles were modified to maximize the number of interprotein hydrogen bonds without producing steric clashes. Modeling was done both in the presence and absence of α-SNAP C-terminal globular domain; a substantially better fit was obtained when the C-terminal domain was allowed to move and left out of the model. Features of the model are described elsewhere (see “Discussion”). α-SNAP Binding to Synaptic SNARE Complex—α-SNAP binds to an array of SNARE complexes (9Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and is thought to serve as an essential link between these complexes and NSF (9Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). To study α-SNAP interaction with the SNARE complex, we monitored α-SNAP binding to a synaptic SNARE complex containing the SNARE motifs from syntaxin 1a and synaptobrevin II together with full-length SNAP-25 (Fig. 1). This SNARE complex lacks the N-terminal Habc domain of syntaxin as well as the transmembrane domains of syntaxin and synaptobrevin. After combining α-SNAP and SNARE complex, we immobilized the SNARE complex on protein G-Sepharose using a C-terminal c-Myc epitope tag on SNAP-25 and an anti-Myc antibody. Unbound α-SNAP was washed off, and immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO Red staining. SYPRO dyes fluoresce upon interaction with protein-bound SDS; α-SNAP binding to the SNARE complex was, therefore, defined as the molar ratio of α-SNAP to SNAP-25 fluorescence in each lane. The EC50 of α-SNAP binding to SNARE complex in this assay was ∼5 μm. At high α-SNAP concentrations, approximately three α-SNAPs were bound per SNARE complex (Fig. 1). SYPRO dyes stain different proteins differently, rendering measurements of stoichiometry only semiquantitative (31Steinberg T.H. Jones L.J. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 32Berggren K.N. Chernokalskaya E. Lopen M.F. Beechem J.M. Patton W.F. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 54-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is, however, clear that more than one, and most likely three, α-SNAPs bind to a single SNARE complex. This is consistent with early estimates of the stoichiometry (22Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and with calibrated scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis of the 20 S complex, which suggests that it contains one SNARE complex, one NSF, and three molecules of α-SNAP (5Wimmer C. Hohl T. Hughes C.A. Muller S.A. Sollner T.H. Engel A. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29091-29097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Differences between the three α-SNAP binding sites on the SNARE complex are not apparent in our binding data. Interestingly, binding of α-SNAP to SNARE complex was sharply reduced when the concentration of NaCl in the assay was increased from 100 to 500 mm (Fig. 1). This demonstrates that electrostatic interactions are important for α-SNAP binding to the SNARE complex. It also confirms the specificity of binding detected in our assay, even at the highest concentrations of α-SNAP. Design and Production of α-SNAP Mutants—To define functionally important contacts between α-SNAP and the synaptic SNARE complex, we generated a series of α-SNAP mutants based on a homology model of α-SNAP. We built this model using the crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae α-SNAP orthologue, Sec17p (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sec17p is 35% identical and 15% similar to α-SNAP and can functionally replace α-SNAP in in vitro Golgi transport assays (6Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that the homology model reasonably predicts the actual α-SNAP structure, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to estimate α-SNAP helical content (Fig. 2). Based on its mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, α-SNAP is ∼70% helical. The helical content of Sec17p predicted from its crystal structure (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) is 73%, and that of α-SNAP from the homology model is 74%. The close correlation between the observed and predicted helical content of these proteins both substantiates the α-SNAP homology model and provides independent evidence that the Sec17p crystal structure reflects its structure in solution. As discussed in the introduction, the nine N-terminal α-helices in Sec17p form a twisted sheet domain which has two surfaces that are good candidates for SNARE complex binding. These two surfaces, the concave face and longer edge, are also found on the α-SNAP homology model. The concave face, which is part of the front face of the protein, is complementary in shape and charge to the convex, mostly acidic surface of the SNARE complex, and many of its exposed residues are strongly conserved among SNAP orthologues (25Rice L.M. Brunger A T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 85-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The longer edge of the twisted sheet also has several conserved residues, and its curvature complements that of the shallow grooves on the surface of the SNARE complex that run between the SNARE helices. The SNAP-SNARE complex interface is, therefore, likely to involve either the front face or the longer edge of the α-SNAP twisted sheet domain. Because of this and because the salt sensitivity of binding (Fig. 1) indicated that electrostatic interactions are important for α-SNAP binding to the SNARE complex, we introduced point mutations at all conserved charged residues on these two surfaces (Fig. 3). In addition, we generated mutations at three conserved residues (Tyr-200, Lys-203, and Asp-273) on the edge of the globular bundle near the twisted sheet and at one conserved hydrophobic residue (Phe"

We show here that, despite normal activation of insulin receptor, hyperosmotic stress inhibits both tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and IRS-1-associated phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase activity in response to physiological insulin concentrations. Insulin-induced membrane ruffling, which is dependent on PI 3-kinase activation, was also markedly reduced. These inhibitory effects were associated with an increase in IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin prevented the osmotic shock-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307. The inhibition of mTOR completely reversed the inhibitory effect of hyperosmotic stress on insulin-induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation. In addition, prolonged osmotic stress enhanced the degradation of IRS proteins through a rapamycin-insensitive pathway and a proteasome-independent process. These data support evidence of new mechanisms involved in osmotic stress-induced cellular insulin resistance. Short-term osmotic stress induces the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307 by an mTOR-dependent pathway. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in early proximal signaling events induced by physiological insulin concentrations. On the other hand, prolonged osmotic stress alters IRS-1 function by inducing its degradation, which could contribute to the down-regulation of insulin action.

Glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissues is caused by the translocation of the glucose transporter Glut 4 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane. These biological responses require tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, 1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; α-pS307, polyclonal anti-phosphoserine 307-IRS-1 antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PH, Pleckstrin homology; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase.1The abbreviations used are: IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; α-pS307, polyclonal anti-phosphoserine 307-IRS-1 antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PH, Pleckstrin homology; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. which, in turn, binds and activates PI 3-kinase. Downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase such as protein kinase B (PKB) or atypical PKC could be involved in Glut 4 translocation (2White M.F. Am. J.

Trends in Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Further, it has been recently shown that insulin-induced Glut 4 translocation also requires the activation of the adaptor protein containing PH and SH2 domain (APS)/Cbl-associated protein (CAP)/Cbl/Crk-II/TC10 pathway independent of PI 3-kinase activation (4Baumann C.A.

However, osmotic shock only partly mimics the insulin effect on Glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake. The effect induced by osmotic stress requires the tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Grb2-Associated binder-1 and is independent of PI 3-kinase/PKB activation (7Chen D. Elmendorf J.S.

We have recently shown that both osmotic shock and insulin share the Crk-II/TC10 pathway to stimulate Glut 4 translocation (10Gual P. Shigematsu S. Kanzaki M. Grémeaux T. Gonzalez T. Pessin J.E.

However, like several other insulinomimetic agents, hyperosmolarity not only partly activates several insulin-specific biological responses but also induces a state of insulin resistance. Indeed, in rat epididymal fat cells, hyperosmotic stress markedly reduces insulin-induced glucose transport (11Komjati M. Kastner G. Waldhausl W. Bratusch-Marrain P. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1988; 39: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In perfused rat liver, hyperosmolarity impairs insulin-mediated cell swelling and reverses the proteolysis inhibition induced by insulin (12Vom Dahl S. Hallbrucker C. Lang F. Gerok W. Haussinger D. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, pretreatment with sorbitol strongly decreases the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake, lipogenesis, and glycogen synthesis (13Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which hyperosmotic stress antagonizes insulin-mediated responses has not yet been fully elucidated. A recent report has shown that hyperosmolarity prevents insulin-induced activation of PKB. This could be mediated by the stimulation of calyculin A- or okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases acting at the level of PKB in response to hyperosmotic stress (13Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hyperosmolarity-induced insulin resistance could partially result from the stimulation of a PKB phosphatase that maintains PKB in an inactive state. However, because the role of PKB in insulin-stimulated glucose transport is still controversial (14Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Grémeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other mechanisms, in addition to dephosphorylation of PKB, could be involved in hyperosmolarity-induced insulin resistance. Indeed, it has recently been shown that insulin resistance caused by short- and long-term stress could be caused by an increase in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, with a subsequent inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. For instance, the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α induces the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on its Ser307 (18Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This serine residue is located near the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of IRS-1, and an interaction between this domain and the activated insulin receptor is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (2White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). IRS-1 phosphorylation on Ser307 prevents this interaction and thus inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 providing a potential mechanism to explain, at least in part, the insulin resistance induced by cellular stress (19Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Whereas serine phosphorylation could be a short-term mechanism involved in the negative regulation of IRS-1 function, regulated degradation of IRS-1 might also promote longterm insulin resistance (2White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).In this report, we provide evidences of new mechanisms, apart from PKB inactivation, that contribute to osmotic stress-induced insulin resistance. We show that short-term osmotic stress inhibits IRS-1 function by an mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307, whereas prolonged osmotic stress promotes the degradation of IRS proteins by an mTOR- and proteasome-independent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, and calf serum were obtained from Invitrogen.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in 35- or 100-mm dishes in DMEM, 25 mm glucose, and 10% calf serum and induced to differentiate in adipocytes as described previously (10Gual P. Shigematsu S. Kanzaki M. Grémeaux T. Gonzalez T. Pessin J.E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. J. Biol.

Differentiation medium was removed after 2 days and replaced with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with insulin for 2 more days. The cells were fed every 2 days with DMEM, 25 mm glucose, and 10% fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 8–15 days after the beginning of the differentiation protocol.Immunoprecipitation Assays—3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight in DMEM/0.5% bovine serum albumin. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in serum-free medium supplemented or not with 600 mm sorbitol and subsequently treated with or without insulin, as indicated in figure legends. To study the effect of pharmacological inhibitors, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with various inhibitors in serum-free medium followed by incubation in the serum-free medium with or without 600 mm sorbitol and pharmacological inhibitors. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) before solubilization for 30 min at 4 °C in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 1% Triton X-100). Lysates obtained after centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C) were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies pre-adsorbed on protein-G-Sepharose (4 μg of antibodies/sample). After washes with lysis buffer, immune pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 7.5% resolving gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with saline buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 140 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature and blotted overnight at 4 °C with commercial antibodies at the dilution indicated by the manufacturer's instructions and at 0.5 μg/ml for the anti-pS307-IRS1 antibody. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. In some cases, the membrane was stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS, and reprobed with the indicated antibodies.PI 3-Kinase Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated in the presence or absence of rapamycin for 30 min in serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with or without 600 mm sorbitol and with or without rapamycin for 40 min before 5 min of insulin stimulation (0.2 nm) as indicated in the figure legends. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. Thereafter, immune pellets were washed twice with each of the following buffers: 1) PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 200 μm Na3VO4; 2) 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m LiCl, and 200 μm Na3VO4; and 3) 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μm Na3VO4. PI 3-kinase activity was measured on the immune pellets as described previously (21Heydrick S.J. Jullien D. Gautier N. Tanti J.F. Giorgetti S. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Clin.

After overnight serum starvation, cells were treated with or without rapamycin for 30 min in the serum-free medium. Then, the medium was exchanged for serum-free medium supplemented with or without 600 mm sorbitol and with or without rapamycin for 40 min before 20 min of insulin stimulation (0.5 nm). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min on ice. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, the cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated with Texas red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100/1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and coverslips were mounted onto glass slides. Cells were examined using a Leica confocal microscope equipped with a Leica confocal laser scanning imaging. Cells were studied at a magnification of 40× using a 1.0–0.50 oil-immersion objective. Series of images were collected along the z-axis and examined. In each condition, 200 cells in random fields were examined by two different persons blind to the images' origin. Cells that showed clustering of actin staining at the periphery were scored as positive for membrane ruffles. The experiment was repeated three times.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.

Pessin J.E. Trends in Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Because hyperosmotic stress antagonizes insulin-mediated Glut 4 translocation and glucose uptake (13Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of hyperosmotic stress on insulin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes pre-treated or not with 600 mm sorbitol for 40 min before insulin stimulation using a physiological or a supraphysiological insulin concentration (0.2 and 100 nm, respectively). IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, sorbitol alone did not induce IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Sorbitol treatment inhibited insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by 50% at physiological insulin concentration (0.2 nm), but did not modify IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by 100 nm insulin. We then investigated whether this decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation also impairs its ability to recruit the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase and to activate the enzyme. IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with or without 600 mm sorbitol for 40 min before 0.2 nm insulin stimulation. The level of p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase co-immunoprecipitated with IRS-1 was detected with an anti-p85 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment of cells with sorbitol induced a 57% inhibition in the amount of p85 associated with IRS-1 in response to a physiological insulin concentration. This was correlated with a reduction in PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2B). Indeed, in absence of sorbitol, PI 3-kinase activity associated to IRS-1 was increased 14-fold by insulin, and sorbitol induced a 50% inhibition of insulin effect. This indicates that osmotic stress inhibits both the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and subsequent PI 3-kinase activation.Fig. 2Hyperosmotic stress inhibits the insulin-induced p85 and IRS-1 complex formation and subsequent PI 3-kinase activity. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with (gray bars) or without (empty bars) sorbitol (600 mm) for 40 min before a 5-min insulin stimulation (0.2 nm).

Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and F-actin structures were visualized using Texas red coupled-phalloidin by confocal fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative fields obtained in each condition are shown in Fig. 3A. Quantification of several experiments (Fig. 3B) indicates that sorbitol induced an increase of nearly 2-fold in the number of cells with membrane ruffles (12% in unstimulated cells versus 22% in sorbitol-treated cells). Insulin stimulation promoted a 4-fold increase in the number of cells harboring membrane ruffles (12% in unstimulated cells versus 47% in insulin-stimulated cells), an effect that was totally abolished by sorbitol treatment. This indicates that sorbitol pretreatment markedly inhibits the insulin-induced membrane ruffling, suggesting that inhibition of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity by hyperosmotic stress appears sufficient to alter this insulin effect.Fig. 3Hyperosmotic stress strongly inhibits insulin-induced membrane ruffling. After serum starvation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were either left untreated (empty bars) or stimulated (gray bars) with 600 mm sorbitol for 40 min before 20 min of insulin stimulation (0.5 nm).

To test this hypothesis, we determined the tyrosine phosphorylation level of insulin receptor from cells preincubated with or without sorbitol before insulin stimulation (0.2 nm). As shown in Fig. 4, hyperosmotic stress did not impair the ability of insulin to stimulate the autophosphorylation of its receptor. Thus, in sorbitol-treated cells, the decrease in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 function did not result from an alteration in insulin-mediated receptor activation.Fig. 4Hyperosmotic stress does not alter insulin receptor autophosphorylation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with (gray bars) or without (empty bars) sorbitol (600 mm) for 40 min before a 5-min insulin stimulation (0.2 nm).

To determine whether Ser307 is phosphorylated after sorbitol stimulation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with or without 600 mm sorbitol and IRS-1 was immunopurified and immunoblotted with a phosphospecific antibody against Ser307 (α-pS307). As shown in Fig. 5A, when IRS-1 was immunoblotted with an anti-IRS-1 antibody, we observed a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of IRS-1 in response to sorbitol, which could result from an increase in its serine/threonine phosphorylation. Immunoblotting with α-pS307 antibody indicates that the phosphorylation of this serine residue was very low in unstimulated cells but markedly increased after sorbitol treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that hyperosmotic stress increases the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and that one of the phosphorylated sites is the Ser307.Fig. 5Hyperosmotic stress triggers the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine 307 via a rapamycin-sensitive pathway.

The troposphere warms appreciably in one satellite data set, while the other data set shows little overall change. These satellite data uncertainties are important in studies seekingto identify human effects on climate. A model-predicted “fingerprint” of combined anthropogenic and natural effects is statistically detectable only in the satellite data set with a warmingtroposphere. Our findings show that claimed inconsistencies between model predictions and satellite tropospheric temperature data (and between the latter and surface data) may be an artifact of data uncertainties."
https://openalex.org/W1987300505,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) α interacts with the highly conserved 14-3-3 family proteins. The latter bind phosphorylated serine/threonine residues of “partner” molecules and influence many signal transduction events by altering their subcellular localization and/or protecting them from proteolysis. To examine the physiologic role of 14-3-3 on the glucocorticoid-signaling pathway, we studied the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and transactivation properties of GRα in a cell line replete with or devoid of 14-3-3σ. We found that endogenous 14-3-3σ helped localize green fluorescent protein-fused GRα in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand and potentiated its nuclear export after ligand withdrawal. 14-3-3σ also suppressed the transcriptional activity of GRα on a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. Disruption of the classic nuclear export signal of 14-3-3σ inactivated its ability to influence the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and transactivation activity of GRα, whereas introduction of a mutation inactivating the binding activity of 14-3-3σ to some of its partner proteins did not. 14-3-3σ bound the ligand-binding domain of GRα through its COOH-terminal portion, in a partially ligand-dependent fashion, while it did not interact with “ligand-binding domain” of GRβ at all. These results suggest that 14-3-3σ functions as a negative regulator in the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, possibly by shifting the subcellular localization/circulation of this receptor toward the cytoplasm through its nuclear export signal. Since 14-3-3 proteins play significant roles in numerous cellular activities, such as cell cycle progression, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, these actions might indirectly influence the transcriptional activity of GRα. Conversely, through its 14-3-3 protein interactions, GRα may influence these processes. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) α interacts with the highly conserved 14-3-3 family proteins. The latter bind phosphorylated serine/threonine residues of “partner” molecules and influence many signal transduction events by altering their subcellular localization and/or protecting them from proteolysis.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 1The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; NES, nuclear export signal; DBD, DNA-binding domain; LBD, ligand-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescence protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus;AD, activation domain; WT, wild type; KO, knock-out; C, cytoplasmic distribution; N, nuclear localization. belongs to the superfamily of steroid/thyroid/retinoic acid receptor proteins and mediates the diverse and pivotal actions of glucocorticoids in the maintenance of resting and stress homeostasis (1Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The human GR consists of two highly homologous isoforms, α and β, produced by alternative use of exon 9 α or β of the GR gene. GRα represents the classic glucocorticoid receptor, which binds glucocorticoids and mediates almost all known glucocorticoid effects, while GRβ does not bind ligand, has dominant negative activity upon GRα and unclear physiologic role(s) (2Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). GRα, in the ligand-free condition, resides primarily in the cytoplasm in the form of a hetero-oligomer with several heat shock proteins (hsps) and related molecules (2Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Upon hormone binding, GRα undergoes a conformational change, dissociates from the hsps and translocates into the nucleus depending on nuclear translocation signals 1 and 2 (3LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 4Tang Y. Ramakrishnan C. Thomas J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Biol.

Struct Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation signal 1 catalyzes rapid transport of the GR through the nuclear pore, employing the importin-mediated pathway, while nuclear translocation signal 2 contributes to a slower traffic via as yet unknown mechanisms (6Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). After entering the nucleus, GRα binds as a homodimer to specific DNA enhancer elements, the glucocorticoid response element (GREs) in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid target genes (2Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Promoter-bound GRα, via its two transactivational domains, attracts histone acetyltranferase co-activators and chromatin remodeling complexes, which help transmit signals from the activated ligand-bound GRα to the transcription initiation complex (7McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). After dissociating from DNA, GRα is exported into the cytoplasm, becoming again fully competent for ligand binding and signal transmission (8Hache R.J. Tse R. Reich T. Savory J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1432-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms regulate the nuclear export of GRα. The CRM1/exportin and the classic nuclear export signal (NES)mediated nuclear export machineries were postulated to be involved in GRα nuclear export, based on evidence that leptomycin B, an inhibitor of these systems, abrogated the rapid nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation and cytoplasmic retention of GRα; however, no classic NES(s) are evident in the GRα molecule (6Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The calcium-calreticulin-mediated, classic NES-independent nuclear export system, on the other hand, was also reported to be involved in the nuclear export and cytoplasmic retention of GRα (10Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Rastinejad F. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6286-6297Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Holaska J.M. Black B.E. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Leszyk J. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Reassembly of the GRα in the heterocomplex with hsps may not be sufficient to relocate GRα in the cytoplasm, since such complexes are also observed in the nucleus both before and after withdrawal of the ligand (8Hache R.J. Tse R. Reich T. Savory J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1432-1439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All three main domains of GRα, i.e. the amino-terminal, DNA-binding (DBD), and ligand-binding (LBD) domains, seem to be involved in nuclear export of this molecule. A serine residue at position 226 of GRα located in the amino-terminal domain is necessary for phosphorylation by the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase to facilitate the nuclear export of the GRα, while a 67-amino acid region in the DBD is sufficient to support calreticulin-mediated nuclear export (9Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 12Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Rastinejad F. Paschal B.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1749-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously reported that removal of the LBD from GRα resulted in constitutive localization of this peptide in the nucleus, indicating that the LBD also contributes to nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of GRα (13Kino T. Stauber R.H. Resau J.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 family proteins constitute a highly conserved family present in high abundance in all eukaryotic cells. They consist of nine isotypes from at least 7 distinct genes in vertebrates and regulate important biologic activities by directly binding to and altering the subcellular localization and/or stability of key molecules in several signaling cascades (14Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 15Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 16Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). For example, 14-3-3 proteins regulate the apoptosis pathway by binding BAD and affect the intracellular signaling of several growth factors, including insulin, by interacting with important molecules of their cascades, such as Raf-1, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and the forkhead transcription factors (17Zha J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, 14-3-3 proteins play a critical role in the progression/arrest of the cell cycle by binding to Cdc25C, Wee1, Cyclin B1, and possibly Chk1 (15Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 16Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Binding of 14-3-3 to Cdc25C segregates the latter into the cytoplasm and eliminates its phosphatase activity from the nucleus, thus inhibiting cells from progressing through the G2/M check-point (22Peng C.Y.

Their central third to fifth α-helices create a binding pocket for a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue, and the C-terminal seventh to ninth helices determine the specificity to target peptide motifs (25Yaffe M.B.

Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Recent research indicated that GRα formed complexes with 14-3-3 proteins and Raf-1 (29Widen C. Zilliacus J. Gustafsson J.A. Wikstrom A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39296-39301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although an early study reported that GRα LBD interacted with 14-3-3η in a ligand-dependent fashion in a yeast two-hybrid assay, a subsequent report indicated that GRα was associated with 14-3-3 proteins, both in the ligand-free and -bound conditions (29Widen C.

To further investigate the functional contribution of 14-3-3 to the biologic activity of GRα, we examined the subcellular localization and transactivation properties of GRα in a cell line used in its wild type 14-3-3σ replete and in its mutant type 14-3-3σ-deficient forms (31Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). We found that endogenous 14-3-3σ helps localize ligand-free GRα in the cytoplasm and contributes to nuclear export of GRα after withdrawal of ligand. In addition, endogenous 14-3-3σ suppresses ligand-activated GRα-induced transactivation of a glucocorticoid-responsive promoter. These results indicate that 14-3-3σ functions as a negative regulator of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway by shifting the subcellular circulation of this receptor toward the cytoplasm. Plasmids—pF25-hGRα, which expresses the green fluorescence protein (GFP)-fused human GRα under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was reported previously (13Kino T. Stauber R.H. Resau J.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). pRShGRα, which expresses the human GRα, was a kind gift from Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). pMMTV-Luc, which expresses luciferase under the control of the glucocorticoid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, was a generous gift from Dr. G. L. Hager (NCI, Bethesda, MD). pCDNA4-14-3-3σ and pEGFP-C1-14-3-3σ were constructed by subcloning the coding sequence of the human 14-3-3σ into pcDNA4/HisMax (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) in an in-frame fashion, respectively. pCDNA4-14-3-3σNES Mut, which expresses 14-3-3σ, defective in NES due to mutations replacing leucine at positions 243, 247, and 249 to alanine, was constructed by PCR-assisted mutagenesis using pCDNA4-14-3-3σ as a template. pEGFPC1-14-3-3σNES Mut was constructed using the same procedure employing pEGFP-C1-14-3-3σ as a template. pCDNA4-14-3-3σE182K, which expresses a 14-3-3σ mutant that may have a defective binding site for a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue due to a point mutation that replaces a glutamic acid at position 182 to lysine, was also constructed by PCR-assisted mutagenesis using the same template (26Rittinger K.

Cell Cultures and Transfections—Human colon cancer-derived HCT116 wild type (WT) and 14-3-3σ knock-out (KO) cells were kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) (31Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). These cells are defective in functional GRα (data not shown). They were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 1 μg/ml of streptomycin. They were transfected using Lipofectin™ with 1 μg/well of pF25-hGRα and/or 0.3 μg/well of 14-3-3σ-expressing plasmids for the study of GRα subcellular localization, as described previously (32Kino T. Kopp J.B. Chrousos G.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 75: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For reporter assays, 0.5 μg/well of pRShGRα and 0.3 μg/well of 14-3-3σ-expressing plasmids together with 1.0 μg/well of pMMTV-Luc and 0.3 μg/well of pSV40-β-Gal were used. Detection of Subcellular Localization of GFP-fused GRα and 14-3-3σ—Cells were plated on 25-mm dishes and were transfected as described above. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum with antibiotics. 48 h after transfection, the cells were analyzed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica DM IRB, Wetzlar, Germany) as described previously (13Kino T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3023-3029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 12-Bit black-and-white images were captured using a digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan). Image analysis and presentation was performed using the Openlab software (Improvision, Boston, MA). To examine the subcellular distribution of GFP-GRα, numbers of cells exhibiting five different distribution patterns from complete cytoplasmic distribution (C) to nuclear localization (N) were counted and percentages of each fraction to the total transfected cell number were calculated. For the experiments examining the nuclear export of GFPGRα, cells were exposed to 10–6m dexamethasone 48 h after the transfection. After culturing for 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS two times and placed in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Eight hours after replacement of the medium, numbers of cells that contained GFP-GRα mainly in the cytoplasm (subgroups corresponding to “C” and “N < C”) were counted, and the nuclear export of GRα was expressed as percentages of these numbers to the total transfected cell number. Reporter Assays—Cells were plated on six-well plates and transfected as described above. 24 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to the indicated amounts of dexamethasone. 48 h after transfection, the cell lysis buffer (Promega) was placed in each well, and the resulting cell lysates were harvested. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (32Kino T. Kopp J.B. Chrousos G.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 75: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All measurements of reporter gene activity were conducted in triplicate and all experiments were repeated at least three times. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast strain EGY48 (Clontech) was transformed with the lacZ reporter plasmid p8OP-LacZ, pLexA-GRαLBD or -GRβLBD, and the indicated pGAD424-14-3-3σ- or pB42AD-14-3-3η-related plasmids (34Finley R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). The cells were grown in a selective medium to the early stationary phase, permeabilized with CHCl3-SDS treatment, and β-galactosidase activity was measured in the cell suspension using Galactolight™ PLUS (Tropix, Bedford, MA), as described previously (33Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3023-3029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Statistical analysis was carried out by analysis of variance, followed by Student t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Endogenous 14-3-3σ Helps Non-ligand-bound GRα Remain in the Cytoplasm and Facilitates the Nuclear Export of GRα after Withdrawal of Dexamethasone—To investigate a role of 14-3-3 family proteins on the subcellular localization and transactivation activity of GRα, we employed wild type versus mutant HCT116 cells, in which both alleles of the 14-3-3σ gene were destroyed by homologous recombination (31Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). We first tested the subcellular localization of GFP-GRα in the absence of ligand. GFP-GRα was mainly located in the cytoplasm in the HCT116 WT cells, while substantial amounts of GFP-GRα were found in the nucleus in the 14-3-3σ KO cells (Fig. 1A). To determine this, we examined multiple cells and graded them into five distribution patterns from complete cytoplasmic distribution (C) to complete nuclear localization (N) (Fig. 1B). Using this analysis, HCT116 WT cells had unliganded GFPGRα mainly in the cytoplasm, while KO cells had more in the nucleus, indicating that endogenous 14-3-3σ retained GFPGRα in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand. We also tested nuclear translocation of GFP-GRα in WT cells and KO cells in which 14-3-3σ was supplemented by the transfected expressing plasmid. GFP-GRα entered the nucleus in 10–20 min in response to 10–6m dexamethasone in both cell types, indicating that the mechanism supporting the nuclear translocation of GRα was intact in these cells (data not shown). We next examined whether 14-3-3σ plays a role in the nuclear export of GRα after withdrawal of ligand. Eight hours after removing 10–6m dexamethasone from the medium, 32% of HCT116 WT cells had GFP-GRα in the cytoplasm, while almost all KO cells still retained it in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). When the wild type 14-3-3σ was transfected in KO cells, 22% of the cells had GFP-GRα in the cytoplasm, indicating that transfected 14-3-3σ helped GRα relocate into the cytoplasm after removal of dexamethasone. Endogenous 14-3-3σ Suppresses the Transcriptional Activity of GRα—We then examined the transactivation activity of GRα stimulated with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone in WT and KO cells (Fig. 2). GRα stimulated the MMTV promoter in response to 10–6m dexamethasone by about 80- and 300-fold in WT cells and KO cells, respectively. The dexamethasone titration curve was shifted upward in the latter cells. Transfection of wild type 14-3-3σ partially reversed this change in KO cells. The EC50 (mean ± S.E.: in mm) was 4.01 ± 0.33 and 6.46 ± 1.04 in WT and KO cells, respectively (p > 0.10), whereas the B max (mean ± S.E.: × 10–2 relative luminescence unit) was 9.11 ± 0.89 and 28.01 ± 1.19, respectively (p < 0.001). Transfection of 14-3-3σ partially reversed this change in KO cells. EC50 values were similar in transfected and KO cells (p > 0.30), while the B max in the transfected cells was significantly lower than in KO cells (p < 0.01). These results indicated that endogenous 14-3-3σ functions as a negative regulator of GRα-induced transactivation. The C-terminal Half of 14-3-3σ Interacts with the GRα LBD in a Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—We next examined the interaction of GRα and 14-3-3σ in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 3A). Administration of dexamethasone stimulated the LexA-DBDGRαLBD-induced, but not LexA-GRβLBD-induced, β-galactosidase activity by about 3-fold in the EGY48 yeast strain. Co-expression of GAL4-AD fusions of the full-length or the COOH-terminal half of 14-3-3σ enhanced β-galactosidase activity induced by LexA-DBD-GRαLBD in a partially dexamethasone-dependent fashion, whereas it did not affect the activity of LexA-DBD-GRβ LBD. These results indicated that GRα LBD interacted with the COOH-terminal half of 14-3-3σ in a partially ligand-dependent fashion, while GRβ LBD did not. No increase of β-galactosidase activity was observed in the transformed yeast cells, when they were cultured in galactose-deficient medium that did not support the expression of bait proteins (data not shown). This result indicated that expression of GAL4-AD-fused 14-3-3σs did not influence basal promoter activity. We obtained similar results using a plasmid expressing the LexA-DBD fusions of the full-length GRα (data not shown). Our results showed that 14-3-3σ interacts with GRα in the absence of dexamethasone as well as in its presence. In our system, 14-3-3η interacted with the GRα LBD in the absence of dexamethasone and the interaction was enhanced in its presence (Fig. 3B). 14-3-3η fragments, which contained the region from 210 to 240 that corresponds to the ninth α-helix, supported the binding to GRα LBD. Destruction of 14-3-3σ NES Diminishes the Ability of This Protein to Promote Cytoplasmic Retention/Nuclear Export of GRα and Suppression of GRα Transactivation—14-3-3 proteins may help translocate their partner proteins into the cytoplasm via their classic NES located in their ninth α-helix (16Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 26Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the contribution of 14-3-3σ NES on the cytoplasmic retention of GRα, by constructing a plasmid expressing a 14-3-3σ mutant (14-3-3σNES Mut), in which the NES was destroyed by clustered mutations, as a fusion with EGFP (26Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The EGFP-fused wild type 14-3-3σ was mainly located in the cytoplasm, while a small fraction of this fusion protein was also observed in the nucleus (Fig. 4A). The EGFP-14-3-3σNES Mut, on the other hand, was distributed more in the nucleus, indicating that the introduced mutations inactivated the NES. Co-expression of 14-3-3σNES Mut did not change the distribution of unliganded GFP-GRα, in contrast to the wild type 14-3-3σ (Fig. 4B). We next examined the effect of this mutant on the nuclear export of GFP-GRα after withdrawal of dexamethasone. Supplementation of the wild type 14-3-3σ brought GFP-GRα into the cytoplasm in 23% of KO cells, while expression of 14-3-3σNES Mut did not change the nuclear export of this receptor (Fig. 4C). In a functional reporter assay, 14-3-3σNES Mut did not suppress GRα-induced transactivation of the MMTV promoter in a dexamethasone titration curve (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that 14-3-3σ retained the ligand-free GFP-GRα in the cytoplasm and helped it through its NES to redistribute in the cytoplasm after the withdrawal of dexamethasone. Since the destruction of NES also abolished the suppressive effect of 14-3-3σ on GRα transactivation, it is possible that 14-3-3σ suppressed GRα-induced transcriptional activity by segregating GRα away from the nucleus. The Phosphopeptide Binding Activity of 14-3-3σ May Not Be Necessary for Cytoplasmic Retention of GFP-GRα and Suppression of GRα-dependent Transactivation—Since a previous publication indicated that 14-3-3 forms a complex with GRα together with its partner protein Raf-1, we employed a 14-3-3σE182K mutant, to examine whether 14-3-3 partner proteins might contribute to the action of 14-3-3σ on the activity of GRα (29Widen C. Zilliacus J. Gustafsson J.A. Wikstrom A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39296-39301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This mutation corresponds to the replacement of a glutamic acid at 180 by a lysine in Drosophila 14-3-3ϵ that inactivates the binding activity of this protein to Raf-1 because of destruction of the phosphopeptide-binding pocket (26Rittinger K. Budman J. Xu J. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). 14-3-3σE182K was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm similarly to the wild type 14-3-3σ (Fig. 5A). 14-3-3σE182K preserved property of the wild type 14-3-3σ on the subcellular distribution and transactivation activity of GRα (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that association of 14-3-3σ to partner proteins, such as Raf-1, may not be necessary for its effect on these GRα activities. GRα forms heterocomplexes with 14-3-3 and its partner protein Raf-1 in the cytoplasmic fraction of adrenalectomized rat liver shown by immunoaffinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (29Widen C. Zilliacus J. Gustafsson J.A. Wikstrom A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39296-39301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although these complexes were observed in the absence of ligand, the interaction of constituent molecules was further strengthened by the presence of the hormone. Association of GRα with one of the 14-3-3 proteins, 14-3-3η, was also found in a yeast two-hybrid screening, using the GRα LBD as a bait (30Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above reports, we examined the functional effect of 14-3-3 on the activity of GRα by employing wild type versus mutant HCT116 cells, in which both alleles of the 14-3-3σ gene were destroyed by homologous recombination (31Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). We found that endogenous 14-3-3σ helped GFP-GRα remain in the cytoplasm in the absence of dexamethasone and supported the nuclear export of GFP-GRα after withdrawal of dexamethasone via its NES. 14-3-3σ, thus, appeared to function as an “attached” partner NES, a finding that might explain the results of previous reports demonstrating that the nuclear export of GRα is sensitive to leptomycin B, even though the GRα molecule does not contain a classic NES (6Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We previously reported that deletion of the GRα LBD from GRα localized this GRα fragment in the nucleus (13Kino T. Stauber R.H. Resau J.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since 14-3-3σ interacts with the LBD, a defect in binding of this domain to 14-3-3σ may explain its particular subcellular distribution. We also demonstrated that endogenous 14-3-3σ functioned as a negative regulator of GRα-induced transactivation. This activity correlated with the ability of 14-3-3σ to localize unliganded GFP-GRα in the cytoplasm, in the experiment employing the 14-3-3σ mutants NES Mut and E182K. Therefore, it is likely that 14-3-3σ suppresses GRα-induced transactivation by shifting intracellular circulation of GRα toward the cytoplasm, possibly by reducing the chance of ligand-bound GRα to interact with GREs, steroid hormone receptor co-activators, and other related specific or general transcription factors in the nucleus. For instance, GRα dynamically interacts with GREs in living cells, binding to and dissociating from them in the order of seconds (35Fletcher T.M. Ryu B.W. Baumann C.T. Warren B.S. Fragoso G. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In this situation, the drive created by 14-3-3σ, which shifts GRα toward the cytoplasm, may reduce the probability of GRα binding to GREs and, hence, may reduce its transcriptional activity. A similar effect was also observed in a recent report, which showed that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase suppressed GRα-induced transactivation by phosphorylating serine 216 and facilitating its nuclear export (9Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A previous report demonstrated that overexpressed 14-3-3η enhanced GRα-induced transactivation of a synthetic GRE-containing heterologous promoter in African monkey kidney-derived COS7 cells, while we showed that endogenous 14-3-3σ suppressed GRα transactivation in HCT116 cells (30Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may result from differences in the experimental systems employed, including the type of cell lines, the different 14-3-3 isoforms and overexpression versus normal expression versus knock-out of 14-3-3. Indeed, overexpression of a protein may sometimes cause artificial effects (37Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8155-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We examined 14-3-3 “loss of function” by employing the KO cells and showed that the physiologic activity of 14-3-3σ is that of a negative regulator of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway. We demonstrated that the GRα LBD interacts with 14-3-3σ as well as η in a partially ligand-dependent fashion. A previous report indicated that this domain of GRα interacted with 14-3-3η in an absolutely ligand-dependent fashion in the same LexA yeast two-hybrid system (30Wakui H. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J. Zilliacus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8153-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Differences in the GRα fragments employed or yeast strains used in the assay might have led to the different results. Since a recent report also demonstrated partial ligand-dependent interaction between GRα and 14-3-3 in a semiquantitative coimmunoprecipitation assay, it is likely that GRα and 14-3-3 proteins associate with each other in the absence of ligand. In contrast to the GRα LBD, the GRβ “LBD” did not interact with 14-3-3σ at all. Since GRβ is constitutively located in the nucleus, the inability of GRβ to interact with 14-3-3σ might, to some extent, contribute to its constitutive nuclear localization (13Kino T. Stauber R.H.

Our results employing 14-3-3σE182K suggest that the association of known partner proteins with 14-3-3σ may not be necessary for this molecule to influence the subcellular localization of GRα and the suppression of its transactivation. However, an E180K mutation in Drosophila 14-3-3ϵ, which corresponds to the E182K mutation in human 14-3-3σ, abolishes the interaction of this protein with Raf-1 and BAD, but preserves that with IRS-1, indicating that the E182K mutation in 14-3-3σ might not completely exclude the interaction of this 14-3-3 subtype with all partner proteins (26Rittinger K.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above-indicated evidence, about half of the 14-3-3-partner proteins use a different phosphopeptide-binding motif to interact with 14-3-3, suggesting that a single surface of 14-3-3σ in the phosphopeptide-binding pocket, which the E182K mutation destroys, may not support its association generically with all partner proteins. Further experiments are required to address this issue. In summary, endogenous 14-3-3σ functions as a negative regulator of GRα-induced transactivation, most likely by shifting the subcellular distribution and circulation of GRα toward the cytoplasm. These results indicate that change in the intracellular concentration as well as the subcellular distribution of 14-3-3σ may contribute to the altered sensitivity of tissues to glucocorticoids seen in several physiologic and pathologic conditions (1Kino T. Chrousos G.P. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since 14-3-3 proteins are involved in a broad array of cellular activities, such as cell cycle progression, growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, these activities might indirectly influence the transcriptional activity of GRα, by changing the availability of 14-3-3 and/or altering partner proteins associated with 14-3-3. On the other hand, the opposite may be true. Ligand-bound GRα may influence these cellular processes by segregating and/or influencing 14-3-3 and partner molecules. We thank Drs. R. M. Evans and G. L. Hager for providing their plasmids and K. Zachman, Anton Alatsatianos, and Ly Chheng for their superb technical assistance."

Small molecule antivirals for the treatment of HPV infections do not currently exist.

Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the viral genome in infected cells of the basal layer is essential for the viral life cycle and the ensuing pathology. Maintenance of the HPV episome in primary keratinocyte cultures depends on the function of E1 and E2, a 3′-5′ helicase (8Sverdrup F. Myers G. Myers G. Baker C. Munger K. Sverdrup F. McBride A. Bernard H.-U. Human Papillomaviruses. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1997: 37-53Google Scholar) and a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein (9McBride A. Myers G. Myers G. Baker C.

Intervirology. 1994; 37: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HPV DNA replication is initiated by the co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to specific DNA sequences within the viral origin (11Yang L. Li R. Mohr I. Clark R. Botchan M.R.

Any of the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions occurring at the origin could in principle be targeted for the development of small molecule antivirals to treat HPV infections. In reality, however, not all targets are readily amenable to inhibition by small molecules. Protein interactions for example have been considered difficult to inhibit because they often involve large surfaces devoid of small molecule binding pockets (27Way J.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Gadek T.R. Nicholas J.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the absence of structural information, one often has to rely on screening large compound collections to determine whether a protein can be antagonized by small molecules and for the identification of lead inhibitors. Here we present a class of small molecules that bind reversibly to the E2 transactivation domain and inhibit the E1-E2 protein interaction in vitro and in vivo. The chemical features and synthetic procedures for these molecules will be described elsewhere. 2C. Yoakim, W. W. Ogilvie, N. Goudreau, J. Naud, B. Haché, J. A. O'Meara, M. G. Cordingley, J.

Inhibitor 3 was made by similar procedures using the appropriate indandione, benzaldehyde, and maleimide fragments. 4-Fluoro-7-nitrobenzofurazan was purchased from Aldrich. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid used for expression of HPV11 E2 TAD (amino acids 2–201) fused at its N terminus to a 6-histidine tag (amino acid sequence MGHHHHHH) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding the TAD and the tag in pET28b (Novagen). The plasmid to express CRPV E2 by in vitro transcription/translation was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment corresponding to nucleotides 3107–4287 of the CRPV genome in plasmid pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The plasmid containing the CRPV origin of replication was constructed by inserting a PstI restriction fragment corresponding to nucleotides 192–7111 of CRPV into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Plasmids pOri-SEAP and pGAL4-SEAP encoding, respectively, the HPV11 origin and five GAL4-binding sites upstream of secreted alkaline phosphatase were constructed by inserting a PCR fragment spanning nucleotides 7884–61 of the HPV11 genome or the five GAL4-binding sites from pG5CAT (Clontech) into pSEAP2-Basic (Clontech). The plasmid encoding E1 fused to the transactivation domain of HSV VP16 (pE1-VP16) was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment encoding E1 into pVP16 (Clontech). HPV/CRPV E2 chimeras were constructed by PCR-mediated ligation as described previously (29Darveau A. Pelletier A. Perreault J.

The TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used for in vitro translation of E1 and E2 as described (20Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5282-5293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E1-E2-Ori Complex Formation and Related Assays—E1-E2-ori complex formation was monitored essentially as described previously (31White P.W. Pelletier A. Brault K. Titolo S. Welchner E. Thauvette L. Fazekas M. Cordingley M.G. Archambault J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22426-22438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, all E1-E2-ori complex formation assays were performed with purified E2- and E1-containing nuclear extracts. E1-containing nuclear extracts were titrated in the assay and used at a concentration yielding 70% maximal activity. Wells without E1 or E2 served as negative controls. In assays performed with in vitro translated E2, 2 μl of translation reaction was used per binding reaction. In this case, wells containing E2 but no E1 were used as negative controls, because the reticulocyte lysate present from the translation reaction decreased background signal. An assay to detect binding of E2 to the origin in the absence of E1 was carried out in a similar manner using SPA beads linked to anti-mouse IgG and the anti-E2 monoclonal antibody 53.7E8 raised against full-length HPV11 E2. A similar assay to detect binding of SV40 large T antigen to its cognate origin was carried out using 100 ng of purified large T antigen and an SV40 ori probe encompassing nucleotides 5191–31 of the SV40 genome. This probe was generated by PCR using pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences), which contains the SV40 ori, and primers 5′-GCC CCT AAC TCC GCC CAT CCC GC-3′ and 5′-ACC AGA CCG CCA CGG CTT ACG GC-3′. Detection was performed using the monoclonal antibody PAb 101 (32Gurney E.G. Harrison R.O. Fenno J. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 752-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein A-SPA beads. For assays using in vitro translated CRPV E2 proteins or HPV11/CRPV E2 chimeras containing the CRPV DNA binding domain, a radiolabeled probe for the CRPV origin was used. A modified detection procedure was used for the experiment in Fig. 6 to compensate for the weaker signal obtained in assays with proteins containing the CRPV DNA binding domain. After the 1-h binding reaction, the mixture was transferred to HVB filter plates (Whatman) to which an SPA bead-E1 antibody suspension had been added previously. After incubating the mixture for 1 h with slight shaking, bead-bound protein-DNA complexes were washed by vacuum filtration, which removed the red-colored reticulocyte lysate that slightly quenches detection and also reduced background because unbound probe was washed away. Scintillation fluid was then added (Microscint 20 (Packard Instrument Co.), 150 μl per well), and the plates were shaken vigorously for several minutes and counted using a Topcount NXT scintillation detector (Packard Instrument Co.). Data Analysis—IC50 (where IC50 is 50% inhibitory concentration) values were determined by a non-linear least square regression fitting of the inhibition data using the program SAS (software release 6.12, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) or GraFit 5.03 (Erithicus Software Ltd.). E1-E2 ELISA—PBS (Invitrogen) was used as the buffer for all steps, with additions as noted. Wash buffer contained PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. 96-Well plates (Nunc Immunoplates) were coated overnight at 4 °C using the anti-E2 monoclonal antibody 53.7E8 (1 μg in 100 μl/well). Wells were blocked at room temperature with 300 μl of PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin. Subsequent steps were performed at room temperature on a plate shaker (gentle setting) in a total volume of 100 μl, in PBS supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm EDTA. After blocking, the plates were washed and incubated with 25 ng of purified E2 or 4 μl of in vitro translated E2. Negative controls lacked E2 (assays with purified E2) or E1 (assays with in vitro translated E2). After 1.5 h, plates were washed, and solutions containing test inhibitors (if used) and 0.5 μl of E1-containing nuclear extract were added. Buffer for this step contained 6% Me2SO. After 2 h, bound E1 was detected by successive incubations with the same anti-E1 serum used in the E1-E2-DNA complex formation assay and then with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Antibody buffers were further supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20. After washing, horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using o-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Quenching Experiments—Fluorescence spectra were acquired using an SLM Aminco 8100 spectrometer with a neutral density filter in place and excitation and emission slits set to 4. Samples of proteins at 400 nm were excited at 280 nm, and the emission intensity was recorded over the range from 300 to 380 nm. For each protein/inhibitor combination, spectra were acquired from three individually prepared 0.5-ml samples. Signals from the three replicates were averaged, and for each wavelength, the displayed signal is the average from a 3 nm range. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The calorimetry experiment was carried out using the VP-ITC microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc.) at a temperature of 25 °C. Purified His-tagged HPV11 TAD was exchanged into an aqueous buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm TCEP, plus 2% Me2SO. Inhibitor 2 was diluted from a Me2SO stock solution to give a solution at 200 μm in the same buffer/Me2SO mixture. Both solutions were degassed, and then the protein solution was passed through a 0.22-μm syringe filter, and the inhibitor solution was spun in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at maximum speed, to remove any particulate matter. The concentration of the protein solution after filtration was determined to be 10.0 μm by absorbance at 280 nm (based on a predicted molar extinction coefficient of 4.9 × 104). An initial 4-μl injection was followed by a series of 8-μl injections at a spacing of 240 s. Data were fit using the software Origin (version 5.0, Microcal Inc.), to a one-binding site model after subtraction of the heat of dilution determined by the average value at late injections. Reversibility of Inhibition—Reversibility of inhibition was monitored using a modified version of the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay described above. E2 (23 ng/μl) was mixed with inhibitor in assay buffer at a concentration equal to or greater than the IC50. The mixture was then diluted 19-fold and combined with E1 and radiolabeled probe such that the overall dilution of inhibitor was 32-fold. Controls without inhibitor were run in parallel and used as the reference for calculation of inhibition. The final concentration of E2 was 5-fold higher in preincubation assays (10 versus 2 nm) to compensate for the significant decrease in signal observed on preincubation of E2. Transient HPV DNA Replication Assay—Transient HPV DNA replication was performed as described previously (20Titolo S. Pelletier A. Sauve F. Brault K. Wardrop E. White P.W. Amin A. Cordingley M.G.

Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Amount of replicated HPV DNA (pN9) was quantified by exposure on a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to the amplified E1 signal. When applicable, inhibitors were added to the culture medium after transfection in a final concentration of 1% Me2SO. Each compound concentration was tested in quadruplicate. Cellular DNA replication was measured using the colorimetric cell proliferation ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science). Cellular E1-E2 Interaction Assay—CHO-K1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Roche Applied Science) with three plasmids encoding, respectively, E1-VP16 (2.5 μg), E2 (250 ng), and a SEAP reporter under the control of the minimal origin of DNA replication of HPV11 (62.5 ng). 3 h post-transfection, cells were treated with trypsin and seeded in 96-well plates (20 × 103 cells/well). When applicable, inhibitors were added to the culture medium after transfection in a final concentration of 1% Me2SO. The amount of SEAP in the culture medium was measured by chemiluminescence 48 h post-transfection using the Tropix Phospha-Light System (Applied Biosystems) according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Each condition was performed in duplicate, which typically varied by less than 10%. As a control for specificity, inhibitors were also tested on cells transfected with two plasmids encoding, respectively, an unrelated SEAP reporter (250 ng of pGAL4-SEAP) and the unrelated transactivator GAL4-VP16 (2.5 μg of pM3-VP16; Clontech) composed of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the activation domain of VP16. Identification of a Class of Small Molecules That Inhibit the Co-operative Binding of HPV11 E1 and E2 to the Origin—Cooperative binding of E1 and E2 to the viral origin is an essential step in the initiation of HPV DNA replication. To identify inhibitors of this process, a high throughput screening assay was developed that measures the binding of E1 and E2 to 33P-radiolabeled origin DNA. Binding of E1 to the origin probe was detected by immuno-capture of E1-DNA complexes using an anti-E1 antibody coupled to scintillation proximity assay (34Titolo S. Brault K Majewski J. White P.W. Archambault J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5178-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) beads (Fig. 1A). Binding reactions were performed in the presence of an excess of unlabeled nonspecific competitor DNA to ensure that binding of E1 to the origin probe was dependent on its association with E2. Fig. 1B shows that a strong signal was detected only when E1 and E2 were added to the reaction. This signal was dependent on the association of E1 with E2 because it was reduced to background levels by the E39A amino acid substitution in E2 that abrogates E1 binding (36Cooper C.S. Upmeyer S.N. Winokur P.L. Virology. 1998; 241: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Ferguson M.K. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast the I73A substitution, which affects primarily the transactivation function of E2 and not its ability to bind to E1 (37Ferguson M.K. Botchan M.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4193-4199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sakai H. Yasugi T. Benson J.D. Dowhanick J.J. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had little effect. Screening of our corporate compound collection with this assay yielded inhibitor 1 shown in Fig. 2. Modification of this inhibitor led to more potent compounds2 such as 2 and 3 (Fig. 2). These three compounds were inactive or only weakly active in a mechanistically related SPA that measures binding of SV40 large T antigen to its cognate origin (Fig. 2), demonstrating that they do not interfere with the scintillation proximity detection procedure or bind promiscuously to DNA or protein. Inhibitors 1-3 were also active against E1 and E2 from HPV6 (Fig. 2), the most prevalent low risk anogenital type, albeit at a 10–30-fold lower potency than against the HPV11 proteins. The E1-E2 Protein Interaction Is the Target of Inhibition— Co-operative binding of E1 and E2 to DNA involves the interaction of both proteins with each other and with DNA. The inhibitors were found to be inactive or only weakly active in assays that measure the binding of E2 to DNA (Fig. 2). Compound 1 was also inactive at inhibiting the helicase activity of E1 (IC50 > 100 μm). Hence this class of compounds does not affect the binding of either E1 or E2 to DNA. These results suggested that the E1-E2 protein interaction might be the target of inhibition. This hypothesis was tested using an ELISA. The E2 protein used in this assay was either purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or obtained by in vitro translation; both sources yielded similar results. Binding of recombinant E1 to immobilized E2 was detected using an anti-E1 antiserum followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. As seen in Fig. 3A, the signal was dependent on the interaction of E1 with E2 because it was reduced by the E39A substitution in E2. As anticipated, the I73A substitution had little effect. As can be seen in Fig. 3, B and C, all three compounds inhibited binding of E1 to E2 with potency comparable with that measured in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay. The compounds inhibited the E1-E2 interaction regardless of whether the assay was performed with hexameric E1 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or with monomeric E1 made by in vitro translation (data not shown). Thus the molecular target of these inhibitors is the E1-E2 protein interaction. Inhibitors Bind to the Transactivation Domain of E2—Having found that inhibitor 1 and its derivatives antagonize the E1-E2 protein interaction, we then wished to determine to which protein these compounds were binding. First, we investigated whether addition of compound 2 had any effect on the spectroscopic behavior of either E1 or E2. Fluorescent amino acids such as tryptophan are often found in or close to binding pockets, and the binding of ligands to such sites has been shown to perturb protein fluorescence in some cases (39Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Compound 2 was titrated into solutions of 400 nm E1 or E2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Although a slight effect was observed on the fluorescence of E1, a much greater level of quenching was observed for E2, consistent with this compound binding to E2. The slight effect observed on E1 and the lack of saturation for E2 at high compound concentrations could be explained by weak nonspecific binding of compound 2 to other protein sites, reminiscent of the low level of activity observed in the SV40 T antigen DNA binding assay (Fig. 2). E2 can be divided into an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD, approximately amino acids 1–200) and a C-terminal DNA binding/dimerization domain (DBD, the last 100 amino acids), separated by a 50–70-amino acid “hinge” with little predicted secondary structure (9McBride A. Myers G. Myers G. Baker C. Munger K. Sverdrup F. McBride A. Bernard H.-U. Human Papillomaviruses. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1997: 54-73Google Scholar). Because for HPV11 it is known that the TAD, but not the DBD, interacts with E1 (16Berg M. Stenlund A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3853-3863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sanders C.M. Stenlund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23689-23699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we repeated the titration with a GST fusion protein encoding the E2 TAD, as well as with GST itself as a negative control (Fig. 4, C and D). The results clearly indicated saturable binding of 2 to the GST-TAD but not to GST, indicating that the compound binds to the TAD. Similar results were also obtained with a polyhistidine-tagged version of the E2 TAD (data not shown). Next, we quantified the binding of inhibitor 2 to a polyhistidine-tagged TAD using isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 5). A dissociation constant of 230 nm was obtained by nonlinear regression, in good agreement with the IC50 obtained in the E1-E2-ori complex formation assay. The observed 2:1 stoichiometry is consistent with the formation of a 1:1 inhibitor-protein complex, because compound 2 is racemic, and it has been observed for other compounds in this series that only one of the two enantiomers is active (see below). 3P.

Collectively, the results presented above provide strong evidence that this class of inhibitor antagonizes the E1-E2 protein interaction by binding to the E2 TAD. Functional Evidence That the E2 TAD Is the Target of Inhibition—During the course of this study we found that in vitro translated CRPV E2 can bind co-operatively with purified HPV11 E1 to either the HPV11 or CRPV origins, albeit weakly. CRPV E2, however, was found to be resistant to inhibition by compound 2 (Fig. 6), perhaps not surprisingly given the low level of amino acid identity between the TAD of HPV11 and that of CRPV. Similarly, we found that the inhibitors are inactive against the E2 protein of the high risk HPV types 16, 18, and 31 (data not shown), which at the amino acid level are only 41–50% identical to HPV11 E2. We made use of the observation that some E2 types are resistant to inhibition to substantiate the finding that the TAD is indeed the target of the inhibitors. Specifi"

In skeletal muscle, the principal CK isoform is the cytosolic isoform, MM-CK, a homodimer mainly present as a soluble protein in the cytosol and bound to the myofibrillar M- and I-bands (13Wegmann G.

Skeletal muscle also contains an additional mitochondrial CK isoform (ScCKmit), which amounts to 1–10% of the total CK activity depending on the type of muscle fiber (26Wyss M. Smeitink J.

By pharmacological inhibition of the CK circuit, it has been demonstrated that an increase in AK-mediated phosphotransfer may compensate for the loss of CK-activity (17Dzeja P.P. Zeleznikar R.J.

Likewise, in skeletal muscles carrying a null mutation in either the M-CK or AK1 gene, leading to complete lack of corresponding protein expression and activity, an adaptive rewiring of flux through the remaining intact phosphotransfer circuit occurs (6Janssen E.

Although progress has been made in our understanding of individual phosphotransfer reactions, the consequences of combined deletion of major AK and CK isoforms remain unknown. Here, we report on the effects deleting both the AK1 and M-CK proteins in a single cell-type skeletal muscle fiber of a double knock-out mouse. Use of this model provides us with a unique opportunity to assess the significance of the activities of mitochondrial CK, glycolytic enzymes, and NDPK-mediated phosphotransfer reactions in muscle physiology and metabolism. Monitoring intracellular phosphotransfer kinetics by [18O]phosphoryl labeling revealed that lack of AK1 and M-CK resulted in a serious impairment of communication between ATP-generating and ATP-consuming cellular sites. As a consequence, AK1/M-CK-deficient muscles had a reduced ability to sustain the dynamic fluctuations in ATP/ADP/AMP nucleotide metabolism and overall cellular ATP turnover during functional load despite increased high energy phosphoryl flux through alternative glycolytic and guanylate phosphotransfer pathways. These data provide further evidence for the existence of a fully integrated high energy phosphoryl transfer system with a high degree of functional plasticity required for optimal muscle energetics. Generation of M-CK/AK1-deficient Mice—Gene-targeted AK1-deficient mice were derived from mouse embryonic stem cells carrying a replacement mutation in the AK1 gene. Creatine kinase knock-out mice were derived from embryonic stem cells carrying a replacement mutation in the M-CK gene. Cohorts of AK1 –/– and M-CK –/– animals were generated and maintained as previously described (24van Deursen J. Heerschap A. Oerlemans F. Ruitenbeek W. Jap P. ter Laak H. Wieringa B.

AK1 and M-CK knock-out mice were cross-bred to obtain animals that were heterozygous for both AK1 and M-CK alleles, and these animals were subsequently mated to obtain homozygous double mutants. Genotyping for wild-type and mutant AK1 and M-CK alleles was performed using a PCR assay as described previously (6Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S.

Lack of AK1 and M-CK protein activity was confirmed by Western blot and zymogram analysis. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles from age matched homozygous M-CK/AK1-deficient (MAK=/=) and wild-type control animals also having a 50–50% C57BL/6 × 129/Ola-mixed inbred background were used for all of the studies. The investigation conformed to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Dutch Council and the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nijmegen and the Mayo Clinic. High energy Phosphoryl Transfer—ATP turnover and phosphoryl flux through AK, CK, and glycolytic systems were measured in intact gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus (GPS) muscle complex using the [18O]phosphoryl labeling technique (16Zeleznikar R.J.

Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Beuthanasia D) (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and injected with heparin (50 units of intraperitoneal) prior to muscle dissection. Isolated mouse GPS muscle was preincubated for 12 min at room temperature in a medium containing (in mm) 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 20 HEPES, 0.05 EDTA, 5 glucose, and 24 NaHCO3 (pH 7.4). The muscle complex was then rapidly transferred into a medium enriched with 30% 18O-water (Isotec Inc.) and paced at 2 Hz exactly as described previously (6Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F.

After 3 min of 18O labeling, muscles were freeze-clamped using liquid N2 and extracted in a solution containing 0.6 m HClO4 and 1 mm EDTA. Protein content was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cellular ATP, ADP, GTP, GDP, inorganic phosphate, creatine phosphate (CrP), and glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) were purified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (17Dzeja P.P.

To obtain information on basal levels and turnover rates of phosphoryl-containing metabolites, isolated mouse GPS muscle was treated identically but without pacing. Samples containing phosphoryls of γ-ATP, β-ATP, β-ADP, γ-GTP, β-GTP, β-GDP, inorganic phosphate, and CrP as glycerol 3-phosphate were converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives. 18O enrichment of phosphoryls in glycerol 3-phosphates was determined with a Hewlett-Packard 5980B gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (6Janssen E.

Muscle inorganic phosphate level was determined using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes). Zymogram Analysis and Enzyme Activity—Homogenates from freshly excised GPS muscles (10% w/v) were prepared in SETH buffer (in mm: 250 sucrose, 2 EDTA, 10 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) at 4 °C. GPS extracts were diluted 1:1 in 30 mm Na3PO4 buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% v/v Triton X-100, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Muscle extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 20 min at 11,000 × g, and an aliquot (1–5 μl) was applied to agarose gels (Alameda, CA).

Western Blot Analysis—Skeletal muscles were excised, pulverized with a mortar and pestle using liquid N2, and extracted in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 to which a complete protease inhibitor mixture was added. Extracts were centrifuged (10 min, 8000 × g, 4 °C), and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels before being electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. M-CK and AK1 proteins were detected using antibodies raised against chicken M-CK (44Wallimann T. Moser H. Eppenberger H.M. J. Muscle Res.

Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR films. Actomyosin Contraction—Actomyosin contraction was measured using an established superprecipitation method (45Honig C.R. Am. J.

Excised femoral quadriceps muscles (muscles from two mice combined) were pulverized with mortar and pestle using liquid N2 and extracted in a buffer containing 0.6 m KCl, 0.04 m NaHCO3, 0.01 m Na2CO3, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and a complete protease inhibitor mixture. Extracts were homogenized (3 × 5 s) with a blender (Polytron), maintained at 4 °C for 10–15 min, and centrifuged (30 min, 9500 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was gently diluted with 10 volumes of ice-cold water containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and maintained at 4 °C for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged (15 min, 7000 × g,4 °C), and the precipitate dissolved in a buffer containing 0.6 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and the complete protease inhibitor mixture. Skeletal muscle actomyosin was stored at –20 °C after mixing with an equal volume of glycerol. Superprecipitation was measured in a buffer containing 0.8 mg/ml skeletal muscle actomyosin, 0.8 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at 25 °C. The change in absorbance at 660 nm was followed after the addition of ADP (0.2 or 2 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP; 2 mm), CrP (2.0 mm), or ATP (2 mm). Three measurements for each genotype (muscles from 2 mice/sample combined) were performed and statistically compared. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test for unpaired samples was used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Generation of M-CK/AK1 Double Gene Knock-out Mice—To generate a mouse model lacking cytosolic AK1 and M-CK isoforms, single mutant animals carrying a homozygous null mutation in the AK1 gene (6Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Oerlemans F. Simonetti A.W. Heerschap A. de Haan A. Rush P.S. Terjung R.R. Wieringa B. Terzic A.

Subsequent cross-breeding of the F1 males and females with the heterozygous M-CK +/–/AK1 +/– genotype gave litter with normal size. Among an offspring of 175 pups analyzed, 9 animals were M-CK–/– and AK1–/– (hereon referred to as MAK=/=), indicating normal Mendelian segregation (1 in 16 expected). Zymogram and Western blot analysis confirmed complete absence of M-CK and AK1 protein and enzymatic activity in these animals (Fig. 1). MAK=/= mice showed no overt abnormalities, bred normally when maintained as a separate lineage over multiple (now >6) generations, and had normal life expectancy. Cellular Energetics in Resting and Contracting MAK =/= Muscle—Genetic deletion of M-CK and AK1 produced a dramatic reduction in the amount of 18O labeling of the pools of CrP, β-ATP, and β-ADP in skeletal muscle. Compared with wild type, 18O-metabolic labeling of CrP was decreased from 8.8 ± 0.4 to 5.4 ± 0.2% in MAK=/= resting non-contracting muscle, a reduction of 39% (p < 0.05, n = 6) (Fig. 2A). Stimulation of contractile activity further aggravated the difference in metabolic labeling of CrP between wild-type and mutant muscles, changing from 17.2 ± 1.2% in wild-type to 8.0 ± 0.5% in knock-out muscle (p < 0.05, n = 6), a reduction of 54% (Fig. 2A). On average, muscle stimulation at 2 Hz increased 18O labeling of CrP by 95% in wild type but gave only a 49% elevation in MAK=/= mutant muscle. This increase in [18O]CrP labeling despite the absence of M-CK could be attribu"

The method is based on the site-directed incorporation of a streptavidin binding tag into functionally neutral sites of the 23 S rRNA and subsequent affinity chromatography. It was tested with ribosomes mutated at the 23 S rRNA position 2655 (the elongation factor (EF)-G binding site). Ribosomes carrying the lethal G2655C mutation were purified and studied in vitro. It was found in particular that this mutation confers strong inhibition of the translocation process but only moderately affects GTPase activity and binding of EF-G.

Analysis of the role that specific rRNA nucleotides play in the translation process is of primary interest. In this respect, the application of site-directed mutagenesis of rDNA has so far had one general limitation, namely that for the biochemical characterization of mutant ribosomes, the mutants need to be prepared in a pure form. An Escherichia coli strain was created in the laboratory of C. Squires, in which all the chromosomal rDNA operons were deleted (4Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). With the help of such a strain, it is possible to produce mutant ribosomes if these ribosomes are able to support cell growth (5Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol.

Obviously, most functionally interesting mutations are likely to be lethal and could only be expressed if wild type ribosomes are co-expressed to support translation. Two methods have been published describing attempts to create a pure population of ribosomes carrying lethal mutations (7Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 8Green R. Noller H.F. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1011-1021PubMed Google Scholar, 9Khaitovich P. Tenson T. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Green R. Noller H.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both of them involve in vitro transcription of an rDNA or rDNA fragment and subsequent reconstitution of the ribosomal subunit. However, the first method (9Khaitovich P. Tenson T. Kloss P. Mankin A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) uses ribosomes that are not from E. coli, and the second (7Samaha R.R. Green R. Noller H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) utilizes fragmented rRNA, leading to very low activity (for discussion, see Ref. 10Green R. Noller H.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The major problem here lies in the absence of natural modifications as well as possible (at least partial) misfolding of the rRNA in vitro, as compared with the in vivo assembly. We aimed to create a system for affinity purification of ribosomes, assembled in vivo, via an aptamer tag attached to the mutated rRNA. Whereas the purification of proteins carrying genetically introduced affinity tags has become a routine, only a few such tags are known for RNA (11Peabody D.S. Lim F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Bachler M. Schroeder R. von Ahsen U. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 13Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and none of them has so far been applied to a ribonucleoprotein particle with the size of the ribosome. One of the most challenging steps of the protein synthetic cycle is translocation, and the coupling of GTP hydrolysis and translocation, stimulated by elongation factor G, has been widely discussed in the literature. There are two known sites of interaction of EF-G 1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; SRL, sarcin-ricin loop; DMS, dimethylsulfate; TEV, tobacco etch virus; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: EF, elongation factor; SRL, sarcin-ricin loop; DMS, dimethylsulfate; TEV, tobacco etch virus; WT, wild type. with the 23 S rRNA, namely the sarcinricin loop (SRL) and the GTPase-associated center (14Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The mutation G2655C of the SRL of 23 S rRNA is known from the literature to be lethal (15Macbeth M.R. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an effect that is related to the interaction of the elongation factor with the ribosome. In this report, we decided to study this mutation in more detail, namely to find an exact stage in the elongation factor G cycle affected by the G2655C mutation. For this purpose, we applied a method for the affinity purification of ribosomes harboring the G2655C lethal mutation in an amount and purity sufficient for biochemical characterization. Plasmids—Introduction of the MS2 coat protein binding site into helices 9, 25, 45, and 98 of 23 S rRNA has been described by Matadeen et al. (16Matadeen R. Sergiev P. Leonov A. Pape T. van der Sluis E. Mueller F. Osswald M. von Knoblauch K. Brimacombe R. Bogdanov A. van Heel M. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The plasmid, coding for the MS2 coat protein dimer TEV cleavage site ZZ domain fusion protein, was constructed from the pET-TEV-ZZ vector (17Avdeeva O.N. Myasnikov A.G. Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Brimacombe R. Dontsova O.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the pCP12d1–12 plasmid (11Peabody D.S. Lim F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), encoding the MS2 coat protein dimer. The streptomycin binding aptamer (12Bachler M. Schroeder R. von Ahsen U. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was introduced by sequential site-directed mutagenesis of M13 mp18 phage carrying an SphI-BamHI fragment of the E. coli rrnB operon with the MS2 coat protein-binding site already inserted into helix 98. The resulting sequence of helix 98 of the 23 S rRNA is GACCCUGGAUCGCAUUUGGACUUCUGCCCAGGGUGGCACCACGGUCGGAUCCAGGGUC (starting from the nucleotide 2791 of the wild-type 23 S rRNA, ending with nucleotide 2805 of the wild-type 23 S rRNA). To introduce the streptavidin binding aptamer (13Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), an XbaI-SphI fragment of the rrnB operon with the MS2 coat protein binding site already inserted at helix 9, 25, or 45 was subcloned into an additional plasmid where the KpnI and XmaIII sites of the MS2 insert were unique. The plasmid, cut with KpnI and XmaIII, was ligated with annealed oligonucleotides, coding for the aptamer, followed by subcloning of the XbaI-SphI fragment back into the expression vector pLK1192U (18Powers T. Noller H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The resulting sequence of helix 25 of the 23 S rRNA is CACGCUUGGGUACCGGCUGGGCCGACCAGAAUCAUGCAAGUGCGUAAG AUAGUCGCGGGCCGGCCCGGCCGGGUACUCAGGC (starting from the nucleotide 540 of the wild-type 23 S rRNA, ending with nucleotide 550 of the wild-type 23 S rRNA). Mutations of nucleotide 2655 of the 23 S rRNA were made by site-directed mutagenesis of an SphI-BamHI fragment of the E. coli rrnB operon, subcloned into M13 mp18 phage. Subsequently, the mutated fragment was subcloned back into the pLK1192U plasmid either with or without the affinity tag. The XL1 strain of E. coli was used for all genetic manipulations and phage growth. For preparation of uracil-containing single-stranded DNA for mutagenesis, strain CJ236 was used as a host for M13 phage. For translation fidelity measurements, strain MC140 was used. Strain AVS69009 (4Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) carrying no chromosome-encoded rRNA was transformed by pLK1192U plasmids carrying mutations. For displacement of originally present pHK-rrnC plasmid, the transformants were streaked on LB plates containing spectinomycin (pLK1192U encodes a mutation in 16 S rRNA, causing resistance to spectinomycin). The loss of the pHK-rrnC plasmid was monitored by loss of kanamycin resistance. The absence of wild type rRNA in the cell was confirmed by the primer extension method, as in Sergiev et al. (5Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The primer was complementary to nucleotides 548–564 of the 23 S rRNA. The extension was carried out in the presence of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and ddGTP, thus proceeding up to nucleotide C544 in the case of the wild type and until the last cytosine of the insert, 2 nucleotides from the primer binding site in the case of ribosomes carrying the affinity tag. Translational Fidelity Measurements and Growth Rate Determination—Cells from strain MC140, transformed both by pLK1192U, carrying a mutation at nucleotide 2655 of the 23 S rRNA, and by the pSG or CSH series of plasmids (19O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9214-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.3 was reached. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed essentially according to O'Connor et al. (20O'Connor M. Goringer H.U. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4221-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Growth rates were measured at 37 °C in LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Three independent colonies were grown overnight after transformation of the XL1 strain or plasmid substitution in the AVS69009 strain and were used to inoculate a volume of medium 50 times larger. Cell densities were monitored by absorbance at 600 nm. Ribosome Preparation and Affinity Purification—Ribosomes were prepared by the reassociation method (21Blaha G. Stelzl U. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 292-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity purification was carried out in subunit dissociation buffer (20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.5, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 200 mm NH4C1, 4 mm 2-mercaptothanol) at 4 °C. Binding of 1000 pmol of ribosomes to 100 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was performed overnight (16 h) in a 2-ml tube followed by three washes with binding buffer. Elution was also carried out overnight, using binding buffer saturated with biotin. After elution, the 50 S ribosomal subunits were reassociated with 30 S subunits from an additional subunit preparation, and the 70 S ribosomes were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The ratio of wild type to mutant in the ribosome preparations was estimated by primer extension, according to Sigmund et al. (22Sigmund C.D. Ettayebi M. Borden A. Morgan E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 673-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). GTPase Reaction—For the GTPase reaction, 4 pmol of ribosomes were mixed with a preincubated (10 min, 37 °C) mixture of 4 pmol of EF-G, 4 pmol of GTP, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP for one round of hydrolysis and 400 pmol of GTP for multiple rounds of hydrolysis. Buffer conditions for the reaction were 20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NH4Cl, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fusidic acid was added if required to a final concentration of 1 mm. 40% formic acid was used to stop the reaction. The extent of GTP hydrolysis was assayed by thin-layer chromatography (23Ehrenberg M. Bilgin N. Kurland C.G. Spedding G. Ribosomes am Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1990: 101-129Google Scholar). Recombinant EF-G was purified from the superproducing strain (24Shimizu Y. Inoue A. Tomari Y. Suzuki T. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Ueda T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. T. Ueda. Footprinting—For footprinting experiments, the complexes of ribosomes and EF-G with or without fusidic acid were prepared as for the GTPase reaction (above) but without radioactive GTP. Dimethylsulfate (DMS) modification was carried out by addition of 0.2 μl of 20% DMS solution in ethanol to 10 μl of the complex. Modification was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped, rRNA was extracted, and primer extension was carried out as described in Sergiev et al. (5Sergiev P.V. Bogdanov A.A. Dahlberg A.E. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the region around the SRL and GTPase-associated center, primers complementary to 23 S rRNA nucleotides 1121–1140 and 2730–2749, respectively, were used. Translocation Experiments—For translocation experiments, 2.5 pmol of ribosomes were mixed with 1 μg of polyU (Sigma) and a 2-fold excess of tRNAPhe in a 10-μl volume of polyamine buffer (20 mm Hepes-K, pH 7.5, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 150 mm NH4OAc, 2 mm spermidine, 0.05 mm spermine, 4 mm 2-mercaptothanol) (21Blaha G. Stelzl U. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 292-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 37 °C 15 min. After incubation, a 1.2-fold excess of AcPhe-tRNAPhe in the same buffer was added followed by incubation for an additional 15 min. The same buffer with or without equimolar amounts of EF-G and GTP (2 mm final concentration) was added, and incubation was continued for a further 10 min at 37 °C. In parallel, the binding of AcPhe-tRNAPhe directly to the P-site was done the same way but without prior incubation of the ribosomes with the deacylated tRNA. Binding of AcPhe-tRNAPhe to the ribosomal P or A sites was measured by filtration through nitrocellulose. The puromycin reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min with a 5 mm final concentration of puromycin adjusted to pH 7.5. The radioactive amino acid released was extracted with ethyl acetate. The background of the puromycin reaction was measured in a parallel experiment without puromycin. Choice of Affinity Tag—For the introduction of an affinity tag into E. coli 23 S rRNA, we chose the internal 23 S rRNA helices 9, 25, 45, and 98, which are evolutionarily variable and whose extension is known not to affect protein biosynthesis (16Matadeen R. Sergiev P. Leonov A. Pape T. van der Sluis E. Mueller F. Osswald M. von Knoblauch K. Brimacombe R. Bogdanov A. van Heel M. Dontsova O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Several affinity tags were tested, and the best results were obtained for the streptavidin binding aptamer. Other tags that we tested in preliminary experiments were the MS2 coat protein binding site and the aptamer to streptomycin. Introduction of the MS2 coat protein binding site into rRNA has been described previously. A recombinant fusion protein consisting of the MS2 coat protein dimer (11Peabody D.S. Lim F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a TEV-protease cleavage site, and a dimer of the Z domains of Staphylococcus aureus protein A was created for the affinity purification. Using this system, we were able to observe a quantitative binding of the fusion protein to the affinity-tagged ribosomes and, independently, to the IgG-Sepharose (data not shown). However, the binding of ribosomes carrying the MS2 coat protein binding site to the resin, mediated by the recombinant protein, was extremely low and relatively non-specific (data not shown). The reason was most probably in the steric clash between ribosomes, protein, and the resin when all three are to bind each other simultaneously. The successfully applied MS2 coat protein-based systems for affinity separation of RNA and its complexes obviously involved ribonucleoprotein particles of a much smaller size. We also cannot rule out that more flexible and long linkers between the MS2 coat protein part and the IgG-Sepharose binding part of the fusion protein could potentially enable the binding of tagged ribosomes to the resin. The next affinity tag to be tested was the streptomycin binding aptamer (12Bachler M. Schroeder R. von Ahsen U. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which was introduced into helix 98 of the 23 S rRNA. Purification of the ribosomes carrying this aptamer on immobilized dihidrostreptomycin gave a very high level of co-purification of wild type ribosomes (data not shown). This might be explained by binding of the streptomycin derivative to the 30 S ribosomal subunit or by non-specific electrostatic interactions between the dihydrostreptomycin and rRNA. The latter is more probable since the application of the 50 S subunits instead of the 70 S ribosomes for the binding does not increase the specificity of binding. Finally, an aptamer to streptavidin (13Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was introduced into the helices 9, 25, and 45 of the 23 S rRNA. Strains (4Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) expressing only the tagged variant of 23 S rRNA had no growth defects in rich medium, indicating that tagged ribosomes could support translation equally to the wild type ribosomes. Pure tagged ribosomes bound streptavidin-Sepharose and could be eluted by biotin in a similar manner as that described for yeast RNase P (13Srisawat C. Engelke D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 632-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The best binding was observed when the aptamer was introduced into helix 25 (Fig. 1). In equal conditions, binding of other variants of tagged ribosomes was 70% of the binding of the ribosomes carrying the aptamer inserted into the helix 25. Under equal conditions, the ribosomes without the introduced aptamer were not able to bind the resin to any detectable extent. Affinity Separation of Ribosomes Carrying the Lethal G2655C Mutation—Plasmid pLK1192U, encoding 23 S rRNA carrying both the streptavidin aptamer and the G2655C mutation, was expressed in strain XL1 of E. coli. The plasmid used carries the ampicillin resistance gene and C1192U mutation in 16 S rRNA, making ribosomes resistant to spectinomycin. 70 S ribosomes from this strain were prepared by the reassociation technique (21Blaha G. Stelzl U. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 292-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity purification of tagged ribosomes by streptavidin-Sepharose at 10 mm magnesium concentration lead to only 5-fold enrichment of the initial mixture. Since binding of pure wild type ribosomes (not as a mixture with tagged ones) to the resin was not observed, we concluded that non-specific binding of non-tagged species arises from ribosome-ribosome rather then ribosome-resin interactions. To avoid this effect, we purified 50 S subunits at a magnesium concentration of 1 mm, which led to a satisfactory separation; the initial mixture contained only 6% tagged ribosomes, which was enriched to a level of 90 ± 3% in the final eluate from the resin (Fig. 1). The affinity chromatography step was followed by reassociation of the subunits and further purification of the 70 S ribosomes by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradient as described by Blaha et al. (21Blaha G. Stelzl U. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 292-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The G2655C Mutation Affects Cell Growth and Accuracy of Translation—In agreement with previous reports (15Macbeth M.R. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we found that G2655C mutation is recessive lethal. It was not able to support cell growth if no wild type ribosomes were present in the cell; however, it could be tolerated if the translation is carried out by wild type ribosomes. In a strict sense, the mutation did not allow AVS69009 strain (4Asai T. Zaporojets D. Squires C. Squires C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) to lose the plasmid encoding the wild type 23 S rRNA and remain viable. The study was extended to other substitutions of the 2655 nucleotide, namely G2655A and G2655U. In contrast to G2655C, these mutations were found to be viable and were able to support growth, even when they represented 100% of the 23 S rRNA in AVS69009 cells in which all the chromosomal rDNA operons are deleted. The doubling times of the corresponding strains are listed in Table I. In agreement with previous reports (25Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the G2655A mutation showed little difference from the wild type, G2655C was the most defective, and G2655U was intermediate.Table IDoubling times of strains AVS69009 and XL1, harboring pLK1192U plasmids expressing 23 S rDNA with (or without) mutations of nucleotide 2655AVS69009XL1WT85 min77 minG2655A86 min88 minG2655U117 min130 minG2655CLethal177 min Open table in a new tab The effect of the mutations at 23 S rRNA position 2655 on the in vivo accuracy of translation was tested with the help of a set of plasmids expressing the β-galactosidase gene (19O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9214-9218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Each plasmid of this set (except pSG25, used as a control) contain a mutation in the lacZ gene that would lead to a non-functional protein if the translation of correspondent mRNA proceeded without mistakes. The active enzyme could only be synthesized as a result of a translation error, such as frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, and misreading, compensating the mutation encoded in the DNA. Stop codon readthrough and frameshifting was increased in the strains expressing mutant rDNA (Table II). The extent of the increase correlated well with the growth rates, being minimal for G2655A and maximal for the lethal G2655C mutation. Curiously, the mutations also increased the expression of the normal β-galactosidase gene, an effect that has been described in the literature for several other mutations and explained by an increase of overall wild type ribosome production in response to the expression of mutant rDNA genes (26Moine H. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Table IIEffects of mutations at position 2655 of 23 S rRNA on the readthrough of stop-codons, frameshifting, and missense amino acid incorporationWTG2655AG2655UG2655CStop codon read throughpSG 853 UAA11.85 ± 0.133.1 ± 0.283.04 ± 0.31pSG12-6UAG10.91 ± 0.041.13 ± 0.121.62 ± 0.23pSG 3/4 UGA11 ± 0.011.39 ± 0.211.86 ± 0.29FrameshiftingpSGlac7(+1)11.23 ± 0.151.33 ± 0.072.22 ± 0.29pSG12DP(-1)11.1 ± 0.11.54 ± 0.171.68 ± 0.14MisreadingCSH103 (Glu/Gln)11.03 ± 0.020.78 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.07Total translationpSG 25 (WT)11.08 ± 0.031.46 ± 0.181.53 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab The interesting observation is the decrease in Glu/Gln misreading in strains expressing the G2655C and G2655U mutants (Table II). Altogether these effects could be explained if we suppose that the G2655C mutant ribosomes move very slowly along the mRNAs. In this case, the downstream ribosomes in the polysomes would be forced to move as slowly as the mutant ones, thus gaining additional time for correct tRNA selection as well as for shifting the reading frame. Ribosomes Carrying the G2655C Mutation Stimulate GTPase of EF-G—The experiments were carried out with ribosomes, purified by affinity chromatography, carrying the G2655C mutation. Ribosomes, purified by the same technique, with a wild type 2655G nucleotide were used as a control. The multiple EF-G turnover reaction was measured at a ribosome:EF-G:GTP ratio of 1:1:100. It was shown that ribosomes carrying the G2655C mutation have a slightly slower GTPase turnover rate (Fig. 2). However, in contrast to our expectations, it was found that the mutant ribosomes do in fact stimulate the GTPase activity of elongation factor G. According to the experiments of Munishkin and Wool (25Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a sarcin-ricin loop oligonucleotide carrying the G2655C mutation does not bind EF-G. We decided to check whether the same is true in the context of the ribosome. It is known that fusidic acid stabilizes the complex of EF-G with the ribosome, where EF-G forms a contact with the SRL (14Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 27Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6134-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We checked the inhibition by fusidic acid of GTPase turnover on the mutant ribosomes and found it to be the same as for the wild type ribosomes. Since fusidic acid prevents dissociation of EF-G and the ribosome, this inhibition proves that EF-G binds to the ribosome. This might indicate that an interaction of EF-G with other parts of the ribosome, most probably with the GTPase-associated center, could overcome the effect of the mutation and be sufficient for EF-G binding. EF-G Contacts GTPase-associated Center of Ribosomes Carrying the G2655C Mutation, whereas the Interaction with the Sarcin-Ricin Loop Is Reduced—Stimulation of the GTPase activity already presumes that EF-G binds to the mutant ribosomes. However, to demonstrate EF-G binding directly and to see whether it contacts both the SRL and the GTPase-associated center, we checked the protection by EF-G of 23 S rRNA residues from DMS modification, with and without fusidic acid. We found that ribosomes carrying the G2655C mutation could bind EF-G (Fig. 3), although the extent of binding is reduced in comparison with the binding to wild type ribosomes. We conclude that EF-G contacts both the SRL and the GTPase-associated center of the mutant ribosomes since both A1067 (in the GTPase-associated center) and A2660 (in the SRL) were protected from DMS modification by EF-G. Notably, protection of A1067 in both the wild type and mutant ribosomes is almost the same, whereas the extent of A2660 protection varied somewhat from one experiment to another, being on average 80% for the wild type and 31% for the mutant in the case of the complex with the fusidic acid. Without the antibiotic, EF-G-related protections on both the wild type and mutant ribosomes were reduced in agreement with the literature data (14Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). It was not possible to compare the reactivity of nucleotide 2655 in mutant versus wild type ribosomes since only the mutant is reactive to DMS. However, it is noteworthy that, whereas G2655 of wild type ribosomes is protected by EF-G from modification with kethoxal (14Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), C2655 of the mutant ribosomes is not protected from DMS modification. Ribosomes Carrying the G2655C Mutation Are Defective in EF-G-driven Translocation—The most intriguing question to ask was whether EF-G could cause the translocation of tRNAs on the mutant ribosomes. To test this, we prepared a pretranslocation complex on mutant polyU-programmed ribosomes with the P-site filled by deacylated tRNAPhe and the A-site filled by AcPhe-tRNAPhe. In parallel, AcPhe-tRNAPhe was directly mixed with polyU-programmed ribosomes so as to observe its maximal level of binding to the P-site without prior incubation with deacylated tRNAPhe. The proportion of P-site-bound AcPhe-tRNAPhe was measured by the puromycin reactivity of the AcPhe moiety related to the puromycin reactivity of AcPhe-tRNAPhe bound directly to the P-site. The experiments were done according to the modified Watanabe system (21Blaha G. Stelzl U. Spahn C.M. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Nierhaus K.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 292-309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Watanabe S. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in polyamine-containing buffer. As expected, no detectable difference between G2655C and wild type ribosomes with regard to P- and A-site tRNA binding was observed. Binding of AcPhe-tRNAPhe to the P-site of polyU-programmed ribosomes was on average 98%, whereas the binding to the A-site of ribosomes carrying deacylated tRNAPhe in the P-site was 50%, both values being identical for wild type and G2655C ribosomes. Translocation, both spontaneous and EF-G-related, was measured by the puromycin reaction (Fig. 4) with and without addition of EF-G. No difference in spontaneous translocation was detected, but a clear defect (circa 3-fold difference) in EF-G-driven translocation was observed for the G2655C ribosomes. Under the same incubation conditions, a 100-fold excess of GTP is completely hydrolyzed by EF-G, stimulated by ribosomes carrying the G2655C mutation. Thus, the principal result is that the G2655C mutation moderately affects GTPase stimulation and binding of EF-G to the ribosome but significantly decreases translocation efficiency. The main goal of the affinity purification method described here was to make it possible to obtain pure in vivo assembled ribosomes carrying a lethal mutation. Three aptamer structures were tested as affinity tags, introduced to the unconserved helices of the 23 S rRNA. An MS2 coat protein binding site inserted into the 23 S rRNA helices 9, 25, 45, and 98 was shown to be able to direct specific binding of the MS2 coat protein to the tagged ribosomes. Unfortunately, the attempt to bind such ribosomes to the resin via the fusion protein consisting of MS2 coat protein and IgG binding domain failed. Among the possible explanations are steric clashes among three components of the complex. Streptomycin binding aptamer was introduced to the helix 98 of the 23 S rRNA. It was shown not to be suitable for the affinity preparation of mutant ribosomes due to the high background binding of wild type ribosomes to the immobilized dihidrostreptomycin. Such a low specificity might be explained by electrostatic binding of large ribosomal RNA to the positively charged streptomycin. An aptamer to streptavidin inserted to the helix 25 of the 23 S rRNA performed the best as an anchor to the mutant ribosomes. It was demonstrated that the only limitation to the purity of the mutant ribosomes separated by this technique of affinity chromatography resides in ribosome-ribosome interactions. Application of the low magnesium buffer, reducing unspecific interactions between ribonucleoprotein particles, allowed us to separate tagged 50 S ribosomal subunits sufficiently pure for the biochemical analysis in vitro. The G2655C mutation in 23 S rRNA was selected to test the method. Nucleotide G2655 is protected by both EF-G and EF-Tu from chemical modification (14Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). This nucleotide is not involved in extensive intraribosomal interactions (1Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar), so its mutation would not be expected to cause any conformational changes outside the elongation factor binding site. The mutation G2655C was first described for the SRL oligonucleotide (25Munishkin A. Wool I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12280-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and was shown to impede EF-G binding to this RNA fragment. Later, Macbeth and Wool (15Macbeth M.R. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that expression of 23 S rRNA carrying this mutation, from highly efficient P1P2 rDNA promoters, causes cell lethality. The mutant ribosomes were shown to be no more than 3% active in protein synthesis (15Macbeth M.R. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutations of other SRL nucleotides have defects in EF-G binding (29Macbeth M.R. Wool I.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and EF-Tu/AatRNA/GTP ternary complex binding (30Tapprich W.E. Dahlberg A.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2649-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as effects on translation fidelity (31Bilgin N. Ehrenberg M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32O'Connor M. Dahlberg A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mutations described here also affect the fidelity of translation, and they do so in opposite directions; stop codon readthrough and frameshifting are increased, whereas misreading is decreased. Both effects could be explained if one postulates a slower movement of the mutant ribosomes along an mRNA molecule. An overall decrease in translation speed would result in a wider time window for correct tRNA choice, as well as for frameshifting. Despite the large body of experimental data, the mystery of the function of the elongation factors on the ribosome is still unsolved. One of the most intriguing questions is the coupling of GTP hydrolysis with translocation. In the classical view (33Glukhova M.A. Belitsina N.V. Spirin A.S. Mol. Biol. (Mosc.). 1977; 11: 1190-1200PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 505: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), translocation takes place before GTP hydrolysis, the latter being only necessary to dissociate the factor. A more recent, but often disputed, view supports GTPase activation prior to translocation (35Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Additional support for this alternative hypothesis has come from biochemical (36Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Matassova N.B. Katunin V.I. Semenkov Y.P. Wintermeyer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9586-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and cryo-EM (37Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) studies but has, however, been criticized by Cameron et al. (38Cameron D.M. Thompson J. March P.E. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here, we present a unique analysis of lethal mutant (G2655C) ribosomes purified by affinity chromatography, showing GTPase activity and EF-G binding accompanied by significantly inhibited translocation. The binding of EF-G to the GTPase-associated center was the same for wild type and the G2655C ribosomes; however, the contact of EF-G with SRL of the mutant ribosomes was weaker. This result could be explained in several ways. In the context of the model of Rodnina et al. (35Rodnina M.V. Savelsbergh A. Katunin V.I. Wintermeyer W. Nature. 1997; 385: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), our results indicate that EF-G is in contact with nucleotide 2655 after the GTPase reaction but prior to translocation, as shown by the cryo-EM study (37Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wieden H.J. van Heel M. Wintermeyer W. Cell. 2000; 100: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, translocation is not necessary for GTPase activation, simply because we observe GTPase activity without translocation. However, the results obtained could also be explained in terms of the classical model, which supposed a mechanism whereby GTP hydrolysis is activated only after the translocation has taken place. Thus, it could be hypothesized that the mutation in residue 2655 allows the necessity for translocation to activate the GTPase activity to be “bypassed.” In other words, the mutation could make GTPase and translocation uncoupled, in the way that it occurs with EF-G with the deleted domain IV (39Martemyanov K.A. Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the G2655C mutation could impede an allosteric signal transition from the sarcin-ricin loop to the peptidyltransferase center, thus making it impossible for the CCA ends of the tRNA molecules to shift. Both explanations converge at the point that interaction between EF-G and SRL is not primarily essential for the activation of GTP hydrolysis; however, it is important for translocation. The method described for affinity chromatography of ribosomes will undoubtedly help to explore more lethal mutations, giving insight into other critical steps in the ribosomal function. We are very thankful to Dr. D. S. Peabody, Dr. T. Ueda, and Dr. C. Squires for providing us with strains and plasmids. We also thank especially Albert Dahlberg, Michael O'Connor, and other members of the Dahlberg laboratory not only for their strains and plasmids, but also for the inspiring discussions.

Structural analyses demonstrate that a domain movement in the switch 1 region at the nucleotide site, homologous to domain movements in the switch 1 region in the G proteins [heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding proteins], explains the EPR data. The switch movement primes the motor both for the free energy–yielding nucleotide hydrolysis reaction and for subsequent conformational changes that are crucial for the generation of force and directed motion along the microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W2022046854,"The Escherichia coli MnmE protein is a three-domain protein that exhibits a very high intrinsic GTPase activity and low affinity for GTP and GDP. The middle GTPase domain, when isolated, conserves the high intrinsic GTPase activity of the entire protein, and the C-terminal domain contains the only cysteine residue present in the molecule. MnmE is an evolutionarily conserved protein that, in E. coli, has been shown to control the modification of the uridine at the wobble position of certain tRNAs. Here we examine the biochemical and functional consequences of altering amino acid residues within conserved motifs of the GTPase and C-terminal domains of MnmE. Our results indicate that both domains are essential for the MnmE tRNA modifying function, which requires effective hydrolysis of GTP. Thus, it is shown for the first time that a confirmed defect in the GTP hydrolase activity of MnmE results in the lack of its tRNA modifying function. Moreover, the mutational analysis of the GTPase domain indicates that MnmE is closer to classical GTPases than to GTP-specific metabolic enzymes. Therefore, we propose that MnmE uses a conformational change associated with GTP hydrolysis to promote the tRNA modification reaction, in which the C-terminal Cys may function as a catalytic residue. We demonstrate that point mutations abolishing the tRNA modifying function of MnmE confer synthetic lethality, which stresses the importance of this function in the mRNA decoding process.

We demonstrate that point mutations abolishing the tRNA modifying function of MnmE confer synthetic lethality, which stresses the importance of this function in the mRNA decoding process. The evolutionarily conserved MnmE (TrmE) protein of Escherichia coli is a GTPase that differs extensively from regulatory GTPases such as p21 (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, MnmE exhibits a very high intrinsic GTPase hydrolysis rate and low affinity for GTP and GDP, and it can form self-assemblies. MnmE has a molecular mass of 50 kDa and is organized as a multidomain protein (see Fig. 1) consisting of an ∼220-amino acid N-terminal domain, probably required for self-assembly, a middle GTPase domain, of about 160 residues, and an ∼75-amino acid C-terminal domain, which contains the only Cys residue present in the protein. Strikingly, the isolated GTPase domain roughly conserves the guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activities of the intact MnmE molecule (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C.

Null mnmE mutants are defective in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified nucleoside 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U34) 1The abbreviations used are: mnm5s2U34, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; cmnm5s2U34, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34; m5U54, 5-methyluridine at position 54; RUMT, tRNA-(m5U54)-methyltransferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.

Sørensen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The synthesis of mnm5s2U34 is complex and requires several enzymatic reactions (4Hagervall T.G. Edmonds C.G.

Cannon J.F. Webb F.H. Bock R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 368-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carries out thiolation in the 2-position of the wobble uridine (U34), whereas mnmE controls the first step of the modification in the 5′-position, but it is unclear how many steps precede the formation of cmnm5s2U34 (2Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3521-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Hagervall T.G. Edmonds C.G. McCloskey J.A. Björk G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8488-8495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several data support that a second gene, named gidA, trmF, or mnmG, is also involved in the cmnm5 group addition and that the MnmE activity precedes the activity of GidA (2Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3521-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Brégeon D. Colot V. Radman M. Taddei F. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2295-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mnmC gene product has two enzymatic activities that transform the cmnm5 intermediate into the final mnm5 modification (4Hagervall T.G. Edmonds C.G. McCloskey J.A. Björk G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8488-8495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-thio group, but not the cmnm5 group, is important for aminoacylation of tRNAGlu and tRNALys (2Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A.

MnmE is also involved in modification of tRNA1Gln, but, in this case, the wobble base modification might be different from mnm5s2U34 (3Krüger M.K. Sørensen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the non-thiolated derivatives cmnm5U34 and mnm5U34 are present in tRNA4Leu and tRNA4Arg, respectively, and their formation may be also mediated by MnmE (7Hagervall T.G. Pomerantz S.C. McCloskey J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The precise role of MnmE in the cmnm group addition is unknown. The only biochemical activity of this protein reported to date is the GTPase activity (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but whether it is required for the tRNA modifying function has not been analyzed yet. Given that MnmE is a multidomain protein, the possibility that different domains are involved in different cellular functions cannot be discarded. This would not be something new, because, for instance, the trmA gene product (RUMT) has been proposed to have two different activities associated with different regions of the protein, the synthesis of m5U54 (a non-essential modification that is present in all E. coli tRNA species) and another, yet unknown, essential function (12Persson B.C. Gustafsson C. Berg D.E. Björk G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3995-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Gustafsson C. Björk G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1326-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblotting, as well as immunoelectron microscopy, revealed that MnmE is a cytoplasmic protein partially associated with the inner membrane (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of MnmE and its homologues contain the tetrapeptide motif C(I/L/V)GK at the extreme C terminus, which shows good homology with the CAAX motif (where “A” represents an aliphatic residue, and “X” represents any residue) characteristic of the Ras proteins of eukaryotic cells (14Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). The C-terminal cysteine might be involved in the membrane association of MnmE, as it occurs with other GTPases containing C-terminal cysteines, or in the putative tRNA modifying activity of this protein, because cysteine residues have been shown to be responsible for methyl transferase activity of some tRNA modifying enzymes (15Kealey J.T. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9724-9728Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To unravel its functional role, as well as to investigate whether the cycle of GTP/GDP exchange regulates the subcellular distribution of MnmE, the construction of point mutations affecting the C-terminal Cys or the GTPase activity of MnmE may be of great value. MnmE is homologous to the mitochondrial protein encoded by MSS1, a nuclear gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose product has been proposed to play a role in some aspect of mitochondrial translation (16Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Colby G. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27945-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In E. coli, we have found that null mnmE mutations are lethal depending on the genetic background (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations in MSS1 render the yeast cells respiratory-deficient only in the presence of a paromomycin-resistance mutation (PR454), which resides in the mitochondrial 15 S rRNA gene and may alter the conformational changes involved in the decoding process (16Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Fourmy D. Yoshizawa S. Puglisi J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Ogle J.M. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Tarry M.J. Carter A.P. Ramakrishnan V. Science. 2001; 292: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Altogether these results led us to postulate that the lack of the mnmE gene product may be tolerated by E. coli cells depending on features of other elements involved in translation (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, because MnmE might be a multifunction protein, it is not sure that the lethality conferred by null mnmE mutations in certain genetic backgrounds is directly related with the impairment of the tRNA modifying function. Therefore, isolation of missense mnmE mutations affecting this function is important to determine whether it is essential for E. coli. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of the GTPase domain and the C-terminal Cys of MnmE in the tRNA modifying function of this protein by constructing specific missense mutations and to analyze the effect of such mutations on the subcellular localization of the protein and cell viability. Bacterial Strains, Phages, Plasmids, and DNA Manipulations— E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I, unless specified otherwise. Genetic techniques for the construction of strains were performed as described (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). λIC718 is a λRZ5 derivative carrying the wild-type mnmE allele under control of promoter Ptac (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For DNA manipulations, standard procedures were followed. Plasmids pIC935, pIC936, and pIC937 were obtained by site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis on pre-existing plasmid pIC684 (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mutagenic PCR primers were as follows: for pIC935, 5′-CGTCCTAACGCCGCTAAATCGAGCCTGTT-3′ and 5′-AACAGGCTCGATTTAGCGGCGTTAGGACG-3′; for pIC936, 5′-GCTGCATATCATCGCGACCGCCGGGCTA-3′ and 5′-TAGCCCGGCGGTCGCGATGATATGCAGC-3′; and for pIC937, 5′-TGCGCAATAAAGCCAATATCACCGGCGAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTCGCCGGTGATATTGGCTTTATTGCGCA-3′. Plasmid pIC925 was constructed by exchanging the 1.3-kb BglII/BstXI fragment of pIC914 for the same fragment from pIC805 containing mutation C451S. Plasmids pIC960, pIC961, and pIC962 were constructed by exchanging the MunI/AflII fragment (nucleotide 3620 to 4389) of pIC914 for the same fragment from pIC935, pIC936, and pIC937, respectively. mnmE alleles carrying mutations G228A, D270A, D338N, and C451S were named mnmE10, mnmE30, mnmE40, and mnmE60, respectively. The wild-type mnmE allele on the IC3647 chromosome was replaced for mnmE alleles on pIC914, pIC925, pIC960, pIC961, and pIC962 by a linear transformation method (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); in such a system, mnmE extends from position 3102 to 4466. Mutant MnmE protein and/or phenotype is indicated between brackets. Open table in a new tab Media, Growth Conditions, and Enzyme Assays—LBT (Luria Bertani broth containing 40 μg/ml thymine) and LAT (LBT containing 20 g of Difco agar per liter) were used for routine cultures and plating of E. coli. Antibiotics were added as recommended (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). IC4126 and derivatives were grown at 30 °C and plated at 30 or 42 °C for viability tests. β-Galactosidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assays were performed as described previously (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar, 22Ujita S. Kimura K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein Techniques and Production of Antisera—Overproduction and purification of GST fusion proteins was done in DEV16 transformed with plasmid pIC684 or derivatives. Protein purification, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were carried out essentially as described (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Before use, the anti-MnmE antiserum (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was affinity purified with nitrocellulose-bound MnmE. The anti-CyoA antibody (obtained in our laboratory by J. C. Escudero) was produced by inoculating the purified C-terminal domain of CyoA (fused to GST) into New Zealand rabbits. NTPase and GTP Binding Assays—NTP hydrolysis was measured by a colorimetric assay for determination of Pi release (23Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar, 24Hoenig M. Lee J. Ferguson D.C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The purified proteins (1.89 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations (0–5 mm) of GTP or XTP in 50 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) at 37 °C during 10 min (a period in which the velocity of Pi liberation was constant). Reactions were stopped by adding 200 μl of daily prepared malachite green reagent. This reagent contained 2 volumes of 0.0812% malachite green, 2 volumes of bidistilled water, 1 volume of ammonium molybdate (5.72% in 6 n HCl), and 1 volume of 2.32% polyvinyl alcohol. After 2 min at room temperature, 25 μl of 34% sodium citrate were added to stop the color development. The samples were read within the next 15 min in a Labsystems Multiskan® Plus plate reader using a 690-nm filter. Blanks containing the corresponding nucleotide concentrations in binding buffer plus malachite green reagent and citrate were subtracted from each sample. To quantitate the amounts of enzymatically released Pi, the samples were compared with a standard curve, which was prepared with dilutions of a 500 μm KH2PO4 solution in binding buffer, over a range from 0 to 10 nmol of inorganic phosphate. To determine values for V max and K m, the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression (GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, Inc.). All nucleotides were from Sigma. The affinity of wild-type and mutant MnmE proteins for [γ-35S]GTP (>37 MBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was determined by using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described previously (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The assays were done at 30 °C with a protein concentration equal to 4.7 μm in 25-μl reactions. K d values were calculated by fitting the curves with non-linear regression (one binding site hyperbola), using GraphPad Prism software. Limited Proteolysis—The purified proteins (1 μg) were incubated with the indicated nucleotide concentrations in 18 μl of digestion buffer (0.1 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl) for 5 min at room temperature. Proteolysis reactions were started by adding 2 μl of Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine cloromethyl-ketone-treated chymotrypsin (12.5 ng/μl; Sigma) at 30 °C. After a 20-min incubation, reactions were stopped with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm final concentration) and 2× Laemmli sample buffer, heated 3 min at 95 °C, and subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and the resulting bands were identified by Western blot with anti-MnmE antibody. When using endopeptidase Glu-C (Sigma), the incubation was performed for 1 h at 37 °C with 50 ng of the enzyme. In Vivo Formaldehyde Cross-linking, Cellular Fractionations, and Immunoelectron Microscopy—Cross-linking with formaldehyde was carried out as described previously (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For subcellular localization of MnmE proteins, cells were collected in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl plus a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm bestatin, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A) and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris were removed from the lysate by centrifugation (4,400 × g for 15 min, 4 °C). Cell envelopes were separated from the soluble fraction (containing cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins) by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g for 60 min, 4 °C). The pellet (membrane fraction) was washed once as above and resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and inhibitors before storage at –20 °C. Fractions were tested by Western blot analysis with anti-MnmE antiserum (or anti-CyoA antiserum as a control for the membrane fraction). Immunoelectron microscopy and morphometric analysis were performed as described previously (1Cabedo H. Macián F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martínez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 7063-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Readthrough Measurements—Misreading of the UAG stop codon carried by the lacZ105 gene was monitored by using the β-galactosidase assay (2Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3521-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in LBT containing 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1 mm cAMP and maintained at least four generations in exponential growth by repeated dilution with the same medium before being assayed. β-Galactosidase assays were performed on SDS-chloroform-permeabilized cells as described (21Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Special precautions for very low β-galactosidase activities were taken (2Elseviers D. Petrullo L.A. Gallagher P.

Analysis of tRNAGlu Modification by Northern Blots—Total tRNA from strains DEV16, IC4767, IC4768, IC4769, IC4770, and IC4640 grown to an A 600 of ∼0.6–0.8 was extracted and deacylated (3Krüger M.K. Sørensen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The tRNA was quantified by absorbance measurement at A 260 nm with an Unicam UV-visible spectrophotometer (Helios-β). Northern blots were performed essentially as described (3Krüger M.K. Sørensen M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: the electrophoresis was run for 2.5 h at 100 V and 40 °C through a 10-cm-long, 0.75-mm-thick, 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The area between the two dyes was electroblotted onto a Nylon membrane positively charged. Membranes were pre-hybridized at 50 °C for 1 h in DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied Science). To detect the tRNAGlu, the following digoxigenin-labeled probe was used: 5′-DIG-CCCCTGTTACCGCCGTGAAAGGGCGGTGTC-3′. Hybridization was performed for 6 h at 50 °C in DIG Easy Hyb containing the probe at a final concentration of 3.3 nm. After post-hybridization washes (2 × 15 min at 25 °C with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and 2 × 15 min at 48 °C with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS), chemiluminescent detection with CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol.

https://openalex.org/W1997087173,"CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) transactivates target genes dependent upon DNA binding via its basic region-leucine zipper domain and slows G1 progression by interaction with E2F, cdk2, or cdk4. E2F interacts with the non-DNA-binding surface of the C/EBPα basic region and C/EBPα residues 1–70 are required for repressing E2F targets, while cdk2 and cdk4 bind residues 177–191. C/EBPα-ER induces the 32D cl3 myeloblast cell line to differentiate to granulocytes. C/EBPα-ER variants incapable of binding DNA slowed G1, but did not induce early or late granulopoiesis, indicating that cell cycle inhibition as mediated by C/EBPα is not sufficient for differentiation. C/EBPα-ER variants lacking residues 11–70 or residues 11–70 and 178–200 both slowed the G1 to S transition. C/EBPα(GZ)-ER, containing the GCN4 rather than the C/EBPα leucine zipper, also slowed G1. In contrast, C/EBPα(BRM2)-ER, carrying mutations in the outer surface of the basic region required for interaction with E2F, did not slow G1. C/EBPα(BRM2)-ER induced early markers of granulopoiesis much less efficiently than C/EBPα-ER and did not direct terminal maturation. Inhibition of G1 progression using mimosine increased induction of late markers by G-CSF. Thus, both DNA binding and cell cycle arrest, mediated by opposite surfaces of the C/EBPα basic region, are required for granulopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026483831,"Whereas an important aspect of sensory adaptation in rod photoreceptors and olfactory receptor neurons is thought to be the regulation of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel activity by calcium-calmodulin (Ca2+-CaM), it is not clear that cone photoreceptor CNG channels are similarly modulated. Cone CNG channels are composed of at least two different subunit types, CNGA3 and CNGB3. We have investigated whether calmodulin modulates the activity of these channels by direct binding to the CNGB3 subunit. Heteromeric channels were formed by co-expression of human CNGB3 with human CNGA3 subunits in Xenopus oocytes; CNGB3 subunits conferred sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM, whereas CaM regulation of homomeric CNGA3 channels was not detected. To explore the mechanism underlying this regulation, we localized potential CaM-binding sites in both NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of CNGB3 using gel-overlay and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays. For both sites, binding of CaM depended on the presence of Ca2+. Individual deletions of either CaM-binding site in CNGB3 generated channels that remained sensitive to regulation by Ca2+-CaM, but deletion of both together resulted in heteromeric channels that were not modulated. Thus, both NH2- and COOH-terminal CaM-binding sites in CNGB3 are functionally important for regulation of recombinant cone CNG channels. These studies suggest a potential role for direct binding and unbinding of Ca2+-CaM to human CNGB3 during cone photoreceptor adaptation and recovery.

Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Google Scholar). In mammals, at least six genes encode CNG channel subunits (2Richards M.J. Gordon S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14003-14011Google Scholar, 3Bradley J. Frings S. Yau K.W. Reed R. Science. 2001; 294: 2095-2096Google Scholar). Native CNG channels are tetrameric proteins (4Liu D.T.

Each subunit contains six putative transmembrane domains, cytoplasmic NH2 and COOH termini, a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, and a conserved pore region (1Zagotta W.N.S. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Google Scholar, 6Kaupp U.B. Seifert R. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 769-824Google Scholar). Whereas heterologous expression of α subunits alone (except CNGA4) forms functional homomeric channels, the co-assembly of appropriate α and β subunits creates heteromeric CNG channels with properties that more closely resemble native CNG channels (7Chen T.Y.

CNG channels are highly permeable to Ca2+, and Ca2+ entry through CNG channels provides a negative feedback signal that assists in adaptation and recovery in photoreceptors and olfactory sensory neurons (13Fain G.L.

Rod CNG channels contain CNGA1 (29Kaupp U.B. Niidome T. Tanabe T. Terada S. Bonigk W. Stuhmer W. Cook N.J. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Miyata T. Numa S.

For these channels, Ca2+-CaM modulation is comparatively weaker, and the CNGB1 subunit provides the CaM-binding site in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain that is critical for regulation (30Grunwald M.E. Yu W.P. Yu H.H. Yau K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9148-9157Google Scholar, 31Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.W.

For cone CNG channels, Ca2+-feedback mechanisms are less well defined. Ca2+-dependent regulation of apparent cGMP affinity is robust for native striped bass cone CNG channels and is thought to be of greater significance for cone photoreceptor adaptation than the corresponding changes in rods (33Hackos D.H. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 515-528Google Scholar, 34Rebrik T.I. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 537-548Google Scholar, 35Rebrik T.I. Kotelnikova E.A. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 521-534Google Scholar). Application of CaM to patches excised from cone outer segments inhibits these channels, but CaM only partially mimics the activity of an endogenous modulator(s) (33Hackos D.H. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 515-528Google Scholar, 34Rebrik T.I. Korenbrot J.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 537-548Google Scholar). In contrast, CaM has no effect on CNG channels in patches excised from catfish cone outer segments (36Haynes L.W. Stotz S.C. Vis. Neurosci. 1997; 14: 233-239Google Scholar). Recombinant homomeric CNG channels composed of chick cone CNGA3 subunits are modulated by Ca2+-CaM (37Bonigk W. Muller F. Middendorff R. Weyand I. Kaupp U.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7458-7468Google Scholar). However, homomeric channels formed by the human or bovine orthologs of CNGA3 are insensitive to CaM regulation, even though these subunits possess an NH2-terminal CaM-binding site (38Yu W.P. Grunwald M.E. Yau K.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 211-215Google Scholar, 39Grunwald M.E. Zhong H. Lai J. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13444-13449Google Scholar, 40Muller F. Vantler M. Weitz D. Eismann E. Zoche M. Koch K.W. Kaupp U.B. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 399-409Google Scholar). Thus, there appear to be species differences in sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM both for native cone photoreceptor CNG channels and for heterologously expressed homomeric CNGA3 channels. With recent cloning of the cone photoreceptor β subunit (CNGB3) for mice (12Gerstner A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Biel M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1324-1332Google Scholar) and humans (41Sundin O.H. Yang J.M.

Zrenner E. Sharpe L.T. Wissinger B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2107-2116Google Scholar), the importance of this subunit for modulation of cone CNG channels by Ca2+-CaM can now be examined. In this study, we demonstrate that the human CNGB3 (hCNGB3) subunit forms functional heteromeric channels with human CNGA3 (hCNGA3) when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These recombinant heteromeric channels exhibited electrophysiological properties that differed from those of homomeric hCNGA3 channels, including sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM. Human CNGB3 plus CNGA3 heteromeric channels are shown to be unique compared with other CNG channel types, in that CaM regulation involves functionally important CaM-binding sites in both the NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of hCNGB3. Molecular Biology—The human retinal cone CNG channel β subunit clone, hCNGB3-c22, was isolated using nested PCR from human retinal cDNA (Marathon Ready cDNA; Clontech) with adapter- and gene-specific primers. The coding region for this clone differs from the complete published sequence for human CNGB3 of Kohl et al. (AF272900) (42Kohl S. Baumann B. Broghammer M. Jagle H. Sieving P. Kellner U. Spegal R. Anastasi M. Zrenner E. Sharpe L.T. Wissinger B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2107-2116Google Scholar) at two positions (nucleotides 1743 G → A and nucleotides 1788 A → G); these likely sequence polymorphisms do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence. Human CNGA3 (AF065314) (38Yu W.P. Grunwald M.E. Yau K.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 211-215Google Scholar, 43Wissinger B. Muller F. Weyand I. Schuffenhauer S. Thanos S. Kaupp U.B. Zrenner E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2512-2521Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Professor K.-W. Yau. Both hCNGB3 and hCNGA3 were subcloned into pGEMHE (44Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Google Scholar) for heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. A human calmodulin cDNA clone (hCaM) was also isolated from human retinal cDNA using nested PCR with gene-specific primers. hCaM was modified to include a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the COOH terminus and subcloned in-frame with polyhistidine at the NH2 terminus (pQE-30; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Constructs for polypeptides representing NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of hCNGA3 (amino acids 1–164 and 400–694, respectively) and hCNGB3 (amino acids 1–214 and 441–809, respectively) were generated as in-frame gene fusions with GST (pGEX-5X-2; Amersham Biosciences) using PCR. Deletions were engineered by overlapping PCR, or by restriction digestion followed by blunt end generation using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and in-frame ligation. All mutations and the fidelity of PCR-amplified cassettes were confirmed by fluorescence-based automated DNA sequencing. CaM Interaction Assays—Recombinant protein expression in bacteria and purification were carried out as previously described (25Varnum M.D. Zagotta W.N. Science. 1997; 278: 110-113Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer S (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1% NDSB (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.25% Tween 20) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), then lysed using a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY) or sonication. Soluble proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences); His-tagged CaM was purified using Ni2+-charged Sepharose (Probond resin; Invitrogen), eluted with 0.5 m imidazole (pH 6.0), and then dialyzed with buffer S. GST pull-down assays were performed using immobilized GST fusion proteins and 2 μm recombinant hCaM-FLAG, in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ or 10 mm EDTA. Pull-down assays were incubated overnight in buffer S at 4 °C with rocking. Beads were centrifuged for 2 min at 700 × g, washed 5 times in 100 μl of buffer S (including either Ca2+ or EDTA), and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Bound proteins were separated using 12 or 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Gel overlay assays were performed using similarly blotted GST fusion proteins with 1 μg/ml hCaM-FLAG in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% milk, and either 1 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA (maintained throughout the assay and blot processing). For both assays, interacting hCaM-FLAG was visualized using M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak) directed against the FLAG epitope and a chemiluminescent detection system (SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate; Pierce). Interaction assays were repeated at least 3 times with reproducible results. CaM-binding site search and analysis was performed using the Calmodulin Target database of M. Ikura and co-workers. 2calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/pub_pages/classify/index.htm. Electrophysiology—For functional expression of hCNGA3 and hCNGB3, Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated and microinjected with 5–10 ng of in vitro transcribed mRNA (mMessage mMachine; Ambion, Austin, TX) as previously described (45Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Google Scholar). The ratio of hCNGA3 to hCNGB3 cRNA was 1:5. Two to 7 days after microinjection of mRNA into oocytes, patch clamp experiments were performed with an Axo-patch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the inside-out configuration. Initial pipette resistances were 0.45–0.75 megohm. Currents were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Intracellular and extracellular solutions contained 130 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Cyclic nucleotides were added to intracellular solutions as indicated. Intracellular solutions were changed using an RSC-160 rapid solution changer (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). Currents in the absence of cyclic nucleotide were subtracted. Recordings were made at 20 to 22 °C. For electrophysiological experiments involving CaM, bovine CaM (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used at 250 nm. EDTA was substituted by 2 mm nitrilotriacetic acid and 704 μm CaCl2 for 50 μm buffered free Ca2+ in the intracellular solution. Excised patches were first exposed to 5 mm EDTA for 2–10 min to remove soluble, endogenous Ca2+-dependent modulators. In addition, any changes because of Ca2+ alone were permitted to occur before CaM was applied (10–40 min). After CaM experiments, the channels were typically tested for sensitivity to l-cis-diltiazem (RBI, Natick, MA) applied in the intracellular solution to verify the subunit composition of the channel, i.e. whether hCNGB3 and deletion constructs of hCNGB3 participated in the formation of the expressed channels. Dose-response relationships were obtained by plotting the current as a function of cyclic nucleotide concentration. Dose-response data were fitted to the Hill equation, I/Imax = ([cNMP]n/(K⅓n + [cNMP]n)), where I is the current amplitude, Imax is the maximum current, [cNMP] is the ligand concentration, K1/2 is the apparent affinity for ligand, and n is the Hill slope. For current inhibition by l-cis-diltiazem, data were fit to the Hill equation in the form: Idiltiazem/I = (K½n/(K½n + [diltiazem]n)). Data were acquired using Pulse (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany), and analyzed using Igor Pro (Wave-metrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The data were expressed as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney rank sum or Student's t test (SigmaStat; SPSS), and a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. The Properties of Heteromeric CNG Channels Containing hCNGB3 Subunits Differ from Homomeric hCNGA3 Channels—To examine the potential functional significance of the human CNGB3 subunit, hCNGB3 was co-expressed with hCNGA3 in Xenopus oocytes and macroscopic cGMP- and cAMP-activated currents were recorded from excised, inside-out membrane patches. As expected, hCNGB3 did not form functional CNG channels when expressed alone (data not shown). Co-expression of hCNGB3 and hCNGA3 generated recombinant heteromeric channels that demonstrated dramatically altered functional properties compared with homomeric hCNGA3 channels (Fig. 1, Table I). First, the fractional activation of the channels by a saturating concentration of cAMP compared with saturating cGMP (IcAMP/IcGMP) was significantly increased (p < 0.001) for heteromeric CNG channels (Fig. 1A). Second, a statistically significant increase in the apparent affinity for cAMP (p < 0.05) and decrease in the apparent affinity for cGMP (p < 0.05) were observed for channels containing hCNGB3 subunits compared with the homomeric channels (Fig. 1B). Third, sensitivity to block by l-cis-diltiazem applied to the cytoplasmic face of the patch was also examined. As expected, homomeric hCNGA3 channels were insensitive to block by l-cis-diltiazem (Fig. 1C, left, D; Table I). Heteromeric human cone CNG channels demonstrated much greater sensitivity to l-cis-diltiazem (Fig. 1C, right, D; Table I): the K½ at +80 mV for the l-cis-diltiazem block of hCNGB3 + hCNGA3 channels was 7.4 ± 5.2 μm, n = 0.92 ± 0.13 (n = 16). The voltage dependence and K½ for block by diltiazem were roughly similar to that reported for native catfish cone CNG channels (46Haynes L.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 783-801Google Scholar). These results show that the presence of the hCNGB3 subunit modified the ligand sensitivity of the expressed channels and dramatically enhanced susceptibility to block by l-cis-diltiazem. Thus, the functional properties of recombinant heteromeric channels formed by hCNGB3 and hCNGA3 subunits recapitulated some of the characteristics commonly associated with native CNG channels.Table ICo-expression of hCNGB3 deletion mutants with hCNGA3 forms heteromeric CNG channelscGMPcAMPIcAMP/IcGMPIdiltiazem/IK½nK½nμMμMhA313.5 ± 2.5 (39)2.2 ± 0.21329 ± 369 (39)1.3 ± 0.20.12 ± 0.04 (39)0.94 ± 0.04 (6)hA3 + hB319.9 ± 3.8 (56)2.0 ± 0.2897 ± 177 (56)1.6 ± 0.20.27 ± 0.09 (59)0.26 ± 0.11 (15)hA3 + hB3ΔN16.1 ± 3.4 (20)2.0 ± 0.2767 ± 196 (18)1.5 ± 0.30.34 ± 0.08 (19)0.26 ± 0.03 (3)hA3 + hB3ΔC22.0 ± 4.9 (13)1.9 ± 0.3973 ± 468 (13)1.4 ± 0.20.30 ± 0.09 (13)0.31 ± 0.08 (4)hA3ΔN + hB3ΔN17.4 ± 4.0 (10)2.1 ± 0.21156 ± 367 (8)1.6 ± 0.30.34 ± 0.08 (9)0.11 (1)hA3 + hB3ΔNΔC24.4 ± 4.4 (14)2.0 ± 0.21124 ± 283 (14)1.4 ± 0.20.21 ± 0.07 (13)0.32 ± 0.07 (4) Open table in a new tab hCNGB3 Plus hCNGA3 Heteromeric Channels Are Inhibited by Ca2+-CaM—We examined the sensitivity of both homomeric hCNGA3 channels and heteromeric hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 channels to regulation by Ca2+-CaM. Consistent with previous studies (39Grunwald M.E. Zhong H. Lai J. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13444-13449Google Scholar), homomeric channels formed by hCNGA3 subunits alone were not inhibited by 250 nm CaM in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2, A and C, left). In contrast, heteromeric hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 channels displayed significant inhibition by Ca2+-CaM under identical conditions (Fig. 2, B and C, right). The time course for maximum current inhibition by Ca2+-CaM varied between seconds and minutes. The ratio of the current elicited by 10 μm cGMP at +80 mV with and without 250 nm CaM, i.e. ICaM/I, was 0.96 ± 0.01 (n = 2) for homomeric hCNGA3 channels and 0.62 ± 0.09 (n = 8) for heteromeric hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 channels. Inhibition by Ca2+-CaM was relieved by perfusion of the patch with calcium-free solution (Fig. 2, B and C, right). The apparent affinity of the heteromeric channel for cGMP was decreased slightly by Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 2D), from a K½ of 19.0 ± 2.7 μm, n = 2.0 ± 0.2 (n = 5) in the absence of CaM (see also Table I) to 25.8 ± 6.7 μm, n = 2.1 ± 0.2 (n = 5) in the presence of CaM (p < 0.05, paired t test). No change in the maximum current at a saturating concentration of cGMP (1 mm) was observed with Ca2+-CaM compared with Ca2+ alone (data not shown). These results indicate that the presence of the cone photoreceptor hCNGB3 subunit conferred sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM in the context of recombinant heteromeric channels. Identification of Region in the hCNGB3 NH2-terminal Domain Important for Interaction with Ca2+-CaM—To test the hypothesis that hCNGB3 subunits provide sites for direct binding of Ca2+-CaM, we used epitope-tagged human CaM in gel overlay and pull-down interaction assays with GST fusion proteins representing cytoplasmic domains of hCNGB3 and hCNGA3. hCNGA3 subunits are known to possess a CaM-binding site in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain that is functionally silent in the context of homomeric channels (39Grunwald M.E. Zhong H. Lai J. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13444-13449Google Scholar). As expected, the NH2-terminal domain of hCNGA3 interacted with CaM in the presence of calcium, and deletion of a region including the previously identified Ca2+-CaM-binding site prevented this interaction (Fig. 3, B and C). The NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of hCNGB3 (hCNGB3 N) also was able to physically associate with Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 3, B and C). Next, we localized the CaM-binding site within the hCNGB3 NH2-terminal domain. GST fusion proteins representing various hCNGB3 N deletion constructs were generated and tested for interaction with CaM in vitro (Fig. 3A). Deletion of amino acids 2 to 107 of hCNGB3 N did not disrupt binding of Ca2+-CaM. However, deletion of amino acids 108–159 in hCNGB3 N completely abolished the interaction with Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, a GST fusion protein including only amino acids 108–154 of hCNGB3 N was able to associate with Ca2+-CaM. Thus, these results show that this region of hCNGB3 N is both necessary and sufficient for direct binding of Ca2+-CaM. No CaM binding was observed for any of the fusion proteins in the absence of Ca2+, confirming that the interaction was entirely Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 3, B, middle, and C, bottom). Sequence alignment of the probable CaM-binding site in the hCNGB3 NH2-terminal domain with those of CNGB1, CNGA3, and CNGA2 is shown in Fig. 3D. This site in hCNGB3 N resembles a 1–14 CaM-binding motif, exhibiting bulky hydrophobic residues at positions 1 and 14, a net charge of +4, and a predicted propensity to form an amphiphilic α-helix (47Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Google Scholar, 48Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar). This pattern in hCNGB3 N appears to conform better to these common CaM-binding motifs than the previously characterized “unconventional” CaM-binding site in the NH2-terminal domain of CNGB1 (30Grunwald M.E. Yu W.P. Yu H.H. Yau K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9148-9157Google Scholar, 31Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Google Scholar). Localization of a CaM-binding Site in the hCNGB3 COOH-terminal Domain—Because a functionally silent CaM-binding site was previously identified in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the rod CNG channel β subunit (CNGB1) (30Grunwald M.E. Yu W.P. Yu H.H. Yau K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9148-9157Google Scholar, 31Weitz D. Zoche M. Muller F. Beyermann M. Korschen H.G. Kaupp U.B. Koch K.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2273-2284Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal domain of hCNGB3 (hCNGB3 C) may also bind Ca2+-CaM. Gel-overlay experiments with full-length hCNGB3 C demonstrated an interaction with Ca2+-CaM in vitro (Fig. 4B). Similar to hCNGB3 N, CaM binding to hCNGB3 C depended on the presence of calcium. As expected, the hCNGA3 COOH-terminal domain did not interact with CaM. To localize which regions of hCNGB3 C were necessary for binding of Ca2+-CaM, GST fusion proteins representing hCNGB3 C deletion mutants were engineered and tested using in vitro protein-protein interaction assays (Fig. 4). Assays carried out with fusion proteins including the C-linker region and the cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain, or the CNB domain alone, revealed no binding to Ca2+-CaM. Instead, Ca2+-CaM specifically interacted with a fusion protein representing the region of hCNGB3 C distal to the CNB domain (amino acids 637–809). A fusion protein limited to amino acids 661–757 of hCNGB3 was sufficient for interaction with Ca2+-CaM, whereas proteins including amino acids 637–681 or 680–809 of hCNGB3 C were unable to bind CaM. Similar results were obtained using GST pull-down assays (data not shown). In all cases, CaM binding did not occur in the absence of calcium (Fig. 4B, middle). These results, summarized in Fig. 4A (right), identify a region distal to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain that is necessary for Ca2+-CaM binding in vitro. Consistent with these findings, a search for likely CaM-binding sites in hCNGB3 C highlighted this sequence as a candidate CaM target (Fig. 4A, bottom). This Ca2+-CaM-binding site in hCNGB3 is positioned similar to the functionally silent CaM-binding site in the COOH-terminal domain of CNGB1, but this region of CNGB3 exhibits little sequence homology with CNGB1. Effects of hCNGB3 NH2- and COOH-terminal Deletions on Ca2+-CaM Modulation of Heteromeric CNG Channels—To determine the functional importance of the CaM-binding sites identified within hCNGB3 NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains, hCNGB3 deletion mutants were engineered and individually co-expressed with hCNGA3 in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Table I, the functional properties of these channels, as indicated by the K½ for cGMP, the K½ for cAMP, IcAMP/IcGMP, and the sensitivity to block by l-cis-diltiazem, were roughly similar to wild type hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 channels, demonstrating that all hCNGB3 deletion mutants studied were able to participate in the formation of heteromeric channels. An α subunit with deletion of its Ca2+-CaM-binding site, hCNGA3 ΔN, also formed functional homomeric channels (data not shown) as well as heteromeric channels when co-expressed with hCNGB3. Sensitivity to regulation by CaM for these mutant CNG channels was examined in the presence of 25 μm cGMP and 50 μm Ca2+. Inhibition by Ca2+-CaM was still observed for heteromeric hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 ΔN, hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 ΔC, and hCNGA3 ΔN + hCNGB3 ΔN channels (Fig. 5, A, C, and E). For some patches, slow recovery of the current after Ca2+-CaM inhibition was apparent with removal of CaM even in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). Thus, neither individual deletion of NH2- or COOH-terminal CaM-binding sites in hCNGB3, nor of the NH2-terminal CaM-binding site in hCNGA3, eliminated sensitivity to regulation by Ca2+-CaM. Furthermore, the extent of inhibition by Ca2+-CaM of hCNGA3 + hCNGB3 ΔC and hCNGA3 ΔN + hCNGB3 ΔN channels resembled that of wild t"
https://openalex.org/W2124353341,"Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 potassium channels are expressed in brain as mature glycoproteins that are trans-Golgi glycosylated. When expressed in cell lines these homomers had very different trans-Golgi glycosylation efficiencies and cell surface expression levels with Kv1.4 > Kv1.1 for both parameters (Zhu, J., Watanabe, I., Gomez, B., and Thornhill, W. B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39419–39427). This previous study identified determinants in the outer pore region of Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 that positively and negatively, respectively, affected these events when expressed as homomers. Here we investigated which subunit exhibited positive or negative effects on these processes when expressed as heteromers. Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromers, by coexpression or expression as tandem-linked heteromers, were expressed on the cell surface at ∼20-fold lower levels versus Kv1.4 homomers but they were trans-Golgi glycosylated. The lower Kv1.4/Kv1.1 expression level was not rescued by Kvβ 2.1 subunits. Thus Kv1.1 inhibited high cell surface expression and partially retained the heteromer in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas Kv1.4 stimulated trans-Golgi glycosylation. The subunit determinants and cellular events responsible for these differences were investigated. In a Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromer, the Kv1.1 pore was a major negative determinant, and it inhibited high cell surface expression because it induced high partial endoplasmic reticulum retention and it decreased protein stability. Other Kv1.1 regions also inhibited high surface expression of heteromers. The Kv1.1 C terminus induced partial Golgi retention and contributed to a decreased protein stability, whereas the Kv1.1 N terminus contributed to only a decreased protein stability. Thus a neuron may regulate its cell surface K+ channel protein levels by different Kv1 subfamily homomeric and heteromeric combinations that affect intracellular retention characteristics and protein stability. Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 potassium channels are expressed in brain as mature glycoproteins that are trans-Golgi glycosylated. When expressed in cell lines these homomers had very different trans-Golgi glycosylation efficiencies and cell surface expression levels with Kv1.4 > Kv1.1 for both parameters (Zhu, J., Watanabe, I., Gomez, B., and Thornhill, W. B. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 39419–39427).

Thus Kv1.1 inhibited high cell surface expression and partially retained the heteromer in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas Kv1.4 stimulated trans-Golgi glycosylation. The subunit determinants and cellular events responsible for these differences were investigated. In a Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromer, the Kv1.1 pore was a major negative determinant, and it inhibited high cell surface expression because it induced high partial endoplasmic reticulum retention and it decreased protein stability. Other Kv1.1 regions also inhibited high surface expression of heteromers. The Kv1.1 C terminus induced partial Golgi retention and contributed to a decreased protein stability, whereas the Kv1.1 N terminus contributed to only a decreased protein stability. Thus a neuron may regulate its cell surface K+ channel protein levels by different Kv1 subfamily homomeric and heteromeric combinations that affect intracellular retention characteristics and protein stability. Voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels modulate cell excitability by repolarizing action potentials and shaping their waveforms (1Rudy B.

A large family of voltage-gated K+ channels have been identified by molecular cloning techniques that include the four subfamilies Shaker (Kv1), Shab (Kv2), Shaw (Kv3), and Shal (Kv4) and many structural determinants within core K+ channel proteins that underlie their functional properties have been identified (4Jan L.Y.

Oligomerization of Shaker or Kv1 channels to properly folded tetramers appears to take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGG, trans-Golgi glycosylation; tpTGG, total protein trans-Golgi glycosylation; spTGG, surface protein trans-Golgi glycosylation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Gm/Cm, maximum conductance/capacitance.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGG, trans-Golgi glycosylation; tpTGG, total protein trans-Golgi glycosylation; spTGG, surface protein trans-Golgi glycosylation; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Gm/Cm, maximum conductance/capacitance. and amino acid motifs involved in this include regions of the distal N terminus and the S1 and S2 transmembrane domains (14Papazian D.M.

Other reports suggest that efficient cell surface expression of some Kv α subunits may be promoted by a cytoplasmic C terminus VXXSL motif (16Li D. Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11597-11602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), that different Kv α subunits may be differentially glycosylated (9Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr.

Hammond S. Schechter L.E. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Within a Kv K+ channel subfamily most members function as homotetramers in expression systems, which indicated that a large diversity of functional channels could be generated by numerous heteromeric combinations. Less appreciated is the observation that differences in intracellular trafficking and retention of these homomeric and heteromeric channels could affect cell surface expression levels that could modify neuronal signaling characteristics (10Zhu J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another study has identified regions on Kir-type K+ channels that appear to be possible ER export signals (19Ma D. Serangue N. Lin Y. Collins A. Yu M. Jan U. Jan L. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The importance of proper membrane protein folding, oligomerization, and trafficking to the cell surface is highlighted by descriptions of ion channel trafficking defects associated with numerous disorders such as cystic fibrosis and a form of episodic ataxia (20Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Disease. Academic Press, New York2000Google Scholar). Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromers and Kv1.4 homomers are both found in native brain (21Coleman S.K. Newcombe J. Pryke J. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and are mature glycoproteins indicating they are heavily glycosylated in the trans-Golgi. In our previous work (Ref. 10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, see also Ref. 22Manganas L.N. Wang Q. Scannevin R.H.

A. 2001; 98: 14055-14059Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), Kv1.4 or Kv1.1 were expressed in CHO cells as homomers and we found that (a) Kv1.4 exhibited a high trans-Golgi glycosylation (TGG) conversion and Kv1.1 showed low conversion, and (b) Kv1.1 was expressed at only ∼5% the cell surface level compared with Kv1.4, that is, Kv1.4 exhibited a ∼20-fold higher surface level versus Kv1.1, as assayed by cell surface biotinylation and patch clamping, because Kv1.1 exhibited partial high ER retention. Kv1.1 homomers still expressed whole cell peak currents of ∼1.5 nA per cell but this was much less than Kv1.4 homomers (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We also mapped a trafficking determinant to the outer pore regions of these channels because exchanging these regions conferred upon the recipient channel the characteristics of the donor channel. Thus as homoteteramers, the pore of Kv1.4 was positive for high trans-Golgi glycosylation and high cell surface expression, whereas the pore of Kv1.1 was negative for these characteristics. In our current study we investigated (a) the effects of expression of Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromers versus Kv1.4 homomers to determine which subunit, as well as which region of a subunit, contained dominant positive or dominant negative determinants for trans-Golgi glycosylation and cell surface expression levels, and (b) the cellular event(s) responsible for these differences, e.g. whether a change in the protein stability of the Kv1.4 heteromer, export from the ER to Golgi, and/or transport from the Golgi to cell surface were responsible for these cell surface level differences. CHO cells were used as a model system because in our previous work, as well as our current work, they gave similar results as neuronal-like CAD cells (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and COS cells, and they do not endogenously express Kv1 subfamily proteins (23Helms L.M.

Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Transfections—CHO pro5 cells and COS 7 cells, from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.35 mm proline or α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. CAD cells from Dr. Wang were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 as described previously (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Rat brain Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 cDNAs (25Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) were modified using the PCR to have a 5′ Kozak enhanced ribosomal binding sequence (CCACC) in front of the start methionine and no endogenous 5′-or3′-untranslated regions. Standard mutagenesis using PCR was used to construct different cDNAs as outlined in our previous work (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Tandem-linked dimers were constructed by PCR by engineering unique restriction enzyme sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, and the stop codon was eliminated from the 3′ end of the first cDNA and the start methionine was eliminated from the 5′ end of the second cDNA. These cDNAs were gel purified and ligated with an appropriate vector to produce a tandem-linked cDNA construct containing Kv1.4-Kv1.4 or Kv1.4-Kv1.1. These tandem-linked constructs would be expected to express at a defined stoichiometry of Kv1.44 and Kv1.42Kv1.12. Channel cDNAs in the eucaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 were sequenced to confirm construct integrity. LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) reagent was used for transient transfections following the manufacturer's method on cells plated in a 35-mm dish using 0.5 μg of plasmid for single transfection and cells were incubated for ∼20 h post-transfection before they were processed. An incubation for ∼20 h was chosen because we have shown that the cell surface expression levels for Kv1.4 and Kv1.1 were maximal at ∼15 h (data not shown). For expression of Kv1.4 homomers we cotransfected with plasma membrane M2 muscarinic receptor cDNA to control for competition of reagents to produce mRNA in the nucleus and for components used for protein processing in the ER/Golgi and transport to the cell surface. Crude Membrane Isolation and Glycosidase/Immunoblot Analysis of Kv1.4 —Crude total cell membranes (ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane) were isolated in ice-cold hypotonic media with protease inhibitors (5 mm Tris final, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at –80 °C as detailed previously (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycosidase (Roche Diagnostics) treatments of solubilized crude membranes followed the manufacturer's protocol with the final concentration of glycosidases at 0.16 units/ml for Endo H or 13 units/ml for PNGase F for 20–24 h at 37 °C. Total cell membranes recovered from a well of a 6-well dish were used to run on 9% SDS gels with ∼20 μg of membrane protein/gel lane (protein determined by Bio-Rad protein kit). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), the filter was blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated overnight in Kv1.4 mouse monoclonal antibodies (to amino acids 13–37) at 1:1000 (Upstate Biotechnology). The Kv1.4 monoclonal antibody specificity has been described previously (26Bekel-Acruri Z. Matos M.F. Manganas L. Strassle B.W. Monaghan M.M. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Following washes, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibodies were added and the bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL detection kit, Amersham Biosciences) and preflashed x-ray film (AR5, Eastman Kodak). Signals on immunoblots were quantified as described below. Nontransfected CHO, CAD, and COS cells do not express endogenous Kv1.4 or Kv1.1 proteins by immunoblotting (data not shown). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins and Immunoblot Analysis of Kv1.4 —Cell surface biotinylation used the hydrazide-LC-biotin (Pierce) reagent, which is specific for carbohydrates. The transfected cell procedure for surface carbohydrate oxidation and biotinylation, streptavidinagarose bead (Pierce) precipitation of solubilized biotinylated membrane glycoproteins, and the specific detection of cell surface Kv1.4 proteins by subsequent immunoblotting has been extensively described in our previous work (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of aliquots of the whole lysate for actin antibodies (clone AC-40, Sigma) was used to control for any cell density differences between wells. We also routinely checked for transfection efficiencies by cotransfecting with 0.1 μg of green fluorescence protein plasmid and performing immunoblots with green fluorescent protein antibodies (Clontech) (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Filters were exposed to preflashed x-ray film (Kodak, AR5) for various lengths of time. A microtex 8700 scanmaker (dynamic range of 0–3.5) was used to scan a film image. Densitometry analysis was performed with the NIH Image 1.6 software that was calibrated with its own internal as well as an external standard (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Values for cell surface expression levels of Kv1.4 homomers and Kv1.4 heteromers were normalized to Kv1.4 homomers that were taken as 100.0. We also estimated the total cell membrane (ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane) Kv1.4 protein levels of Kv1.4 homomers and Kv1.4 heteromers. Again these values were normalized to Kv1.4 homomers that were taken as 100.0. It appeared that only one or two Kv1.1 subunits in a Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromer were sufficient to inhibit surface expression (17Manganas L.N. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29685-29693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We predict that in our Kv1.4 with 4× Kv1.1 cotransfections the surface heteromers are a mixture of Kv1.43Kv1.11 and Kv1.42Kv1.12 (also see our data for tandem-linked Kv1.4-Kv1.1 versus Kv1.4-Kv1.4). Because our biotinylation/immunoblotting method measured surface Kv1.4 monomer levels, the surface protein value for Kv1.4 with 4× Kv1.1 was multiplied by 1.5 to correct for this and this corrected value is shown in the histograms in Fig. 1. Tandem-linked constructs of Kv1.4-Kv1.4 and Kv1.4-Kv1.1 would be expressed on the cell surface as Kv1.44 homomers and Kv1.42Kv1.12 heteromers, respectively. Cell surface Kv1.4-Kv1.4 denatured proteins on an immunoblot have two Kv1.4 antibody epitopes on each of their N termini whereas the Kv1.4-Kv1.1 protein has one. Thus the cell surface value obtained for Kv1.4-Kv1.1 was multiplied by two and this corrected value is shown in the histogram in Fig. 3C. The ECL detection system was linear over a ∼1–20-fold range by an immunoblot assay on serially diluted total cell membranes from transfected cells (∼100 to 5 μg of total membrane protein) (data not shown). Kv1 TGG (trans-Golgi glycosylation) percent = upper band signal/total band signal (upper and lower bands).Fig. 3Tandem-linked Kv1.4–1.4 and Kv1.4-Kv1.1 constructs gave similar results as cotransfection experiments. CHO cells were transfected with tandem-linked Kv1.4-Kv1.4 or Kv1.4-Kv1.1 constructs and used for immunoblot analysis of total cell protein and cell surface protein and for patch clamping to estimate Gm/Cm levels. A, immunoblot analysis using Kv1.4 antibodies of total cell membranes (ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane) from cells transfected with 0.5 μg of plasmid. Endo H or PNGase F glycosidase were used to treat membrane proteins. tpTGG percent was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, cell surface biotinylation/immunoblot analysis used Kv1.4 antibodies of cells transfected with Kv1.4-Kv1.4 or Kv1.4-Kv1.1 tandem-linked construct. spTGG percent was calculated as a mean ± S.E., n = 3, as in Fig. 1. The lower panels are longer time exposures of the upper panels. C, group data for cell surface protein levels by surface biotinylation from B. Values were normalized to Kv1.4-Kv1.4, which was taken as 100.0 ± S.E., n = 3. D, group data from whole cell current patch clamping (hold cell at –80 mV and depolarize to 50 mV for 80 ms) to estimate Gm/Cm. Values were normalized to Kv1.4-Kv1.4, which was taken as 100.0 ± S.E., n = 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analysis of Kv1.4 —Transfected COS cells on glass coverslips were incubated for 20 h following transfection. Cells were then washed, fixed in 3% paraformaldhyde for 10 min, and permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100) and blocked in standard blocking solution for 1 h. Kv1.4 antibody (1:1000) was added overnight and following washes, the cells were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with a chromaphore (Alexa dyes, Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with an Olympus BX50 microscope with a BX-FLA fluorescence attachment using the appropriate filter cube for the chromaphore. Photographs were taken using a ×100 objective and an automatic camera setting that determined the optimal time exposure for the signal (short time exposures for strong signals and longer time exposures for weak signals). Therefore micrographs should be viewed for differences in the overall distribution pattern of the Kv1.4 antibody signal and not the intensity of the signal. Nontransfected cells, on a coverslip with transfected cells, showed no fluorescence from incubation in first and secondary antibodies (data not shown). In addition transfected cells showed no fluorescence when incubated with only secondary antibody (data not shown). Antibodies to localize the ER (BiP/Grp78, Stressgen; calnexin, Stressgen) and the Golgi (GM130, Transduction Laboratories; p230, Transduction Laboratories) in cells were also used in this study (data not shown). Patch Clamping—Electrophysiological recordings and analysis of whole cell currents from transfected CHO cells have been described in our previous work (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with channel dimer cDNA constructs and 0.1 μg of green fluorescence protein construct to allow visualization of transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were held at –80 mV and depolarized to 50 mV for 80 ms and maximal current levels were used to calculate maximum conductance/capacitance (Gm/Cm) values. Values were normalized to the Kv1.4-Kv1.4 dimer that was taken as 100.0 ± S.E. Gm/Cm values may under- or overestimate surface tetramer expression tetramer levels if channel constructs have different single channel parameters such as differences in single channel conductance and mean channel open time. Although Kv1.4 has a single channel conductance of 4 pS and fast inactivation and Kv1.1 has a single channel conductance of 10 pS and slow inactivation (25Stuhmer W. Ruppersberg J.P. Schruer K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Giese K.P. Perschke A. Baumann A. Pongs O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3235-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), we did not correct for these differences in the histograms of normalized Gm/Cm for Kv1.4-Kv1.4 versus the Kv1.4-Kv1.1 dimers. Total Cell Protein Half-life Analysis of Kv1.4 Homomers and Kv1.4 Heteromers—Transfected CHO cells were incubated for 20 h following transfection and then incubated in [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (200 μCi/ml, Tran35S-label, Amersham Biosciences) in media without methionine or cysteine for 5 h. The media was changed and the cells were chased with media containing 5 mm methionine and cysteine. Cells were solubilized with a Triton X-100-solubilization buffer and Kv1.4 antibodies (1/200 dilution) were added overnight (9Shi G. Trimmer J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein A/G-agarose (Invitrogen) was used for 3 h with rocking to precipitate Kv1.4 complexes and the beads were washed to remove nonspecific binding. The immunoprecipitate was then denatured in SDS sample buffer, run on a 9% gel, and the radiolabeled bands were detected by fluorography (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) using preflashed x-ray film (AR5, Kodak). Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis as described above. Values were normalized to time 0 (time of chase with unlabeled media) and plotted as a function of time. A curve was fitted to a decaying single exponential time course and a protein half-life value was determined. In a Kv1.4/Kv1.1 Heteromer, Kv1.1 Inhibited High Cell Surface Expression (Dominant Negative Effect), whereas Kv1.4 Stimulated High Trans-Golgi Glycosylation (Dominant Positive Effect)—Kv1.4 homomers in cell lines were detected on immunoblots as monomers consisting of two glycoprotein bands (Fig. 1A , lane 1) as shown previously (10Zhu J. Watanabe I. Gomez B. Thornhill W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39419-39427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a high mannose-type glycoprotein p85 band (it was sensitive to glycosidase treatment by both Endo H which cleaves only N-linked high mannose-type sugars and PNGase F which cleaves all N-linked sugars), and a complex-type mature glycoprotein p110 band (it was insensitive to Endo H cleavage but sensitive to PNGase F), which suggested that it was trans-Golgi glycosylated. The site of N-glycosylation on Kv1.4 is on its extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 transmembrane domains at Asn-354 (Fig. 4A). Kv1.4 cDNA was cotransfected with increasing amounts of Kv1.1 cDNA and we performed immunoblots with Kv1.4 antibodies on total cell membranes (ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane). We found that the total protein trans-Golgi glycosylation (tpTGG) percent of Kv1.4 from total cell membranes was decreased from ∼62 to ∼1% as the Kv1.1 amount was increased (Fig. 1A). Cell surface biotinylation and immunoblotting methods were used to measure the cell surface protein level and the surface protein trans-Golgi glycosylation (spTGG) percent of Kv1.4 cotransfected with Kv1.1 compared with Kv1.4 cotransfected with M2 muscarinic receptor. Kv1.4 cotransfected with 4× M2 receptor will be referred to in the text as Kv1.4 homomers. The cell surface expression of Kv1.4 was dramatically inhibited when cotransfected with Kv1.1 and the levels were only ∼20 and ∼5% when cotransfected with 2 or 4× more Kv1.1 amounts, respectively, compared with Kv1.4 homomers (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast to our results with total cell membrane immunoblots, cell surface Kv1.4 heteromers showed a high spTGG percent of ∼88–92% that was slightly less than the ∼97–98% value for Kv1.4 homomers (Fig. 1, A versus B). The spTGG percent was a more direct measure of trans-Golgi glycosylation than the tpTGG percent because only channels that were processed in the Golgi were assayed. Will Kvβ 2.1 subunits rescue the lower expression level of Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromers? It appeared that they did not. Kvβ 2.1 increased the surface level of Kv1.4 homomers and this percent increase was similar as seen in Kv1.4/Kv1.1 heteromers (Fig. 1D). We also performed cell surface biotinylation, as well as total protein determinations, of neuronal-like CAD cells and COS cells that were cotransfected with Kv1.4 with M2 or Kv1.4 with Kv1.1 (Fig. 1, E–I).

In primary cultures of dog thyroid epithelial cells, the cAMP-dependent cell cycle induced by a sustained stimulation by thyrotropin or forskolin differs from growth factor mitogenic pathways, as cAMP does not upregulate d-type cyclins but increases p27 levels. Instead, cAMP induces the assembly of required cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes, which associate with nuclear p27. In this study, the arrest of forskolin stimulation rapidly slowed down the entry of dog thyrocytes into S phase and the phosphorylation of pRb family proteins. The pRb kinase activity, but not the formation, of the cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 complex was strongly reduced. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a phosphorylated form of CDK4 was separated. It appeared in response to forskolin and was bound to both cyclin D3 and p27, presumably reflecting the activating Thr-172 phosphorylation of CDK4. Upon forskolin withdrawal or after cycloheximide addition, this CDK4 phosphoform unexpectedly persisted in p27 complexes devoid of cyclin D3 but it disappeared from the more labile cyclin D3 complexes. These data demonstrate that the assembly of the cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 holoenzyme and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of CDK4 depend on distinct cAMP actions. This provides a first example of a crucial regulation of CDK4 phosphorylation by a mitogenic cascade and a novel mechanism of cell cycle control at the R point.

This provides a first example of a crucial regulation of CDK4 phosphorylation by a mitogenic cascade and a novel mechanism of cell cycle control at the R point. The restriction point (R point) 1The abbreviations used are: R point, restriction point; pRb, retino-blastoma susceptibility protein; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CAK, CDK-activating kinase; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DTT, dithiothreitol. has been originally defined as a critical no-return checkpoint in mid-to-late G1 phase at which cells are committed to initiate DNA replication and to complete one division cycle (1Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). Whereas the progression through the pre-R portion of G1 strictly depends on the sustained cell stimulation by external growth factors and mitogens, the passage through the R point results in the triggering of an intrinsic machinery autonomously ordering cell cycle completion. This concept implies the peculiarly labile feature of a key event stimulated by mitogens in G1 phase to explain the necessity of their continuous presence until R point passage (2Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 3Zetterberg A. Larsson O. Wiman K.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that the phosphorylation and inactivation of the tumor/growth suppressors of the Rb family (pRb, p107, and p130) and activation of E2F-dependent gene transcription are major events underlying the transit through R point (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 5Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin.

Before R point, the phosphorylations of pRb, p107, and p130 are initiated by CDK4 and 6 activated by d-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) synthesized in response to growth factors (7Sherr C.J. Trends.

In this loop, cyclin E activates CDK2 and promotes its own expression by phosphorylating pRb, thus relieving the inhibition of E2F-dependent transcription of cyclin E gene (4Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 13Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

From the R point, the phosphorylations of pRb and p130 are maintained by cyclin E/A-CDK2 complexes and become independent of growth factors (12Farkas T. Hansen K. Holm K. Lukas J. Bartek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26741-26752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kelly B.L. Wolfe K.G. Roberts J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Zetterberg A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) over an inhibitory threshold imposed by INK4 CDK inhibitors constitutes the sensor element of the sustained action of mitogens that leads to the phosphorylation of pRb-related proteins and to R point passage (7Sherr C.J.

Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the accumulation of a cyclin D does not suffice for CDK4/6 activation (20Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J.

Both the formation and nuclear import of cyclin d-CDK4/6 complexes have been demonstrated as additional regulated steps (22Cheng M. Sexl V. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, the complete activation of nuclear d-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes requires the Thr-172 phosphorylation of CDK4 by the nuclear CDK-activating kinase (CAK, cyclin H-CDK7) (20Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which is generally considered to be constitutively active during cell cycle (27Tassan J.P. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J.

The role of CDK “inhibitors” of the cip/kip family including p27kip1 in the passage through the R point is complex. Their down-regulation by mitogenic factors (30Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) and/or their titration by cyclin d-CDK complexes participate to cyclin E-CDK2 activation (31Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 32Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Their functions in the activation of cyclin d-CDK complexes are more controversial (19Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Reutens A.T. Segall J.E. Lee R.J. Arnold A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 501-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Initially, p27kip1 was claimed to inhibit the activity of CDK4 by preventing its phosphorylation by CAK (33Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). More recently, p21cip1 and p27kip1 have been suggested as essential adaptors and/or nuclear anchors for cyclin d-CDK complexes (21LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). However, other groups still conclude that cip/kip proteins are not absolutely required for the assembly of cyclin d-CDK4 complexes (38Bagui T.K. Jackson R.J. Agrawal D. Pledger W.J. Mol. Cell.

Rev. 2001; 22: 631-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) has raised the necessity to reexamine, at least in some systems, the nature of the critical labile events that couple at R point, the mitogenic cascades with the autonomous part of the cell cycle (47Roger P.P. Demartin S. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this physiologically relevant system (48Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 49Roger P.P. Christophe D. Dumont J.E. Pirson I. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 579-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the cAMP-dependent mitogenic stimulation by thyrotropin (TSH) or the general adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin depends on CDK4/6 activity (50Lukas J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and involves the phosphorylations of pRb, p107, and p130 (51Coulonval K. Maenhaut C. Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but it strikingly differs from the most generally envisaged growth factor cascades as it stimulates the accumulation of p27kip1 (52Depoortere F. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not that of d-type cyclins (23Depoortere F. Van Keymeulen A. Lukas J. Costagliola S. Bartkova J. Dumont J.E. Bartek J. Roger P.P. Dremier S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the presence of permissive co-mitogenic factors (insulin and carbachol) that support the accumulation of the required cyclin D3 (25Van Keymeulen A. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7351-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 53Van Keymeulen A. Deleu S. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), TSH and cAMP promote the assembly and nuclear import of cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes that associate with nuclear p27 (23Depoortere F. Van Keymeulen A. Lukas J. Costagliola S. Bartkova J. Dumont J.E. Bartek J. Roger P.P. Dremier S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Depoortere F. Pirson I. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, an additional cAMP-dependent labile event responsible for a last control of R point passage remains to be uncovered. Even after the required induction of stable or continuously formed nuclear cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 complexes, dog thyrocytes still depend on sustained elevation of cAMP levels for entry into DNA synthesis phase (47Roger P.P. Demartin S. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 54Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and pRb phosphorylation (47Roger P.P. Demartin S. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Whereas the progression through a first part of G1 phase depends on the synergy of both cAMP and supportive co-mitogens integrated by the accumulation of cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes, the transit through the R point can be controlled by cAMP alone (53Van Keymeulen A. Deleu S. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify the phosphorylation of CDK4 within the cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 holoenzyme as the target of this crucial control. Moreover, we provide an explanation for the paradox that the disappearance of CDK4 phosphorylation upon arrest of cAMP stimulation could be perceived only in cyclin D3-bound CDK4 but not in total CDK4 or p27-bound CDK4. Primary Cultures—Follicular cells were obtained from dog thyroid tissue as described previously (55Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) cultured in monolayer in the “control” medium, i.e. DMEM+Ham's F-12+MCDB104 medium (2:1:1 by volume) supplemented with bovine insulin (5 μg/ml, Sigma), ascorbic acid (40 μg/ml), and antibiotics (55Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and quiescent cells at day 4 or 5 were stimulated with the general adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (2 × 10–6m, Calbiochem) as detailed in the figure legends. Previous experiments on dog thyrocytes have shown that forskolin quantitatively reproduces all of the cAMP-dependent effects of TSH on cell cycle progression, function, and differentiation expression (reviewed in Ref. 49Roger P.P. Christophe D. Dumont J.E. Pirson I. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 137: 579-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that the activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin and cellular cAMP generation are very fast (maximum within 5 min in dog thyrocytes), do not desensitize for at least 48 h, and are completely reversible (within 10 min) after washing of the cells (54Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 56Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Mockel J. Dumont J.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Percentages of cells in the different phases of cell cycle were determined from the different patterns of proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunofluorescent staining exactly as described previously (57Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 58Baptist M. Lamy F. Gannon J. Hunt T. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 256-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by counting at least 500 cells/dish. Cell cycle progression was corroborated by the incorporation of 8-bromodeoxyuridine detected by immunofluorescence (59Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses of cyclin D3, CDK4, p27, pRb, p107, and p130 were performed as described previously (26Depoortere F. Pirson I. Bartek J. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1061-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Ser-807/Ser-811 phosphosite-specific pRb antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoprecipitation—For analyses of protein complexes and pRb kinase activity, subconfluent cultures of thyrocytes in 10-cm Petri dishes that contain the same number of cells were lysed on ice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm DTT, protease inhibitors (pefablock and leupeptin), and 10% glycerol. The homogenized (glass/glass) cellular lysate was sonicated twice, precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and then incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with protein A-Sepharose, which had been preincubated overnight with 2 μg of antibody (monoclonal antibody against cyclin D3 (DCS-28) (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) or a mixture of the K25020 anti-p27 monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories and the C-15 p27 polyclonal antibody from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. Alternatively, for analyses of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of the whole population of cyclin D3, p27, or CDK4, cultures of thyrocytes in 10-cm Petri dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 200 μl of denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm vanadate, and protease inhibitors), boiled for 5 min, and frozen. Cell lysates containing 300–500 μg of protein were cleared by centrifugation and diluted by adding five volumes of RIPA buffer without SDS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm vanadate, and protease inhibitors). They were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as above with the exception that a mixture of DCS-28 and DCS-22 (NeoMarkers) was used for cyclin D3 and the C-22 polyclonal antibody for CDK4. pRb Kinase Assay—Immune complexes were washed three times with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm DTT and three times with the kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT). Washed complexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 2 mm ATP, 0.5 μg of a 56-kDa fragment (amino acids 379–928) of pRb (QED Bioscience, San Diego, CA), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 60 μg/ml pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with occasional gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by adding 60 μl of twice-concentrated Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the phosphorylation on Ser-780 of the pRb fragment (specifically ascribed to CDK4 (60Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar)) was detected using the phosphospecific pRb (Ser-780) antibody from Cell Signaling Technology. Membranes were then reprobed using the C-22 polyclonal CDK4 antibody, the DCS-22 monoclonal cyclin D3 antibody, and the C-15 polyclonal p27 antibody. Protein A (Pierce and Perbio Science, Erembodegem, Belgium) or an anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham Biosciences), both coupled to horseradish peroxidase, were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Various exposures of the bands corresponding to these proteins were collected on Hyperfilms (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated by laser-scanning densitometry (Ultroscan, Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured in a buffer containing 7 m urea and 2 m thiourea. Proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing using the IPGphor apparatus from Amersham Biosciences and active in-gel rehydratation as described previously (61Gorg A. Obermaier C. Boguth G. Harder A. Scheibe B. Wildgruber R. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1037-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar) on immobilized linear pH gradient (IPG, immobilized pH gradient), pH 3–10, strips (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed for a total of 28,000 Vh starting at 200 V and gradually raising the voltage to 8000 V. The IPG strip was equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 1% DTT and then equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 5% iodoacetamide before loading onto SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels (12.5%) for separation according to molecular mass. After transfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, CDK4, cyclin D3, and p27 were detected as above. Metabolic 32P-labeling of Proteins—1 h before arrest, subconfluent thyrocytes in 10-cm Petri dishes were rinsed twice in phosphate-free DMEM and incubated in 3 ml of phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with non-essential amino acids. [32P]Phosphate (1.7 mCi/ml) was then added for the last 40 min. 32P-Labeled CDK4, cyclin D3, or p27 was immunoprecipitated, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes exactly as above and detected by film autoradiography (two-week exposure). The positions of CDK4, cyclin D3, or p27 in these membranes were then defined by their immunodetection as above by enhanced chemiluminescence. Late G 1 Phase Progression and Phosphorylation of pRb Family Proteins Depend on Sustained cAMP Stimulation—In response to TSH or forskolin, quiescent dog thyrocytes cultured in the presence of insulin progressively enter DNA synthesis phase after approximately 18 h (Fig. 1A) (55Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 57Baptist M. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with forskolin (F) for 16, 20 or 24 h and then rapidly rinsed twice with prewarmed Hepes-buffered DMEM-F-12 medium and subsequently incubated either in forskolin-free control medium or again with forskolin. As shown in Fig. 1A, the fraction of cells having entered S phase gradually increased in cells replaced in the presence of forskolin, whereas cells deprived of forskolin were largely prevented from entering S phase already 2 h after cell rinsing. This confirms that DNA synthesis stimulation by forskolin requires its continuous presence until a late G1 R point (54Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This implies a rate-limiting cAMP-dependent event(s), which must be labile in order to explain the rapid consequence of forskolin deprivation on DNA synthesis initiation. As shown in Fig. 1B, this labile cAMP-dependent event(s) targeted the phosphorylations of pRb family proteins. Upon forskolin withdrawal, the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated forms of pRb, p107, and p130 stopped increasing and progressively disappeared in favor of a reaccumulation of the active hypophosphorylated forms of these proteins. 2Because of a relative increase of total pRb content, 3 h after forskolin deprivation (Fig. 1B , FC3), the still partial diminution of pRb phosphorylation was more apparent upon the reaccumulation of the (active) hypophosphorylated form than upon the reduction of the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form also revealed using the Ser-807/Ser-811 phosphosite-specific pRb antibody. The phosphorylations of pRb at Ser-807 and Ser-811 also progressively declined (Fig. 1B). 2Because of a relative increase of total pRb content, 3 h after forskolin deprivation (Fig. 1B , FC3), the still partial diminution of pRb phosphorylation was more apparent upon the reaccumulation of the (active) hypophosphorylated form than upon the reduction of the slower migrating hyperphosphorylated form also revealed using the Ser-807/Ser-811 phosphosite-specific pRb antibody. As these phosphorylations have been specifically ascribed to CDK4 but not CDK2 (8Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that cAMP may positively control the R point transit by regulating the activity of CDK4. The Activity but Not the Assembly of the Cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 Holoenzyme Depends on Sustained cAMP Stimulation—To confirm that the arrest of stimulation by cAMP decreases the activity of CDK4, we measured the activity of CDK4 co-immunoprecipitated by the specific cyclin D3 monoclonal antibody DCS-28 using a 56-kDa fragment of pRb as a substrate. The phosphorylation of this fragment was detected with a phospho-pRb (Ser-780) antibody (60Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, forskolin stimulated both the assembly of cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 complexes and the pRb kinase activity associated with cyclin D3 (and also p27). 3S. Paternot, K. Coulonval, J. E. Dumont, and P. P. Roger, unpublished data. The subsequent washing out of forskolin did not affect the presence or formation of these complexes for at least 7 h, but it progressively reduced the associated pRb kinase activity of cyclin D3-bound CDK4 (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we conclude that cAMP separately controls the assembly and then the activity of the cyclin D3-CDK4 holoenzyme. cAMP Stimulates the Phosphorylation of CDK4 —In vitro experiments have demonstrated that the activation of CDK4 requires not only its association with a d-type cyclin but also its phosphorylation at Thr-172 by CAK (20Kato J.Y.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of VacA-induced vacuolation, we examined the participation of syntaxin 7 in the human gastric epithelial cell line AGS. Immunocytochemistry revealed that endogenous syntaxin 7 was localized to vacuoles induced by VacA. Northern and Western blotting demonstrated that VacA intoxication increased syntaxin 7 mRNA and protein expression, respectively, in a time-dependent manner.

In contrast, transient transfection of wild-type syntaxin 7, dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 1a, or dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 4 did not alter VacA-induced vacuolation. Furthermore, under VacA treatment, neutral red dye uptake, a parameter of VacA-induced vacuolation, was inhibited in cells stably transfected with mutant syntaxin 7 but not in cells stably transfected with wild-type syntaxin 7, mutant syntaxin 1a, or mutant syntaxin 4. Sequential immunocytochemical observation confirmed that expression of mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect VacA attachment to or internalization into AGS cells.

Sequential immunocytochemical observation confirmed that expression of mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect VacA attachment to or internalization into AGS cells. We suggest that syntaxin 7 is involved in the intracellular vacuolation induced by VacA. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing gastric mucosa, is a major cause of chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers. H. pylori produces several virulence factors, such as urease, the cytotoxin-associated gene A product, and VacA (vacuolating cytotoxin A). VacA is one of the major virulence factors in the pathogenesis that induces H. pylori-related diseases. Previous studies reported that intragastric administration of VacA to mice induced erosion of gastric epithelium (1Telford J.L. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Tecce M.F. Censini S. Covacci A. Xiang Z. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In vitro, VacA induces cytoplasmic vacuolation. The intracellular vacuolation is assumed to represent an early pathophysiological event leading to cell sufferance and eventually to necrosis. These vacuoles induced by VacA contain both a late endosomal marker, rab7, and a lysosomal marker, lgp110, suggesting that they are hybrids of late endosomes and lysosomes (2Papini E. de Bernard M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) reported recently that rab7, a small molecular weight GTP-binding protein that regulates late endosomal trafficking, plays an essential role in VacA-induced vacuolation. More recently, we reported that dynamin, a large molecular weight GTP-binding protein functioning as a mechanochemical enzyme in vesicle formation, is involved in VacA-induced vacuolation (5Suzuki J. Ohnishi H. Shibata H. Wada A. Hirayama T. Iiri T. Ueda N. Kanamaru C. Tsuchida T. Mashima H. Yasuda H. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, we revealed that VacA cytopathic effect on intoxicated cells was also attenuated by inhibiting the dynamin function (5Suzuki J. Ohnishi H. Shibata H. Wada A. Hirayama T. Iiri T. Ueda N. Kanamaru C. Tsuchida T. Mashima H. Yasuda H. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These results suggest that VacA-induced vacuolation is a result of a toxin-induced alteration of intracellular vesicle trafficking and that VacA cytopathic effect can be prevented by inhibiting VacA-induced vacuolation. Thus, the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of VacA-induced vacuolation will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategy for H. pylori-related diseases. However, the molecular mechanism of the final and key step of the VacA-induced vacuolation, that is fusion of late endosome and lysosome resulting in vacuolation, is still unknown. Recently, the SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors; GFP, green fluorescent protein. hypothesis has provided a model for fusion events of intracellular trafficking (6Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are present on cellular membranous organelles including transport vesicles and function to bridge two membranes about to undergo membrane fusion (7Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They form cytoplasmic coiled-coil bundles with other SNARE proteins using their cytoplasmic amphipathic helices and mediate docking and fusion of two membranous organella (7Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). SNARE proteins are classified into Q- and R-SNARE, according whether they contain a glutamine or an arginine, respectively, in the central region of their helical bundles (7Hay J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Of these, syntaxin protein family is a representative of Q-SNARE proteins. A number of syntaxin proteins have been identified with their specific localization and function. Syntaxin 1, 2, 3, and 4 are localized to the plasma membrane and play their roles in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, platelet dense core granule exocytosis, intestinal apical delivery, and glucose transporter 4 translocation, respectively (8Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W.

Syntaxin 5, present on Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, functions in vesicular transport between them. Syntaxin 6 on trans-Golgi network and endosome operates in that between trans-Golgi-network and endosome (8Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 11Hay J.C. Klumperman J. Oorschot V. Steegmaier M. Kuo C.S. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1489-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel member of syntaxin family, syntaxin 7, was identified and characterized. It was localized on both late endosome and lysosome and was elucidated to play a crucial role in the physiological heterotypic fusion of late endosome and lysosome (12Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Ward D.M. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because VacA-induced intracellular vacuoles are supposed to be hybrids of late endosomes and lysosomes, we hypothesized that syntaxin 7 may participate in VacA-induced vacuolation. We investigated the role of syntaxin 7 in the VacA-induced vacuole formation in the present study. Here, we demonstrated that endogenous syntaxin 7 are localized to VacA-induced vacuoles and that the expression level of endogenous syntaxin 7 was enhanced in VacA-intoxicated cells. We also showed that both transiently and stably transfected dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 7, which lacks the transmembrane domain, inhibited VacA-induced vacuolation. We concluded that syntaxin 7 is involved in the molecular mechanism of VacA-induced vacuolation. Cell Culture, Purification, and Activation of VacA and Intoxication of Cells—AGS cells, a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, were provided by Dr. Hiroyuki Mutoh (Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. VacA cytotoxin was purified from the toxin-producing strain H. pylori ATCC49503 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), according to the reported procedures (14Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Padilla P.I. Wada A. Hirayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and then it was activated with acidic pH treatment as described (15Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H.

For VacA intoxication, cells were treated with 1 μg/ml activated VacA at 37 °C. Transiently transfected cells were treated with VacA 24 h after transfection. Vacuolation was examined 18 h after VacA intoxication. DNA and Plasmid Constructions—Full-length human syntaxin 7 cDNA and dominant-negative mutant cDNAs of human syntaxin 4 (3–273 amino acids) and syntaxin 7 (2–234 amino acids), lacking their carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic regions, were amplified by PCR from human liver and brain cDNA libraries (provided by Dr. Yukio Horikawa, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan). Dominant-negative mutant cDNA of human syntaxin 1a (2–260 amino acids) was amplified by PCR using full-length human syntaxin 1a cDNA (a gift of Dr. Tetsuro Izumi, University of Gunma) as a template. PCR was performed with the following primers: syntaxin 1a mutant, 5′-GGGTCTAGAAAG-GACCGAACCCAG-GAGCTCCGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTACTACTTGCTCTGG-TACTTGACGGCCTTC-3′ (antisense); syntaxin 4 mutant, 5′-GACAGGACCCACG-AGCTGAGACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTATTTCTTCTTCCTCGCCTTCT-3′ (antisense); syntaxin 7 mutant, 5′-TCTAGATCTTACACTCCAGGAGTTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTACTATCTGGATTTGCGCTGATAATC-3′ (antisense); full-length syntaxin 7, 5′-TCTAGATCTTACACTCCAGGAGTTGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCATCAGTGGTT-CAATCCCCATATG-3′ (antisense). Amplified cDNAs were verified by sequencing and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and expressed as GFP fusion proteins. We used a pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen) as a control plasmid for mock transfection. Transfection—Transfection procedures were performed using LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. AGS cells were seeded at a density of 105/cm2 and transfected with constructed plasmids described above. For selecting stably transfected cell lines, geneticin-resistant clones were screened and then their potential to express transfected GFP-tagged proteins was confirmed by observing the GFP signals by fluorescence microscopy. Antibodies—Anti-syntaxin 7 rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-VacA rabbit polyclonal antibody were prepared as described (12Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K. Wada A. Moss J.

Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoReserch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, and incubated sequentially with Blocking Ace (Snow Brand Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan), first antibodies, and secondary antibodies. Samples were examined under a Nikon E-600 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured and digitized using a Spot charged coupled device camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and then edited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Western Blotting—For electrophoresis, 20 μg of protein from each sample per lane was loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and run at 200 V. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 30 V for 3 h. Western blotting was done as described previously (16Ohnishi H. Samuelson L.C. Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Williams J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3044-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent to visualize the secondary antibody. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was performed as described previously (17Mashima H. Yamada S. Tajima T. Seno M. Yamada H. Takeda J. Kojima I. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20-μg total RNA extracted from the cells was denatured and blotted onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probe and washed at a final stringency of 0.1× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min before exposure to x-ray film. Neutral Red Dye Uptake Assay—AGS cells were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then treated with VacA and incubated for a further 18 h. After the incubation, the vacuolation rate induced by VacA was examined by the method described (15Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K. Wada A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36693-36699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), in which uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. The potential differences in cell numbers of each preparation were corrected by measuring the protein concentration of each sample. Neutral red uptake into VacA-induced vacuoles was expressed as a percentage of neutral red accumulation into VacA-induced vacuoles in GFP mock-transfected cells. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Localization of Endogenous Syntaxin 7 to VacA-induced Vacuoles in AGS Cells—In the first attempt to investigate whether syntaxin 7 participates in the VacA-induced vacuolization in AGS cells, we examined the localization of endogenous syntaxin 7 in VacA-treated and untreated AGS cells by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1, endogenous syntaxin 7 was localized to the perinuclear region of the untreated cells, consistent with the previous observation that syntaxin 7 is present on late endosomes and lysosomes (12Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Ward D.M. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In VacA-treated AGS cells, in contrast, endogenous syntaxin 7 was localized to vacuoles induced by VacA. These data suggest the involvement of syntaxin 7 in VacA-induced vacuolization in AGS cells. VacA Increased the Expression of Syntaxin 7 mRNA and Protein in AGS Cells—We next examined the expression of endogenous syntaxin 7 in VacA-treated AGS cells by both Northern and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, VacA intoxication increased the expression of syntaxin 7 mRNA in AGS cells in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, Western blotting revealed that the amount of syntaxin 7 protein in AGS cells was also increased by VacA (Fig. 2B). At 12 to 24 h after VacA intoxication, the expression of both syntaxin 7 mRNA and protein reached the maximum. Because VacA-induced vacuolation is also accomplished at the same time point (data not shown), the increase of syntaxin 7 by VacA was well accompanied with that of intracellular vacuolation. These results, as well as its subcellular localization (Fig. 1), suggest that syntaxin 7 participates in the VacA-induced vacuolation in AGS cells. Transient Transfection of Dominant-negative Mutant Syntaxin 7 Inhibits the VacA-induced Vacuolation in AGS Cells— We next investigated participation of syntaxin 7 in VacA-induced vacuolation by a different approach. We generated AGS cells transiently overexpressing either GFP-tagged wild-type syntaxin 7 or dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 7. The cytosolic part of syntaxin 7 protein interacts with its counterpart to form a SNARE complex. The SNARE complex mediates the docking and fusion of the two compartments by functioning as a linker. However, mutant syntaxin 7, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region, is expected to compete with endogenous syntaxin 7 in binding with other SNARE proteins. Thus, mutant syntaxin 7 acts as a dominant-negative syntaxin 7 as shown in previous studies (12Nakamura N. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6523-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Ward D.M. Pevsner J. Scullion M.A. Vaughn M. Kaplan J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, overexpressed GFP-tagged wild-type syntaxin 7 changed its intracellular localization from the perinuclear region (panels A and E) to the vacuoles after VacA intoxication (panels B and F). This is consistent with the localization of endogenous syntaxin 7 to VacA-induced vacuoles (Fig. 1). In contrast, most overexpressed GFP-tagged mutant syntaxin 7 was localized to cytoplasm uniformly in both VacA-treated (panel D) and untreated cells (panel C). The mutant syntaxin 7 inhibited the VacA-induced vacuolation in VacA-treated AGS cells (panels D and H, arrowheads), whereas overexpressed wild-type syntaxin 7 did not affect the VacA-induced vacuolation in AGS cells (panels B and F, arrows). For quantitative estimations, we compared the numbers of vacuolated cells under each experimental condition. To investigate the specific inhibitory effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on VacA-induced vacuolation, we utilized GFP-tagged dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 1a and syntaxin 4 as controls. When expressed in AGS cells, these control mutant syntaxins were localized to cytoplasm in the similar manner to that of mutant syntaxin 7 (data not shown). As depicted in Fig. 4, the inhibitory effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on VacA-induced vacuolation was statistically significant. In contrast, either mutant syntaxin 1a or mutant syntaxin 4 did not inhibit VacA-induced vacuolation. These data indicate that mutant syntaxin 7 specifically inhibited VacA-induced vacuolation, suggesting the syntaxin 7 involvement in the molecular machinery of VacA-induced vacuolation.Fig. 4Numbers of vacuolated cells in AGS cells transiently transfected with GFP-tagged mutant syntaxins, wild-type syntaxin 7, or GFP alone. Results are expressed as percent of vacuolated cells. Values are means ± S.E. for four independent experiments with triplicate determination in which more than 100 cells were scored. The number of VacA-induced vacuolated cells in mutant syntaxin 7-tranfected AGS cells was significantly lower than those in cells transfected with other plasmids. *, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Stable Transfection of Mutant Syntaxin 7 on Neutral Red Dye Uptake into VacA-treated AGS Cells—For another quantitative estimation of the inhibitory effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on VacA-induced vacuolation, we constructed AGS cell lines stably transfected with mutant syntaxin 7, wild-type syntaxin 7, mutant syntaxin 1a, mutant syntaxin 4, or GFP alone. Using these cell lines, we examined the neutral red dye uptake under VacA-exposure condition. Because neutral red dye is predominantly taken up by acidic lumen of the vacuoles, it has been used as a quantitative marker for VacA-induced vacuolation (5Suzuki J. Ohnishi H. Shibata H. Wada A.

We established clones that expressed GFP-tagged mutant syntaxin 7, wild-type syntaxin 7, mutant syntaxin 1a, or mutant syntaxin 4 proteins (Fig. 5A). In stably transfected cells, GFP-tagged mutant syntaxin proteins were localized to cytoplasm (Fig. 5A , panels a–c), whereas GFP-tagged wild-type syntaxin 7 was localized to perinuclear region (Fig. 5A , panel d). Their intracellular localizations were consistent with those in transiently transfected cells (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 5B, mutant syntaxin 7 inhibited neutral red dye uptake into VacA-treated cells compared with that into cells with GFP mock transfection, whereas wild-type syntaxin 7, mutant syntaxin 1a or mutant syntaxin 4 did not alter neutral red dye uptake under VacA-exposed condition. These data indicate again that mutant syntaxin 7 specifically inhibited VacA-induced vacuolation, suggesting the direct involvement of syntaxin 7 in the VacA-induced vacuolation mechanism. Mutant Syntaxin 7 Does Not Affect the VacA Internalization into AGS Cells—Syntaxin 7 functions physiologically in endocytotic pathways. Although our observation with transfection approaches strongly suggest direct involvement of syntaxin 7 in VacA-induced vacuolation, the possibility still remained that the inhibitory effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on VacA-induced vacuolation might be a result from a block of VacA internalization into AGS cells. To exclude this possibility, we examined the effect of mutant syntaxin 7 on the VacA internalization into AGS cells. AGS cells were transiently transfected with mutant syntaxin 7, and the time course of VacA internalization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 6, signals of VacA toxin staining were observed at the plasma membranes in both transfected and non-transfected cells after 1 h of incubation with VacA. This indicates that mutant syntaxin 7 did not affect VacA binding to AGS cells. After 3 h of incubation with VacA, intracellular signals of VacA staining were detected in cytoplasm of both mutant syntaxin 7-expressing and nonexpressing cells. We followed VacA localization until 6 h after incubation and found that intracellular signals of VacA staining were localized to the perinuclear region in both GFP-tagged mutant syntaxin 7-transfected and non-transfected cells. These data indicate that dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 7 does not affect either binding or internalization of VacA to AGS cells and that syntaxin 7 is directly involved in molecular mechanism of VacA-induced vacuole formation. In the present study, we have demonstrated the participation of syntaxin 7 in the VacA-induced vacuolation in AGS cells. We showed that both endogenous and overexpressed wild-type syntaxin 7 localized to the vacuoles induced by VacA. Moreover, VacA increased the expression of both syntaxin 7 mRNA and protein. Mutant syntaxin 7 inhibited the VacA-induced vacuolation in both transiently and stably transfected AGS cells, without affecting VacA internalization. From these lines of evidence, we concluded that syntaxin 7 directly participates in VacA-induced vacuolation in AGS cells. VacA-induced vacuole has been assumed to be a hybrid of late endosome and lysosome, because both late endosomal marker rab7 and lysosomal marker lgp110 are colocalized (2Papini E. de Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9720-9724Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Molinari M. Galli C. Norais N. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Luzio J.P. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25339-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear whether the vacuole is formed as a result of the fusion of late endosome and lysosome. rab7 is physiologically localized to late endosome and regulates intracellular transport around late endosomes (18Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). However, rab7 is not an integral membrane protein of late endosome membrane but is cycling between late endosome membranes and cytosol. Thus, rab7 localization to VacA-induced vacuoles might not result from late endosome fusion but might be the aberrant targeting caused by VacA-intoxication. By contrast, lgp110 is an integral membrane protein of lysosome, and its existence on VacA-induced vacuole indicates that the vacuole is, at least partly, consisting of lysosome. Although lgp110 has been shown to play a role in the fusion of lysosome and autophagosome (19Tanaka Y. Guhde G. Suter A. Eskelinen E.L. Hartmann D. Lullmann-Rauch R. Janssen P.M. Blanz J. von Figura K. Saftig P. Nature. 2000; 406: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), its participation in lysosome and late endosome fusion has not been described. Syntaxin 7 is also an integral membrane protein present on both late endosome and lysosome and functions in their heterotypic fusion as a compartment of SNARE complex with other SNARE proteins. Thus, our observations that both endogenous and overexpressed syntaxin 7 are localized to VacA-induced vacuoles reinforce that the vacuole results from the fusion of late endosome and lysosome. The phenomenon that expression of both syntaxin 7 mRNA and protein in AGS cell was enhanced by the exposure to VacA strongly suggests that syntaxin 7 is involved in the VacA-induced vacuolation. It was reported that syntaxin 7 is widely expressed in tissues and regulates a membrane transport with late endosomes and lysosomes of mammalian cells (20Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the expression level of syntaxin 7 varied with tissues and cell lines. In B16 melanoma cells, syntaxin 7 was shown to function in melanogenesis. Syntaxin 7 in B16 melanoma cells was present at about 10-fold higher than in other tissues and cell lines, and it was up-regulated upon the induction of melanogenesis (21Wade N. Bryant N.J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19820-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that elevated expression level of syntaxin 7 facilitated melanogenesis that is, in part, related to lysosomal biogenesis. In the analogy of melanogenesis, our current observation suggests that VacA induces the up-regulation of syntaxin 7 expression to facilitate the intracellular vacuolation. Recently, de Bernard et al. (22de Bernard M. Moschioni M. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Montecucco C. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that VacA-induced vacuolation did not depend on late endosomal SNAREs. Using a procedure of microinjection of anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies into cells, they revealed that anti-syntaxin 7 antibodies did not affect VacA-induced vacuolation and concluded that syntaxin 7 did not participate in the VacA-induced vacuolation. In our study, however, the localization and the elevated expression of syntaxin 7 strongly suggest its involvement in the VacA-induced vacuolation. Moreover, the direct participation of syntaxin 7 in VacA-induced vacuolation was ascertained by showing the inhibitory effects of dominant-negative mutant syntaxin 7 in two different experiments, counting vacuolated cell numbers among transiently transfected cells and determining neutral red uptake in stably transfected cells. The obvious discrepancy between de Bernard's group and ours may be ascribed to the difference of procedures used in the studies. It is noteworthy to point out that we used AGS cells originated from human gastric epithelial cells, a relevant target of VacA cytotoxin, whereas de Bernard et al. (22de Bernard M. Moschioni M. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Montecucco C. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) used HeLa cells that originated from human uterine epithelial cells. As described above, the endogenous level of syntaxin 7 varied with tissues and cell lines (20Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3137-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Wade N. Bryant N.J. Connolly L.M. Simpson R.J. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19820-19827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the difference of the cell lines used in the studies may also resulted in the discrepancy of the findings. Our immunocytochemistry data that VacA cytotoxin is internalized even into cells expressing mutant syntaxin 7 are important. They reinforce that the dominant-negative syntaxin 7 mutant inhibited VacA-induced vacuolation by blocking endogenous syntaxin 7 but not by perturbing VacA internalization into cells. Various cytotoxins enter target cells through a vesicular endocytosis-dependent or -independent pathway or both. Although the mechanism of VacA internalization into target cells has been still unclear (23Garner J.A. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reported recently (5Suzuki J. Ohnishi H. Shibata H. Wada A. Hirayama T. Iiri T. Ueda N. Kanamaru C. Tsuchida T. Mashima H. Yasuda H. Fujita T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that VacA internalization into cells is independent of early endocytotic pathway. Moreover, we showed in the current study that VacA internalization into cells was not blocked by mutant syntaxin 7, suggesting that VacA internalization is independent of late endocytotic pathway. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that VacA is internalized, at least in part, by a mechanism distinct from the early and late endocytotic machinery. In conclusion, we have shown that syntaxin 7 is involved in the molecular machinery of VacA-induced vacuolation. These observations provide new insights related to the molecular pathogenesis of gastroduodenal disease by the H. pylori bacterium.

https://openalex.org/W2044643226,"DNA of all living organisms is constantly modified by exogenous and endogenous reagents. The mutagenic threat of modifications such as methylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic deamination of DNA bases is counteracted by base excision repair (BER). This process is initiated by the action of one of several DNA glycosylases, which removes the aberrant base and thus initiates a cascade of events that involves scission of the DNA backbone, removal of the baseless sugar-phosphate residue, filling in of the resulting single nucleotide gap, and ligation of the remaining nick. We were interested to find out how the BER process functions in hyperthermophiles, organisms growing at temperatures around 100 °C, where the rates of these spontaneous reactions are greatly accelerated. In our previous studies, we could show that the crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum has at least three uracil-DNA glycosylases, Pa-UDGa, Pa-UDGb, and Pa-MIG, that can initiate the BER process by catalyzing the removal of uracil residues arising through the spontaneous deamination of cytosines. We now report that the genome of P. aerophilum encodes also the remaining functions necessary for BER and show that a system consisting of four P. aerophilum encoded enzymes, Pa-UDGb, AP endonuclease IV, DNA polymerase B2, and DNA ligase, can efficiently repair a G·U mispair in an oligonucleotide substrate to a G·C pair. Interestingly, the efficiency of the in vitro repair reaction was stimulated by Pa-PCNA1, the processivity clamp of DNA polymerases.

Interestingly, the efficiency of the in vitro repair reaction was stimulated by Pa-PCNA1, the processivity clamp of DNA polymerases. Most hyperthermophiles, organisms living at temperatures of around 100 °C, belong to Archaea (1Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5088-5090Google Scholar), the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes (2Keeling P.J. Doolittle W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5761-5764Google Scholar). Two key pathways of DNA metabolism, transcription and replication, are highly conserved among Archaea and eukaryotes (3Bell S.D. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Kosa P.F. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15218-15222Google Scholar, 4Cann I.K. Ishino Y. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1249-1267Google Scholar), and we were interested to learn whether these similarities extended also to the third domain of DNA metabolism, namely DNA repair. We chose to study the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, the genomic sequence of which has recently become available (5Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Google Scholar). DNA repair processes can be classified into three major categories: damage reversal, recombination repair, and excision repair. The last can be further subdivided into three biochemical pathways: nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and base excision repair (BER). 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; dRP, deoxyribose-phosphate; pol-β and -δ, polymerase-β and -δ, respectively; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; ORF, open reading frame; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; WCE, whole cell-free extract; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AP, abasic (apyrimidinic or apurinic); RAP, reduced AP; nt, nucleotide; ExoI, -II, and -III, exonuclease I, II, and III, respectively; EndoIV, endonuclease IV. 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; dRP, deoxyribose-phosphate; pol-β and -δ, polymerase-β and -δ, respectively; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; ORF, open reading frame; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; WCE, whole cell-free extract; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; AP, abasic (apyrimidinic or apurinic); RAP, reduced AP; nt, nucleotide; ExoI, -II, and -III, exonuclease I, II, and III, respectively; EndoIV, endonuclease IV. Sequence similarity searches for DNA repair genes in P. aerophilum revealed that the organism apparently lacks key representatives of several of these pathways. Thus, we found only a single representative of the damage reversal class, O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, which is present in most Archaea (6Skorvaga M. Raven N.D. Margison G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6711-6715Google Scholar), and two copies of the RecA/RAD51 recombinase homologue RadA. It is not known whether the latter genes encode functional polypeptides, since the genome of this organism appears to carry little evidence of recombination events (5Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Google Scholar). This implies that recombination repair may be rather infrequent, as shown for Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (7Reilly M.S. Grogan D.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 208: 29-34Google Scholar), a close relative of P. aerophilum. Only two putative homologues of mammalian nucleotide excision repair enzymes, the DNA helicases XPB and XPD (5Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Google Scholar), could be found, and it is presently unclear whether these proteins are involved in DNA repair or transcription, as components of the transcription factor TFIIH (8Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 22-33Google Scholar). Like other Archaea, the genome of P. aerophilum carries no homologues of the mismatch repair genes mutS and mutL. Although this does not rule out the existence of a mismatch repair system, the mutation frequency in P. aerophilum is rather high, especially in mononucleotide repeats, which is consistent with the absence of a mismatch repair pathway (5Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Google Scholar). The remaining pathway, BER, is responsible for the removal of the largest fraction of DNA damage, which is mainly associated with the modification or loss of DNA bases through hydrolysis, oxidation, or methylation. Spontaneous hydrolytic reactions lead to deamination of cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and adenine in DNA to give rise to uracil, thymine, and hypoxanthine, respectively, or to the loss of purines. Given that the rates of most chemical reactions double with each 10 °C increase in temperature, it is to be expected that the DNA of hyperthermophiles, which live at temperatures around 100 °C, would be modified to a much greater extent than that of organisms living in ambient environments. Correspondingly, BER would be expected to assume greater importance for the survival of the former organisms. Our earlier studies appear to substantiate this hypothesis, since the 2.2-megabase pair genome of P. aerophilum encodes at least three different uracil-DNA glycosylases, Pa-MIG, Pa-UDGa, and Pa-UDGb (9Yang H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Marcotte E.M. Tai J.H. Hyman E.C. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1272-1279Google Scholar, 10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar, 11Sartori A.A. Fitz-Gibbon S. Yang H. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3182-3191Google Scholar), which initiate the repair of cytosine deamination by excising uracil from DNA (reviewed in Refs. 12Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Google Scholar, 13Lindahl T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: xvii-xxxxGoogle Scholar, 14Scharer O.D. Jiricny J. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 270-281Google Scholar). The glycosylase-mediated removal of damaged or modified bases gives rise to abasic (apyrimidinic or apurinic) sites (AP sites) in the DNA, which are noncoding and therefore highly mutagenic (15Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Their repair involves in the first instance an AP endonuclease-catalyzed incision of the sugar-phosphate backbone at the 5′-side of the AP site, which gives rise to a single-strand break, where the upstream fragment is terminated with a free 3′-hydroxyl group, whereas the downstream one carries a baseless deoxyribose-phosphate (dRP) residue at its 5′ terminus. In mammalian cells, the subsequent processing of the incised AP sites can be accomplished by one of two distinct pathways: short patch BER, the preferred mechanism that results in the replacement of a single nucleotide residue, and long patch BER, where the repair tracts are 2–6 nucleotides long (16Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 3-27Google Scholar). In the short patch pathway, DNA polymerase β (pol-β) extends the upstream fragment by a single nucleotide, and concomitantly removes the dRP moiety by β-elimination (17Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar). The DNA ligase III-XRCC1 complex (18Vidal A.E. Boiteux S. Hickson I.D. Radicella J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Google Scholar, 19Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Google Scholar) then seals the remaining nick. In long patch BER, the upstream primer is thought to be extended by pol-β (or pol-δ) by 2–6 nucleotides, which results in the displacement of the dRP residue as part of a “flap” oligonucleotide (20Podlutsky A.J. Dianova II Podust V.N. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1477-1482Google Scholar). This short overhang is then excised by the flap-endonuclease (FEN1), and the resulting nick is sealed by DNA ligase I. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) may also be involved in this process, since it was found to enhance the pol-β-dependent long patch BER by stimulating the activity of FEN1 and to interact with DNA ligase I (21Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Google Scholar, 22Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L. Park M.S. Matsumoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4354-4363Google Scholar). The long patch pathway may be important for the repair of reduced or oxidized AP sites, in which the modified dRP residues are resistant to pol-β-catalyzed β-elimination reactions (21Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Google Scholar). We set out to explore the BER system of P. aerophilum, the genome of which carries, in addition to the above mentioned DNA glycosylase genes, also genes encoding orthologues of downstream-acting BER proteins: one putative AP endonuclease, three putative DNA polymerases of the B family, one putative DNA ligase, and PCNA1, which was already shown to interact with FEN1, UDGa, and PolB3 from P. aerophilum (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Google Scholar). We expressed these proteins in Escherichia coli and analyzed their ability to catalyze the repair of a G·U mispair in a double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate. Below, we show that efficient repair of this substrate can be accomplished by the P. aerophilum proteins UDGb, AP endonuclease IV, DNA polymerase B2, and DNA ligase. The putative role of Pa-PCNA1 in this process is also discussed. Reagents and Oligonucleotides—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland) and were purified by PAGE. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and E. coli UDG were supplied by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pfu DNA polymerase and Taq DNA polymerase were from Stratagene and Qiagen, respectively. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Amresco, Epicentre Technologies, or Merck and were of analytical grade purity. P. aerophilum Extracts and Purified Proteins—P. aerophilum cultures were grown in the laboratory of Jeffrey Miller (University of California, Los Angeles, CA), and cell-free extracts were prepared by Mahmud Shivji as described previously (24Hudepohl U. Reiter W.D. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5851-5855Google Scholar). The cell-free extract was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× “Complete™, EDTA-free” (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor mixture and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT. The protein concentration was estimated to be 4 mg/ml as determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Aliquots were stored at –80 °C. The recombinant P. aerophilum uracil-DNA glycosylases Pa-UDGa and Pa-UDGb were expressed and purified as described previously (10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar, 11Sartori A.A. Fitz-Gibbon S. Yang H. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3182-3191Google Scholar). The purified recombinant wild-type human DNA polymerase-β was a kind gift of Samuel H. Wilson (Laboratory of Structural Biology, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). Bacterial Strains and Expression Plasmids—The E. coli strain DH5α was used in all cloning experiments and for plasmid amplifications, and the strain BL21 (DE3) was used for protein expression (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.9-A.10Google Scholar). The plasmid pET28c(+) (Novagen) was used for bacterial expression of N-terminal His6-tagged proteins. The plasmids pQE30-PaPolB3 and pQE30-PaPCNA1 for bacterial overexpression of full-length P. aerophilum proteins DNA polymerase B3 (Pa-PolB3; PAE2109: 785 amino acids, 89.5 kDa) and PCNA1 (Pa-PCNA1; PAE3038: 249 amino acids, 28 kDa) containing an N-terminal His6 tag were a kind gift of Hanjing Yang (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). The gene encoding Pa-PCNA1 was subloned from pQE30 into pET28c(+) vector using NdeI and HindIII restriction sites. Computational Analyses and Cloning of the P. aerophilum AP Endonuclease IV, DNA Ligase, and DNA Polymerase B2 Genes (Pa-EndoIV, Pa-DNA Ligase, and Pa-PolB3)—The open reading frames PAE3257 (275 amino acids, 31.1 kDa), PAE833 (589 amino acids, 65.1 kDa), and PAE1113 (553 amino acids, 61.5 kDa) encoding the putative proteins Pa-EndoIV, Pa-DNA ligase, and Pa-PolB2, respectively, were identified in the complete genome sequence of P. aerophilum (5Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Google Scholar). Analyses of the P. aerophilum genome were performed using the Genetics Computer Group program package, version 10 (27Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Google Scholar); for other data base searches, we used the BLAST and ENTREZ services available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Web site (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The respective open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by PCR from P. aerophilum genomic DNA using the following sense (s) and antisense (as) primers for subsequent cloning into pET28c(+) vector (restriction sites are in boldface type): EndoIV-s (5′-GGATCGCTAGCATGGCAAAGGTATATCTGGGGCCTGC-3′) and EndoIV-as (5′-GTACGGATCCCTATGCCAAGTTTACGCCGACTTGC-3′); PolB2-s (5′-GGATCCATATGTTCGTAATTGGGGCCAGGCCG-3′) and PolB2-as (5′-GTACCTCGAGTCATATAAGCCTTAAGGCGCGTAACTTCC-3′); DNA ligase-s (5′-GGATCCATATGGGTAGTATATACGTGCAGTTTGGGGAG) and DNA ligase-as (5′-GTACGGATCCCTACTCGGGCTGAACCACTTTTTTCTGC). Expression of the Recombinant Pa-EndoIV, Pa-DNA Ligase, Pa-PolB2, Pa-PolB3, and Pa-PCNA1 Proteins—The His6-tagged fusion proteins were produced by transforming E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells with the respective expression constructs (pET28-PaEndoIV, pET28-PaDNA-Ligase, and pET28-PaPolB2). Following incubation overnight at 30 °C on selective LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-kan) and 2% d-glucose, single colonies were picked and grown overnight at 30 °C in 20 ml of LB-kan medium supplemented with 2% d-glucose. The saturated cultures were diluted 1:100 in 1 liter of LB-kan medium and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5–0.8. The cultures were cooled down to 30 °C, and the overexpression of the recombinant proteins was induced with 250 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were then grown overnight at 30 °C and pelleted by centrifugation (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 4000 rpm, 30 min) at 4 °C. The recombinant Pa-PolB3 protein (PAE2109; 785 amino acids, 89.5 kDa) was overexpressed using the above procedure, except that the BL21 (DE3) cells were co-transformed with two plasmids at once: the expression construct pQE30-PaPolB3, bearing the gene for ampicillin resistance, and pREP4, bearing the gene for kanamycin resistance. Therefore, both LB agar plates and LB medium had to be supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin. The pREP4 plasmid constitutively expresses the Lac repressor protein encoded by the lacI gene to reduce the basal level of expression (Qiagen). The recombinant Pa-PCNA1 protein (PAE3038; 249 amino acids, 28 kDa) was produced by transforming E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells with the pET28-PaPCNA1 expression construct. Following incubation overnight at 30 °C on selective LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin (LB-kan) and 2% d-glucose, a single colony was picked and grown overnight at 30 °C in 20 ml of LB-kan medium supplemented with 2% d-glucose. The saturated culture was diluted 1:100 in 1 liter of LB-kan medium and grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 1.0. The culture was cooled to room temperature, and the overexpression of the recombinant protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After growing the cells overnight at 30 °C, they were pelleted by centrifugation as above. Purification of Pa-EndoIV and Pa-DNA Ligase—The cell pellets were resuspended in 3 ml/g of ice-cold sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed by sonication with 25 × 10-s bursts on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble fraction of the whole cell-free extract was heat-treated for 30 min at 70 °C, and the precipitated E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation as above. The supernatant, containing only thermostable proteins, was incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated in sonication buffer. The suspension was then packed into a disposable column, and unbound proteins were eluted with sonication buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (1 × 20 ml of 5 mm imidazole and 3 × 10 ml of 20 mm imidazole). The His6-tagged protein was eluted with 3 × 1 ml of sonication buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. These fractions were pooled and diluted to 100 mm NaCl in Buffer A (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap Q Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The flow-through containing the recombinant protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of Buffer A supplemented with 25 mm NaCl and loaded onto a 1-ml Hi-Trap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was extensively washed with Buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with a 5-ml linear gradient of 25–700 mm NaCl. The nearly homogenous Pa-EndoIV and Pa-DNA ligase eluted at around 300 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Purification of Pa-PolB2—The procedure, including Ni2+-NTA purification, was as above, except that the heat treatment had to be omitted since Pa-PolB2 was found to be less stable at higher temperatures. The 250 mm imidazole fractions containing Pa-PolB2 were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of Buffer A supplemented with 50 mm NaCl. The sample was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono-S FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was extensively washed with Buffer A. The proteins were then eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 50–700 mm NaCl. The nearly homogenous Pa-PolB2 protein eluted as a major peak in fractions containing 350–450 mm NaCl. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Purification of Pa-PolB3—Pa-PolB3 was purified similarly to Pa-EndoIV and Pa-DNA ligase, except that the heat treatment was done at 80 °C, as the protein exhibited the highest thermostability of all of the proteins tested. After Ni2+-NTA purification, the 250 mm imidazole fractions containing >95% pure Pa-PolB3 were pooled and dialyzed overnight. Purification of Pa-PCNA1—The cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml/g of ice-cold sonication buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed by sonication on ice. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was incubated with gentle shaking for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The suspension was then packed into a disposable column, and unbound proteins were eluted with sonication buffer containing increasing concentrations of imidazole (1 × 20 ml of 10 mm imidazole and 3 × 10 ml of 50 mm imidazole). The His6-tagged Pa-PCNA1 protein was eluted with 3 × 1 ml of sonication buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. These fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of ion exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a Resource Q FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was extensively washed with buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 10–700 mm NaCl. The nearly homogenous protein eluted at around 300 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The concentrations of the recombinant proteins, as measured by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and verified by SDS-PAGE analysis, were as follows: Pa-EndoIV ≈ 150 μg/ml, Pa-DNA ligase ≈ 500 μg/ml, Pa-PolB2 ≈ 300 μg/ml, Pa-PolB3 ≈ 30 μg/ml, and Pa-PCNA1 ≈ 7.72 mg/ml. All proteins were stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Base Excision Repair Assay Using P. aerophilum Whole Cell-free Extract (WCE)—The fluorescently labeled substrates, containing either a single-nucleotide gap (1-nt gap) or a G·U mismatch at a defined position, were prepared as follows: 1-nt gap, the labeled 23-mer-F and 36-mer oligonucleotides were annealed with the complementary 60-mer G oligonucleotide; G·U, the labeled 60-mer U-F was annealed with the 60-mer G oligonucleotide according to the protocol described previously (10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab All repair reactions (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NAD, 50 mm NaCl, 5 pmol of unlabeled single-stranded 50-mer oligonucleotide (50-mer G), and 1 pmol of labeled substrates. Essential cofactors, such as 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm each dNTP, and 2 mm ATP, were added as indicated in Fig. 1A. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μg of P. aerophilum WCE and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 60 °C. In the cases indicated, repair was completed by the addition of T4 DNA ligase, since the ligation step in the WCE was inefficient. After further incubation for 1 h at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (500 μg/ml Proteinase K, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C. The DNA samples were then precipitated, and the products were analyzed as described previously (10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar). AP Endonuclease Assays—DNA substrate oligonucleotides containing a single AP site were prepared by incubating the labeled G·U* substrate with E. coli UDG for 20 min at 37 °C (the asterisk denotes the labeled strand). The homoduplex 60-mer substrate (G·C*) was obtained by annealing the 60-mer G with the labeled 60-mer C-F oligonucleotide. Where recombinant proteins were used, the standard AP endonuclease reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 ng/μl BSA. Whenever the P. aerophilum WCE was used, the same buffer described above was employed, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Incubation times and temperatures varied as indicated in the figures. After precipitation, the DNA pellets were dissolved in 90% formamide supplemented with 50 mm NaBH4 in order to prevent spontaneous hydrolytic cleavage of the labile AP sites prior to analyzing the samples as described (10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar). DNA Polymerase Assays—The primer extension ability of the DNA polymerases was compared using a substrate prepared by annealing the 5′-labeled 23-mer-F primer with the 60-mer G template oligonucleotide (listed in Table I), illustrated in Fig. 3A. Unless otherwise mentioned, the standard reaction mixtures contained, in a 20-μl volume, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 ng/μl BSA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm dNTP, 1 pmol of the labeled substrate, and purified recombinant DNA polymerases. Incubation conditions varied as indicated in the figures. The reaction products were separated on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels, and the bands were visualized on a Fluoro-Imager (Storm 860; Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (10Sartori A.A. Schar P. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29979-29986Google Scholar). For 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity on single strands, the degradation of the labeled 23-mer-F primer was analyzed. 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity on double strands was measured using the same substrate as for DNA polymerizing activity. Intrinsic 3′ → 5′ proofreading features of different DNA polymerases were assayed in the absence of dNTPs. A 20 mm stock solution of the polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of aphidicolin (Calbiochem) in 150 μl of 100% Me2SO. In DNA polymerase inhibition reactions, 2 mm aphidicolin was preincubated with the DNA polymerase prior to adding the enzyme to the reaction mixtures. A 5 mm stock solution of ddCTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and used in a 10:1 ratio with 100 μm dNTPs in standard reaction mixtures. Wherever indicated, 500 ng of recombinant purified Pa-PCNA1 was included in the reactions, corresponding to ∼5 pmol of the functional trimeric complex (23Yang H. Chiang J.H. Fitz-Gibbon S. Lebel M. Sartori A.A. Jiricny J. Slupska M.M. Miller J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22271-22278Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—In EMSA reactions (10 μl), Pa-UDGb (5 pmol), Pa-PolB3 (2 pmol), and Pa-PolB2 (1 and 2 pmol) were incubated in the presence or absence of Pa-PCNA1 (500 ng) with 1 pmol of labeled 60-mer substrates (1-nt gap or G·C*) and 10 pmol of unlabeled G·C competitor DNA in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C"
https://openalex.org/W2060549651,"A truncated form (ΔnMDH2) of yeast cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) lacking 12 residues on the amino terminus was found to be inadequate for gluconeogenic function in vivo because the mutant enzyme fails to restore growth of a Δmdh2 strain on minimal medium with ethanol or acetate as the carbon source. The ΔnMDH2 enzyme was also previously found to be refractory to the rapid glucose-induced inactivation and degradation observed for authentic MDH2. In contrast, kinetic properties measured for purified forms of MDH2 and ΔnMDH2 enzymes are very similar. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicate weak interactions between MDH2 and yeast phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) and between MDH2 and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1). These interactions are not observed for ΔnMDH2, suggesting that differences in cellular function between authentic and truncated forms of MDH2 may be related to their ability to interact with other gluconeogenic enzymes. Additional evidence was obtained for interaction of MDH2 with PCK1 using Hummel-Dreyer gel filtration chromatography, and for interactions of MDH2 with PCK1 and with FBP1 using surface plasmon resonance. Experiments with the latter technique demonstrated a much lower affinity for interaction of ΔnMDH2 with PCK1 and no interaction between ΔnMDH2 and FBP1. These results suggest that the interactions of MDH2 with other gluconeogenic enzymes are dependent on the amino terminus of the enzyme, and that these interactions are important for gluconeogenic function in vivo.

Three differentially compartmentalized isozymes of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) 1The abbreviations used are: MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PCK1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FBP1, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units.1The abbreviations used are: MDH, malate dehydrogenase; PCK1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FBP1, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units. in Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyze the NAD(H)-specific interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate. Mitochondrial MDH1 catalyzes a reaction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and disruption of the corresponding gene results in an inability to grow with acetate as a carbon source (1Thompson L.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 12091-12096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype shared with yeast mutants containing disruptions in genes encoding other tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes (3Cupp J.R.

Cytosolic MDH2 is a gluconeogenic enzyme and is required for growth on minimal medium with ethanol or acetate as the carbon source (6Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as are the other yeast gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) (7Winzeler E.A. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) (8Entian K.D. Vogel R.F. Rose M. Hofmann L. Mecke D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal MDH3 is proposed to catalyze a step in the glyoxylate pathway, which permits formation of C4 metabolites from C2 precursors (9Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24708-24715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Steffan J.S. Minard K.I. Anderson S.L. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21220-21225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and has also been shown to be necessary for growth with oleate as the carbon source (11Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional role in providing NADH for peroxisomal β-oxidation.The yeast MDH isozymes are all homodimers with similar subunit M r values (33,500 for MDH1; 40,700 for MDH2; and 37,200 for MDH3), and they share primary sequence identities of 43 to 50%. Distinct differences among the enzymes include a 17-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence for MDH1 that is removed upon import (2Thompson L.M. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12091-12096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide targeting sequence (Ser-Lys-Leu) required for peroxisomal import of MDH3 (11Van Roermund C.W.T. Elgersma Y. Singh N. Wanders R.J.A. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3480-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, MDH2 has a 12-residue extension on the amino terminus that is not present on mature MDH1 or on MDH3 (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that removal of this 12-residue extension, generating a truncated enzyme designated ΔnMDH2, appears to have no effect on cellular levels of activity of the enzyme (12Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17458-17464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the ΔnMDH2 enzyme is resistant to catabolite inactivation, a regulatory phenomenon in yeast involving glucose-induced inactivation and degradation of gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes (13Chapman C. Bartley W. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 8: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, when glucose is added to a culture of a strain expressing ΔnMDH2, adaptation to utilization of glucose as a carbon source is slowed (12Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17458-17464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that catabolite inactivation may provide a physiological advantage by rapidly removing enzymes that interfere with optimal rates of glycolysis. In this report, we also provide evidence that the catalytically active ΔnMDH2 enzyme may not function efficiently in gluconeogenesis in vivo.Because of the unfavorable equilibrium for formation of oxaloacetate from malate (ΔG 0′ ≅ +7 kcal/mol), it has been proposed that physical interactions between malate dehydrogenase and the next enzyme in the same metabolic pathway may be necessary to ensure direct transfer of oxaloacetate (15Srere P.A. Mehlman M.A. Hanson R.E. Energy Metabolism and the Regulation of Metabolic Processes in Mitochondria. Academic Press, New York1972: 79-91Crossref Google Scholar), a metabolite present in very low cellular concentrations. In support of this proposal, substantial experimental evidence has been presented for interactions between the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, in yeast and other organisms (16Lindbladh C.

These results suggest an association of these cytosolic enzymes in vivo that may facilitate metabolic flux through gluconeogenesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Gene disruption mutants were constructed using the parental yeast strain S173-6B (MAT a , leu2-3,112, his3-1, ura3-57, trp1-289) (20Botstein D. Falco S.C. Stewart S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 12-24Crossref Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Disruption of the MDH2 gene (MDH2::HIS3) was previously described (2Thompson L.M. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12091-12096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCK1 and FBP1 genes were independently disrupted by transformation with PCR products containing ∼45 nucleotides from the 5′ and 3′ ends of each coding region fused with the kanMX4 coding region (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Phillipsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Gene disruptions (pck1::kan or fbp1::kan) were verified by Southern blot analyses and by enzyme assays. The yeast strain used in two-hybrid analyses was Y190 (MAT a , ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3,112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2, lys2::GAL1 UAS -HIS3 TATA -HIS3, ura3::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -lacZ; Clontech). Strains were grown in liquid cultures or on agar plates containing rich YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone) or minimal YNB medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, pH 5.8) with additions of 2% glucose or 2% ethanol as the carbon source. YNB medium was supplemented with 20 μg/ml of nutrients as required for growth or selection.Plasmid Constructs and Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—For growth phenotype analyses, the Δmdh2 strain was transformed (22Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar) with pRS314 plasmids (23Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying authentic (MDH2) or truncated (ΔnMDH2) coding regions of MDH2. The pRS314MDH2 plasmid was previously described (24Small W.C. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and was used for mutagenesis to remove 12 codons following the AUG translation initiation codon (12Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17458-17464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to produce the pRS314ΔnMDH2 plasmid.For subcloning into two-hybrid vectors (Clontech, Inc.), PCR was used to introduce BamHI restriction sites onto the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region of MDH2 for in-frame fusions with the 3′ end of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain sequence in pAS2-1 (carrying GAL4 (1–147) and TRP1 for selection) and with the 3′ end of the GAL4 transcription-activation domain sequence in pACT2 (carrying GAL4 (768–881) and LEU2 for selection). This generated plasmids designated pASMDH2 and pACTMDH2. A truncated form of the MDH2 gene (ΔnMDH2) lacking codons for the first 12 amino acids was obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of pACTMDH2, and the truncated coding region was transferred to pAS2, generating both pACTΔnMDH2 and pASΔnMDH2.To construct “reverse” two-hybrid vectors to express fusion proteins with GAL4 domains on the carboxyl-terminal side, the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the multicloning sites of pACT and pAS2-1 were eliminated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Subsequent mutagenesis was used to reinsert EcoRI and BamHI sites between the ADH1 promoter and the GAL4 domain coding sequences in these plasmids. The resulting reverse two-hybrid vectors permit in-frame cloning of coding sequences (carrying a 5′ translation-initiator AUG codon) onto the 5′ end of the GAL4 domain sequences. PCR fragments containing MDH2 and ΔnMDH2 coding sequences with EcoRI restriction sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends were cloned into the reverse pACT and pAS2-1 plasmids as illustrated in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Reverse two-hybrid constructs and proteins. Shown are the relative orientations of coding sequences for (Δn)MDH2 and for GAL4 domains in the reverse two-hybrid plasmids constructed in this study. MCS* indicates the position of the residual multicloning site sequences from pAS2-1 and pACT plasmids following repositioning of EcoRI and HindIII sites onto the 5′ side of GAL4 domain sequences as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These constructs result in free amino termini for MDH2 or ΔnMDH2 in the expressed fusion proteins. In contrast, conventional two-hybrid plasmids result in fusion of these amino termini to the carboxyl termini of GAL4 domains. The diagrams of fusion proteins are proportional to relative sizes for MDH2 (376 amino acid residues) and for the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (147 amino acid residues).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To construct conventional two-hybrid vectors (pASPCK1 and pACT-PCK1) containing PCK1 sequences, PCR was conducted with a YEp352 plasmid carrying PCK1 (provided by Dr. E. Cardemil) (25Krautwurst H. Encinas M.V. Marcus F. Latshaw S.P. Kemp R.G. Frey P.A. Cardemil E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6382-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to generate the PCK1 coding region flanked by EcoRI restriction sites for subcloning. Similar vectors (pASFBP1 and pACTFBP1) containing FBP1 sequences were generated using PCR with yeast genomic DNA as the template to generate the FBP1 coding region with 5′ and 3′ XhoI restriction sites for ligation into plasmid SalI or XhoI sites. Coding sequences in two-hybrid plasmids were verified by DNA sequence analysis.The two-hybrid plasmids were transformed singly and in pairwise pAS/pACT combinations into Y190, and transformants were selected by growth on YNB plates lacking tryptophan and/or leucine. A positive control strain was obtained by transformation with plasmid pCL1, a centromere-based plasmid carrying the full GAL4 gene and LEU2 for selection (26James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were restreaked for colony filter assays of lacZ reporter gene expression as described in protocols provided by Clontech. The time required for colony color development was monitored over a 24-h period. Enzyme assays for β-galactosidase activity were conducted using extracts prepared by freeze-thaw cycles from transformants harvested from YP glucose cultures at measured densities (A 600nm = 1–2). β-Galactosidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (A 578nm) at times (min) following color development with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Units are expressed as A 578nm × 103/min ml of A 600nm.Affinity Purification and Kinetic Analyses—To insert tags for affinity purification, MDH2 and ΔnMDH2 genes on pRS426 plasmids, and the PCK1 gene on a YEp352 plasmid, were used for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to add codons for six histidine residues between the final codon and the stop codon of each gene. Each plasmid contained ∼500 bp of the authentic 5′ promoter sequence for expression of each gene. A 2.0-kb DNA fragment containing the FBP1 coding region and adjacent promoter sequences was cloned using PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into pRS426. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was subsequently used to insert nine codons for the residues in a streptavidin tag (28Skerra A. Schmidt T.G.M. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 79-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) into the 3′ ends of PCK1 and FBP1 genes. Each plasmid was transformed into the yeast strain containing a disruption in the corresponding MDH2, PCK1, or FBP1 chromosomal locus.For affinity purification, transformants were grown in 10-ml cultures of YNB glucose medium to maintain plasmid selection, then transferred to 250–1000-ml cultures of YP ethanol medium to induce expression of gluconeogenic enzymes (6Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested at A 600nm = 4–5, and cell pellets were stored at –20 °C. For purification of histidine-tagged enzymes, the cell pellets were lysed with glass beads, and the lysate was diluted 1:1 with a buffer containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 600 mm sodium chloride, and 40 mm imidazole. The diluted lysate was incubated with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA superflow resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C and loaded into a 1-cm diameter column. The column flow-through fraction was collected, and the column was washed with three column volumes of a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm sodium chloride, and 20 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 1.0 ml of the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. For purification of streptavidin-tagged enzymes, 2 μg of avidin was added to the cell lysates, and the lysates were loaded onto 1.0-ml streptavidin-agarose columns (immunopure affinity Pak immobilized streptavidin, Pierce). The columns were washed with 5 ml of phosphate buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride). We found that the streptavidin-tagged enzymes bind weakly to these columns and are eluted with a second 5-ml phosphate buffer wash. Yields for the affinity purified enzymes were ∼0.5 mg of histidine-tagged enzymes and 0.1–0.2 mg of streptavidin-tagged enzymes per 1.2–1.7 g of cells harvested from 250-ml cultures. Protein concentrations were determined using absorbance at A 280nm and calculated extinction coefficients (29Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). Samples obtained during affinity purification were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide/sodium dodecyl sulfate gels for Coomassie Blue staining or for immunoblotting.Enzyme activities for malate dehydrogenase (1Thompson L.M. Sutherland P. Steffan J.S. McAlister-Henn L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (30Hansen R.J. Hinze H. Holzer H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 178-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (31Funayama S. Molano J. Gancedo C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were measured as previously described. Activities measured for affinity purified enzymes were: 200–250 units/mg for MDH2His and ΔnMDH2His, ∼8 units/mg for PCK1His and PCK1Strep, and ∼10 units/mg for FBP1Strep. These values are 2–3-fold lower than those reported for conventionally purified MDH2 (6Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), PCK1 (30Hansen R.J. Hinze H. Holzer H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 178-181Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and FBP1 (31Funayama S. Molano J. Gancedo C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).For determination of kinetic parameters, 0.15 μg of MDH2His or ΔnMDH2His were used in 1.0-ml assays containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). NADH concentrations were varied from 0 to 0.4 mm in the presence of 0.35 mm oxaloacetate, or oxaloacetate concentrations were varied from 0 to 1.0 mm in the presence of 0.4 mm NADH. Units are defined as micromole of NAD+ produced per minute.Immunoblots and Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoblot analysis of MDH2 or ΔnMDH2 was conducted using a polyclonal antiserum prepared against MDH2 (6Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The antiserum was preadsorbed with extracts from a Δmdh2 strain and used at dilutions of 1:250. A polyclonal antiserum against FBP1 was obtained from Dr. K. Eschrich (32Bigl M. Eschrich K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and was used at dilutions of 1:500. Histidine-tagged enzymes were also detected using a monoclonal penta-histidine antiserum obtained from Qiagen. Immunocomplexes were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Bioscience).For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were pelleted from YP ethanol cultures of the parental strain or, for controls, of gene disruption strains. Pellets of cells from 20 ml of the cultures (A 600nm = 1.5–2.0) were lysed in 400 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing a protease mixture (20 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, 20 μg/ml E-64, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride) and sodium chloride at concentrations ranging from 10 to 150 mm. The cleared lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of antiserum against MDH2 or FBP1. Protein A-Sepharose beads (50 μl; Sigma) were added and the incubation continued for 30 min. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with 400 μlof10mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm sodium chloride, then resuspended and boiled in 50 μl of SDS electrophoresis sample buffer. After centrifugation to remove the beads, the supernatants were used for gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis.Hummel-Dreyer Analyses—Gel filtration chromatography was conducted with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (24 ml bed volume) attached to an Applied Biosystems HPLC model 120A. The chromatography buffer contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 50 mm sodium chloride. Samples and standard proteins (at concentrations of 4 μm for calibration and otherwise as indicated in the text) were injected with a 50-μl loop and chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. For some experiments, 4.0 μm MDH2 was included in the chromatography buffer.Surface Plasmon Resonance Analyses—Experiments were performed on a BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) instrument using steptavidin and carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) research grade chips (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). Runs were conducted at 25 °C with HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Proteins were immobilized on steptavidin chips by injection in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm sodium chloride. CM5 chips were activated by a 6-min injection of 50% N-hydroxysuccinimide and 50% N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Proteins (ligands) were immobilized on activated CM5 chips at 1000–3500 response units (RU; 1 RU = a change of ∼1 ng/mm2 in surface protein concentration) at pH 7.5. After immobilization, the surfaces were blocked by a 6-min injection of 1.0 m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). Soluble analyte proteins or bovine serum albumin as the control were passed over the surfaces at the indicated concentrations for 3 min. The surfaces were regenerated between binding runs by a 3-min injection of 1 m sodium chloride or 4 m guanidine HCl.RESULTSDifferential Function of MDH2 and ΔnMDH2 in Vivo—Removal of the amino-terminal 12-residue extension of yeast MDH2 was previously shown to have little effect on activity of the enzyme, because levels of malate dehydrogenase activity and immunodetectable MDH2 were similar in extracts from cells expressing the authentic or truncated enzyme (ΔnMDH2) (12Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17458-17464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike authentic MDH2, ΔnMDH2 was found to be resistant to glucose-induced degradation, as were the activities of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and isocitrate lyase in cells expressing ΔnMDH2. The latter phenotype suggested a dominant effect on enzymes normally subject to catabolite inactivation (13Chapman C. Bartley W. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Holzer H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1976; 8: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further investigate potential growth phenotypes that might be associated with a general effect on gluconeogenesis, we constructed yeast mutants with disruptions in MDH2, FBP1, or PCK1 genes encoding the major gluconeogenic enzymes. As previously reported (6Minard K.I. McAlister-Henn L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Winzeler E.A. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3157) Google Scholar, 8Entian K.D. Vogel R.F. Rose M. Hofmann L. Mecke D. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these mutant strains were found to grow well on plates containing rich medium with C2 carbon sources (ethanol or acetate), but the strains fail to grow on plates of minimal medium with the same carbon sources. This phenotype was attributed to the requirement for gluconeogenesis for growth in minimal medium that lacks carbon compounds sufficiently abundant in rich medium to allow for growth of these strains. (Note, no growth phenotypes are observed with glucose media because gluoneogenic enzymes are not expressed or functional under this growth condition.)We additionally found that transformation of the Δmdh2 strain with a centromere-based plasmid containing the MDH2 gene restores the ability to grow on minimal medium plates with ethanol or acetate as carbon sources. In contrast, transformation of the same strain with a similar plasmid bearing the ΔnMDH2 gene fails to restore growth under these conditions. These results were extended by measuring culture doubling times in minimal medium. When shifted from minimal glucose to minimal ethanol medium, the parental strain and the Δmdh2 strain expressing MDH2 exhibit a lag of ∼24 h before attaining doubling times of 5.9 and 6.9 h, respectively (Table I). In contrast, all three gluconeogenic gene disruption strains and the Δmdh2 strain expressing ΔnMDH2 fail to grow under these conditions. Similar results were obtained when strains and transformants were shifted to minimal medium with acetate as the carbon source (Table I), although doubling times for the parental strain and for the Δmdh2 strain expressing MDH2 were significantly longer on this medium. These results suggest that ΔnMDH2 does not compensate for the normal gluconeogenic function of MDH2.Table IDoubling times (h) of strains with minimal mediumRelevant genotypeCarbon sourcea2% ethanol or 2% acetate were used as carbon sources with minimal YNB medium.EthanolAcetateParental5.919.0ΔMDH2NGbNG, no growth over a 60-h period.NGΔPCK1NGNGΔFBP1NGNGΔMDH2 + pRS314MDH26.926.4ΔMDH2 + pRS314ΔnMDH2NGNGa 2% ethanol or 2% acetate were used as carbon sources with minimal YNB medium.b NG, no growth over a 60-h period. Open table in a new tab Similar levels of malate dehydrogenase activity (7–8 units/mg of protein) were measurable with cellular extracts from the Δmdh2 strains expressing MDH2 or ΔnMDH2. However, because of expression of other MDH isozymes in those strains, immunoblot analysis was conducted to specifically examine levels of expression of MDH2 and ΔnMDH2. As illustrated in Fig. 2, this analysis indicates no significant difference between levels of MDH2 (lane 2) and levels of ΔnMDH2 (lane 3) in extracts from respective transformants. Levels of the plasmid-expressed enzymes exceed that of chromosomally expressed MDH2 in extracts from the parental strain (lane 1) by 2–3-fold, and MDH2 is clearly absent in the Δmdh2 strain (lane 4). Fig. 2 also illustrates the differences in electrophoretic mobilities of authentic MDH2 (lanes 1 and 2) relative to ΔnMDH2 (lane 3) and relative to purified MDH2 carrying a histidine tag (lane 5), as described below.Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of MDH2 expression. Cellular protein extracts (30 μg) used for immunoblot analysis were prepared from the parental strain (lane 1), the Δmdh2 strain transformed with pRS314MDH2 (lane 2), the Δmdh2 strain transformed with pRS314ΔnMDH2 (lane 3), and the Δmdh2 strain (lane 4). Lane 5 was loaded with ∼1 μg of affinity purified histidine-tagged MDH2. The strains were grown in YNB medium with glucose then shifted to YNB medium with ethanol for 24 h to induce expression of (Δn)MDH2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine activity and kinetic properties of the MDH2 and ΔnMDH2"
https://openalex.org/W2091921200,"Gam1, an early adenoviral CELO protein, is required for viral replication. Consistent with its ability to inhibit histone deacetylation by HDAC1, Gam1 activates transcription. In this report, we identify the cellular transcription factor p120E4F as a Gam1 interaction partner. p120E4F is a low-abundance transcription factor that represses the adenovirus E4 promoter. Here we demonstrate that p120E4F interacts with HDAC1 in vivo and in vitro, and that E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is alleviated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A or by overexpressing Gam1. A mutant E4 promoter unresponsive to E4F-mediated transcriptional repression is also not stimulated by Gam1. Moreover, our cofractionation experiments demonstrate that p120E4F, HDAC1 and Gam1 may be concomitantly present in protein complexes. We conclude that Gam1 activates E4-dependent transcription possibly by inactivating HDAC1."
