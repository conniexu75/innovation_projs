https://openalex.org/W3116063736,"Comprehensively resolving neuronal identities in whole-brain images is a major challenge. We achieve this in C. elegans by engineering a multicolor transgene called NeuroPAL (a neuronal polychromatic atlas of landmarks). NeuroPAL worms share a stereotypical multicolor fluorescence map for the entire hermaphrodite nervous system that resolves all neuronal identities. Neurons labeled with NeuroPAL do not exhibit fluorescence in the green, cyan, or yellow emission channels, allowing the transgene to be used with numerous reporters of gene expression or neuronal dynamics. We showcase three applications that leverage NeuroPAL for nervous-system-wide neuronal identification. First, we determine the brainwide expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for acetylcholine, GABA, and glutamate, completing a map of this communication network. Second, we uncover changes in cell fate caused by transcription factor mutations. Third, we record brainwide activity in response to attractive and repulsive chemosensory cues, characterizing multimodal coding for these stimuli."

Indeed, previous human pluripotent stem-cell-derived models of kidney tissue either contain nephrons or pattern specifically to the ureteric epithelium. By re-analyzing the transcriptional distinction between distal nephron and ureteric epithelium in human fetal kidney, we show here that, while existing nephron-containing kidney organoids contain distal nephron epithelium and no ureteric epithelium, this distal nephron segment alone displays significant in vitro plasticity and can adopt a ureteric epithelial tip identity when isolated and cultured in defined conditions. ""Induced"" ureteric epithelium cultures can be cryopreserved, serially passaged without loss of identity, and transitioned toward a collecting duct fate. Cultures harboring loss-of-function mutations in PKHD1 also recapitulate the cystic phenotype associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease."

Brain templates are essential for comparative biological studies because they enable analyzing many individuals in a common reference space. Several central brain templates exist for Drosophila , but every one is either biased, uses sub-optimal tissue preparation, is imaged at low resolution, or does not account for artifacts. No publicly available Drosophila ventral nerve cord template currently exists. In this work, we created high-resolution templates of the Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord using the best-available technologies for imaging, artifact correction, stitching, and template construction using groupwise registration. We evaluated our central brain template against the four most competitive, publicly available brain templates and demonstrate that ours enables more accurate registration with fewer local deformations in shorter time."

The aim of the study was to highlight the immunological events associated with the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an emphasis on cells of innate immunity. Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved."
https://openalex.org/W3115293642,"Background Sorghum bicolor (SB) is rich in protective phytoconstituents with health benefits and regarded as a promising source of natural anti-diabetic substance. However, its comprehensive bioactive compound(s) and mechanism(s) against type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have not been exposed. Hence, we implemented network pharmacology to identify its key compounds and mechanism(s) against T2DM. Methods Compounds in SB were explored through GC-MS and screened by Lipinski’s rule. Genes associated with the selected compounds or T2DM were extracted from public databases, and the overlapping genes between SB-compound related genes and T2DM target genes were identified using Venn diagram. Then, the networking between selected compounds and overlapping genes was constructed, visualized, and analyzed by RStudio. Finally, affinity between compounds and genes was evaluated via molecular docking. Results GC-MS analysis of SB detected a total of 20 compounds which were accepted by the Lipinski’s rule. A total number of 16 compounds-related genes and T2DM-related genes (4,763) were identified, and 81 overlapping genes between them were selected. Gene set enrichment analysis exhibited that the mechanisms of SB against T2DM were associated with 12 signaling pathways, and the key mechanism might be to control blood glucose level by activating PPAR signaling pathway. Furthermore, the highest affinities were noted between four main compounds and six genes (FABP3-Propyleneglyco monoleate, FABP4-25-Oxo-27-norcholesterol, NR1H3-Campesterol, PPARA-β-sitosterol, PPARD-β-sitosterol, and PPARG-β-sitosterol). Conclusion Our study overall suggests that the four key compounds detected in SB might ameliorate T2DM severity by activating the PPAR signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3115315447,"Background Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of risk factors for a poor outcome have been identified. Thereby, cardiovascular comorbidity has a major impact on mortality. We investigated whether coronary calcification as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD) is appropriate for risk prediction in COVID-19. Methods Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109) were analyzed regarding clinical outcome after native computed tomography (CT) imaging for COVID-19 screening. CAC (coronary calcium score) and clinical outcome (need for intensive care treatment or death) data were calculated following a standardized protocol. We defined three endpoints: critical COVID-19 and transfer to ICU, fatal COVID-19 and death, composite endpoint critical and fatal COVID-19, a composite of ICU treatment and death. We evaluated the association of clinical outcome with the CAC. Patients were dichotomized by the median of CAC. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were calculated for the events death or ICU or a composite of death and ICU. Results We observed significantly more events for patients with CAC above the group’s median of 31 for critical outcome (HR: 1.97[1.09,3.57], p = 0.026), for fatal outcome (HR: 4.95[1.07,22.9], p = 0.041) and the composite endpoint (HR: 2.31[1.28,4.17], p = 0.0056. Also, odds ratio was significantly increased for critical outcome (OR: 3.01 [1.37, 6.61], p = 0.01) and for fatal outcome (OR: 5.3 [1.09, 25.8], p = 0.02). Conclusion The results indicate a significant association between CAC and clinical outcome in COVID-19. Our data therefore suggest that CAC might be useful in risk prediction in patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3115561157,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Various nutritional compounds possess anti-carcinogenic properties which may be mediated through their effects on the gut microbiota and its production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) for the prevention of breast cancer. We evaluated the impact of broccoli sprouts (BSp), green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and their combination on the gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism from the microbiota in Her2/neu transgenic mice that spontaneously develop estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary tumors. The mice were grouped based on the dietary treatment: control, BSp, GTPs or their combination from beginning in early life (BE) or life-long from conception (LC). We found that the combination group showed the strongest inhibiting effect on tumor growth volume and a significant increase in tumor latency. BSp treatment was integrally more efficacious than the GTPs group when compared to the control group. There was similar clustering of microbiota of BSp-fed mice with combination-fed mice, and GTPs-fed mice with control-fed mice at pre-tumor in the BE group and at pre-tumor and post-tumor in the LC group. The mice on all dietary treatment groups incurred a significant increase of Adlercreutzia , Lactobacillus genus and Lachnospiraceae, S24-7 family in the both BE and LC groups. We found no change in SCFAs levels in the plasma of BSp-fed, GTPs-fed and combination-fed mice of the BE group. Marked changes were observed in the mice of the LC group consisting of significant increases in propionate and isobutyrate in GTPs-fed and combination-fed mice. These studies indicate that nutrients such as BSp and GTPs differentially affect the gut microbial composition in both the BE and LC groups and the key metabolites (SCFAs) levels in the LC group. The findings also suggest that temporal factors related to different time windows of consumption during the life-span can have a promising influence on the gut microbial composition, SCFAs profiles and ER(-) breast cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3115727351,"Background A priority for health services is to reduce self-harm in young people. Predicting self-harm is challenging due to their rarity and complexity, however this does not preclude the utility of prediction models to improve decision-making regarding a service response in terms of more detailed assessments and/or intervention. The aim of this study was to predict self-harm within six-months after initial presentation. Method The study included 1962 young people (12–30 years) presenting to youth mental health services in Australia. Six machine learning algorithms were trained and tested with ten repeats of ten-fold cross-validation. The net benefit of these models were evaluated using decision curve analysis. Results Out of 1962 young people, 320 (16%) engaged in self-harm in the six months after first assessment and 1642 (84%) did not. The top 25% of young people as ranked by mean predicted probability accounted for 51.6% - 56.2% of all who engaged in self-harm. By the top 50%, this increased to 82.1%-84.4%. Models demonstrated fair overall prediction (AUROCs; 0.744–0.755) and calibration which indicates that predicted probabilities were close to the true probabilities (brier scores; 0.185–0.196). The net benefit of these models were positive and superior to the ‘treat everyone’ strategy. The strongest predictors were (in ranked order); a history of self-harm, age, social and occupational functioning, sex, bipolar disorder, psychosis-like experiences, treatment with antipsychotics, and a history of suicide ideation. Conclusion Prediction models for self-harm may have utility to identify a large sub population who would benefit from further assessment and targeted (low intensity) interventions. Such models could enhance health service approaches to identify and reduce self-harm, a considerable source of distress, morbidity, ongoing health care utilisation and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3114087005,"Herpesviruses are large and complex viruses that have a long history of coevolution with their host species. One important factor in the virus-host interaction is the alteration of intracellular morphology during viral replication with critical implications for viral assembly. However, the details of this remodeling event are not well understood, in part because insufficient tools are available to deconstruct this highly heterogeneous process. To provide an accurate and reliable method of investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of virus-induced changes to cellular architecture, we constructed a dual-fluorescent reporter virus that enabled us to classify four distinct stages in the infection cycle of herpes simplex virus-1 at the single cell level. This timestamping method can accurately track the infection cycle across a wide range of multiplicities of infection. We used high-resolution fluorescence microscopy analysis of cellular structures in live and fixed cells in concert with our reporter virus to generate a detailed and chronological overview of the spatial and temporal reorganization during viral replication. The highly orchestrated and striking relocation of many organelles around the compartments of secondary envelopment during transition from early to late gene expression suggests that the reshaping of these compartments is essential for virus assembly. We furthermore find that accumulation of HSV-1 capsids in the cytoplasm is accompanied by fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus with potential impact on the late steps of viral assembly. We anticipate that in the future similar tools can be systematically applied for the systems-level analysis of intracellular morphology during replication of other viruses."
https://openalex.org/W3115343760,"Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, and all COVID-19 patients were recruited who were admitted to the Yichang Third People’s Hospital from February 1 st to March 31 st , 2020. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was used for minimizing confounding effects. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, with the secondary outcomes being the time needed for a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test to turn negative and the length of hospital stay. Results Totaling 367 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Yichang Third People’s Hospital were identified, of whom 276 were mild or stable COVID-19, and 67 were serious or critically ill. Among them, 255 patients were treated using methylprednisolone, and 188 did not receive any corticosteroid-related treatment. After PSM, no statistically significant difference was found in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Regarding the outcomes, there also were no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients without the use of methylprednisolone were more quickly to obtain negative results of their nasopharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after treatment, compared to those receiving methylprednisolone. Conclusion Methylprednisolone could not improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of the use of methylprednisolone in patients with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, thus the use of corticosteroids clinically in patients with COVID-19 should be with cautions."
https://openalex.org/W3118053667,"Rapidly detecting and responding to new invasive species and the spread of those that are already established is essential for reducing their potential threat to food production, the economy, and the environment. We describe a new spatial modeling platform that integrates mapping of phenology and climatic suitability in real-time to provide timely and comprehensive guidance for stakeholders needing to know both where and when invasive insect species could potentially invade the conterminous United States. The Degree-Days, Risk, and Phenological event mapping (DDRP) platform serves as an open-source and relatively easy-to-parameterize decision support tool to help detect new invasive threats, schedule monitoring and management actions, optimize biological control, and predict potential impacts on agricultural production. DDRP uses a process-based modeling approach in which degree-days and temperature stress are calculated daily and accumulate over time to model phenology and climatic suitability, respectively. Outputs include predictions of the number of completed generations, life stages present, dates of phenological events, and climatically suitable areas based on two levels of climate stress. Species parameter values can be derived from laboratory and field studies or estimated through an additional modeling step. DDRP is written entirely in R, making it flexible and extensible, and capitalizes on multiple R packages to generate gridded and graphical outputs. We illustrate the DDRP modeling platform and the process of model parameterization using two invasive insect species as example threats to United States agriculture: the light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana , and the small tomato borer, Neoleucinodes elegantalis . We then discuss example applications of DDRP as a decision support tool, review its potential limitations and sources of model error, and outline some ideas for future improvements to the platform."
https://openalex.org/W3117264094,"Dietary nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves athletic performance in humans, yet data supporting observations that it may increase cerebral blood flow and improve cognitive performance are mixed. We tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) model. We utilized targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to examine the extent to which treatment resulted in changes in nitrate or nitrite concentrations in the brain and altered the brain metabolome. Fish were exposed to sodium nitrate (606.9 mg/L), sodium nitrite (19.5 mg/L), or control water for 2–4 weeks and free swim, startle response, and shuttle box assays were performed. Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not change fish weight, length, predator avoidance, or distance and velocity traveled in an unstressed environment. Nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish initially experienced more negative reinforcement and increased time to decision in the shuttle box assay, which is consistent with a decrease in associative learning or executive function however, over multiple trials, all treatment groups demonstrated behaviors associated with learning. Nitrate and nitrite treatment was associated with mild anxiogenic-like behavior but did not alter epinephrine, norepinephrine or dopamine levels. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed no significant increase in brain nitrate or nitrite concentrations with treatment. Untargeted metabolomics analysis found 47 metabolites whose abundance was significantly altered in the brain with nitrate and nitrite treatment. Overall, the depletion in brain metabolites is plausibly associated with the regulation of neuronal activity including statistically significant reductions in the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 18–19%), and its precursor, glutamine (17–22%). Nitrate treatment caused significant depletion in the brain concentration of fatty acids including linoleic acid (LA) by 50% and arachidonic acid (ARA) by 80%; nitrite treatment caused depletion of LA by ~90% and ARA by 60%, change which could alter the function of dopaminergic neurons and affect behavior. Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not adversely affect multiple parameters of zebrafish health. It is plausible that indirect NO-mediated mechanisms may be responsible for the nitrate and nitrite-mediated effects on the brain metabolome and behavior in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W3115257494,"The synthesis of a mitochondria-targeted derivative of the classical mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) by alkoxy substitution of CCCP with n-decyl(triphenyl)phosphonium cation yielded mitoCCCP, which was able to inhibit the uncoupling action of CCCP, tyrphostin A9 and niclosamide on rat liver mitochondria, but not that of 2,4-dinitrophenol, at a concentration of 1–2 μM. MitoCCCP did not uncouple mitochondria by itself at these concentrations, although it exhibited uncoupling action at tens of micromolar concentrations. Thus, mitoCCCP appeared to be a more effective mitochondrial recoupler than 6-ketocholestanol. Both mitoCCCP and 6-ketocholestanol did not inhibit the protonophoric activity of CCCP in artificial bilayer lipid membranes, which might compromise the simple proton-shuttling mechanism of the uncoupling activity on mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W3118018595,"Recently, various designs and material manufactured interspinous process devices (IPDs) are on the market in managing symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). However, atraumatic fracture of the intervening spinous process has been reported in patients, particularly, double or multiple level lumbar decompression surgery with IPDs. This study aimed to biomechanically investigate the effects of few commercial IPDs, namely DIAM TM , Coflex TM , and M-PEEK, which were implanted into the L2-3, L3-4 double-level lumbar spinal processes. A validated finite element model of musculoskeletal intact lumbar spinal column was modified to accommodate the numerical analysis of different implants. The range of motion (ROM) between each vertebra, stiffness of the implanted level, intra stress on the intervertebral discs and facet joints, and the contact forces on spinous processes were compared. Among the three implants, the Coflex system showed the largest ROM restriction in extension and caused the highest stress over the disc annulus at the adjacent levels, as well as the sandwich phenomenon on the spinous process at the instrumented levels. Further, the DIAM device provided a superior loading-sharing between the two bridge supports, and the M-PEEK system offered a superior load-sharing from the superior spinous process to the lower pedicle screw. The limited motion at the instrumented segments were compensated by the upper and lower adjacent functional units, however, this increasing ROM and stress would accelerate the degeneration of un-instrumented segments."

Thirteen of these stations were in the extensive twilight zones of all three caves. All seventeen stations showed seasonality in temperature with a 3°C drop during the Nortes season. Two of the caves, Muévelo Sabrosito and Muévelo Rico, showed greater variability during the winter months while in Río Secreto (Tuch) variability was greatest during the rainy season. Río Secreto is less open to the surface than the other two. All sites also showed a daily temperature cycle, although it was very faint in some Río Secreto (Tuch) sites. While temperature variability is diminished relative to surface variation, its temporal pattern is worthy of further study."
https://openalex.org/W3113499984,"In the field of forestry, one of the most economically important ecosystem service is the provision of timber. The need to calculate the economic effects of forest management in the short, medium, and long term is increasing. Forest operations or timber harvesting, which comprises felling, processing, and transport of trees or timber, are responsible for a large part of the costs and environmental impacts associated to forest management or enterprises. From a decision maker’s perspective, it is essential to estimate working productivity and production costs under given operating conditions before any operation is conducted. This work addresses the lack of a valid collection of models that allows estimating time, productivities, and costs of labor and machinery for the most important forest operations in forest stands under Central European conditions. To create such models, we used data from forest enterprises, manual time studies, and the literature. This work presents a decision support tool that estimates the wood harvesting productivities of 12 different kinds of forest operations under Central European conditions. It includes forest operations using chainsaws, harvesters, skidders, forwarders, chippers, cable and tower yarders, and helicopters. In addition, the tool covers three models for wood volume estimation. The tool is written in Java and available open-source under the Apache License. This work shows how the tool can be used by describing its graphical user interface (GUI) and its application programming interface (API) that facilitates bulk processing of scientific data. Carefully selected default values allow estimations without knowing all input variables in detail. Each model is accompanied by an in-depth documentation where the forest operation, input variables, formulas, and statistical background are given. We conclude that HeProMo is a very useful tool for applications in forest practice, research, and teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3115157332,"The perception of urban subdivisions, deriving from regionalisation processes and the identification of separating elements (barriers), has proven to dynamically shape peoples’ cognitive representations of space and route choice behaviour in cities. However, existing Agent-Based Models (ABMs) for pedestrian simulation have not accounted for these particular cognitive mapping processes. The aim of this paper is to explore the behaviour of pedestrian agents endowed with knowledge about urban subdivisions. Drawing from literature in spatial cognition, we adapted a region-based route choice model, which contemplates a high- and a local planning level, and advanced a barrier-based route choice model, wherein the influence of separating elements is manipulated. Finally, we combined these two approaches in a region-barrier based model. The patterns emerging from the movement of agents employing such approaches were examined in the city centres of London and Paris. The introduction of regions in the routing mechanisms reduced the unbalanced concentration of agents across the street network brought up by the widely employed least cumulative angular change model (-.08 Gini coefficient). The inclusion of barriers further raised the dispersal of the agents through secondary roads, while leading agents to walk along waterfronts and across parks; it also yielded a more regular usage of pedestrian roads. Moreover, the region- and the region-barrier based routes showed deviation ratio values from the road distance shortest path (region-based: 1.18 London, 1.16 Paris, region-barrier based: 1.43 London, 1.33 Paris) consistent with empirical observations from pedestrian behaviour research. A further evaluation of the model with macro-level observational data may enhance the understanding of pedestrian dynamics and help tuning the interplay amongst urban salient elements at the agent level. Yet, we consider the movement flows arising from our current implementation insightful for assessing the distribution of pedestrians and testing possible interventions for the design of legible and walkable spaces."
https://openalex.org/W3116466936,"The nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are major multifunctional signaling molecules. Deregulation of Fyn and altered PP2A methylation are implicated in cancer and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the hypothesis that the methylation state of PP2A catalytic subunit, which influences PP2A subunit composition and substrate specificity, can affect Fyn regulation and function. Using Neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cell models, we first show that methylated PP2A holoenzymes containing the Bα subunit coimmunoprecipitate and copurify with Fyn in membrane rafts. PP2A methylation status regulates Fyn distribution and Fyn-dependent neuritogenesis, likely in part by affecting actin dynamics. A methylation-incompetent PP2A mutant fails to interact with Fyn. It perturbs the normal partitioning of Fyn and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in membrane microdomains, which governs Fyn function and APP processing. This correlates with enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, a hallmark of AD pathogenesis. Conversely, enhanced PP2A methylation promotes the nonamyloidogenic cleavage of APP in a Fyn-dependent manner. Disturbances in one-carbon metabolic pathways that control cellular methylation are associated with AD and cancer.

They highlight the underestimated importance of cross talks between essential metabolic pathways and signaling scaffolds that are involved in normal cell homeostasis and currently being targeted for cancer and AD treatment. Fyn is a member of the Src family kinases (SFKs) of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases that modulate a plethora of key cellular functions, including growth, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Expectedly, deregulation of these important signaling enzymes is associated with numerous pathological conditions, including cancer (2Kumar A. Jaggi A.S. Singh N. Pharmacology of Src family kinases and therapeutic implications of their modulators.Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2015; 29: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, deregulation of Fyn also participates in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In AD, the abnormal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides derived from enhanced β- and γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is believed to be a key event in initiating hallmark neurodegenerative cascades (3Zhang T. Chen D. Lee T.H. Phosphorylation signaling in APP processing in Alzheimer's disease.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 21: 209Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Pathological levels of oligomeric Aβ species are linked to aberrant overstimulation of postsynaptic Fyn-dependent signaling pathways, ultimately leading to impaired synaptic and cognitive functions, and neurotoxicity in several animal models of AD (4Ittner A. Ittner L.M. Dendritic tau in Alzheimer's disease.Neuron. 2018; 99: 13-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Overactivation of Fyn also induces an abnormal elevation of APP phosphorylated at Tyr682, causing its mistrafficking and missorting in neurons, with important consequences for Aβ production (5Matrone C. Iannuzzi F. Annunziato L. The Y682ENPTY687 motif of APP: Progress and insights toward a targeted therapy for Alzheimer's disease patients.Ageing Res. Rev. 2019; 52: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Fyn activity can counteract memory and synaptic deficits in AD mice (6Kaufman A.C. Salazar S.V. Haas L.T. Yang J. Kostylev M.A. Jeng A.T. Robinson S.A. Gunther E.C. van Dyck C.H. Nygaard H.B. Strittmatter S.M. Fyn inhibition rescues established memory and synapse loss in Alzheimer mice.Ann. Neurol. 2015; 77: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), further demonstrating the essential link between Fyn deregulation and AD pathogenic pathways. SFKs transduce signals from a variety of receptors via their ability to form complexes with numerous cytoskeletal and signaling proteins at the plasma membrane (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 2Kumar A. Jaggi A.S. Singh N. Pharmacology of Src family kinases and therapeutic implications of their modulators.Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2015; 29: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The spatial localization and signaling activity of SFKs is tightly controlled by endocytic trafficking (7Sandilands E. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C.

Under normal physiological conditions, a majority of APP undergoes proteolytic processing by α-secretase, which precludes Aβ formation and generates neurotrophic-secreted soluble amyloid precursor protein α (sAPPα) fragments. There is strong support that the α-secretase cleavage of APP preferentially occurs in nonraft membrane microdomains, while its amyloidogenic processing primarily takes place in lipid rafts (17Ehehalt R.

Protein phosphatase 2A dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) is protein Ser/Thr phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The “PP2A family” encompasses multimeric enzymes with the typical mammalian holoenzyme being composed of a catalytic “C” subunit (PP2Ac) associated with a scaffolding “A” subunit and a variable regulatory “B” subunit. PP2A biogenesis, stability, and substrate specificity can be modulated by leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1)-dependent methylation of PP2Ac on the Leu309 residue; conversely, PP2Ac is demethylated by the methylesterase, PME1 (22Janssens V. Longin S. Goris J. PP2A holoenzyme assembly: In cauda venenum (the sting is in the tail).Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that reduced PP2A methylation is associated with a loss of PP2A/Bα holoenzymes that contain the regulatory Bα (or PPP2R2A) subunit and altered dephosphorylation of PP2A/Bα substrates, including APP phosphorylated at the Thr668 site, in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells and in vivo (23Sontag E.

PP2A methylation becomes downregulated in AD and after alterations in one-carbon metabolism in cells and in vivo (21Sontag J.M. Sontag E. Protein phosphatase 2A dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism that promote toxic elevation of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and its oxidized derivatives and inhibition of cellular methylation are strongly associated with AD (26Smith A.D.

Disturbed homocysteine metabolism is associated with cancer.Exp. Mol. Med. 2019; 51: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, using neuroblastoma N2a cell models, we show that intact PP2A methylation is essential for the formation of PP2A/Bα-Fyn protein complexes and their codistribution in membrane rafts. Altered PP2A methylation promotes a redistribution of Fyn and inhibits Fyn-dependent neuritogenesis. It affects the compartmentalization of Fyn and APP in membrane microdomains, which regulates APP processing. Manipulations of one-carbon metabolism that modulates PP2A methylation state also affect Fyn distribution. Our findings identify a novel mechanism of regulation of Fyn at the crossroads of metabolism and signaling. Based on the reported in vitro binding of PP2Ac to Src (29Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. Inhibition of Src by direct interaction with protein phosphatase 2A.FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an SFK structurally closely related to Fyn, we first assessed the existence of PP2A–Fyn protein complexes using a series of coimmunoprecipitation assays. Western blot analyses showed that endogenous PP2Ac was present in Fyn immunoprecipitates prepared from mouse cortical homogenates (Fig. 1A). However, endogenous Fyn was not detected in corresponding PP2Ac immunoprecipitates. Although these data suggest that PP2A is a major Fyn interacting protein and Fyn is a minor interacting partner of PP2Ac, it is worth noting that anti-PP2Ac subunit antibodies are ineffective at quantitatively pulling down native heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzymes, the predominant species in mammalian cells (30Frohner I.E. Mudrak I. Kronlachner S. Schuchner S. Ogris E. Antibodies recognizing the C terminus of PP2A catalytic subunit are unsuitable for evaluating PP2A activity and holoenzyme composition.Sci. Signal. 2020; 13eaax6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA)–conjugated beads were used to effectively immunoprecipitate PP2A holoenzymes from well-characterized N2a cell lines stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged WT PP2Ac or the L309Δ PP2Ac mutant, as described previously (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag J.M. Diaz-Arrastia R. Ogris E. Dayal S. Lentz S.R. Arning E. Bottiglieri T. Protein phosphatase 2A methyltransferase links homocysteine metabolism with tau and amyloid precursor protein regulation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In contrast to the WT, the L309Δ mutant is methylation incompetent and unable to associate with regulatory B-type subunits in N2a (31Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Schuechner S. Sontag J.M. Montgomery L. Pallas D.C. Juno C. Mudrak I. Ogris E. Sontag E. Expression of protein phosphatase 2A mutants and silencing of the regulatory B alpha subunit induce a selective loss of acetylated and detyrosinated microtubules.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other cell lines (22Janssens V. Longin S. Goris J. PP2A holoenzyme assembly: In cauda venenum (the sting is in the tail).Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with an empty vector (EV) were used as controls. Western blot analyses revealed that endogenous Fyn was present in HA–PP2Ac immunoprecipitates prepared from WT but not L309Δ-expressing or control N2a cell lysates (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Fyn preferentially associates with B-containing methylated PP2A holoenzymes. To confirm the existence of PP2A/Bα–Fyn protein complexes, immunoprecipitates were prepared from N2a cells coexpressing Flag–Bα and GFP–Fyn. We chose this approach based on the lack of suitable antibodies to pull down PP2A/Bα holoenzymes and the close proximity of endogenous Bα, Fyn, and immunoglobulins on gels. GFP–Fyn was clearly concentrated with the Bα subunit in Flag–Bα immunoprecipitates prepared from these cells but was absent in parallel control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 1C). The concomitant presence of PP2Ac in these immunoprecipitates further confirmed that PP2A/Bα holoenzymes were successfully pulled down under our experimental conditions. In agreement with the preferential targeting of Fyn to membrane rafts, Fyn is enriched in detergent-insoluble fractions obtained after lysing tissue or cells with the nonionic detergent, NP-40 (32Shima T. Okumura N. Takao T. Satomi Y. Yagi T. Okada M. Nagai K. Interaction of the SH2 domain of Fyn with a cytoskeletal protein, beta-adducin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Typically, NP-40 detergent-insoluble fractions contain highly insoluble lipid rafts and cytoskeletal components, whereas the detergent-soluble fraction largely consists of cytosolic proteins and extracted proteins “less tightly” attached to membranes. Endogenous PP2Ac coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn in NP-40 detergent-insoluble fractions prepared from GFP–Fyn–transfected but not EV-transfected N2a cells (Fig. 1D), supporting the existence of membrane-associated PP2A–Fyn protein complexes. Together, these findings indicate that methylation-dependent PP2A/Bα holoenzymes are important for the formation of PP2A–Fyn protein complexes. In light of the importance of PP2A methylation and subunit composition for its membrane targeting (33Sontag J.-M. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag E. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1)-dependent methylation regulates the association of protein phosphatase 2A and tau protein with plasma membrane microdomains in neuroblastoma cells.J.

To that end, total lysates and Fyn-enriched NP40-detergent insoluble fractions were first prepared from our N2a cell models and comparatively analyzed by Western blotting for relative changes in endogenous Fyn levels. Compared with controls, detergent-insoluble Fyn levels were overall increased in WT-expressing N2a cells (Fig. 2, A and B), which display a proportional ∼30% increase in total cellular and membrane-associated PP2Ac amounts (33Sontag J.-M. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag E. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1)-dependent methylation regulates the association of protein phosphatase 2A and tau protein with plasma membrane microdomains in neuroblastoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27396-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to the WT, there was a decrease in insoluble Fyn levels in L309Δ-expressing N2a cells. In these cells, there is a ∼35 to 45% reduction of methylated PP2Ac and Bα subunit levels and concomitant accumulation of demethylated PP2Ac (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag J.M. Diaz-Arrastia R. Ogris E. Dayal S. Lentz S.R. Arning E. Bottiglieri T. Protein phosphatase 2A methyltransferase links homocysteine metabolism with tau and amyloid precursor protein regulation.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2751-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); these methylation deficits induce a pronounced loss of PP2A/Bα enzymes targeted to the plasma membrane (33Sontag J.-M.

Further demonstration of the regulatory role of PP2A methylation in Fyn distribution was obtained by deregulating PP2A methyltransferase and methylesterase enzymes.

Conversely, those were reduced after overexpression of PME-1, which promotes the accumulation of demethylated PP2Ac, downregulation of PP2A/Bα, and concomitant decrease in membrane levels of methylated PP2A enzymes (23Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag J.M. Diaz-Arrastia R. Ogris E. Dayal S. Lentz S.R. Arning E. Bottiglieri T.

Notably, this reduction in detergent-insoluble Fyn levels was recapitulated by inducing partial, siRNA-mediated LCMT1 downregulation in N2a cells (Fig. 2, C and D). This submaximal reduction in LCMT1 levels is associated with a pronounced loss of methylated PP2Ac and PP2A/Bα (34Sontag J.-M. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Montgomery L. Arning E. Bottiglieri T. Sontag E. Folate deficiency induces in vitro and mouse brain region-specific downregulation of leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 and protein phosphatase 2A B alpha subunit expression that correlate with enhanced tau phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and membrane-associated LCMT1 and PP2Ac in N2a cells (33Sontag J.-M. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Sontag E. Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT1)-dependent methylation regulates the association of protein phosphatase 2A and tau protein with plasma membrane microdomains in neuroblastoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 27396-27405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that PP2A methylation state concomitantly affects the membrane targeting of PP2A/Bα and Fyn. Parallel immunoblotting of total cell lysates confirmed that the differential enrichment of Fyn in NP-40 detergent-insoluble fractions in our cell models was not related to changes in total Fyn protein expression levels (Fig. 2A, Fig. S1A). To assess whether PP2A-mediated alterations in detergent-insoluble Fyn levels are associated with modulation of Fyn activity state, cell fractions were also probed with validated antibodies recognizing SFKs phosphorylated (pSFK) at the conserved regulatory Tyr416 (numbering depending on species), a readout of SFK activity (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Cellular functions regulated by Src family kinases.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Basal levels of active pSFK were observed in control N2a cells cultured in a “normal” serum-containing medium (Fig. 2A). Relative to controls, there was a marked increase in the pSFK signal in insoluble fractions that closely mirrored the increase in insoluble Fyn protein expression levels in WT- and LCMT1-expressing cells. Conversely, a similar reduction in the levels of pSFK and Fyn was observed in insoluble fractions from L309Δ- and PME1-expressing N2a cells. Yet, after normalizing the pSFK signal (apportioned to Fyn) for Fyn protein expression levels, we found no changes in the net phosphorylation of Fyn in any of the cell lines examined, relative to controls (Fig. S1B). Thus, under our experimental conditions, PP2A methylation influenced steady-state levels of active Fyn in detergent-insoluble fractions via mechanisms that do not implicate overall changes in Fyn activity or protein turnover. Because neuronal Fyn is primarily concentrated in lipid rafts that resist extraction by nonionic detergents (9Stuermer C.A. Lang D.M. Kirsch F. Wiechers M. Deininger S.O. Plattner H.

In this context, we have previously shown that pools of LCMT1 and methylated PP2Ac and PP2A/Bα holoenzymes are concentrated in lipid rafts, whereas demethylated PP2Ac is preferentially distributed in nonraft membrane microdomains purified from N2a cells (33Sontag J.-M.

Males scored higher than females on all three scales. No differences were found between divisions. SC partially mediated the MT-MH relationship, but moderation was not significant. Working towards NCAA MH best practice should include training athletes in both MT and SC skills (via mindfulness)."
https://openalex.org/W3114186335,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes and is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis). NAFLD can transition into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with liver cell injury, inflammation, and an increased risk of fibrosis. We previously found that injections of either 1866, a synthetic ligand for the lectin receptor CD209, or DANA, a sialidase inhibitor, can inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in multiple animal models. The methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet is a model of NASH which results in the rapid induction of liver steatosis and inflammation. In this report, we show that for C57BL/6 mice on a MCD diet, injections of both 1866 and DANA reversed MCD diet-induced decreases in white fat, decreases in adipocyte size, and white fat inflammation. However, these effects were not observed in type 2 diabetic db/db mice on a MCD diet. In db/db mice on a MCD diet, 1866 decreased liver steatosis, but these effects were not observed in C57BL/6 mice. There was no correlation between the ability of 1866 or DANA to affect steatosis and the effects of these compounds on the density of liver macrophage cells expressing CLEC4F, CD64, F4/80, or Mac2. Together these results indicate that 1866 and DANA modulate adipocyte size and adipose tissue macrophage populations, that 1866 could be useful for modulating steatosis, and that changes in the local density of 4 different liver macrophages cell types do not correlate with effects on liver steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W3114579468,"Driving is an everyday task involving a complex interaction between visual and cognitive processes. As such, an increase in the cognitive and/or visual demands can lead to a mental overload which can be detrimental for driving safety. Compiling evidence suggest that eye and head movements are relevant indicators of visuo-cognitive demands and attention allocation. This study aims to investigate the effects of visual degradation on eye-head coordination as well as visual scanning behavior during a highly demanding task in a driving simulator. A total of 21 emmetropic participants (21 to 34 years old) performed dual-task driving in which they were asked to maintain a constant speed on a highway while completing a visual search and detection task on a navigation device. Participants did the experiment with optimal vision and with contact lenses that introduced a visual perturbation (myopic defocus). The results indicate modifications of eye-head coordination and the dynamics of visual scanning in response to the visual perturbation induced. More specifically, the head was more involved in horizontal gaze shifts when the visual needs were not met. Furthermore, the evaluation of visual scanning dynamics, based on time-based entropy which measures the complexity and randomness of scanpaths, revealed that eye and gaze movements became less explorative and more stereotyped when vision was not optimal. These results provide evidence for a reorganization of both eye and head movements in response to increasing visual-cognitive demands during a driving task. Altogether, these findings suggest that eye and head movements can provide relevant information about visuo-cognitive demands associated with complex tasks. Ultimately, eye-head coordination and visual scanning dynamics may be good candidates to estimate drivers’ workload and better characterize risky driving behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3115213701,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis (PD) are chronic inflammatory diseases that appear to occur in tandem. However, the mutual impact PD exerts on RA and vice versa has not yet been defined. To address this issue, we set up an animal model and analyzed how two prime inducers of periodontitis— Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa)– differ in their pathogenic potential. Our experimental setup included collagen induced arthritis (CIA) in the mouse, oral inoculation with Pg or Aa to induce alveolar bone loss and the combination of both diseases in inverted orders of events. Neither pathobiont impacted on macroscopic arthritis and arthritis did not exacerbate alveolar bone loss. However, there were subtle differences between Pg and Aa with the former inducing more alveolar bone loss if PD was induced before CIA. On a molecular level, Pg and Aa led to differential expression patterns in the synovial membranes that were reminiscent of cellular and humoral immune responses, respectively. The Pg and Aa specific signatures in the synovial proteomes suggest a role for oral pathogens in shaping disease subtypes and setting the stage for subsequent therapy response."
https://openalex.org/W3118187447,"Background In kidney transplant patients, parathyroidectomy is associated with an acute decrease in renal function. Acute and chronic effects of parathyroidectomy on renal function have not been extensively studied in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Methods This retrospective cohort study included 494 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for PHPT. Acute renal changes were evaluated daily until day 4 post-parathyroidectomy and were stratified according to acute kidney injury (AKI) criteria. Biochemical assessment included serum creatinine, total and ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation. We compared preoperative and postoperative renal function up to 5 years of follow-up. Results A total of 391 (79.1%) patients were female, and 422 (85.4%) were non-African American. The median age was 58 years old. The median (first and third quartiles) preoperative serum creatinine, PTH and total calcium levels were 0.81 mg/dL (0.68–1.01), 154.5 pg/mL (106–238.5), and 10.9 mg/dL (10.3–11.5), respectively. The median (first and third quartiles) preoperative eGFR was 86 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (65–101.3). After surgery, the median acute decrease in the eGFR was 21 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (p&lt;0.0001). Acutely, 41.1% of patients developed stage 1 AKI, 5.9% developed stage 2 AKI, and 1.8% developed stage 3 AKI. The acute eGFR decrease (%) was correlated with age and PTH, calcium and preoperative creatinine levels in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that the acute change was related to age and preoperative values of ionized calcium, phosphorus and creatinine. The change at 12 months was related to sex, preoperative creatinine and 25OHD. Permanent reduction in the eGFR occurred in 60.7% of patients after an acute episode. Conclusion There was significant acute impairment in renal function after parathyroidectomy for PHPT, and almost half of the patients met the criteria for AKI. Significant eGFR recovery was observed during the first month after surgery, but a small permanent reduction may occur. Patients treated for PHPT seemed to present with prominent renal dysfunction compared to patients who underwent thyroidectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3115741174,"Hormonal changes such as increased cortisol level in blood plasma in response to stress and social environmental stimuli are common among vertebrates including humans and typically accompanied by other physiological processes, such as changes in body pigmentation and/or pupil dilatation. The role of pupil size variation (PSV) as a response to stress have yet to be investigated in fish. We exposed albino and pigmented European catfish to short-term stress and measured changes in pupil size and cortisol level. Albinos showed lower pupil dilatation and higher cortisol levels than did pigmented conspecifics. A clear positive relationship between pupil dilatation and cortisol concentrations was observed for both pigmented and albino specimens, suggesting that PSV can be used as a stress indicator in fish, irrespective of albino’s inability to express social communication by coloring. During the follow-up, we investigated whether a penultimate contest between albino individuals would impact contestants’ social stress during subsequent contact. We observed PSV during the contact of unfamiliar albino catfish with different penultimate experiences (winner (W) and/or loser (L)). Then, the following treatment combinations were tested: WW, WL and LL. Twenty-four-hour contact of two unfamiliar catfish resulted in higher pupil dilatation among individuals with previous winner experience. Among treatment combinations, a WL contest displayed the highest pupil dilatation for winners. PSV reflected socially induced stress in individuals that was accompanied by the “winner” experience and dominancy in albinos. To conclude, the present study validates pupil dilatation as a non-invasive method to evaluate stress level in pigmented as well as albino fish in various contexts."

Methods A 1:2 unmatched case-control study was carried out among deliveries over an 8-month period. Stillbirths were a case group and live births were the control group. Respective placentas of the newborns from both groups were histopathologically analyzed. Maternal information was collected via chart review. Mean and standard deviation were used to summarize the numerical variables while frequency and percentage were used to summarize categorical variables. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions were done to test the association between each variable and the risk of stillbirth. Results A total of 2305 women delivered during the study period. Their mean age was 30 ± 5.9 years. Of all deliveries, 2207 (95.8%) were live births while 98 (4.2%) were stillbirths. Of these, 96 stillbirths (cases) and 192 live births (controls) were enrolled. The average gestational age for the enrolled cases was 33.8 ±3.2 weeks while that of the controls was 36.3±3.6 weeks, ( p-value 0.244). Of all stillbirths, nearly two thirds 61(63.5%) were males while the females were 35(36.5%). Of the stillbirth, 41were fresh stillbirths while 55 were macerated. The risk of stillbirth was significantly associated with lower maternal education [aOR (95% CI): 5.22(2.01–13.58)], history of stillbirth [aOR (95%CI): 3.17(1.20–8.36)], lower number of antenatal visits [aOR (95%CI): 6.68(2.71–16.48), pre/eclampsia [aOR (95%CI): 4.06(2.03–8.13)], and ante partum haemorrhage [OR (95%CI): 2.39(1.04–5.53)]. Placental pathology associated with stillbirth included utero-placental vascular pathology and acute chorioamnionitis. Conclusions Educating the mothers on the importance of regular antenatal clinic attendance, monitoring and managing maternal conditions during antenatal periods should be emphasized. Placentas from stillbirths should be histo-pathologically evaluated to better understand the possible aetiology of stillbirths."
https://openalex.org/W3114238024,"Leydig cells represent the steroidogenic lineage of mammalian testis, which produces testosterone. Genetic evidence indicates the requirement of Notch signaling in maintaining a balance between differentiated Leydig cells and their progenitors during fetal development. In primary Leydig cells, Notch1 expression decreases with testicular development, while the expression of its ligand, Jagged1, remains relatively unchanged, suggesting that the roles of Jagged1 extend beyond Notch signaling. In addition, Jagged1 is known to be processed into its intracellular domain, which then translocate to the nucleus. In this study, we investigated the effect of Jagged1 intracellular domain (JICD) on steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. The independent overexpression of JICD in MA-10 Leydig cells was found to inhibit the activity of cAMP-induced Nur77 promoter. In addition, JICD suppressed Nur77 transactivation of the promoter of steroidogenic genes such as P450scc , P450c17 , StAR , and 3β-HSD . Further, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of JICD in primary Leydig cells repressed the expression of steroidogenic genes, consequently lowering testosterone production. These results collectively suggest that steroidogenesis in testicular Leydig cells, which is regulated by LH/cAMP signaling, is fine-tuned by Jagged1 during testis development."
https://openalex.org/W3115541358,"Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit dry mass) is a key canopy structural characteristic, a measure of photosynthetic capacity, and an important input into many terrestrial process models. Although many studies have examined SLA variation, relatively few data exist from high latitude, climate-sensitive permafrost regions. We measured SLA and soil and topographic properties across a boreal forest permafrost transition, in which dominant tree species changed as permafrost deepened from 54 to &gt;150 cm over 75 m hillslope transects in Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed, Alaska. We characterized both linear and threshold relationships between topographic and edaphic variables and SLA and developed a conceptual model of these relationships. We found that the depth of the soil active layer above permafrost was significantly and positively correlated with SLA for both coniferous and deciduous boreal tree species. Intraspecific SLA variation was associated with a fivefold increase in net primary production, suggesting that changes in active layer depth due to permafrost thaw could strongly influence ecosystem productivity. While this is an exploratory study to begin understanding SLA variation in a non-contiguous permafrost system, our results indicate the need for more extensive evaluation across larger spatial domains. These empirical relationships and associated uncertainty can be incorporated into ecosystem models that use dynamic traits, improving our ability to predict ecosystem-level carbon cycling responses to ongoing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3116536567,"Background Combination antiretroviral drugs (cARVs) prolong patients’ lives but are unfortunately thought to increase complications related to metabolic disorders including type-2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). We sought to confirm the association of cARVs with type-2 DM and ascertain the extent of this association in a rural South African setting. Methods A case-control study of 177 (33.33%) cases with HIV/AIDS and type-2 DM were selected and compared with 354 (66.67%) non-DM HIV/AIDS unmatched controls from a rural district of South Africa’s third most populous province (Eastern Cape). Cases were identified from community health centres using the district health information system, and controls were identified using simple random sampling from the same health facilities. Odds Ratios (OR), together with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for all the univariable and multivariable logistic analyses. Results This study found that cARVs significantly increased the occurrence of type-2 DM among HIV patients. Patients on protease inhibitors (PIs) were at least 21 times significantly (p&lt;0.0001) more likely to be diabetic than those on the fixed dose combination (FDC); those on stavudine (D4T) and zidovudine (AZT) were 2.45 times and 9.44 times respectively more likely to be diabetic than those on FDC (p&lt;0.05). The odds of diabetes increased by more than three-folds for those who had been on antiretroviral drugs for more than 6 years (p&lt;0.005). Conclusion This study has been able to establish the association between cARVs and type-2 DM. It therefore proposes consideration of the usage of AZT, D4T, lopivavir and ritonavir for the treatment of HIV. The study further proposes more prospective research to test these findings further."
https://openalex.org/W3116778189,"Objective To investigate the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in patients with rheumatic diseases receiving high-dose glucocorticoids and to evaluate the preventive effect of isoniazid (INH). Methods This study included 1618 treatment episodes of prolonged (≥4 weeks), high-dose steroids (≥30mg/day of prednisone) in 1160 patients. Of these, INH was administered in 152 (9.4%) treatment episodes (INH group), while others received no prophylaxis (control group). The high-risk subgroup (n = 92) was defined as patients with 1) incomplete adherence to treatment of previous TB, 2) positive interferon-γ release assay, and/or 3) linear/reticular fibrotic lesions on chest radiographs. Primary outcome was 1-year incidence of TB in each group. Results During 1579.8 person-years, 21 cases of TB occurred. The high-risk subgroup showed a significantly higher TB incidence than the non-high-risk subgroup (Incidence rate ratio = 8.29). INH did not significantly affect the 1-year TB incidence in the whole population but numerically reduced it only in the high-risk subgroup [adjusted hazards ratio = 0.37 (95% CI, 0.002–5.10)]. The incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to INH was 111.6 (89.3–137.9)/100 person-years, including one fatal occurrence of fulminant hepatitis. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of TB was lower than the number needed to harm (NNH) for one case of severe ADR only in the high-risk subgroup (11 vs. 16). Conclusion INH treatment to prevent TB might be effective in high-risk patients but has a risk of frequent ADRs, which limits its use in general practice in patients not at a high risk of developing TB."
https://openalex.org/W3117523234,"The high rates of bat mortality caused by operating wind turbines is a concern for wind energy and wildlife stakeholders. One theory that explains the mortality is that bats are not only killed by impact trauma, but also by barotrauma that results from exposure to the pressure variations caused by rotating turbine blades. To date, no published research has calculated the pressure changes that bats may be exposed to when flying near wind turbines and then used these data to estimate the likelihood that turbines cause barotrauma in bats. To address this shortcoming, we performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of a wind turbine and analytical calculations of blade-tip vortices to estimate the characteristics of the sudden pressure changes bats may experience when flying near a utility-scale wind turbine. Because there are no data available that characterize the pressure changes that cause barotrauma in bats, we compared our results to changes in pressure levels that cause barotrauma and mortality in other mammals of similar size. This comparison shows that the magnitude of the low-pressures bats experience when flying near wind turbines is approximately 8 times smaller than the pressure that causes mortality in rats, the smallest mammal for which data are available. The magnitude of the high-pressures that bats may experience are approximately 80 times smaller than the exposure level that causes 50% mortality in mice, which have a body mass similar to several bat species that are killed by wind turbines. Further, our results show that for a bat to experience the largest possible magnitude of low- and high-pressures, they must take very specific and improbable flight paths that skim the surface of the blades. Even a small change in the flight path results in the bat being hit by the blade or experiencing a much smaller pressure change. Accordingly, if bats have a physiological response to rapid low- and high-pressure exposure that is similar to other mammals, we conclude that it is unlikely that barotrauma is responsible for a significant number of turbine-related bat fatalities, and that impact trauma is the likely cause of the majority of wind-turbine-related bat fatalities."
https://openalex.org/W3117794089,"Objectives Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells have been shown to contribute in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study was aimed at investigating the frequency, phenotype, and function of circulating MAIT cells, as well as their alterations after successful direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in HCV-infected patients with or without HIV infection. Methods A total 85 patients (51 HCV-monoinfection and 34 HCV/HIV-coinfection), who received elbasvir/grazoprevir from a clinical trial and 20 healthy controls were included. MAIT cells in blood were characterized using flow cytometry at baseline and 24 weeks post-treatment. Results HCV-monoinfected and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients achieved similar sustained virological response rates (SVR24, 94.1% vs. 97.1%). Circulating MAIT cells in the monoinfection and coinfection groups were presented at low frequencies in comparison with healthy controls (median, 1.1% vs. 1.1% vs. 2.4%, P &lt;0.001) and exhibited features of chronic activation and impaired functional capacity. A negative correlation between circulating MAIT cell frequency and liver stiffness assessed by magnetic resonance elastography was observed. Compared with baseline, increased in circulating MAIT cells after successful DAA therapy was mainly detected in HCV-monoinfected patients compared with HCV/HIV-coinfected individuals. Moreover, MAIT cell restoration was predominantly observed among patients with significant fibrosis to cirrhosis (F2-F4). Conclusions These data indicated that dysregulation of MAIT cells might play a role in the progression of chronic HCV infection. Partial restoration of MAIT cell frequency and function was observed after successful DAA therapy, particularly in HCV-monoinfected patients."

We developed an in silico protocol called i BRAB to design a broad-reactive Fab on a wide range of influenza A virus. The Fab model was constructed based on sequences and structures of available broad-spectrum Abs or Fabs against a wide range of H1N1 influenza A virus. As a result, the proposed Fab model followed i BRAB has good binding affinity over 27 selected HA of different strains of H1 influenza A virus, including wild-type and mutated ones. The examination also took by computational tools to fasten the procedure. This protocol could be applied for a fast-designed therapeutic vaccine against different types of threats."
https://openalex.org/W3114434201,"Hippocampal-cortical dialogue, during which hippocampal ripple oscillations support information transfer, is necessary for long-term consolidation of spatial memories. Whereas a vast amount of work has been carried out to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the impairments of memory formation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), far less work has been accomplished to understand these memory deficiencies at the network-level interaction that may underlie memory processing. We recently demonstrated that freely moving 8 to 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice, a model of AD, are able to learn a spatial reference memory task despite a major deficit in Sharp-Wave Ripples (SWRs), the integrity of which is considered to be crucial for spatial memory formation. In order to test whether reconfiguration of hippocampal-cortical dialogue could be responsible for the maintenance of this ability for memory formation, we undertook a study to identify causal relations between hippocampal and cortical circuits in epochs when SWRs are generated in hippocampus. We analyzed the data set obtained from multielectrode intracranial recording of transgenic and wild-type mice undergoing consolidation of spatial memory reported in our previous study. We applied Directed Transfer Function, a connectivity measure based on Granger causality, in order to determine effective coupling between distributed circuits which express oscillatory activity in multiple frequency bands. Our results showed that hippocampal-cortical coupling in epochs containing SWRs was expressed in the two frequency ranges corresponding to ripple (130–180 Hz) and slow gamma (20–60 Hz) band. The general features of connectivity patterns were similar in the 8 to 9-month-old APP/PS1 and wild-type animals except that the coupling in the slow gamma range was stronger and spread to more cortical sites in APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type group. During the occurrence of SWRs, the strength of effective coupling from the cortex to hippocampus (CA1) in the ripple band undergoes sharp increase, involving cortical areas that were different in the two groups of animals. In the wild-type group, retrosplenial cortex and posterior cingulate cortex interacted with the hippocampus most strongly, whereas in the APP/PS1 group more anterior structures interacted with the hippocampus, that is, anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex. This reconfiguration of cortical-hippocampal interaction pattern may be an adaptive mechanism responsible for supporting spatial memory consolidation in AD mice model."
https://openalex.org/W3117555476,"Introduction Preeclampsia therapy has not been established, except for the termination of pregnancy. The aim of this study was to identify a potential therapeutic agent from traditional Japanese medicine (Kampo) using the drug repositioning method. Materials and methods We screened a library of 74 Kampo to identify potential drugs for the treatment of preeclampsia. We investigated the angiogenic effects of these drugs using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to measure the levels of placental growth factor (PlGF) in conditioned media treated with 100 μg/mL of each drug. We assessed whether the screened drugs affected cell viability. We performed tube formation assays to evaluate the angiogenic effects of PlGF-inducing drugs. PlGF was measured after administering 10, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL of the candidate drug in the dose correlation experiment, and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in the time course experiment. We also performed tube formation assays with the candidate drug and 100 ng/mL of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1). PlGF production by the candidate drug was measured in trophoblastic cells (BeWo and HTR-8/SVneo). The Mann-Whitney U test or one-way analyses of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test were performed. P–values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Results Of the 7 drugs that induced PlGF, Tokishakuyakusan (TS), Shoseiryuto, and Shofusan did not reduce cell viability. TS significantly facilitated tube formation (P = 0.017). TS administration increased PlGF expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. TS significantly improved tube formation, which was inhibited by sFlt1 (P = 0.033). TS also increased PlGF production in BeWo (P = 0.001) but not HTR-8/SVneo cells (P = 0.33). Conclusions By using the drug repositioning method in the in vitro screening of the Kampo library, we identified that TS may have a therapeutic potential for preeclampsia. Its newly found mechanisms involve the increase in PlGF production, and improvement of the antiangiogenic state."
https://openalex.org/W3117755509,"Study objectives While poor sleep quality has been related to increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, long-time shift workers (maritime pilots) did not manifest evidence of early Alzheimer’s disease in a recent study. We explored two hypotheses of possible compensatory mechanisms for sleep disruption: Increased efficiency in generating deep sleep during workweeks (model 1) and rebound sleep during rest weeks (model 2). Methods We used data from ten male maritime pilots (mean age: 51.6±2.4 years) with a history of approximately 18 years of irregular shift work. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A single lead EEG-device was used to investigate sleep in the home/work environment, quantifying total sleep time (TST), deep sleep time (DST), and deep sleep time percentage (DST%). Using multilevel models, we studied the sleep architecture of maritime pilots over time, at the transition of a workweek to a rest week. Results Maritime pilots reported worse sleep quality in workweeks compared to rest weeks (PSQI = 8.2±2.2 vs. 3.9±2.0; p&lt;0.001). Model 1 showed a trend towards an increase in DST% of 0.6% per day during the workweek (p = 0.08). Model 2 did not display an increase in DST% in the rest week (p = 0.87). Conclusions Our findings indicated that increased efficiency in generating deep sleep during workweeks is a more likely compensatory mechanism for sleep disruption in the maritime pilot cohort than rebound sleep during rest weeks. Compensatory mechanisms for poor sleep quality might mitigate sleep disruption-related risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. These results should be used as a starting point for future studies including larger, more diverse populations of shift workers."

We set out to use remote sampling to ascertain vitamin D status and vitamin D supplementation in a cross-sectional study of people with MS across the UK. Methods People with MS and matched controls were recruited from across the UK. 1768 people with MS enrolled in the study; remote sampling kits were distributed to a subgroup. Dried blood spots (DBS) were used to assess serum 25(OH)D in people with MS and controls. Results 1768 MS participants completed the questionnaire; 388 MS participants and 309 controls provided biological samples. Serum 25(OH)D was higher in MS than controls (median 71nmol/L vs 49nmol/L). A higher proportion of MS participants than controls supplemented (72% vs 26%, p&lt;0.001); people with MS supplemented at higher vD doses than controls (median 1600 vs 600 IU/day, p&lt;0.001). People with MS who did not supplement had lower serum 25(OH)D levels than non-supplementing controls (median 38 nmol/L vs 44 nmol/L). Participants engaged well with remote sampling. Conclusions The UK MS population have higher serum 25(OH)D than controls, mainly as a result of vitamin D supplementation. Remote sampling is a feasible way of carrying out large studies."
https://openalex.org/W3116062879,"Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 μm. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex ® test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new elastometric respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of the new respirator over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators. As a universal masking policy is generally implemented, health care workers who are at risk must be protected with appropriate devices. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3116244568,"Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is the gold standard for accurate measurement of thermodynamic parameters in solution reactions. In the data processing of ITC, the non-constant variance of the heat requires special consideration. The variance function approach has been successfully applied in previous studies, but is found to fail under certain conditions in this work. Here, an explicit ITC measurement model consisting of main thermal effects and error components has been proposed to quantitatively evaluate and predict the non-constant variance of the heat data under various conditions. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the ITC measurement model provides higher accuracy and flexibility than variance function in high c -value reactions or with additional error components, for example, originated from the fluctuation of the concentrations or other properties of the solutions. The experimental design of basic error evaluation is optimized accordingly and verified by both Monte Carlo simulation and experiments. An easy-to-run Python source code is provided to illustrate the establishment of the ITC measurement model and the estimation of heat variances. The accurate and reliable non-constant variance of heat is helpful to the application of weighted least squares regression, the proper evaluation or selection of the reaction model."

Our study attempted to elucidate the roles of DM/HTN and the effects of diabetes medications among advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib. Methods From August 2012 to February 2018, 733 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib were enrolled at China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. According to the presence/absence of DM or HTN, they were divided into four groups: control [DM(-)/HTN(-), n = 353], DM-only [DM(+)/HTN(-), n = 91], HTN-only [DM(-)/HTN(+), n = 184] and DM+HTN groups [DM(+)/HTN(+), n = 105]. Based on the types of diabetes medications, there were three groups among DM patients (the combined cohort of DM-only and DM+HTN groups), including metformin (n = 63), non-metformin oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) (n = 104) and regular insulin (RI)/neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) groups (n = 29). We then assessed the survival differences between these groups. Results DM-only and DM+HTN groups significantly presented longer overall survival (OS) than control group (control vs. DM-only, 7.70 vs. 11.83 months, p = 0.003; control vs. DM+HTN, 7.70 vs. 11.43 months, p = 0.008). However, there was no significant OS difference between control and HTN-only group (7.70 vs. 8.80 months, p = 0.111). Besides, all groups of DM patients showed significantly longer OS than control group (control vs. metformin, 7.70 vs. 12.60 months, p = 0.011; control vs. non-metformin OHA, 7.70 vs. 10.80 months, p = 0.016; control vs. RI/NPH, 7.70 vs. 15.20 months, p = 0.026). Conclusions Rather than HTN, DM predicts better prognosis in advanced HCC treated with sorafenib. Besides, metformin, non-metformin OHA and RI/NPH are associated with longer survival among DM-related advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib."
https://openalex.org/W3114470368,"Keratin intermediate filaments are the principal structural element of epithelial cells. Their importance in providing bulk cellular stiffness is well recognized, but their role in the mechanics of cell cortex is less understood. In this study, we therefore compared the cortical stiffness of three keratinocyte lines: primary wild type cells (NHEK2), immortalized wild type cells (NEB1) and immortalized mutant cells (KEB7). The cortical stiffness was measured by lateral indentation of cells with AOD-steered optical tweezers without employing any moving mechanical elements. The method was validated on fixed cells and Cytochalasin-D treated cells to ensure that the observed variations in stiffness within a single cell line were not a consequence of low measurement precision. The measurements of the cortical stiffness showed that primary wild type cells were significantly stiffer than immortalized wild type cells, which was also detected in previous studies of bulk elasticity. In addition, a small difference between the mutant and the wild type cells was detected, showing that mutation of keratin impacts also the cell cortex. Thus, our results indicate that the role of keratins in cortical stiffness is not negligible and call for further investigation of the mechanical interactions between keratins and elements of the cell cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3115181466,"The activation of C. elegans spermatids to crawling spermatozoa is affected by a number of genes including spe-47. Here, we investigate a paralog to spe-47: spe-50, which has a highly conserved sequence and expression, but which is not functionally redundant to spe-47. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication event that produced the paralogs occurred prior to the radiation of the Caenorhabditis species included in the analysis, allowing a long period for the paralogs to diverge in function. Furthermore, we observed that knockout mutations in both genes, either alone or together, have little effect on sperm function. However, hermaphrodites harboring both knockout mutations combined with a third mutation in the him-8 gene are nearly self-sterile due to a sperm defect, even though they have numerous apparently normal sperm within their spermathecae. We suggest that the sperm in these triple mutants are defective in fusing with oocytes, and that the effect of the him-8 mutation is unclear but likely due to its direct or indirect effect on local chromatin structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W3117869873,"Tea is a popular beverage consumed at different temperatures. The effect of tea on teeth at different temperatures has not been studied previously. The present study used an in vitro green tea immersed tooth model at different tea temperatures (hot and cold) compared to an in vivo tea administration model allowing rats to drink tea over the course of a week. The elements present in tea leaves were identified by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and compared to the elements in teeth (enamel surface) using Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). Here, LIBS demonstrated in vivo and in vitro green tea treatments resulted in a significant increase in the mineral elements found in enamel. For the in vitro assessment, elements in enamel varied based on cold-tea and hot-tea treatment; however, hot water reduced the elements in enamel. Atomic force microscopy found the in vivo tea group had a higher roughness average (RA) compared with the in vivo water group. Cold tea and hot tea in vitro groups demonstrated lower RA than in vitro water controls. Scanning electron microscopy found hot water induced cracks more than 1.3μm in enamel while cold tea and hot tea promoted the adhering of extrinsic matter to teeth. Overall, teeth treated to high temperature lost the mineral phase leading to demineralization. Our results indicate that green tea protects enamel, but its protective action in dental structures is enhanced at cold temperature."

This effect has been replicated with different methods and stimuli types. We aimed to a) replicate the effect of symmetry on subjective duration, and b) assess whether it was further modulated by the number of symmetrical axes. There was no evidence for either effect. This null result cannot be explained by reduced statistical power or enhanced floor or ceiling effects. There is no obvious stimulus-based explanation either. However, we are mindful of the reproducibility crisis and file drawer problems in psychology. Other symmetry and time perception researchers should be aware of this null result. One possibility is that the effect of symmetry on subjective duration is limited to very specific experimental paradigms."

Skin patches learn their relative positions from the order in which they are stimulated during motion events. We propose that reversing the local motion within a global motion sequence (‘motion scrambling’) provides a good test for this idea, and present results of the first experiment implementing the paradigm. We used 6-point apparent motion along the forearm. In the Scrambled sequence, two middle locations were touched in reversed order (1-2- 4-3 -5-6, followed by 6-5- 3-4 -2-1, in a continuous loop). This created a double U-turn within an otherwise constant-velocity motion, as if skin patches 3 and 4 physically swapped locations. The control condition, Orderly, proceeded at constant velocity at inter-stimulus onset interval of 120 ms. The 26.4-minute conditioning (delivered in twenty-four 66-s bouts) was interspersed with testing of perceived motion direction between the two middle tactors presented on their own (sequence 3–4 or 4–3). Our twenty participants reported motion direction. Direction discrimination was degraded following exposure to Scrambled pattern and was 0.31 d’ weaker than following Orderly conditioning (p = .007). Consistent with the proposed role of motion, this could be the beginning of re-learning of relative positions. An alternative explanation is that greater speed adaptation occurred in the Scrambled pattern, raising direction threshold. In future studies, longer conditioning should tease apart the two explanations: our re-mapping hypothesis predicts an overall reversal in perceived motion direction between critical locations (for either motion direction), whereas the speed adaptation alternative predicts chance-level performance at worst, without reversing."
