The RAD51encoded product mediates the DNA strand exchange reaction. Efficient strand exchange is contingent upon the addition of the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA binding factor replication protein A (RPA) after Rad51 has nucleated onto the single-stranded DNA. However, if the single-stranded DNA is incubated with Rad51 and RPA simultaneously to mimic what may be expected to occur in vivo, the efficiency of strand exchange decreases dramatically, revealing an inhibitory effect of RPA that is distinct from its stimulatory function. Interestingly, the inclusion of Rad52 protein, which has been purified in this study from yeast cells, restores the efficiency of strand exchange. Thus, Rad52 functions as a co-factor for the Rad51 recombinase, acting specifically to overcome the apparent competition by RPA for binding to single-stranded DNA.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes of the RAD52epistasis group, including RAD50, RAD51,RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57,RAD59, MRE11, and XRS2, function in genetic recombination and the recombinational repair of DNA double-stranded breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Because meiotic recombination is required for the proper disjunction of chromosomal homologs during meiosis I, mutants of the RAD52 group often also exhibit severe meiotic abnormalities, including a failure to sporulate and low spore viability (1Petes T.D.

Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Like RecA, Rad51 protein mediates the homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange reaction (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction is markedly stimulated by the heterotrimeric ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid.binding factor RPA (3Sung P.

However, the manner in which RPA is incorporated is critical for obtaining maximal stimulation, such that if the ssDNA substrate is incubated with Rad51 and RPA simultaneously, the extent of ensuing strand exchange is only a fraction of what is seen when the ssDNA is first incubated with Rad51 prior to the incorporation of RPA (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These results suggest that, although it is an important accessory factor for the Rad51 recombinase activity, RPA can also compete with Rad51 for binding sites on the ssDNA and thus reduce the efficiency of strand exchange (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). That RPA competes with Rad51 protein for sites on ssDNA has also been inferred from the observation that an excess of RPA inhibits the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rad51 protein (5Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 12: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Here Rad52 protein is expressed in yeast and purified to near homogeneity. It is demonstrated that inclusion of Rad52 protein in the strand exchange reaction alleviates the inhibition by RPA, providing evidence for a co-factor function of Rad52 protein in the Rad51-catalyzed DNA strand exchange reaction. The portion of Rad52 protein encompassing amino acid residues 168–456 was expressed as a fusion protein with the E. coli transcriptional terminator rho (ρ). The insoluble ρ-Rad52 fusion protein was purified by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and used for polyclonal antiserum production in rabbits. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the antiserum as described (7Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Rad51 protein were prepared as described (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and the preparation of anti-Rad14 antibodies (8Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Sami Guzder. For immunoprecipitation, extract was prepared in cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors at 2 ml of buffer/gram of cells using a French press (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min) and dialyzed against buffer I (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) containing 150 mm KCl and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min), the clarified dialysate (0.5 ml) was mixed at 4 °C for 4 h with 10 μl of protein A beads bearing affinity-purified anti-Rad14 antibodies, anti-Rad51 antibodies, and anti-Rad52 antibodies, all at 2 mg antibodies/ml matrix. The beads were washed once each with 300 μl of buffer I containing 150 mm KCl, buffer I containing 250 mm KCl, and buffer I alone and then incubated with 30 μl of 3% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min to elute bound proteins. An aliquot of the eluates (5 μl) was subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of the Rad51 and Rad52 proteins. RAD52 gene from nine nucleotides upstream of the first translation initiating ATG codon until 600 nucleotides downstream of the TGA translation stop codon was placed under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, yielding plasmid pR52.1 (2μ,PGK-RAD52). This plasmid was introduced into yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring the RAD51 overexpressing plasmid pR51.1 (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). For the purification of Rad52 protein, extract was prepared from 400 g of frozen yeast paste (7Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and subjected to the purification scheme described in Fig. 2 B. The yield of Rad52 protein was about 100 μg, and the full purification details will be described elsewhere. 2P. Sung, manuscript in preparation. Rad51 protein was purified from yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring plasmid pR51.3 (2μ,PGK-RAD51) as described (9Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). RPA was purified from strain LP2749-9B as described (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Rad51 protein (2 mg) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 3 mg) in 1 ml of coupling buffer (0.1m potassium MOPS, pH 7.5) were mixed with 0.5 ml of Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 5 h. The coupling efficiencies were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the final concentrations of the immobilized ligands were 3.2 mg/ml of Rad51 and 5 mg/ml of BSA. The Affi-Gel matrices were stored at −20 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol. Purified Rad52 protein (1 μg) was diluted to 200 μl with buffer T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) containing 150 mm KCl and 100 μg/ml BSA, and 150 μl of this solution was mixed with 7.5 μl of Affi-Gel 15 beads containing covalently conjugated BSA or Rad51 at 25 °C for 45 min. The beads were then spun down in a microcentrifuge and washed at 4 °C once with 150 μl each of buffer T containing 150 mm KCl, buffer T containing 300 mm KCl, and buffer T alone. The beads were treated with 30 μl 3% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min to elute proteins, and 3 μl of the eluates along with 15 μl of the starting material, 15 μl of the supernatant containing unbound Rad52, and 15 μl the two KCl washes were subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of Rad52 protein. In the experiment shown in Fig.3 B, the reaction (final volume, 50 μl) was assembled by mixing 25 μg of Rad51 protein (11.6 μm) added in 4 μl of storage buffer with 2.4 μl of buffer K containing 250 mm KCl (used for Rad52 storage) and 520 ng of φX174 viral (+) strand (32 μm nucleotides) added last in 4 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA) in 40 μl of buffer R (35 mm potassium MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT). After a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, 8 μg of RPA (1.35 μm) in 2 μl of storage buffer was added, followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, then 520 ng of φX174 dsDNA (16 μm base pairs) was added in 4 μl of TE, and 4 μl of 50 mm spermidine were incorporated. The complete reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and 5.5-μl portions were withdrawn at the indicated times and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis as described (4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The reaction that had no RPA (Fig. 3 B) was assembled and incubated in exactly the same way, except that 2 μl of storage buffer that did not contain RPA was added after preincubation of Rad51 protein with the viral (+) strand. In the experiment in Fig. 3 C, 25 μg of Rad51 protein (11.6 μm) added in 4 μl of storage buffer, 8 μg of RPA (1.35 μm) added in 2 μl of storage buffer, and 2.4 μl of buffer K with 250 mm KCl (used for Rad52 storage) and 520 ng of φX viral (+) strand (32 μm nucleotides) added last in 4 μl of TE were mixed together in 40 μl of buffer R on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the incorporation of 520 ng of linear φX dsDNA (16 μm base pairs) added in 4 μl of TE, 2 μl H2O, and 4 μl of 50 mm spermidine to complete the reaction mixture (50 μl), which was incubated at 37 °C. At the times indicated, a 5.5-μl portion was withdrawn and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis. To examine the effect of Rad52 protein on strand exchange (Fig. 4), 25 μg of Rad51 protein (11.6 μm) in 3 μl of storage buffer, 8 μg of RPA (1.35 μm) in 2 μl of storage buffer, and 3.5 μg of purified Rad52 protein (1.25 μm) in 2.4 μl of storage buffer were mixed with 520 ng of φX viral (+) strand (32 μm nucleotides) added in 4 μl of TE in 40 μl of buffer R on ice and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by the incorporation of 520 ng of linear φX dsDNA (16 μm base pairs) in 4 μl of TE, 2 μl of H2O, and 4 μl of 50 mm spermidine to complete the reaction mixture (50 μl), which was incubated at 37 °C. Portions (5.5 μl) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at the indicated times and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis. As seen in immunoblot analyses, Rad52 protein in yeast extract consists of a number of closely spaced bands with sizes ranging from 61 to 63 kDa (Figs. 1 and2). The abundance of these Rad52 protein species increases with elevated expression of RAD52, as when extract from yeast cells harboring the overproducing plasmid pR52.1 (2μ, PGK-RAD52) was analyzed (see Fig.2 A). The gel mobility of these Rad52 species was not altered by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, suggesting that the difference in gel mobility of these Rad52 species is not due to phosphorylation. The RAD52 protein coding frame within the first 40 amino acid residues contains five potential translation initiating ATG codons; it is possible that the multiple Rad52 species are the result of alternate ATG codons being used in the translation of the RAD52 encoded message. Immunoprecipitation experiments using protein A-agarose beads bearing covalently conjugated anti-Rad51 and anti-Rad52 antibodies were carried out to determine whether Rad52 protein in cell extract is physically associated with Rad51 protein. As shown in Fig. 1 A, anti-Rad51 immunobeads precipitated, in addition to Rad51, also Rad52 protein, and likewise, anti-Rad52 immunobeads co-precipitated Rad51 protein. The amount of Rad52 protein that co-precipitated with Rad51 protein was very similar to that directly precipitated by its cognate antibodies, suggesting that a substantial portion of the cellular Rad52 protein exists as a complex with Rad51 protein. Interestingly, the amount of Rad51 protein that co-precipitated with Rad52 protein was less than 10% of that precipitated by anti-Rad51 immunobeads, suggesting that Rad51 is present in considerable excess over Rad52 protein in yeast cells. Consistent with this deduction, the amount of Rad51 protein that co-precipitated with Rad52 increased with overexpression of the Rad52 protein, as when extract from LP2749-9B harboring pR52.1 (2μ, PGK-RAD52) was used for immunoprecipitation. As a result of a 20-fold overproduction of Rad52 protein, approximately 40% of the Rad51 protein in cell extract became associated with the Rad52 protein (Fig. 1 A). The association of Rad52 with Rad51 in cell extract was likely due to a direct interaction between the two proteins, because purified Rad52 bound to purified Rad51 immobilized on Affi-gel 15 beads (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, the level of Rad52 protein in strain LP2749-9B harboring pR52.1 was enhanced about 2.5-fold upon the introduction of theRAD51 overexpressing plasmid pR51.1 (2μ,ADCI-RAD51; Ref. 3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Because Rad51 and Rad52 proteins interact (Refs. 2Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 10Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1), it appears that interaction of Rad52 with Rad51 results in stabilization of the former in yeast cells. For the purification of Rad52 protein, extract from strain LP2749-9B co-harboring pR51.1 and pR52.1 was subjected to the chromatographic procedure outlined in Fig. 2 B. Rad52 protein from the last step of purification in Mono Q was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 2 C) and was used in the studies below. In the earliest or the presynaptic phase of the in vitrohomologous pairing and strand exchange reaction (Refs. 11Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 229-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar and 12Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 3 A), Rad51 protein polymerizes on the ssDNA substrate to form a nucleoprotein filament, within the confines of which the ensuing pairing and strand exchange occur (4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Previous work has indicated that the most efficient pairing and strand exchange is effected by incubating ssDNA during the presynaptic phase, first with Rad51 protein alone for a few minutes before incorporating RPA (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In this standard strand exchange reaction, about 60% (11% joint molecules and 49% nicked circular duplex) and 87% (12% joint molecules and 75% nicked circular duplex) of the input linear dsDNA had been converted into strand exchange products after 36 and 72 min of incubation, respectively. As reported previously (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 5Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 12: 7940-7945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and reiterated in Fig. 3 (B andD), RPA plays an important accessory role in the strand exchange reaction, because in its absence, the efficiency of pairing and strand exchange decreased to a point where only 6% of the input linear dsDNA had been converted to joint molecules and ≤1% to the full strand exchange product, nicked circular duplex, by the reaction end point of 72 min. When RPA was added together with Rad51 protein to the ssDNA during presynapsis, the level of ensuing pairing and strand exchange was only a fraction of what could be achieved in the standard reaction. Specifically, the level of reaction products after 60 min of incubation was only 9% (4% nicked circular duplex) of the input linear duplex (Fig. 3, C and D), as compared with about 80% conversion into products after the same incubation time in the standard reaction (Fig. 3, B and D). These results indicated that RPA can also exert a negative effect on DNA strand exchange and suggested that other RAD52 group proteins may function to neutralize the inhibition by RPA. I therefore examined whether purified Rad52 protein was capable of alleviating the inhibition by RPA. Because the results from the immunoprecipitation experiments summarized earlier (Fig. 1 A) revealed that Rad52 protein is of a much lower cellular abundance than Rad51 protein, initially, a molar amount of Rad52 protein about one-tenth that of Rad51 protein was used in the strand exchange reaction. Interestingly, the inclusion of Rad52 protein (1.25 μm) with Rad51 (11.6 μm) and RPA (1.35 μm) resulted in marked stimulation (Fig. 4, A andB), restoring strand exchange to a level comparable with that seen in the standard reaction (Fig. 3, B andD). For instance, at the mid-point of the reaction (36 min of incubation), the amount of strand exchange products was 56% (44% nicked circular duplex) of the input linear dsDNA when Rad52 was present (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas only 7% of the input dsDNA (3% nicked circular duplex) had been converted to products in its absence (Fig. 3, C and D). As shown in Fig. 4 A (lanes 1–3), in the absence of RPA, the level of pairing and strand exchange obtained with Rad51 and Rad52 proteins was essentially the same as the extremely low level seen with Rad51 alone (Fig. 3 C), which suggested that Rad52 does not function to replace RPA. Strand exchange enhancement was also examined as a function of Rad52 protein concentration, and it was found, in reactions containing 11.6 μm Rad51 and 1.35 μm RPA, that the maximal level of stimulation occurred at about 1.0 μm Rad52 protein (Fig. 4 C). The possibility that Rad52 might have pairing and strand exchange activity was also examined. However, in the absence of Rad51 protein, there was no evidence of homologous pairing, even at a Rad52 protein concentration (5 μm) much higher than those used in the experiments shown in Fig. 4 and regardless of whether or not RPA was added to the reaction during or after incubation of Rad52 with the ssDNA (data not shown). In its role as a co-factor for the Rad51 recombinase, Rad52 protein resembles the heterodimer of the Rad55 and Rad57 proteins, which is also capable of overcoming the inhibition by RPA (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the recombination defects in rad55 andrad57 mutants can be suppressed partially by introducing a multicopy plasmid that contains the RAD52 gene (13Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92 (2929): 6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), suggesting that a common biochemical function exists in the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer and Rad52 protein. Our results now provide evidence that this common function may be an ability of these protein factors to facilitate Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein assembly in the presence of RPA. The function of Rad52 protein and the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer in the Rad51-mediated strand exchange reaction is reminiscent of that described for the bacteriophage T4 UvsY protein (Refs. 14Jiang H. Giedroc D. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7904-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 15Morrical S.W. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which act to allow their cognate recombinases UvsX protein and RecA protein to efficiently utilize ssDNA coated with T4 gene 32 protein and E. coli SSB protein for pairing and strand exchange. Both Rad52 protein and the Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer bind ssDNA (6Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I.

https://openalex.org/W2027874598,"Intracellular fatty acid (FA) concentrations are in part determined by a regulated import/export system that is controlled by two key proteins, <i>i.e.</i> fatty acid transport protein (FATP) and acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), which respectively facilitate the transport of FAs across the cell membrane and their esterification to prevent their efflux. The aim of this investigation was to analyze the expression pattern of FATP and ACS and to determine whether their expression was altered by agents that affect FA metabolism through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) such as the fibrates and thiazolidinediones. FATP mRNA was ubiquitously expressed, with highest levels being detected in adipose tissue, heart, brain, and testis. Fibrate treatment, which is known to preferentially activate PPARα, induced FATP mRNA levels in rat liver and intestine and induced ACS mRNA levels in liver and kidney. The antidiabetic thiazolidinedione BRL 49653, which is a high-affinity ligand for the adipocyte-specific PPARγ form, caused a small induction of muscle but a robust induction of adipose tissue FATP mRNA levels. BRL 49653 did not affect liver FATP and had a tendency to decrease heart FATP mRNA levels. ACS mRNA levels in general showed a similar pattern after BRL 49653 as FATP except for the muscle where ACS mRNA was induced. This regulation of FATP and ACS expression by PPAR activators was shown to be at the transcriptional level and could also be reproduced <i>in vitro</i> in cell culture systems. In the hepatocyte cell lines AML-12 or Fa 32, fenofibric acid, but not BRL 49653, induced FATP and ACS mRNA levels, whereas in the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line, the PPARγ ligand induced FATP and ACS mRNA levels quicker than fenofibric acid. Inducibility of ACS and FATP mRNA by PPARα or γ activators correlated with the tissue-specific distribution of the respective PPARs and was furthermore associated with a concomitant increase in FA uptake. Most interestingly, thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents seem to favor adipocyte-specific FA uptake relative to muscle, perhaps underlying in part the beneficial effects of these agents on insulin-mediated glucose disposal."
https://openalex.org/W2059687919,"We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides from the hemolymph of shrimpsPenaeus vannamei in which immune response has not been experimentally induced. The three molecules display antimicrobial activity against fungi and bacteria with a predominant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of enzymatic cleavages, Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and cDNA cloning using a hemocyte cDNA library. The mature molecules (50 and 62 residues) are characterized by an NH2-terminal domain rich in proline residues and a COOH-terminal domain containing three intramolecular disulfide bridges. One of these molecules is post-translationally modified by a pyroglutamic acid at the first position. Comparison of the data obtained from the cDNA clones and mass spectrometry showed that two of these peptides are probably COOH-terminally amidated by elimination of a glycine residue. These molecules with no evident homology to other hitherto described antimicrobial peptides were named penaeidins.

The defense mechanisms, largely based on the activity of the blood cells, include encapsulation, phagocytosis and associated oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms (1Bachère E. Mialhe E. Rodriguez J. Fish Shellfish Immunol. 1995; 5: 597-612Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the prophenoloxidase activating system leading to melanization, and hemolymph coagulation, a rapid and powerful system that prevents blood loss upon wounding and participates in the engulfment of invading microorganisms (2Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Johansson M.W. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.R. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996: 229-253Google Scholar). In the horseshoe crab (Chelicerata, Merostomata), the oldest existent marine arthropod, the hemocytes respond to a bacterial endotoxin activation by cell adhesion and degranulation. The released granule-specific proteins include clotting factors essential for hemolymph coagulation, lectins, and a large number of antimicrobial substances (for review see Ref. 3Iwanaga S. Muta T. Shigenaga T. Miura Y. Seki N. Saito T. Kawabata S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 712: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In insects, the synthesis of potent antimicrobial peptides or polypeptides induced upon injury is a major and important component of the humoral innate host defense (4Hoffmann J.A. Reichhart J.-M. Hetru C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in crustaceans, the role of antimicrobial peptides in the survival against invading microorganisms has hardly been studied. Until now, bactericidal activities have only been demonstrated in the hemocytes of very few crustaceans (5Chisholm J.R.S. Smith V.J. J. Mar. Biol. Assoc. U. K. 1992; 72: 529-542Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Three constitutive hemocytic proteins have been isolated to date in the shore crab, Carcinus maenas, and one of these, a 6.5-kDa antibacterial peptide, has been partially characterized (6Schnapp D. Kemp G.D. Smith V.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial peptides are widespread in the living kingdom, and a large number of these molecules have been isolated from vertebrates and invertebrates (reviewed by Hetru et al. (7Hetru C. Bulet P. Cociancich S. Dimarcq J.-L. Hoffmann D. Hoffmann J.A. Hoffmann J.A. Janeway C.A. Natori J.S. Phylogenetic Perspectives in Immunity: The Insect Host Defense.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For the time being and for convenience, these antimicrobial peptides are tentatively classified into four distinct groups based on amino acid sequences, secondary structures, and functional similarities: (i) linear basic peptides forming amphipathic α-helices including the cecropins, the first antimicrobial peptide isolated from insect hemolymph (for review see Ref. 9Boman H.G.

Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6114-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mode of action, the broad activity, the molecular diversity, and the noncytotoxicity of all these circulating antimicrobial peptides make them very attractive as therapeutic agents for pharmaceutical or agricultural applications (26Norelli J.L. Aldwinckle H.S. Destefano-Beltran L. Jaynes J.M. Euphytica. 1994; 77: 123-128Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar,27Jaynes J.M. Nagpala P. Destefano-Beltran L. Huang J.H. Kim J. Denny T. Cetiner S. Plant Sci. (Limerick). 1993; 89: 43-53Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cultivation of penaeid shrimp is a worldwide economically important activity especially in intertropical developed and developing countries. However, this industry is now suffering serious problems linked to infectious diseases (28Lightner D.V. McVey J.P. Crustacean aquaculture. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1983: 289-320Google Scholar, 29Vega-Villasante F. Puente M.E. Prev. Vet. Med. 1993; 17: 271-282Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), which cause a decrease in growth in shrimp production resulting in vast economic losses. In this context, the control of diseases has become a priority in terms of research in immunology and genetics to insure the long term survival of shrimp aquaculture. Therefore, we have undertaken the isolation of antimicrobial peptides in the tropical shrimp Penaeus vannamei. We report here, for the first time in a crustacean, the biochemical characterization, the antimicrobial activities, and the cDNA cloning of three antimicrobial peptides purified to homogeneity from the hemolymph of P. vannamei that have not been experimentally infected. These peptides, with molecular masses ranging from 5.5 to 6.6 kDa, are characterized by an over-representation of proline residues in their NH2-terminal domain and by 6 cysteine residues engaged in three intramolecular disulfide bridges concentrated in their COOH-terminal domain. One of these molecules is unusual in that the NH2 and COOH termini are blocked by a pyroglutamic acid residue and an amidation, respectively. These peptides, which cannot be associated to groups hitherto described, were named penaeidins, after the genus Penaeus. Juvenile white leg shrimp, P. vannamei (Penaeidae, Decapoda) were obtained from an intensive shrimp farm in the province of Guayas, Ecuador. A total of 225 ml of hemolymph from five hundred animals (weight ranging from 10 to 30 g) was collected from the ventral sinus located at the base of the first abdominal segment, under 110 volume of anticoagulant buffer (10% sodium citrate, pH 7) supplemented with 200 μm phenylthiourea as a melanization inhibitor and 40 μg/ml aprotinin as a protease inhibitor. The hemolymph was then centrifuged at 700 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove the blood cells. Plasma (cell-free hemolymph) and hemocytes were separately frozen at −70 °C until use. The plasma was first diluted (1:1 v/v) with MilliQ water and further (1:1 v/v) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The pH was then brought to 3.9 with 1 m HCl in an ice-cold water bath under gentle stirring for 1 h. Two successive centrifugations (8000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C) were performed to clarify the supernatant, which was kept in an ice-cold water bath at 4 °C until use. After thawing, the hemocytes were homogenized using a Dounce apparatus (maximum, 152 μm; minimum, 76 μm) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.7, containing 50 mm NaCl. After centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was acidified to pH 3.6 by the addition of 1 m HCl and kept without freezing at 4 °C until further purification. The pellet containing cellular organelles was extracted in 2 m acetic acid by sonication (3 × 30 s) at medium power (Branson Ultrasons, Annemasse, France) in an ice-cold water bath. Debris was eliminated by centrifugation (8000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the organelle acid extract was kept at 4 °C until use. The plasmatic fraction and the cellular cytosolic and organelle acid extracts were separately loaded onto 35 cc Sep-Pak C18Vac cartridges (10 g, Waters Associates) equilibrated in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). After washing with acidified water, three stepwise elutions were performed with successively 5, 40, and 80% acetonitrile in acidified water. The different fractions obtained were lyophilized and reconstituted with MilliQ water before subjection to reversed-phase HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry; nanoES-MS-MS, nanoelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. The 40% Sep-Pak fractions were subjected to reversed-phase chromatography on an Aquapore RP300 C8 column (4.6 × 220 mm, Brownlee™) equilibrated in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Separation of the 40% Sep-Pak fractions was performed with a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water over 80 min (0.72% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were hand collected, dried under vacuum (Speed-Vac, Savant), reconstituted in MilliQ water, and tested for antimicrobial activity as described below. Reversed-phase fractions showing the antimicrobial activity were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using two serially linked HPLC columns (Ultraspherogel SEC 3000 and SEC 2000 columns, 7.5 × 300 mm, Beckman) protected by a precolumn (Ultraspherogel SEC, 7.5 × 40 mm, Beckman). Elution was performed under isocratic conditions with 30% acetonitrile in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were hand collected and treated as above. Different gradients were used for this third purification step of peptides 1–3. Peptides 1 and 2 were purified on the same reversed-phase column as in Step 1 at a controlled temperature of 35 °C with a linear biphasic gradient of 2–21% acetonitrile in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) over 10 min (1.9% acetonitrile/min) and of 21–35% over 50 min (0.28% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Peptide 3 was purified with a linear biphasic gradient of 2–23% acetonitrile in acidified water over 10 min (2.1% acetonitrile/min) and of 23–37% over 50 min (0.28% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at 35 °C. The last purification steps for peptides 1–3 were performed on a narrow bore C18reversed-phase column (Delta Pak HPI C18, 2 × 150 mm, Waters Associates) at 40 °C at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using the biphasic gradients described above in Step 3. All HPLC purification steps at room temperature were carried out on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with a Beckman 168 photodiode array detector. For the HPLC purifications under controlled temperature, a Waters HPLC system (Waters 626 pump) attached to a tunable absorbance detector (Waters 486) was used. Column effluent was monitored by its UV absorption at 225 nm. Fractions corresponding to absorbance peaks were hand collected in polypropylene tubes (Microsorb 75 × 12 mm, Nunc immunotubes), concentrated under vacuum (Savant), and reconstituted in MilliQ water (Millipore™) before antimicrobial activity was tested. Peptide purity was ascertained by capillary zone electrophoresis. Analysis was performed on 2 nl of fractions using a 270A-HT electrophoresis system (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) equipped with a fused silica capillary (length, 72 cm; internal diameter, 50 μm). Electrophoresis was monitored at 30 °C in 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 2.5, at 20 kV. Capillary effluent was detected by its absorbance at 200 nm. Purified peptides were subjected to reduction and alkylation using the procedures already described (30Bulet P. Cociancich S. Reuland M. Sauber F. Bischoff R. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide (1–2 nmol) was dissolved in 40 μl of 0.5 m Tris HCl containing 2 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, pH 7.5, to which 2 μl of 2.2 m dithiotreitol were added. The samples were incubated under oxygen-free conditions for 1 h at 45 °C. 2 μl of freshly distilled 4-vinylpyridine (Aldrich) were added, and incubation was continued for 10 min at 45 °C under N2 to prevent oxidation. The S-pyridylethylated peptide was desalted on an Aquapore RP300 C8 column (220 × 4.6 mm, Brownlee™) using a linear gradient of 2–60% acetonitrile in acidified water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) over 120 min (0.48% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Native andS-pyridylethylated peptides (5 μg) were subjected individually to trypsin and α-chymotrypsin treatments (Boehringer Mannheim). Trypsin and chymotrypsin hydrolysis were performed at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 (w/w) in a 40-μl reaction containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.5 and in a 50-μl reaction containing 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 and 10 mmCaCl2, respectively. Incubations were carried out for 16 h at 37 and 25 °C for trypsin and α-chymotrypsin treatments, respectively. The reactions were stopped by acidification with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptidic fragments were separated on a Delta Pak HPI C18 column (2 × 150 mm, Waters Associates) and eluted with a linear gradient of 2–80% acetonitrile in acidified water over 120 min (0.65% acetonitrile/min) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. TheS-pyridylethylated peptide (5 μg) was treated with arginyl endopeptidase (Takara, Otsu) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in a 20-μl reaction containing 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 and 0.01% Tween 20. Incubation was performed for 16 h at 37 °C. Peptidic fragments were separated following the procedure described above. 10 μg of each native andS-pyridylethylated peptides were separately treated with thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27) from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus(Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 37 °C at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:2 (w/w) in 0.1 m MES at pH 6.5 supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. The digestion was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides generated by protease hydrolysis were separated by reversed-phase HPLC for further characterization by MALDI-TOF-MS and microsequencing by Edman degradation. This study was carried out on a Bruker (Bremen) BIFLEX™ matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with SCOUT™ High Resolution Optics, an X-Y multisample probe, a gridless reflector, and the HIMAS™ linear detector. This instrument has a maximum acceleration potential of 30 kV and may be operated in either linear or reflector mode. Ionization was accomplished with the 337 nm beam from a nitrogen laser with a repetition rate of 3 Hz. The output signal of the detector was digitized at a sampling rate of 250 MHz in the linear mode using a 1 GHz digital oscilloscope. A camera mounted on a microscope allowed the inspection of the sample crystallization homogeneity before measurement. All spectra were obtained in the linear positive ion mode and externally calibrated with a mixture of three standard peptides (angiotensin II, ACTH 18–39, and bovine insulin with MH+at m/z 1047.2, 2466.1, and 5734.6, respectively). Purified peptides or enzymatically derived fragments (1 μl) were deposited on a thin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid crystals made by fast evaporation of a saturated solution in acetone (31Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 32Vorm O. Mann M. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 5: 955-958Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The droplets were allowed to dry under gentle vacuum before introduction into the mass spectrometer. The nanoelectrospray (nanoES) experiments were done on a triple quadrupole Bio-Q mass spectrometer, upgraded by the manufacturer so that the source and the quadrupoles had Quattro II performances (Micromass Ltd. UK, Altrincham). The conventional electrospray probe was modified so that a glass capillary similar to that described by Wilm and Mann (33Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) could be positioned at about 2 mm from the first cone of the electrospray source. The source was used without counter electrode, and the drying gas heated at 50 °C was nitrogen. The glass capillary and extracting cone voltages were 900 and 50 V, respectively. Electrical contact between the probe tip and the metallized glass capillary (long needle type glass capillaries purchased from the Protein Analysis Company, Odense M) was made by using a graphite cone inside the Swagelok union instead of the customary brushing of an organic solution of graphite (33Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar) giving interference ions in the low m/z range. Before connecting the glass capillary into the mass spectrometer, it was opened by briefly touching a metal capillary (0.5-mm inner diameter × 150 mm) connected to a vacuum source. The opened glass capillary was then washed by applying a N2 pressure to reduce contamination by impurities in the metal layer. After loading the sample solution at a concentration of 1 pmol/μl in acetonitrile/water containing 1% formic acid, the glass capillary was inserted in the MS source, and static air pressure was applied to give a flow rate of approximately 20 nl/min, which allowed a stable signal recording for up to 3 h. In a first approach, the parent ion (m/z = 520.1) produced at a low cone voltage (V c = 30 V) was selected in the first quadrupole mass analyzer and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with argon gas at 4.5 × 10−2 Pa at 40 V. To gain additional structural information, MS-MS experiments on fragments generated by source collision of the parent ion at m/z 520 with an extracting cone voltage of 100 V were performed using 60 and 80 V in the collision cell. The resulting fragment ions were named according to Roepstorff and Fohlman's nomenclature (34Roepstorff P. Fohlman M. J. Biomed. Mass. Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar). The quadrupole analyzers were calibrated by using the multiply charged ions from a separate acquisition of horse heart myoglobin (16951.5 Da). Native,S-pyridylethylated peptides and peptidic fragments were subjected to Edman degradation on a pulse liquid automatic sequenator (Applied Biosystems, model 473A). The microbial strains used to determine antimicrobial activities during the purification steps were those used in previous studies (11Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F.

The marine fungus Fusarium oxysporum, pathogenic for penaeid shrimp (gift from Dr. Alain Vey, INRA, St. Christol-les-Alès, France) was used to complete the activity spectrum. After each step of purification, an aliquot of each eluted fraction reconstituted in MilliQ water was tested by the liquid growth inhibition assay already described (22Bulet P. Dimarcq J.-L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-μl aliquots from each test fraction were incubated in microtiter plates with 100 μl of a suspension of a midlogarithmic phase culture of bacteria (E. coli D31 or M. luteus) at a starting optical density ofA 600 = 0.001 in Poor-Broth nutrient medium (1% bactotryptone, 0.5% NaCl, w/v). Bacterial growth was assayed by measurement of the optical density at A 600 after a 24-h incubation at 30 °C. An identical procedure was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the molecules on the previously described bacterial strains. The MIC values are expressed as intervals of concentration (a–b), where a is the highest concentration at which bacteria are growing and b is the lowest concentration that causes 100% of growth inhibition (36Casteels P. Ampe C. Jacobs F. Tempst P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7044-7054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A midlogarithmic phase culture ofM. luteus in Poor-Broth nutrient medium was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of the antimicrobial peptides of interest or water (control). The final concentration of the molecules to be tested was eight times over the MIC value. 20-μl aliquots were removed at different time intervals and plated on nutrient agar. The number of colony-forming units was determined after 24 h at 37 °C. Antifungal activity was monitored againstN. crassa and F. oxysporum as described previously (11Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L.

Briefly, 80 μl of fungal spores (final concentration, 104 spores/ml) suspended in potato dextrose broth (Difco) at half-strength supplemented with tetracycline (10 μg/ml) and cefotaxim (100 μg/ml) were added to 10 μl of fractions in microtitration plates. The final volume was brought to 100 μl by the addition of 10 μl of water. Growth inhibition can be observed microscopically after a 24-h incubation at 25 °C in the dark and measured by the increase in optical density (at 600 nm) after 48 h. Poly(A)+ RNA from juvenile shrimp hemocytes harvested 6 and 12 h after a bacterial challenge were used to construct a cDNA library in the ZAP Express vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to prepare a DNA probe corresponding to the P3 peptide (see “Results”) isolated from P. vannamei. From the peptide sequence obtained by Edman degradation, a degenerate oligonucleotide probe pool corresponding to the residues 38–44 of the mature molecule was designed by back translation: 5′-GGIAT(A/T/C)(A/T)(G/C)ITT(C/T)(A/T)(G/C)ICA(A/G)GC-3′ (see Fig.4 A). 3 μg of total hemocyte RNA were submitted to reverse transcription using the Ready-to-Go You-prime first-strand beads kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) with a 18-base poly(dT) oligonucleotide as primer. One-fifth of the reaction was directly used as a template for polymerase chain reaction with the degenerate pool primers and the poly(dT) oligonucleotide. PCR was performed with five cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 37 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in 1.5 mm MgCl2and 1 μm primers. The resulting 497-base pair fragment corresponding to a fragment of P3 cDNA was sequenced and a 440-base pair subfragment, for the most part consisting of the 3′-untranslated region, was generated byBsaAI enzymatic hydrolysis (see Fig. 4 A). This fragment was cloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene). It was labeled by random priming using the Ready-to-Go DNA labeling kit (Pharmacia) and used to screen 500,000 plaques from the cDNA library transferred to Hybond-N filter membranes (Amersham Corp.). High stringency hybridizations were carried out overnight at 65 °C in 5 × Denhardt's solution, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 150 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed in a solution of 0.5 × SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C followed by autoradiography. A secondary screening was performed to purify the positive plaques. Phagemids were obtained byin vivo excision according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced on both strands. A screening at low stringency was performed to isolate other members of the family. A probe was generated by PCR on a P3 cDNA clone with 5′-GTGTACAAGGGCGGTTACACG-3′ as the upstream primer and 5′-CAACAGGTTGTCAAGCGAGGT-3′ as the downstream primer. The amplified fragment consisted mainly of the P3 open reading frame (ORF). Radiolabeling and hybridization were identical to those previously described with the exception of a reduced hybridization temperature (50 °C). Antimicrobial peptides were purified from about 225 ml of hemolymph prepared from P. vannamei shrimps collected in an intensive culture farm and that had not been experimentally bacteria-challenged. Three different acid extracts were prepared, one from plasma (cell free hemolymph; P) and two from hemocytes: cytosolic (HC) and organelle-rich (cellular debris; HO) fractions (see “Materials and Methods”). The three extracts were directly applied to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges. Elutions were successively performed with 5, 40, and 80% solutions of acetonitrile in acidified water.

https://openalex.org/W2019978236,"Pathogenic Yersinia species have a specialized secretion system (type III) to target cytotoxic Yop proteins during infection. The signals of YopE and YopN sufficient for the secretion of translational reporter fusions were mapped to the first 15 codons. No common amino acid or peptide sequence could be identified among the secretion signals. Systematic mutagenesis of the secretion signal yielded mutants defective in Yop translation; however, no point mutants could be identified that specifically abolished secretion. Frameshift mutations that completely altered the peptide sequences of these signals also failed to prevent secretion. Thus, the signal that leads to the type III secretion of Yop proteins appears to be encoded in their messenger RNA rather than the peptide sequence."

PS1 and PS2 are homologous polytopic membrane proteins that are processed endoproteolytically into two fragments in vivo. In the present report we examine the fate of endogenous PS1 and PS2 after overexpression of human PS1 or PS2 in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cell lines and human PS1 in transgenic mice. Remarkably, in N2a cell lines and in brains of transgenic mice expressing human PS1, accumulation of human PS1 derivatives is accompanied by a compensatory, and highly selective, decrease in the steady-state levels of murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives. Similarly, the levels of murine PS1 derivatives are diminished in cultured cells overexpressing human PS2. To define the minimal sequence requirements for “replacement” we expressed familial Alzheimer's disease-linked and experimental deletion variants of PS1. These studies revealed that compromised accumulation of murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives resulting from overexpression of human PS1 occurs in a manner independent of endoproteolytic cleavage. Our results are consistent with a model in which the abundance of PS1 and PS2 fragments is regulated coordinately by competition for limiting cellular factor(s).

Remarkably, murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives fail to accumulate in these cells. These observations in cultured cells have been confirmed by the demonstration that murine PS2 is “replaced” by human PS1 derivatives in brains of transgenic mice expressing human PS1. Arguing against the view that replacement of murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives in cultured cells may be the result of artifacts associated with protein overexpression, we document that neither the steady-state levels of murinePS1/PS2 mRNA, synthetic rates of total membrane-bound or soluble protein, nor the steady-state levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins, i.e. calnexin and BiP/GRP78, are altered in these cell lines. Interestingly, overexpression of the PS1ΔE9 variant in neuroblastoma cells also resulted in failed accumulation of murine PS1 derivatives, findings that suggest that endoproteolytic processing is not obligatory for replacement. In summary, our results are consistent with a model in which overexpressed human PS1 or PS2 competes with newly synthesized endogenous PS1/PS2 for limiting cellular component(s) that regulate endoproteolysis of full-length PS1/PS2 polypeptide and/or accumulation of the resulting derivatives.DISCUSSIONMutations in two related genes, PS1 and PS2, account for the majority of early onset cases of FAD (30Schellenberg G.D.

The molecular mechanism(s) underlying this fascinating regulatory aspect of PS biology are yet to be established.

Greenwald I. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1015-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).To these latter observations, the present report provides an important insight. We document that in cultured cells overexpressing human PS1, saturable accumulation of human PS1 derivatives is accompanied by a compensatory decrease in accumulated murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives, this despite the persistence of murine PS1/PS2mRNA. Similarly, overexpression of human PS2 in cultured cells compromised accumulation of murine PS1-derived fragments. These effects are not unique to cultured cells since overexpression of human PS1 polypeptides in brains of transgenic mice leads to the reduced accumulation of murine PS1 (12Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S.

These observations are consistent with a model in which PS1 and PS2 molecules are stabilized and endoproteolytically processed by common, but limiting cellular factors, whereas excessively overexpressed PS polypeptides are rapidly degraded (Fig.8). In support of this view, recent studies have shown that in cultured cells, the vast majority of transiently overexpressed full-length PS polypeptides are rapidly turned over (t 1/2 ∼1 h), whereas the processed PS derivatives are long lived (t 1/2 ∼24 h) (13Kim T.-W.

For example, overexpression of chicken class IV (c-IV) β-tubulin isotype in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in limited accumulation of chicken c-IV β-tubulin polypeptides and was accompanied by a selective loss of endogenous CHO class IV (m-IV) β-tubulin isotype (34Sisodia S.S. Gay D.A. Cleveland D.W. New Biol. 1990; 2: 66-76PubMed Google Scholar). In this latter case, the authors argued that a limiting cellular pool of factors that bind selectively to either class IV β-tubulin- or class IV β-tubulin-enriched microtubules is responsible for stabilization of c-IV β-tubulin and replacement of m-IV β-tubulin isotype.With the concern that overexpression of membrane-bound or secretory proteins has a confounding affects on protein biogenesis in the ER and intracellular trafficking, we felt compelled to examine several aspects of ER metabolism in cells overexpressing PS1 and PS2 to confirm that the replacement of murine PS1/PS2 derivatives by human PS1 or PS2 is a highly specific and selective phenomenon. First, we documented that the biosynthesis of newly synthesized membrane-bound and soluble polypeptides in control cell lines and lines expressing human PS1 or PS2 was identical. Second, the steady-state levels of calnexin, an ER resident, integral membrane protein that facilitates folding and assembly of glycoproteins in the ER is identical in PS1, PS2, and control lines. Third, overexpression of PS1 or PS2 had no effect on the steady-state levels of BiP/GRP78, an ER lumenal chaperone that is normally induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Fourth, induced overexpression of APP, a type I integral membrane glycoprotein, had no effect on the accumulation of murine PS1 derivatives. Finally, expression of COOH-terminally truncated human PS1 polypeptides had no effect on the levels of endogenous murine PS1 derivatives, indicating that murine PS1 gene expression is unaffected by the presence of high levels of truncated human PS1transcripts and polypeptides. Thus, we conclude that compromised accumulation of murine PS1 and PS2 derivatives resulting from overexpression of human PS1 or PS2 is a highly selective effect.In a variety of experimental settings it has become increasingly evident that the processed PS1/PS2 derivatives accumulate to saturable levels independent of the levels of full-length PS1/PS2 polypeptides (7Duff K.

These observations have suggested that the cellular factor(s) involved in endoproteolysis or stabilization of PS1 derivatives may be limiting. Although little information is available regarding the molecular identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for PS1/PS2 endoproteolysis and factors responsible for fragment stability, we consider it unlikely that the regulated accumulation of PS fragments is dependent on competition for protease(s) responsible for cleavage. In support of this view, we demonstrate that expression of COOH-terminally truncated human PS1 polypeptides (PS1361Δ and PS1403Δ), which contain the proteolytic cleavage site but fail to be cleaved, do not influence accumulation of endogenous murine PS1 fragments.

Leimer U. Zweekbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly likely that the functional rescue by the PS1ΔE9 variant is a reflection of its stabilization by successful interaction with limiting cellular factor(s) or targeting to cellular compartments that are normally occupied by endoproteolytic derivatives of PS (33Ratovitski T.

However, a major endoproteolytic site between amino acids 298 and 299 has been reported (21Podlisny M.B. Citron M. Amarante P. Sherrington R. Xia W. Zhang J. Diehl T. Levesque G. Fraser P. Haass C.

With this information, it will be important to generate end-specific antibodies to the NH2 terminus of the CTF or the extreme COOH terminus of the NTF to discriminate full-length PS1 from its cleaved derivatives. These reagents will be enormously useful for biochemical, cell biological, and morphological studies of PS1 metabolism and trafficking. Moreover, characterization of the protein(s) involved in targeting PS to the cleavage pathway and identification of the enzyme(s) responsible for the endoproteolysis of PS will facilitate future efforts aimed at clarifying the limiting step(s) that regulate the accumulated levels of processed PS1/PS2 derivatives.

https://openalex.org/W2084517844,"A central issue in cognitive neuroscience concerns the functional architecture of the prefrontal cortex and the degree to which it is organized by sensory domain. To examine this issue, multiple areas of the macaque monkey prefrontal cortex were mapped for selective responses to visual stimuli that are prototypical of the brain's object vision pathway—pictorial representations of faces. Prefrontal neurons not only selectively process information related to the identity of faces but, importantly, such neurons are localized to a remarkably restricted area. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex is functionally compartmentalized with respect to the nature of its inputs."

The role of MAPK cascades and of NF-κB activation in the early intracellular signal transduction involved in iNOS transcription in TNF-α/IL-1α-stimulated astrocytes was investigated.

The present study investigates the role of p38MAPK in the regulation of iNOS expression. The results show that a p38MAPK-dependent pathway transduces iNOS expression signals elicited by combined TNF-α and IL-1α stimulation in mouse primary astrocytes. p38MAPK activation is necessary but not sufficient, since stimulation by TNF-α or IL-1α alone fully activated p38MAPK but was unable to induce iNOS transcription. The p38MAPK-mediated signal acts indirectly, since iNOS gene transcription is blocked by protein synthesis inhibition.

Astrocytes grown to confluence in 75-cm2 flasks were treated for various times with cytokines or other reagents, and total cell RNA was isolated as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar). 10-μg samples of total RNA were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and fixed by UV exposure. The filters were prehybridized in hybridization mix (1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS) for 1 h and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in hybridization mix containing DNA probes produced by polymerase chain reaction and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Polymerase chain reaction primers to prepare DNA probes were 5′-TGCCAGGGTCACAACTTTACAGG (forward iNOS primer), 5′-GGTCGATGTCACATGCAGCTTGTC (reverse iNOS primer), 5′-TGCTGTTCACAGTTGCCGGC (forward MCP-1 primer), and 5′-CGGGTCAACTTCACATTCAAAG (reverse MCP-1 primer). The human GAPDH probe was purchased from CLONTECH. Filter membranes were washed twice for 10 min at low stringency (5% SDS, 40 mmsodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 65 °C) and twice for 20 min at high stringency (1% SDS, 40 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 65 °C) and subjected to autoradiography. Cells cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 14 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaF). After incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were recovered. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA colorimetric assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of cell lysates containing 20 μg of total protein in Laemmli buffer were separated by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The filter blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline; 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with specific antibody for 2 h and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at ambient temperature. Specific bands were revealed using the ECL system. Rainbow markers, range 14.3–220 kDa (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK), were used as molecular mass standards. Cell lysates samples equivalent to 50 μg of total protein were precleared three times for 20 min at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and incubated with 1 μg of anti-p38MAPK, anti-p42/44MAPK, and anti-p54JNK antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 13 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min. The beads were washed with lysis buffer (2 times) and 10 mmHepes and 10 mm magnesium acetate (2 times). Complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3VO4) containing 5 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-ATF-2, GST-c-Jun, or MBP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of loading buffer, and samples were boiled and separated by 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried, and incorporated 33P was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Astrocytes were seeded in 24-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and stimulated with cytokines, and culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points. The accumulation of NO2−, a stable end product of NO formation, was used as a relative measurement of NO production. 100 μl of supernatant were incubated with 100 μl of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilic acid, 0.1% naphtylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 2.5% phosphoric acid) for 10 min at room temperature, and the optical absorbance was monitored at 570 nm with a microtiter plate reader, using sodium nitrite as a standard. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (42Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Untreated or cytokine-treated astrocytes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, 500 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm DTT) were added, and cells were allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 6,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were discarded, and the volume of the nuclear pellet was estimated. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in 3 volumes of high salt buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm EDTA, pH 7.5, 1 mmPMSF, 10 mm DTT), vortexed vigorously for 10 s, and incubated on ice for 1 h with intermittent mixing. Samples were centrifuged at 6,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and 3 volumes of low salt buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm DTT) were added to the supernatants representing the nuclear extracts. The protein content was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C until use. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 6 μg of nuclear extracts with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 30 μg of bovine serum albumin in 10 μl of binding buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with two tandem κB elements from the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) was used as a probe to detect specific NF-κB binding activity. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase; 60,000 cpm of 32P-labeled probe were added to the nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were electrophoresed using native 4% polyacrylamide gels. The expression of iNOS protein in cytokine-stimulated mouse astrocyte cultures was first examined in cytoplasmic extracts by immunoblotting using a specific polyclonal anti-iNOS antibody. Fig.1 A shows the time dependence of iNOS expression in astrocyte stimulated by combined TNF-α/IL-1α treatment. iNOS protein was first detected at a very low level after 9 h, and high levels were reached after 24 and 48 h. To correlate the time dependence of iNOS expression and NO production, astrocyte cultures were treated with TNF-α/IL-1α, the cell culture supernatants were harvested, and nitrite concentrations were determined by a colorimetric assay. An accumulation of nitrites in the supernatants consistent with the observed iNOS protein expression time profile was found (Fig. 1 B). To investigate whether a p38MAPK-dependent pathway mediates the TNF-α/IL-1α-stimulated iNOS induction, a specific inhibitor, FHPI, was used to block p38MAPKactivity (30Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 C, preincubation of astrocytes with 10 μm FHPI reduced the TNF-α/IL-1α-induced iNOS protein expression to nondetectable levels at the 24-h time point. As a consequence, the stimulated NO release determined from the nitrite concentrations in the culture supernatants after 48 h was decreased by more than 80% to background levels (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, iNOS expression 24 h after TNF-α/IL-1α stimulation was only partially affected by the pretreatment with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the MEK1-dependent pathway (Fig. 1 C). As a consequence, the NO release 48 h after TNF-α/IL-1α stimulation was merely reduced by 15% in the presence of 20 μm of PD98059, a treatment that fully inactivates the MEK1 pathway (43Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar). The FHPI dose dependence of the inhibition of iNOS expression was determined in astrocytes that had been preincubated for 45 min with various concentrations of p38MAPK inhibitor before TNF-α/IL-1α stimulation (Fig. 2,A and B). iNOS expression was inhibited in a regular dose dependence, with a half-inhibitory concentration, IC50, of about 0.5 μm, congruent with the IC50 of FHPI determined in assays using recombinant p38MAPK (data not shown). The NO production in astrocyte cultures in the presence of increasing concentrations of FHPI agreed well with the iNOS protein expression (Fig. 2 B). The inhibition of NO release by PD98059 treatment saturated at about 40 μm at a level of about 10% inhibition. The expression of iNOS had been previously shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level (16Dı́az-Guerra M.J.M. Velasco M. Martı́n-Sanz P. Boscá L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30114-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but the dependence on p38MAPK activation and the presence of AUUUA motifs in the 3′-untranslated region sequence of the iNOS mRNA suggested that a regulation at the translational level might also occur. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of iNOS gene expression by the p38MAPK pathway, iNOS mRNA levels were studied by Northern blot analysis in TNF-α/IL-1α-stimulated astrocytes in the presence or the absence of p38MAPK inhibitor. Combined TNF-α and IL-1α treatment resulted in a transient increase of the 4.4-kilobase pair iNOS transcript (Fig. 3 A). The transcript was first detected at 3 h, reached a maximum at 6 h, and had substantially declined after 24 h. Pretreatment of the cells with 10 μm FHPI resulted in a 3–4-fold reduction in iNOS transcript level after 6 h, and only faint bands were detected at the 3-, 12-, and 24-h time points. The fact that residual iNOS mRNA levels are detected agrees well with incomplete inhibition of iNOS protein expression in the presence of 10 μm FHPI, the lowest inhibitor concentration causing a substantial reduction in iNOS protein expression (Fig. 2 A). These findings support a dominant transcriptional control of iNOS by p38MAPK. To test for a selective activity of FHPI on p38MAPK-mediated iNOS regulation, the Northern blots were reprobed for another inducible gene, the MCP-1 gene. The induction of TNF-α/IL-1α-stimulated MCP-1 transcription was found independent of FHPI treatment of the cells and therefore must be controlled by signal pathways independent of p38MAPK activity (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, the production of MCP-1 protein by the astrocytes was inhibited by FHPI treatment in a dose-dependent fashion, with an IC50 of 0.5 μm, despite the fact that the MCP-1 mRNA levels were unaffected, suggesting that p38MAPK exerts control of MCP-1 release at a post-transcriptional level (data not shown). Dose response studies conducted in FHPI-treated cells 6 h after TNF-α/IL-1α stimulation showed that the inhibition of iNOS transcription (Fig.3 B) correlated well with the IC50 value determined in the immunoblot and NO release studies (Fig.2 B), consistent with inhibition of iNOS expression at the transcriptional level. To investigate whether the induction of iNOS mRNA transcription by TNF-α/IL-1α treatment depended on new protein synthesis, the astrocytes were cultured in the presence of cycloheximide (1 or 10 μg/ml) added 1 h before the start of the cytokine treatment. The cells were harvested after 6 h of cytokine stimulation, at a time when in control cultures iNOS transcription was maximal. Cycloheximide at 1 and 10 μg/ml fully prevented induction of iNOS transcription as detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig.4), whereas transcription of MCP-1 and GAPDH was not affected by the cycloheximide treatment. To dissect the role of the TNF-α and IL-1α in the iNOS expression, astrocyte cultures were stimulated with TNF-α, IL-1α, or combined TNF-α/IL-1α for 24 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and PVDF membrane filter blots were probed for iNOS protein by immunoblotting. iNOS expression was observed after combined TNF-α/IL-1α treatment but not after treatment with TNF-α or IL-1α or after osmotic shock by sorbitol used as control (Fig.5 A). Northern analysis showed that the astrocytes responded to TNF-α and to IL-1α stimulation with induced transcription of the MCP-1 gene, but iNOS transcription required the combined activity of both cytokines (Fig. 5 B). As a consequence, combined TNF-α/IL-1α stimulation is required for accumulating NO release after 48 h (Fig. 5 C); preliminary studies had shown that the differences amon"

Because most of the enzymes involved in the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins contain active site sulfhydryls that might be covalently modified (thiolated) upon enhancement of GSSG levels (glutathiolation), it appeared plausible that glutathiolation might alter ubiquitinylation rates upon cellular oxidative stress. This hypothesis was explored using intact retina and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell models. Exposure of intact bovine retina and RPE cells to H2O2 (0.1–1.7 μmol/mg) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the GSSG:GSH ratio and coincident dose-dependent reductions in the levels of endogenous ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)-ubiquitin thiol esters and endogenous protein-ubiquitin conjugates and in the ability to formde novo retinal protein-125I-labeled ubiquitin conjugates. Oxidant-induced decrements in ubiquitin conjugates were associated with 60–80% reductions in E1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) activities as measured by formation of ubiquitin thiol esters. When GSH levels in RPE cells recovered to preoxidation levels following H2O2 removal, endogenous E1 activity and protein-ubiquitin conjugates were restored. Evidence that S thiolation of E1 and E2 enzymes is the biochemical link between cellular redox state and E1/E2 activities includes: (i) 5-fold increases in levels of immunoprecipitable, dithiothreitol-labile35S-E1 adducts in metabolically labeled, H2O2-treated, RPE cells; (ii) diminished formation of E1- and E2-125I-labeled ubiquitin thiol esters, oligomerization of E225K, and coincident reductions in protein-125I-labeled ubiquitin conjugates in supernatants from nonstressed retinas upon addition of levels of GSSG equivalent to levels measured in oxidatively stressed retinas; and (iii) partial restoration of E1 and E2 activities and levels of protein-125I-labeled ubiquitin conjugates in supernatants from H2O2-treated retinas when GSSG:GSH ratios were restored to preoxidation levels by the addition of physiological levels of GSH. These data suggest that the cellular redox status modulates protein ubiquitinylation via reversible S thiolation of E1 and E2 enzymes, presumably by glutathione.

Thus, elucidation of biochemical mechanisms that protect cells from or promote cellular recovery following oxidative stress are of vital importance. Studies suggest that ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-residue protein, is essential for viability following stress (6Cheng L. Watt R. Piper P.W. Mol. Gen.

The principle mechanism of ubiquitin action is through its covalent ligation to other proteins via a series of reactions catalyzed by thiol enzymes (11Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the initial reaction, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier enzyme; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; E-64, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MDA, malondialdehyde; RPE, retinal pigment epithelial; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin via the formation of a high energy thiol ester bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and a specific cysteine in the active site of E1 enzyme (12Haas A.L.

Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine in the active site of one of many ubiquitin carrier proteins, the E2 enzymes (14Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also by means of a thiol ester linkage. Some E2 enzymes catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate proteins directly, whereas other E2 enzymes require the help of ubiquitin protein isopeptide ligases (E3 enzymes) (16Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ligation of each ubiquitin to a protein (ubiquitinylation) results in an increase of 8.5 kDa in the apparent mass of the protein. Multiple ubiquitins may be attached to a substrate protein, yielding a high molecular mass protein-ubiquitin conjugate. The ubiquitinylated protein may be degraded by the 26 S protease, an ATP-dependent multicatalytic protease, or alternatively, the protein-ubiquitin conjugate can be disassembled by ubiquitin-specific hydrolases and isopeptidases (11Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinylation is involved in many critical biological processes. Among the best described is ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, which regulates levels of key regulatory proteins and cell effectors (11Wilkinson K.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, cellular protection is afforded by selective ubiquitin-dependent degradation of damaged or otherwise aberrant proteins, which may be cytotoxic (17Huang L.L. Shang F. Nowell Jr., T.R. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Taylor A. Davies K.J.A. Free Radical Biol.

Several studies have demonstrated that oxidation can alter rates of protein ubiquitinylation and/or ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. These oxidation-related effects were rationalized as being due to altered substrate conformation (17Huang L.L. Shang F. Nowell Jr., T.R. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 1995; 61: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Dunten R.L. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chin D.T. Kuehl L.

Genet. 1994; 243: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently we proposed that E1 and E2 activities may be regulated by the cellular redox state (9Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Such regulation is likely to involve sulfhydryl groups given that: (i) E1 and E2 enzymes contain active site sulfhydryl residues that must be maintained in the reduced state for E1 and E2 activities (12Haas A.L. Warms J.V.B. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pickart C.M. Rose I.A. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1994; 310: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Coincident reductions in GSH and ubiquitin conjugating activity in oxidatively stressed cells (9Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) are consistent with direct inhibition of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme activities by S thiolation. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical mechanism regulating ubiquitin conjugating activity following oxidative stress. Using both cultured cells as well as intact tissue, we demonstrate that: (i) immediately following exposure to oxidant insult (H2O2), reduced levels of endogenous andde novo-formed protein-ubiquitin conjugates were due to decreased ability to form E1- and E2-ubiquitin thiol esters; (ii) cellular capacities to form E1- and E2-ubiquitin thiol esters were inversely correlated with the cellular ratio of GSSG:GSH; (iii) E1 was S-thiolated following exposure to H2O2 in vivo; (iv) S thiolation of E1 and E225K inhibited formation of their respective ubiquitin thiol esters in cell-free assays; and (v) E1- and E2-ubiquitin thiol ester formation was restored following removal of the oxidant and/or subsequent re-establishment of the GSSG:GSH ratio. These data indicate that ubiquitin conjugating activity is subject to redox regulation through reactive sulfhydryls and suggest that levels of ubiquitinylated proteins are regulated by glutathiolation in response to oxidative stress. Materials for protein electrophoresis and nitrocellulose (0.2 μm) were from Bio-Rad laboratories. Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. The inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Na125I,125I-labeled protein A andl-[35S]cystine were from NEN Life Science Products. The ECL chemiluminescence kit was from Amersham Life Sciences. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma and were the highest grade available. Ubiquitin was iodinated by reaction with chloramine T as described (31Jahngen J.H. Haas A.L. Ciechanover A. Blondin J. Eisenhauer D. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13760-13767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum to SDS-denatured ubiquitin conjugated to γ-globulin and preimmune serum were obtained as described (31Jahngen J.H. Haas A.L. Ciechanover A. Blondin J. Eisenhauer D. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13760-13767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting with antiserum preadsorbed with heat- and SDS-denatured ubiquitin indicate that the antiserum is specific for ubiquitin and recognizes both the free and conjugated forms at a ratio of approximately 1:8. 2M. S. Obin and X. Gong, unpublished data. Rabbit antiserum recognizing both E1A (≈117 kDa) and E1B (≈110 kDa) was raised against a synthetic peptide comprised of methionine 41 to alanine 66 (32Handley P.M. Mueckler M. Siegel N.R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The antiserum recognizes native E1A and E1B and the ubiquitin thiol esters of each but appears to preferentially recognize the E1A isoform under denaturing conditions. IgG (purified with protein A) was used to immunoprecipitate E1. A second rabbit antiserum that recognizes only E1A and its ubiquitin thiol ester was raised against a synthetic peptide comprising methionine 1 to cysteine 26. Purified IgG was used to identify and quantitate E1A and E1A-ubiquitin thiol ester on immunoblots. Human SV40-immortalized RPE cells (repository number AG06095, Coriell Institute, Camden, NJ) were grown in minimal essential medium as described (33Obin M. Nowell T. Taylor A. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except that vitamins and essential amino acids were provided only at 1X. For experiments, subconfluent cultures that had been fed 16–24 h previously were washed once gently with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated (37 °C) for various times in PBS (sham treatment) or with PBS containing 0.1–1.0 μmol H2O2/mg cells (0.1–1.0 mm H2O2). The PBS was then aspirated, and the cells were immediately scraped into either (i) 200 μl of 10% perchloric acid for quantitation of GSH and GSSG (see below) or (ii) 200 μl of lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 8.7m urea, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), 1 mm AEBSF, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mmtrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), 25 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 7.8) followed by incubation on wet ice for 15 min, sonication for 1 s, and centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Fresh, light-adapted bovine eyes were obtained on ice from a local slaughterhouse. The cornea, lens, and humors were removed, and the remaining eye cup with retina attached was incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red and with 0.15–1.4 μmol H2O2/mg retina wet weight (10–100 mm H2O2 as described in Refs. 9Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,34Siezen R.J. Coppin C.M. Kaplan E.D. Dwyer D. Thomson J.A. Exp.

H2O2 concentration in the medium was determined spectrophotometrically (36Spector A. Wang G.-M. Wang R.-R. Garner W.H. Moll H. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Retinas were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then the medium was removed, and the retinas were rinsed with PBS. The concentration of H2O2 decreased approximately 50 and 75% within 15 and 30 min, respectively. Following washes, the retinas were rubbed gently toward the optic nerve, and either the entire retina or approximately 200-mg pieces were immediately stored at −80 °C. The mildness of the retina oxidation was corroborated by our inability to detect increases in protein acidification and fragmentation or increased lipid peroxidation (measured as malondialdehyde, MDA) (37Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23298) Google Scholar) in the control or H2O2-treated retinas (0.15 nmol MDA/mg protein in control and oxidatively stressed). In contrast, oxidation with ascorbate/Fe2+/H2O2did increase MDA values in supernatants from sham-treated retinas (1.24 nmol MDA/mg protein). GSH and GSSG were measured by HPLC (38Mune M. Meydani M. Jahngen-Hodge J. Martin A. Smith D. Palmer V. Blumberg J.B. Taylor A. Age. 1995; 18: 43-49Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or by spectrophotometry (39Sedlak J. Lindsay R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (6592) Google Scholar) using approximately 700 mg of frozen retinal tissue or 5 mg of RPE cells. Both procedures yielded similar results. Retina or RPE protein levels were determined using the Protein Assay Kit from Sigma, following neutralization and resolubilization of acid-precipitated protein pellets. Retina pieces were homogenized in TEDI buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 5 mmiodoacetate, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μmE-64, 0.2 mm AEBSF, 10 μm pepstatin, and 8.7m urea, pH 7.6) and then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use. Retina and RPE supernatants (10–25 mg/ml) were denatured by boiling in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.7% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 13% glycerol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose using conditions that optimize the transfer and retention of either conjugated or free ubiquitin (41Obin M.S. Jahngen-Hodge J. Nowell T. Taylor A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14473-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). No immunoreactivity was detected when blots were probed with equivalent amounts (μg of IgG) of preimmune serum. For analysis of endogenous E1- and E225K-ubiquitin thiol esters, RPE or retina supernatant was solubilized in thiol ester gel buffer (33 mm Tris-HCl, 2.7 m urea, 2.5% SDS, 13% glycerol, pH 6.8 (42Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), electrophoresed on 6 (E1 analyses) or 15% (E225K analyses) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose at 4 °C using a Bio-Rad Mini Trans Blot Apparatus (100 V, 45 min for E1; 60 V, 40 min for E225K). E1 and E1-ubiquitin thiol esters were detected with anti-E1 serum (see above) using ECL visualization. E225K-ubiquitin thiol esters were detected using affinity purified rabbit IgG raised against recombinant bovine E225K(a generous gift of Dr. Cecile Pickart). Frozen retina pieces were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, on ice and centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Aliquots (20 mg/ml) were stored at −80 °C until use. Final concentrations of conjugation assay components in a 25-μl assay were 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 15 milliunits/ml creatine phosphokinase, 15 milliunits/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 10 μm E-64, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, approximately 1–3 μg of 125I-labeled ubiquitin (2 to 10 × 105 cpm), and 120 μg of retinal supernatant. Assays were at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends and were terminated by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 2 min. Following SDS-PAGE, stained gels and resulting autoradiograms were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA). Assay conditions were as described above for conjugation assays, except that termination was with thiol ester assay gel buffer. Functional E1 and E2 enzymes were detected on autoradiograms of SDS gels by comparing proteins electrophoresed in the presence or the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. The ability of GSSG and GSH to modify rates of formation of E1- and E2-thiol esters and protein-ubiquitin conjugates was determined (i) by preincubating supernatants of sham-treated retinas for 20 min (37 °C) with various amounts of GSSG such that the GSSG:GSH ratio measured in H2O2-treated retinas was obtained and (ii) by preincubating supernatants from H2O2-treated retinas for 20 min (37 °C) with GSH such that the GSSG:GSH ratio found in sham-treated retinas was obtained. Reactions were then initiated by addition of the assay mixture containing125I-labeled ubiquitin and incubated for 5 min. RPE cells were washed and refed with 4 ml of medium containing 5 μg/ml cycloheximide but lacking serum, methionine, and cysteine. This concentration of cycloheximide inhibited 90% of protein synthesis, as determined by scintillation counting of acid-precipitated, dithiothreitol (DTT)-washed RPE protein. After 30 min, cultures were supplemented with l-[35S]cystine (585 μCi/mmol) at a final concentration of 50 μmol/ml and incubated for an additional 5 h. RPE cultures were then exposed to 0.1 or 0.2 μmol H2O2/mg cells or to “sham” treatment for 90 s, followed by washing with warm PBS, cell harvesting, and preparation of cell supernatants (as described under “Exposure of RPE Cells and Intact Retina Tissue to H2O2”). Nonidet P-40 and NEM concentrations were reduced to 0.5% and 10 mm, respectively, by addition of an equal volume (0.5 ml) of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. E1 was then immunoprecipitated from 1.3 mg of RPE supernatant by incubation with 180 μg of purified anti-E1 IgG (3 h, 4 °C, with rocking) followed by incubation (60 min, 4 °C) with prewashed protein A beads (60 μl of a 50% slurry) and centrifugation (13,000 × g, 1 min). The immunocomplex was washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and then E1 was separated from the beads by boiling in thiol ester gel buffer followed by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 1 min). The supernatants were each divided into two equal aliquots (20 μl), and DTT (final concentration, 20 mm) was added to one aliquot. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, each aliquot was subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 35S label into DTT-reducible E1 adducts was visualized by autoradiography of dried gels following exposure of the gels to En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products). Immunoprecipitated E1 was quantitated on immunoblots using a standard curve of purified rabbit E1 (a generous gift of Dr. M. Rechsteiner) and anti-E1 IgG. Total 35S incorporated into protein-associated thiols was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of RPE protein, resolubilization of the ether-washed pellet in 20 mm DTT (37 °C, 1 h), reprecipitation of protein with trichloroacetic acid, and scintillation counting of 35S in the supernatant. Nonradiolabeled ubiquitin (final concentration, 80–200 ng/μl) was added to control retinal supernatant (25–35 mg/ml protein), and 20-μl aliquots were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 20 nmol GSSG/mg protein (final concentration, 0.1 mm) or for 5 min with 1 mm NEM (final concentration). NEM was delivered to the protein mixture in pentane, triturated, and the pentane evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. ATP buffers for the thiol ester assay were then added to each tube, mixed, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated with thiol ester gel buffer and subject to SDS-PAGE and electroblotting. ATP levels were measured in retina supernatant using the Bioluminescent Somatic Cell Assay kit from Sigma. Isoelectric focusing gels were as modified by Semple-Rowland et al. (43Semple-Rowland S.L. Adamus G. Cohen R.J. Ulshafer R.J. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance (Systat, Evanston, IL) was used to determine significant differences between treatments. Recently we demonstrated that ubiquitin conjugation decreased in mammalian lens cells that were exposed to oxidative stress (9Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We also showed that when cells and tissues were allowed to recover from oxidative stress (H2O2), ubiquitinylation recovered to or exceeded preoxidation levels (9Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 44Shang F. Gong X. Palmer H.J. Nowell Jr., T.R. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E1 and E2) contain essential active site sulfhydryls. It therefore seemed logical to propose that oxidant-induced increases in the cellular GSSG:GSH ratio would result in the formation of E1-SSG and E2-SSG adducts (glutathiolation, Reaction 1) and that such transient glutathiolation could account for oxidatively induced decreases in E1 and E2 activities. GSSG+E­SH(active)→E­S­SG(inactive)+GSH Reaction1The mammalian retina affords a good model for the study of redox effects on ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, because the retina has a highly active ubiquitin system (33Obin M.

Yamamoto T. Nagano T. Hirano T. Retina. 1992; 12: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A sensitive index of H2O2-induced effects on the cellular redox state is the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH) (23Lii C.-K. Chai Y.-C. Zhao W. Thomas J.A. Hendrich S. Arch. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2081617200,"Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) has been shown previously to interact with α1-syntrophin in the dystrophin complex of skeletal muscle. In the present study, we have examined whether nNOS also interacts with caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle. nNOS and caveolin-3 are coimmunoprecipitated from rat skeletal muscle homogenates by antibodies directed against either of the two proteins. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the membrane-proximal caveolin-3 residues 65–84 and 109–130 and homologous caveolin-1 residues 82–101 and 135–156 potently inhibit the catalytic activity of purified, recombinant nNOS. Purified nNOS also binds to a glutathione S-transferase-caveolin-1 fusion protein inin vitro binding assays. In vitro binding is completely abolished by preincubation of nNOS with either of the two caveolin-3 inhibitory peptides. Interactions between nNOS and caveolin-3, therefore, appear to be direct and to involve two distinct caveolin scaffolding/inhibitory domains. Other caveolin-interacting enzymes, including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and the c-Src tyrosine kinase, are also potently inhibited by each of the four caveolin peptides. Inhibitory interactions mediated by two different caveolin domains may thus be a general feature of enzyme docking to caveolin proteins in plasmalemmal caveolae.

Nitric oxide has been identified as an important and highly versatile signaling molecule in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Endogenous NO in these systems is produced by one of three isoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) 1The abbreviations used are: NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; iNOS, inducible NOS; eNOS, endothelial NOS; CaM, calmodulin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. termed neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS). nNOS is so termed because it was first localized in neurons (1Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). The nNOS isoform, however, is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle (2Nakane M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Pollock J.S. Förstermann U. Murad F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 3Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions of nNOS function both to regulate enzyme activity and to target the protein to specific subcellular locations. nNOS is activated by interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by interaction with a 10-kDa protein designated PIN (5Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The nNOS protein is targeted to neuronal postsynaptic densities by interaction with the postsynaptic density proteins PSD-95 and PSD-93 (6Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E.

Interactions with PIN, PSD-95, PSD-93, and α1-syntrophin are mediated by a 230-amino acid N-terminal extension of the enzyme that contains a PDZ domain. This domain is not found in either eNOS or iNOS (9Bredt D.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 211: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). eNOS activity and subcellular localization is also modulated by protein-protein interactions. eNOS is localized in plasmalemmal caveolae of endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes through association with the caveolae integral-membrane structural proteins, caveolins-1 and -3, respectively (10Feron O.

Therefore, in the present study, we have examined whether skeletal muscle nNOS, in addition to interacting with α1-syntrophin, also interacts with caveolin-3.

Three units of purified, human recombinant c-Src was incubated with various concentrations of caveolin peptides in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiling of samples for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels) followed by autoradiography. Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II activity was assayed using a CaM-dependent protein kinase II assay kit to phosphorylate Auto CaM II with [γ-32P]ATP. 100 ng of purified enzyme was used to phosphorylate the Auto CaM II substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of the same final concentration of Ca2+/CaM as used in the nNOS activity assays. To determine the stoichiometry of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II autophosphorylation under these assay conditions, the32P-labeled kinase protein was separated from [32P]ATP on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The number of moles of phosphate incorporated into the enzyme in vitro was then calculated based on the based on the amount of 32P present in the excised protein band and the known specific radioactivity of the [γ-32P]ATP used, as described previously (19Venema R.C.

Purified human nNOS (1 μg) was incubated with or without synthetic peptides (100 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer for 5 min at 37 °C and then subjected to CaM-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (12Ju H.

Bound nNOS was eluted from the column with 2 mmEGTA and quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-nNOS antibody as described previously (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol.

In vitro binding assays of baculovirus-expressed, purified human nNOS and a full-length bovine GST-caveolin-1 fusion protein were carried out under the same conditions described previously for eNOS binding to GST-caveolin-1 fusion proteins (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Rat quadriceps muscle homogenates were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-nNOS or an anti-caveolin-3 antibody. Anti-nNOS immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-caveolin-3. Anti-caveolin-3 immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-nNOS. As shown in Fig.1, caveolin-3 (20 kDa) was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-nNOS antibody and nNOS (160 kDa) was specifically coimmunoprecipitated by the anti-caveolin-3 antibody. A different anti-caveolin antibody that recognizes both caveolins-1 and -3 also coprecipitated nNOS. However, a caveolin-1-specific antibody (clone 2297) did not react with the caveolin protein precipitated by the anti-caveolin-3 antibody. Caveolin-3 is structurally and functionally similar to caveolin-1, a 178-residue protein containing three distinct domains: a 101-residue N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 44-residue C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and a 33-residue membrane-spanning domain (21Dupree P.

We have shown previously that interaction of eNOS with either cytoplasmic domain of caveolin-1 significantly inhibits eNOS catalytic activity. The eNOS-inhibitory region of the caveolin-1 N-terminal cytoplasmic domain is identified as a membrane-proximal region containing residues 82–101 (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). This 82–101 region has also been shown to inhibit the catalytic activities of Gα subunits, Ha-Ras, and Src family tyrosine kinases (24Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H.

It has been proposed, therefore, that this 20-amino acid sequence of caveolin-1 represents the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain. Other regions of caveolin-1 have not been suspected of participating in caveolin-1 protein-protein interactions (24Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I.

In the present study, however, we have identified a second membrane-proximal caveolin scaffolding/inhibitory domain that exists in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of both caveolins-1 and -3. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of caveolin-1 is comprised of residues 135–178. We therefore prepared synthetic peptides corresponding to bovine caveolin-1 residues 135–156 and 157–178 (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Peptides were tested for their abilities to inhibit recombinant bovine eNOS expressed and purified from a baculovirus system (16Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Arnal J.-F. Harrison D.G. J. Biol.

Enzyme activity was determined by arginine-to-citrulline conversion assay in the presence of excess cofactors and in the absence or the presence of varying concentrations of the peptides. The 135–156 caveolin-1 peptide inhibited eNOS with a potency similar to that previously reported for inhibition of eNOS by the 82–101 peptide (IC50 = 1.0 μm). In contrast, the 157–178 peptide had no effect on activity. The effects of caveolin-1 peptides on the activity of human recombinant nNOS expressed and purified from a baculovirus system (16Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) were also determined. The 82–101 peptide inhibited activity of purified nNOS (Fig. 2 A) with a potency (IC50 = 1.2 μm) similar to that reported previously for inhibition of eNOS (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), suggesting that nNOS, like eNOS, can interact directly with caveolin proteins. The caveolin-1 peptide corresponding to residues 135–156 was also effective in inhibiting nNOS (IC50 = 0.9 μm) (Fig.2 B). In contrast, peptides corresponding to caveolin-1 residues 61–81 and 157–178 had no effect on nNOS activity. Bovine caveolin-1 residues 82–101 and 135–156 (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) are equivalent to rat caveolin-3 residues 65–84 and 109–130, respectively (14Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The primary structures of caveolin-1 residues 82–101 and corresponding caveolin-3 residues 65–84 contain conservative substitutions at six positions. Caveolin-1 residues 135–156 and corresponding caveolin-3 residues 109–130 contain conservative substitutions at seven positions. To determine whether these amino acid substitutions significantly alter the inhibitory potency of the two caveolin scaffolding domains, we prepared synthetic peptides corresponding to rat caveolin-3 residues 65–84 and 109–130 and determined the effects of the peptides on nNOS activity. As shown in Fig. 2 (C andD), low micromolar concentrations of both caveolin-3 peptides inhibited nNOS, indicating that nNOS can interact in vitro with both inhibitory domains of both caveolin-3 and caveolin-1. The 109–130 caveolin-3 peptide was 8-fold more potent than the 65–84 peptide in inhibiting nNOS (IC50 = 0.5 μm versus IC50 = 4.0 μm), suggesting that the second caveolin-3 scaffolding domain identified in this study may contribute significantly to nNOS inhibition when nNOS and caveolin-3 interact in skeletal muscle cells. To determine whether inhibition of nNOS activity was due to binding of the caveolin-3 peptides to nNOS or to Ca2+/CaM, we tested the effects of the peptides on the activity of another Ca2+/CaM target enzyme, the Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. Concentrations of caveolin-3 peptides (10 μm) that inhibited nNOS by 100% only partially inhibited this Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. Inhibition of 56 ± 2 and 50 ± 3% were determined for the 65–84 and 109–130 peptides, respectively (mean ± S.E., n = 4). Interactions of the peptides with Ca2+/CaM may thus contribute to the peptide inhibition observed for nNOS. However, because complete inhibition was not observed, this mechanism can only account for about half of the inhibitory effects of the peptides on nNOS. The ∼50% residual CaM kinase II activity determined in these experiments cannot be explained by partial activation of the enzyme due to autophosphorylation, which yields a CaM-independent enzyme. This can be concluded from experiments in which the stoichiometry of autophosphorylation under identical assay conditions was quantitated and found to be <0.001 mol phosphate incorporated/mol of enzyme in the presence or the absence of the caveolin peptides (n = 3). Moreover, the peptides could also inhibit Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II by direct interaction with the enzyme rather than with Ca2+/CaM. This interpretation is supported by the results of our previous study in which we reported that Ca2+/CaM does not bind to a GST-caveolin-1 fusion protein in in vitro binding assays (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Dose-response relationships for caveolin-3 peptide inhibition of eNOS were very similar to those shown for nNOS in Fig. 2 (C andD) (IC50 values of 0.8 and 5.4 μmfor the 65–84 and 109–130 peptides, respectively). Similar IC50 values of the four peptides for nNOS and eNOS suggest that both NOS enzymes contain the structural features necessary for direct interaction with caveolin proteins. These data suggest further that eNOS interactions with caveolin-3, known to occur in cardiac myocytes (10Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), are likely to have similar functional consequences to those of eNOS with caveolin-1 in endothelial cells. Additionally, in cells where eNOS and nNOS are coexpressed (i.e. neurons in the hippocampus) (27Dinerman J.L. Dawson T.M. Schell M.J. Snowman A. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), it is not likely that caveolin proteins will preferentially bind one of the two NOS isoforms and not the other. To demonstrate unequivocally the capacity of nNOS to interact directly with caveolin proteins, we performed in vitro binding assays with purified human nNOS and a full-length bovine caveolin-1-GST fusion protein (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The GST-caveolin-1 fusion protein (GST-cav 1–178) and a GST-nonfusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose. The GST-caveolin-1 fusion or GST alone prebound to beads were then used inin vitro binding assays with recombinant nNOS expressed and purified from a baculovirus system (16Venema R.C. Sayegh H.S. Kent J.D. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6435-6440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Venema R.C. Ju H. Zou R. Ryan J.W. Venema V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1276-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Purified nNOS was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with or without the caveolin-3 65–84 and 109–130 peptides (100 μm). As a negative control nNOS was also preincubated with the caveolin-1 61–81 peptide. Following preincubation, nNOS was incubated overnight a 4 °C with GST-caveolin-1 or GST prebound to beads. Beads were washed extensively (six consecutive washes), and bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-nNOS antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, nNOS bound specifically to the GST-caveolin-1 fusion protein but not to GST alone, demonstrating that nNOS can interact directly with caveolin proteins. Furthermore, binding was completely blocked by preincubation of nNOS with the caveolin-3 65–84 and 109–130 peptides. The 61–81 caveolin-1 peptide, however, had no effect on binding. We have shown previously that the mechanism by which the caveolin-1 82–101 peptide reversibly inhibits eNOS activity is through interference with the interaction of the enzyme with Ca2+/CaM (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). We now report that the caveolin-1 135–156 peptide inhibits eNOS by the same mechanism. This particular mechanism of inhibition was also observed for nNOS. Purified nNOS was preincubated in the absence or the presence of the caveolin-3 65–84 and 109–130 peptides (100 μm). The enzyme was then subjected to affinity chromatography on CaM-Sepharose. nNOS was allowed to bind to the column in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2 and was specifically eluted with 2 mmEGTA. The amount of enzyme eluted in each condition was quantitated by immunoblotting with anti-nNOS antibody. As shown in Fig.4, both of the caveolin-3 peptides completely blocked the binding of nNOS to CaM-Sepharose, demonstrating that both caveolin scaffolding/inhibitory domains inhibit nNOS by a common mechanism. The caveolin-1 82–101 and 135–156 peptides also blocked the binding of nNOS to CaM-Sepharose. Control peptides (caveolin-1 residues 61–81 and 157–178), however, had no effect on binding. The results of our previous study and of the present study demonstrate that the NOS enzymes interact with both N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of caveolin proteins. We have therefore suggested that the caveolin-NOS interaction may be fundamentally different from that of caveolin with Gα subunits, Ha-Ras, and Src tyrosine kinases (12Ju H. Zou R. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18522-18525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These particular proteins are reported to interact with (and be inhibited by) caveolin-1 exclusively through residues 82–101 in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (24Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, we have found that c-Src activity is actually more potently inhibited by the caveolin-1 135–156 peptide than by the caveolin-1 82–101 peptide. Auto-activation of c-Src occurs through auto-phosphorylation of tyrosine 416 and has been used previously to measure the effects of the 82–101 peptide in inhibition of c-Src (26Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). We have used this same approach to determine the effects of the 135–156 peptide on c-Src activity. Purified human recombinant c-Src was preincubated in the absence or the presence of varying concentrations of the 82–101 and 135–156 peptides. Autophosphorylation was then assessed by32P labeling and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.5, both peptides inhibited autophosphorylation, with the 135–156 peptide having a greater inhibitory potency than that of the 82–101 peptide. Complete inhibition required a 3 μm concentration of the 82–101 peptide versus a 1 μm concentration of the 135–156 peptide. Caveolin-3 65–84 and 109–130 peptides in the low micromolar range also completely inhibited c-Src. In summary, the results of this study demonstrate several important but previously unrecognized features of the protein-protein interactions of both nNOS and the caveolins. Notable among these is the fact that nNOS in the skeletal muscle dystrophin complex interacts not only with α1-syntrophin but also with caveolin-3. Interaction of the two proteins appears to be direct and to involve two distinct and physically separated caveolin scaffolding domains. Furthermore, interaction serves to suppress or inhibit nNOS catalytic activity. The capacity to interact with caveolin proteins is thus a general property of the Ca2+/CaM-dependent NOS enzymes and is not unique to eNOS. Two distinct caveolin scaffolding domains are also involved in caveolin inhibition of the c-Src tyrosine kinase. We propose, therefore, that caveolin proteins contain both N- and C-terminal scaffolding/inhibitory domains and suggest that these domains be referred to as scaffolding domains 1 and 2, respectively."

Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 2Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These processes are essential for nucleotide synthesis by salvage pathways in hemopoietic and other cells that lack de novo pathways and are the route of cellular uptake of many cytotoxic nucleosides used in the treatment of human neoplastic and viral diseases, including leukemias and AIDS (3Periguad C.

Chemother. 1993; 32: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Nucleoside transport processes also play an important role in adenosine-mediated regulation of coronary vasodilation, renal vasoconstriction, neurotransmission, platelet aggregation, and lipolysis (5Belardinelli L. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 6$$Google Scholar). Na+-dependent mechanisms of nucleoside transport are limited to specialized cells such as intestinal and renal epithelia, choroid plexus, liver, splenocytes, macrophages, and leukemic cells (1Cass C.E.

Na+-independent nucleoside transport processes are subdivided into two types on the basis of their sensitivities to inhibition by the nucleoside analog NBMPR (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 2Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporters bind NBMPR with high affinities (K d values 0.1–10 nm) and have the functional designation equilibrative sensitive (es), whereas NBMPR-insensitive transporters are unaffected by micromolar concentrations of NBMPR and are designatedequilibrative insensitive (ei). Transporters of the es type are widely distributed in different cell types and tissues, bind NBMPR reversibly, and can be covalently radiolabeled with [3H]NBMPR by exposure of the transporter-ligand complex to UV light (14Wu J.-S.R. Kwong F.Y.P. Jarvis S.M. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13745-13751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The es andei nucleoside transporters are under independent genetic control and are produced either singly or together in different cell types and tissues (15Cass C.E. Gaudette L.A. Paterson A.R.P.

Both have a broad substrate selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. Transporters of the estype are pharmacological targets for coronary vasodilator drugs such as dipyridamole and dilazep (5Belardinelli L. Linden J. Berne R.M. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1989; 32: 73-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 6$$Google Scholar). The prototypic es nucleoside transporter from human erythrocytes, a glycoprotein of apparent M r55,000 (22Kwong F.Y.P. Davies A. Tse C.-M. Young J.D. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 243-249PubMed Google Scholar), is related immunologically to nucleoside transporters in human placenta, pig and rabbit erythrocytes, and rat liver (23Kwong F.Y.P. Fincham H.E. Davies A.

Information derived from amino-terminal sequence analysis of the erythrocyte transporter was used to clone a cDNA from human placenta encoding a 456-residue es-type nucleoside transporter protein, hENT1 (25Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). When expressed in oocytes ofXenopus laevis, recombinant hENT1 mediated NBMPR-sensitive, Na+-independent transport of pyrimidine (uridine) and purine (adenosine) nucleosides and was inhibited by anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs, dipyridamole and dilazep (25Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). hENT1 is unrelated to other known transporter proteins, including members of the CNT/nupC gene family (25Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, there is high sequence similarity between the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of hENT1 and truncated sequences of human and mouse HNP36, two delayed-early proliferative response gene products of unknown function (26Williams J.B. Lanahan A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We report here identification of two ENT proteins from rat tissues by molecular cloning and functional expression of their cDNAs. We used RT-PCR amplification and primers based on hENT1 and HNP36 to isolate cDNAs from jejunum, liver, and lung (rENT1) and from jejunum (rENT2). rENT1 and rENT2 exhibited NBMPR-sensitive (es) and NBMPR-insensitive (ei) nucleoside transport activity, respectively, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Neither rat transporter was inhibited by dipyridamole or dilazep. rENT2 had a 2-fold lower affinity for uridine than rENT1 and was less sensitive to inhibition by cytidine. The cloning of cDNAs encoding rENT1 and rENT2 opens the way to identification of structural features within, or adjacent to, the ENT substrate site responsible for the binding of NBMPR and vasoactive drugs. The cDNA encoding rENT1 was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of total RNA extracted from mucosal scrapings of Sprague-Dawley rat jejunum (27Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using primers (A1 and A2) flanking the hENT1 open reading frame (25Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (GenBank™/EBI accession no. U81375). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed on 5 μg of RNA as template using the Superscript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) as primer. The PCR reaction (50 μl) contained 10 ng of template first strand cDNA, 5 units ofTaq/Deep Vent DNA polymerase (100:1), and 10 pmol each of primers A1 and A2. Primer A1 corresponded to hENT1 nucleotide positions 179–203 (sense, 5′-CACCATGACAACCAGTCACCAGCCT-3′); primer A2 corresponded to hENT1 nucleotide positions 2108–2127 (antisense, 5′-TGAAGGCACCTGGTTTCTGTC-3′) and was identical in sequence to nucleotides 39–59 of a 353-bp expressed sequence tag (EST) cloned from a rat PC-12 cell cDNA library (GenBank™/EBI accession no. H31422). Amplification for one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 1 min 20 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and 34 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min 20 s, and 72 °C for 2 min generated a ∼1.8-kb product that was ligated into the PCR vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the plasmid pAN2. The resulting 1766-bp rENT1 cDNA, which was sequenced in both directions by TaqDyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing using an automated Model 373A DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT), had an open reading frame encoding a 457-residue protein flanked by 4 bp of untranslated 5′-nucleotide sequence and 387 bp of untranslated 3′-sequence. The same RT-PCR procedure was used to amplify rENT1 cDNAs from rat liver and rat lung. The 5′- and 3′-ends of these cDNAs were sequenced (a total of ∼400 bp for each cDNA) and shown to be >99% identical to pAN2. The cDNA encoding rENT2 was obtained by first amplifying rENT2 partial cDNA from oligo(dT)-primed rat jejunal cDNA using primers (A3 and A4) for conserved regions of mouse/human HNP36, corresponding to human HNP36 nucleotide positions 265–286 (sense, 5′-AACAACTGGGTGACACTGCTG-3′) and 1217–1238 (antisense, 5′-TGGTGAGAGACACCAAGTAGCC-3′) (26Williams J.B. Lanahan A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (GenBank™/EBI accession no.X86681). PCR amplification as described above for rENT1, but with a shorter extension time of 1 min, generated a ∼1.0-kb product that was 84% and 99% identical in nucleotide sequence to human and mouse HNP36, respectively. This fragment, labeled with 32P (T7QuickPrime kit, Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), was used to screen a directional rat jejunal cDNA library prepared in this laboratory using the Stratagene vector Uni-ZAP™ XAR. A clone of ∼1.6 kb was obtained that contained ∼600 bp of rat HNP36 coding sequence and ∼700 bp of untranslated 3′-sequence. Two rat-specific primers A5 (antisense, 5′-TAGAAGGCATGGTACCCAAC-3′) and A6 (antisense, 5′-TCAAATCCACCTTCACCAGC-3′) were then constructed to amplify the missing 5′ portion of rat HNP36 by a nested approach. Initial amplification of the Uni-Zap™ XAR rat jejunal cDNA library by the protocol described above used A5 as the 3′ primer and a T3 oligonucleotide corresponding to a region of the Uni-Zap™ XAR insertion vector upstream of the EcoRI cloning site as the 5′ primer. A second round of amplification using the nested 3′ primer A6 yielded a ∼500-bp product that contained 157 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence, as well as the initial 5′ portion of the rat HNP36 coding sequence. A cDNA encoding full-length rat HNP36 was then amplified from oligo(dT)-primed rat jejunal cDNA using a pair of primers (A7 and A8) corresponding to nucleotide positions 157–136 bp upstream of start codon (A7 sense, 5′-TTACCCAACCTGCACCCTCTC-3′) and positions 138–150 bp downstream the stop codon (A8 antisense, 5′-TCACCATATGCAATGTGGCTAC-3′). The resulting ∼1.7-kb product, which contained the complete coding sequence of rat HNP36, designated here as rENT2, was ligated into the pGEM-T vector to generate the plasmid pAN3 and sequenced in both directions. The 1766-bp rENT2 cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a 456-residue protein flanked by 157 bp of untranslated 5′-nucleotide sequence and 150 bp of untranslated 3′-sequence. Plasmids pAN2 and pAN3 were linearized with SphI and transcribed with SP6 polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG cap (Ambion, Austin, TX) using the MEGAscript™ (Ambion) transcription system. Plasmid cDNA encoding hENT1 (25Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat.

Injected oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C with a daily change of MBM before the assay of transport activity. Uptake of uridine and adenosine by oocytes was traced with the respective 14C-labeled nucleoside (Amersham) (1 μCi/ml). Assays were performed at 20 °C on groups of 10–12 oocytes in transport buffer (0.2 ml) containing either 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm choline chloride and 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (25Griffiths M.

In adenosine uptake and inhibition experiments, the transport buffer also contained 1 μm deoxycoformycin to inhibit adenosine deaminase activity. Unless otherwise indicated, the incubation period was 1 min and the permeant concentration was 10 μm. Competing unlabeled nucleosides and uracil were used at a concentration of 2 mm. For experiments involving NBMPR, dipyridamole, and dilazep, oocytes were pretreated with inhibitor (1 μmunless otherwise indicated) for 1 h before addition of permeant. At the end of the incubation, extracellular radioactivity was removed by six rapid washes in ice-cold transport buffer. Individual oocytes were dissolved in 5% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. We have determined previously that oocytes lack endogenous nucleoside transport processes and have a low basal permeability to uridine and adenosine (7Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y.M. Ritzel M.W.L.

Kinetic constants (apparent K m and V max) and IC50 values were determined using programs of the ENZFITTER software package (Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of oocytes. Electrophoretic analyses of NBMPR-photolabeled proteins in membrane preparations from various cell types have produced evidence of considerable species and/or tissue-related variations in the size ofes transporters (1Cass C.E.

The apparent structural similarity between rat and human es transporters is of particular interest because nucleoside transport in rodent species has a reduced sensitivity to inhibition by vasoactive drugs (1Cass C.E.

Although nothing was known about the molecular properties of ei-type nucleoside transporter proteins, the functional similarities betweenes- and ei-mediated processes suggested an underlying structural homology. Sequence homology between rodent and humanes transporter proteins was suggested by the identification, in the GenBank™/EBI EST data base (dbEST), of ESTs encoding partial sequences of rat and mouse homologs of hENT1 (25Griffiths M.

The insert of plasmid pAN2 encoded a rat jejunal protein, designated here as rENT1, that contained one more amino acid than hENT1 (457 residues,M r 49,984) and was 78% identical (88% similar) to hENT1 in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the additional residue was a cysteine, located just before TM 8. This residue was not present in an otherwise similar dbEST sequence corresponding to mouse ENT1 (GenBank™/EBI accession no.AA270375).

In this model, 11 TMs are connected by short (≤16 residues) hydrophilic regions, with the exception of large loops linking TMs 1 and 2 (extracellular) and TMs 6 and 7 (intracellular), which contain 41 and 66 residues, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The intracellular amino terminus and TMs 1–8, 10, and 11 were highly conserved between the two proteins.Figure 2Hydropathy analyses and topographical model of rENT1 and rENT2.

Since membrane proteins frequently exhibit increased mobilities relative to soluble protein standards on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (35Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R.

Peptide mapping experiments with native human erythrocyte and rat lung/liver es transporters have identified a common trypsin cleavage site situated in an intracellular domain in the approximate center of both proteins (30Kwong F.Y.P.

Copper-containing proteins are important mediators of denitrification, the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to gaseous nitric oxide, nitrous oxide and dinitrogen. Denitrification plays a role in determining the amount of biologically available nitrogen in soil and aqueous systems. Some of the gaseous products (NO and N2O) are greenhouse gases or react with ozone. Nitrite reductase (EC1.7.99.3) is the best studied of the copper denitrification enzymes. Copper-containing nitrite reductase has been isolated fromAlcaligenes faecalis strain S-6 (1Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and found to receive electrons from pseudoazurin, a cupredoxin (2Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The structure of the related enzyme from Achromobacter cycloclastes (3Godden J.W. Turley S. Teller D.C. Adman E.T. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Science. 1991; 253: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) revealed that NIR 1The abbreviation used is: NIR, nitrite reductase. is a trimer of 37-kDa subunits. The trimer has four blue type I copper sites (Cys, His, His, and Met ligands), one buried within each subunit, and three mononuclear type II copper sites (three His ligands) found at the subunit interfaces. Investigation of copper NIRs from several species has revealed that the type I copper is the site of electron transfer with pseudoazurin and the type II copper is the site of nitrite reduction (4Libby E. Averill B.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1529-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Smith B.E. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis studies on A. cycloclastes NIR have demonstrated a first order rate constant for internal electron transfer between the type I and type II copper of 1.4 × 103 s−1 (7Suzuki S. Kohzawa T. Deligeer Yamaguchi K. Nakamura N. Shidara S. Kobayashi K. Takagawa S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11145-11146Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The primary product of NIR is nitric oxide (NO); however, the enzyme can produce nitrous oxide (N2O) if nitric oxide is allowed to accumulate (8Hulse C.L. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2322-2323Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Many organisms make use of a heme cd1 nitrite reductase instead of the copper protein (9Coyne M.S. Arunakumari A. Averill B.A. Tiedje J.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 2924-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this NIR fromThiosphera pantotropha reveals a two domain structure, with heme c bound in a cytochrome c like domain, and heme d1 bound in a β-propeller domain, liganded by a tyrosine from the other domain (10Fulop V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A heme iron nitrosyl intermediate (Fe+–NO+) is proposed in the mechanism for NO production. (11Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for copper NIR whereby nitrite is N-coordinated to a reduced copper followed by protonation, dehydration and production of a copper nitrosyl (Cu+–NO+) intermediate (8Hulse C.L. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2322-2323Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Model compounds of NIR with both N-coordinate bound to Cu(I) and O-coordinate nitrite (12Halfen J.A.

Protonation of the nitrite adduct of the N-bound Cu(I) compound in nonaqueous solution results in the production of NO (12Halfen J.A. Tolman W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5475-5476Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for intermediates of the proposed mechanism is lacking. Using isotopically labeled nitrite one can show that NIR can catalyze the nitrosylation of azide, hydroxylamine and nitrite to yield nitrous oxide (8Hulse C.L. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2322-2323Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Jackson M.A. Tiedje J.M. Averill B.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Azide was shown to inhibit production of NO, and to yield decreasing 15N15NO and small amounts of14N15NO. On the other hand, hydroxylamine did not inhibit NO production and stimulated14N15NO production, suggesting that it was more effective at trapping a bound NO species. In either case, a Cu+-NO+ species was hypothesized, not directly detected. When nitrite binds to oxidized type II copper in the relatedA. xylosoxidans NIR, electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy suggests that nitrite displaces the water ligand (16Howes B.D. Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3171-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No change in the electron nuclear double resonance spectrum is seen when15N nitrite is used, so that it is tempting to interpret the binding to Cu as O bound, although Howes et al. (16Howes B.D. Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3171-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) point out that weak coupling might preclude this interpretation (16Howes B.D. Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3171-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the cytochrome cd1 system, 18O-labeled water can be incorporated into nitrite (17Kim C.H. Hollocher T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this observation is interpreted as the rehydration of a Fe2+-NO+ species. As pointed out by Averill (11Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), no such 18O exchange has been seen in the copper nitrite reductases, and the trapping experiments with 14N15N were done with cell-free extracts, where NO reductase could have confounded the interpretation. Soaking nitrite into crystals of oxidized A. cycloclastes, NIR results in a partially occupied nitrite bound asymmetrically via the oxygen atoms (18Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Finally, extended x-ray absorption fine structure experiments on A. xylosoxidans NIR shows O-bound nitrite (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Toward understanding the productive mode of ligation of nitrite to the active site copper, we report here high resolution structures ofA. faecalis NIR in both the reduced and oxidized states in the presence and absence of nitrite to determine how the protein structure influences the binding mode of nitrite. RecombinantA. faecalis NIR was expressed in Escherichia coliand purified as described elsewhere (20Nishiyama M. Suzuki J. Kukimoto M. Ohnuki T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Green crystals were obtained using the hanging drop method with a reservoir solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0–4.8 (21Turley S. Adman E.T. Sieker L.C. Liu M.-Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 417-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All crystals used in this study are in the space group P212121 and are isomorphous. Data was collected at −160 °C using crystals from four different conditions: air oxidized, ascorbate reduced, nitrite soaked, and ascorbate reduced and then nitrite soaked at low temperature. Oxidized crystals were soaked in freshly prepared reservoir solution. Reduced crystals were prepared by soaking in freshly prepared reservoir solution plus 10 mm ascorbate. Crystals turned from green to colorless within 1 h. Similarly, nitrite-soaked oxidized crystals were obtained by soaking in a freshly prepared reservoir solution plus 1 mm nitrite for 1 h. Crystals soaked for longer periods of time occasionally turned amber-brown, presumably from the slow decomposition of nitrite to NO and other nitrogen oxides that may interact with the type I chromophore. Prior to cryogenic freezing, each soaking solution was brought in steps to 30% glycerol over 30 min. Crystals reduced at room temperature until colorless were transferred into reservoir solution plus 30% glycerol, 30% methanol, 10 mm ascorbate, and 50 mm nitrite cooled to −40 °C using a methanol dry ice slush bath. This solution remains a liquid at −40 °C and acts as a cryogenic protectant for freezing. Crystals were left soaking for 30–45 min and remained colorless. These crystals were quickly transferred onto the end of a −40 °C air stream to allow transport of the crystal from the slush bath to a −160 °C N2 cryostream. Once frozen, crystals were a faint amber color. It was not possible to carry out the converse reaction (that is, to reduce nitrite-soaked crystals with ascorbate at −40 °C) nor was it possible to reduce crystals at all at −40 °C. A Rigaku R-AXIS IIc image plate system was used to collect x-ray diffraction data from each of the four cryocooled crystals. CopperK α radiation was produced from a rotating anode generator operated at 50 kV and 100 mA and focused with mirrors. Data from the reduced nitrite-soaked crystals were processed with the program DENZO (22Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. United Kingdom Science and Engineering Research Council Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1993: 87-91Google Scholar). All other data sets were processed using software provided by the manufacturer (23Higashi T. J. Appl. Cryst. 1990; 23: 253-257Crossref Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12107-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and contains the NIR trimer in the asymmetric unit. This structure was used as the starting point for refinement of the higher resolution (1.8 Å) oxidized nitrite soaked data. A randomly selected portion (8%) of the data was reserved for computation of the free R factor (25Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with the program X-PLOR (26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar) using the parameter set parhcsdx.pro (27Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). In the final stages, all data were included in the refinement. The copper geometry, including the relative position of the nitrite molecules, was not restrained. B-factors were refined using data from 5 Å to the resolution limit (Table II) for 25–40 steps per refinement cycle. Manual adjustment and modeling was done using the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y.

Open table in a new tab The refined model from nitrite-soaked crystals (from data with the highest resolution) was used as the starting point for the other three data sets: oxidized, reduced, and nitrite-soaked reduced. The same refinement methods were applied to each of these. Final refinement statistics for all four structures are presented in Table II. The structure of oxidized NIR at cryogenic temperature is similar to the higher resolution room temperature structure reported previously (24Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Sasaki H. Tanokura M. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12107-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The nitrite-soaked and reduced crystals of NIR diffracted to greater than 2.0 Å resolution, and the overall quality of each structure is similar to or better than that of the room temperature structure (24Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Horinouchi S. Sasaki H. Tanokura M. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12107-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For each structure reported, the conventional R-factor is 19% or better (Table II). More than 90% of the residues are within the most favorable regions of a Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and display reasonable stereochemistry (Table II). Although the cell dimensions of the original crystal are larger than those from the low temperature data (63.0 × 103.6 × 146.9 Å), compression of the molecules into the smaller cell results in a shift of 0.8 Å overall, mostly in the direction of the largest cell dimension difference. There is one short stretch of residues 228–232 of the C chain that, through small adjustments in conformational angles and larger side chain rotations, moves about 3 Å. This short loop comprises a small helical bulge and simply rolls to one side to accommodate the tighter packing. Interestingly, this loop packs up against residues 228–232 of the A chain of a symmetry-related molecule and against residues 51–55 of that molecule. However the conformation of that loop in both the A and B chains remains as it was in the room temperature structure. The B values of the room temperature structure (PDB entry 2afn) are on the average 6 Å2 higher for main chain atoms, 7 Å2 higher for side chain atoms, 6–8 Å2 for the copper atoms. Solvent B values are nearly 15 Å2 higher. The active site of NIR is located at the interface between two domains. The type II copper at the active site of oxidized NIR has a near perfect tetrahedral geometry (Fig. 1 A, TableIII). Three histidine residues provide three ligands via Nε atoms of the imidazole rings. The fourth ligand is an oxygen from either water or a hydroxyl ion. Two of these histidines (His-100 and His-135) are from domain 1, and His-306 is from domain 2 of another monomer in the trimer. All three histidines are located on β-sheet residues that form an integral part of the conserved β-barrel fold of each domain (33Murphy M.E.P. Lindley P.F. Adman E.T. Prot.

His-135 and His-306 are hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyls of Cys-136 and His-306, respectively. His-100 forms a salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Glu-279.Table IIIMetal ligand geometryParameteroxidizedreducedNitrite soaked oxidizedNitrite soaked reducedType I Copper Site (CuA) Ligand bond length (Å)95Nδ12.06 (3)2.07 (2)2.09 (2)2.10 (6)136Sγ2.08 (4)2.19 (5)2.14 (2)2.15 (9)145Nδ11.98 (7)2.08 (4)2.00 (8)2.03 (4)150Sδ2.64 (5)2.58 (1)2.61 (6)2.59 (6) Ligand bond angles (°)95Nδ1–Cu–136Sγ133 (2)126 (4)131 (1)127 (2)95Nδ1–Cu–145Nδ1102 (1)102 (4)106 (2)99 (4)136Sγ–Cu–145Nδ1108 (3)104 (2)106 (2)111 (1)136Sγ–Cu–150Sδ101 (3)104 (3)103 (1)106 (2)150Sδ–Cu–145Nδ1130 (6)132 (4)133 (4)128 (2)150Sδ–Cu–95Nδ185 (3)91 (1)86 (1)86 (2)Type II Copper Site (CuB) Ligand bond length (Å)100Nε21.91 (7)1.94 (4)1.91 (5)1.92 (8)135Nε22.07 (11)2.01 (8)2.02 (5)2.01 (13)306Nε22.09 (3)2.06 (2)2.15 (3)2.11 (1)503O (O1)2.00 (23)2.3 (1)2.4 (2)503O (O2)2.2 (1)2.3 (2) Ligand bond angles (°)100Nε2–Cu–135Nε299 (3)108 (1)99 (3)106 (1)100Nε2–Cu–306Nε299 (2)106 (4)104 (2)105 (3)135Nε2–Cu–306Nε2111 (2)125 (3)125 (3)122 (3)100Nε2–Cu–503O (O1,O2)148 (11)15, 893 (1)15, 490 (6)135Nε2–Cu–503O (O1,O2)97 (8)90, 127 (3)87, 123 (4)306Nε2–Cu–503O (O1,O2)99 (8)87, 102 (3)85, 105 (6)The bond length and angles are the average of three values. Open table in a new tab The bond length and angles are the average of three values. The solvent copper ligand is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Asp-98, which in turn forms a water-bridged hydrogen bond to the side chain His-255. Access to the copper site at the solvent ligand position is sterically limited by Ile-257, which is within 3.3 Å of the oxygen ligand. Ascorbate-reduced crystals of NIR are colorless, indicating that the type I copper site is reduced to Cu(I). Inspection of the x-ray structure of these reduced crystals reveals that the active site copper solvent ligand is no longer present (Fig. 1 B, and TableIII). The conformation of other ligands does not change from the oxidized structure, resulting in a tri-coordinate tetrahedral copper site. The conformation of residues Asp-98 and His-255 are not perturbed by the absence of the solvent ligand. In two of the three subunits Cδ1 of Ile-257 may be less ordered, adopting a conformation in which it becomes closer to the copper. Although difference maps between the oxidized and reduced data showed shifts in atom positions at the type I site, consistent with differences seen between oxidized and reduced forms of pseudoazurin (34Peters-Libeu C.A. Adman E.T. Biochemistry. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar), the shifts are quite small (Table III). Differences in B values and poorer resolution preclude detailed analysis of the shifts. The environment around the active site copper of nitrite-soaked crystals is depicted in Figs. 1 C and 2 C. A nitrite molecule can be fit to electron density by replacing the active site solvent ligand such that the copper remains oxygen coordinate. The nitrite nitrogen lies at an approximate 45° angle to the plane defined by the copper and nitrite oxygens and is closely packed against the side chain of Ile-257. Attempts to fit nitrite in an N coordinate mode failed due to a poor fit to the density and a steric clash with Ile-257. Nitrite O2 forms a hydrogen bond to Asp-98 Oδ1 (3.0 Å), which approaches the oxygen from the opposite side of the Cu–O plane to nitrite N. The other nitrite oxygen, O1, is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules. The average crystallographic B factor of the side chain of Asp-98 is 15 Å2 in the nitrite-soaked crystals, compared with 20 Å2 for reduced and oxidized crystals indicating that this residue is more ordered in the presence of nitrite. The conformations of His-255 and Ile-257 do not change upon nitrite binding. The most notable difference, in addition to the nitrite, is the presence of five solvent molecules in the vicinity of the nitrite, the copper, and Asp-98 (Fig. 2). Only two of these are present in the oxidized structure, and a different pair is present in the reduced structure. The presence of these solvent molecules is also consistent with a more ordered Asp-98. Reduced crystals soaked in 10 mm nitrite remained colorless unless allowed to warm to room temperature, upon which crystals became amber-brown. Data were collected from a slightly colored crystal at −160 °C. Difference density shows nitrite bound in an orientation similar to that found in the oxidized nitrite-soaked structure. The difference density is not as strong as in the oxidized structure, suggesting that the nitrite binding site is not fully occupied in these crystals (Fig. 1 D). There is again less ordered solvent near Asp-98, and the average B value for Asp-98 is 17 Å2, intermediate to the oxidized and nitrite-soaked forms. Evidence for O-coordinate binding of nitrite to oxidized type II copper of nitrite reductase has been observed crystallographically forA. cycloclastes (18Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and by electron nuclear double resonance and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy forA. xylosoxidans (16Howes B.D. Abraham Z.H.L. Lowe D.J. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3171-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The present work differs from theA. cycloclastes NIR structure, in that the nitrite is bent such that the nitrogen points away from Asp-98 instead of toward Asp-98. This difference is likely due to the partial occupancy of nitrite in the A. cycloclastes NIR structure limiting the accuracy of the nitrite orientation. The electron density for nitrite bound to reduced NIR is also weaker than the oxidized structure. The Cu-O distances found in this study (Table III) are intermediate between those found in a dinitrito-O-O′ model complex, where the axial Cu-O distances are 2.5 Å and the basal Cu-O distances are 2.0 Å (37Stibrany R.T. Potenza J.A. Schugar H.J. Inorganic Chimica Acta. 1996; 243: 33-37Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and those found in a mono-nitrito complex, where the Cu-O distances are 2.2 and 2.0 Å (14Tolman W.B. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4877-4880Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The other dimensions of the copper sites (Table III) are in reasonable agreement with those found in our earlier studies and those from extended x-ray absorption fine structure on the relatedA. xylosoxidans NIR (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An attempt to model an N-coordinate nitrite in the same location as the O-coordinate nitrite failed. Not only are there steric clashes with the side chain Ile-257, but difference maps computed after refining N-coordinate nitrite show negative density at the oxygen positions and positive density where the oxygens should be located. The space restriction and the stabilizing hydrogen bond to the carboxylate of Asp-98 likely limits nitrite binding to the O-coordinate mode. Restricting the volume of the ligand bound at the active site may be advantageous in limiting access to larger nonsubstrates, such as nitrate. The binding mode of nitrite to the copper site of A. cycloclastes NIR suggested a possible mechanism for nitrite reduction and dehydration (18Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, we hypothesized (a) that nitrite displaces a water (or hydroxyl) bound to the copper and hydrogen bonds to Asp-98; (b) that the proton in this hydrogen bond remains with Asp-98 until the nitrite is reduced via the copper; (c) that the N-O bond at that oxygen breaks; and (d) that NO is released, restoring the active site. In this proposed scheme, the oxidized enzyme is in an intermediate protonation state, where the proton may formally reside on either the water (18Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) or Asp-98 (Fig. 3), depending on how the type II copper site modulates the pK a of bound ligands. At a lower pH, it is possible that both the copper hydroxyl and Asp-98 are protonated. At a higher pH, both solvent (or nitrite) and Asp-98 could be unprotonated and negatively charged. These alternate protonation states may explain the bell-shaped pH dependence curve observed for NIR (1Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. 1981; 89: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The four structures described here are consistent with the outlined mechanism and suggest additional features. The nitrite-soaked oxidized structure clearly shows nitrite asymmetrically O coordinate to the copper forming a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Asp-98. The nitrite is bent away from Asp-98, which may facilitate proton transfer from this residue to the nitrite oxygen (O2) ligated to the copper. The other nitrite oxygen (O1) is loosely interacting with the copper and may enable the nitric oxide product to easily leave the metal site. In the oxidized structure, nitrite appears to be poised for a concerted reaction of electron transfer and protonation. In the case of the reduced copper, nitrite appears to bind at the same site, but more weakly (lower occupancy) and with less ordered solvent near Asp-98 than is found in the oxidized form. The loss of the solvent atom in the ascorbate reduced NIR structure suggests that the reduced copper has a lower affinity for exogenous ligands, including nitrite. The weak density for nitrite bound to reduced copper likely represents an average of unbound, nitrite bound, or perhaps other metal-bound intermediates in the reaction pathway. Nevertheless, the observed electron density and position of Ile-257 excludes the possibility of predominantly N-coordinate nitrite bound to the reduced enzyme. The combined structural data supports a mechanism where nitrite binds to an oxidized type II site that is then reduced by electron transfer from the type I site. Such a model may explain the need for two linked copper sites in NIR to accomplish a single electron reaction. There are five solvent sites (labeled as A, B, C, D, and E in Fig. 2, upper right) seen in the oxidized nitrite-soaked crystals (Fig. 2, nc) in addition to the copper bound site in the oxidized native enzyme. Site C is found in all four structures; A and E are unique to the oxidized nitrite bound form; D is occupied only in nitrite bound or reduced forms; and B is occupied only in the oxidized forms. A plausible hydrogen bonding pattern is shown for these sites. Some of these water sites may play important roles in the mechanism. In the oxidized enzyme (Fig. 2, oc), the active site solvent is shown protonated and hydrogen bonded to Asp-98. Sites A and E, which hydrogen bond to the nitrite directly, may facilitate the reaction in two ways: both sites can hydrogen bond to nitrite O1, maintaining its orientation, and E can hydrogen bond to Asp-98, forcing its proton to go back to O2 of the nitrite. Site D, in turn, helps to position site E. All of this may help direct the product to a hydrophobic region above His-255 that is devoid of solvent and to modify the reduction potential of the nitrite to facilitate electron transfer. The role of His-255 and the solvent between it and Asp-98 is to ensure that Asp-98 remains well oriented and available for temporary binding of a proton. In general, the network of hydrogen bonded solvent sites surrounding the nitrite provides a ready source of protons for the reaction. It should be noted that the five solvent sites depicted in Fig. 2 are tightly constrained by surrounding residues. Sites B and C are near Ala-137, part of the larger (relative to pseudoazurin and other cupredoxins) loop ligating the type I copper. Mutating Ala-137 to a larger residue would have a significant impact on the function, if our scheme is correct. The amount of nitrous oxide produced by NIR from nitrite increases substantially when nitric oxide levels are high and is not detectable if nitric oxide is removed (15Jackson M.A. Tiedje J.M. Averill B.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Results of incubation of the copper NIR with15NO2− and14NO, and yielding a mixed isotope N2O, have been interpreted as the formation of a copper nitrosyl (Cu+–NO+) that then reacts with a second nitrite (8Hulse C.L. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2322-2323Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Assuming that these isotope studies on cell extracts actually reflect NIR activity (11Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and not endogenous NO reductase activity, they can be reinterpreted in light of our present results. Our proposed scheme for production of NO does not include an N-coordinate copper nitrosyl intermediate. However, a copper nitrosyl may be formed by a rebound mechanism (8Hulse C.L. Averill B.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2322-2323Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) such that released nitric oxide displaces the solvent ligand (Fig. 2), or it may be that NO remains near the active site so that when another nitrite is reduced, that species reacts with it to produce the observed N2O without having to invoke an N-coordinate species. Biomimetic models of NO and nitrite bound to copper have been synthesized and characterized. One model of Cu(II) coordinated with nitrite has been prepared with threet-butylpyrazol ligands in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal arrangement. In this complex, nitrite is asymmetrically O-coordinate (Cu–O = 1.975 and 2.169 Å) but has not been shown to yield NO (14Tolman W.B. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 30: 4877-4880Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A similar Cu(I) complex with t-butylpyrazol ligands and NO is N-coordinate with a Cu–N distance of 1.759 Å and Cu–N–O angle of 163° (36Tolman W.B. Carrier S.M. Ruggiero C.E. Anthroline W.E. Whittker J.W. Karlin K.D. Tykelar Z. Bioinorganic Chemistry of Copper. Chapman and Hall, Inc., New York1993: 406Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, a Cu(I) nitrite complex using tri-isopropyltriazacyclononane to provide N ligands has been characterized in which nitrite is N coordinate to the copper (Cu–N = 1.903 Å) and that does quantitatively yield NO upon addition of protic acids (12Halfen J.A. Tolman W.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5475-5476Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These biomimetic models provide precedence only for productive N coordinate nitrite binding to reduced copper but do not preclude a possible O-coordinate mechanism in NIR. Also, although there is no precedence for O-coordinate NO to copper, the proposed mechanism does not require the NO be a stable copper ligand. As noted previously (19Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), structural features of the type II site of NIR are paralleled in the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase, although in general the NIR active site is much less open to solvent. A zinc coordinated by a solvent atom near a proton-abstracting group, either a carboxylate or hydroxyl group (38Argos P. Garavito R.M. Eventoff W. Rossmann M.G. Branden C.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), is typical of many zinc enzymes. The handedness of this site defined by the proton-abstracting group and substrate binding site is also conserved. All of these structural features are observed in NIR, with Asp-98 as the proton abstractor. In astacin, a member of the metzincin proteinase family that has these structural features, the zinc may be replaced with copper, retaining 37% activity using a synthetic substrate (39Gomis-Ruth F.-X. Grams F. Yiallouros I. Nar H. Kusthardt U. Zwilling R. Bode W. Stocker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17111-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The striking common structural features of the zinc enzymes with NIR and the ability of copper to substitute for zinc in astacin suggests that the mechanisms of these metalloenzymes may share common features as well. Many of the zinc enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase, catalyze the hydration or dehydration of substrates just as NIR removes oxygen from nitrite in the form of water. In both carbonic anhydrase and NIR the substrate, either bicarbonate or nitrite, binds asymmetrically to the metal via two oxygens, one with a shorter metal oxygen distance and hydrogen bonded to the proton abstractor, and the other with a longer distance. The substrate then decomposes, leaving a hydroxyl ion bound to the metal hydrogen bonded to the proton-abstracting group. The mode of binding nitrite in the 2.8 Å room temperature structure of nitrite bound to A. xylosoxidans nitrite reductase (40Dodd F.E. Hasnain S.S. Abraham Z.H.L. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is consistent with our results, although they report a shorter nitrite O1-Cu distance and also propose an N-bound intermediate with which we disagree.

Almost all of these mutants were fully active for serotonin (5-HT) transport and insensitive to inactivation by the positively charged cysteine reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosul-fonate (MTSET). Two active mutants, I172C and I179C, were sensitive to rapid inactivation by MTSET but were relatively insensitive to the negatively charged reagent (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). Inactivation of I172C was blocked by 5-HT and cocaine, but I179C was not similarly protected.

The results suggest that Ile-172, Tyr-176 and Ile-179 are on one face of an α-helical transmembrane element, and that Ile-172 and Tyr-176 are in proximity to the binding site for 5-HT and cocaine.

Clark J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of SERT are clinically effective as antidepressants (2Boyer W. Int. Clin. Psychopharm. 1992; 6: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine derivatives also interact with SERT, either as inhibitors or alternative substrates (3Wall S.C. Gu H.H. Rudnick G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 544-550PubMed Google Scholar). The site at which nontransported inhibitors, such as cocaine, bind to the transporter has been a matter of speculation. They could bind at the same site as 5-HT but not be transported, or they could bind at another, allosteric site. However, the individual amino acid residues that contribute to this binding site have not been identified. Competitive inhibition by cocaine, like most other inhibitors of biogenic amine transport, suggests that it binds at the same site as substrate, or at a mutually exclusive site. The possibility that cocaine binds at a separate site would justify searching for drugs that antagonize cocaine binding without inhibiting transport as therapeutic agents for cocaine abuse. Serotonin is cotransported with Na+ and Cl−and countertransported with K+ (4Rudnick G. Reith M. Neurotransmitter Transporters: Structure, Function, and Regulation. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 73-100Crossref Google Scholar). Previous work suggests that external Na+ and Cl− are bound together with 5-HT and translocated together (5Humphreys C.J. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9118-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After dissociation of 5-HT, Na+, and Cl− to the cytoplasm, internal K+ is thought to bind and be translocated to the external medium (6Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10084-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation steps for 5-HT and K+ are envisaged as conformational changes that expose a substrate binding site (formed by α-helical transmembrane domains) alternately to one side of the plasma membrane or the other. These conformational changes could be triggered by binding of external substrates (5-HT, Na+, and Cl−) or internal K+ at this site. SERT is a member of a large gene family containing transporters for many other neurotransmitters and other substances (7Amara S. Kuhar M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 8Uhl G. Johnson P. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 229-236PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nelson N. Lill H. J. Exp.

Each of these transporters is believed to consist of 12 transmembrane domains connected by hydrophilic loops on the external and cytoplasmic surfaces of the plasma membrane, with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm. Within this family are the closely related transporters for the biogenic amines 5-HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine (1Rudnick G. Clark J. Biochim. Biophys.

Synapse. 1993; 15: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Differences in imipramine affinity between rat and human SERT has been traced to a phenylalanine in TM 12 (16Barker E.L. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 957-965PubMed Google Scholar). However, the removal of consensus glycosylation sites in the second external loop of SERT (EL 2), although they resulted in a lower expression level, did not affect the K m for transport (14Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wang et al. (15Wang J. Moriwaki A. Uhl G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) mutated three cysteines in EL 1 and EL 2 of DAT. Replacement of the single cysteine in EL 1 (equivalent to Cys-109 in SERT) with alanine had no effect on DAT function, but replacement of either cysteine in EL 2 (corresponding to Cys-200 and Cys-209 in SERT) blocked the appearance of DAT immunofluorescence on the plasma membrane and no dopamine transport was observed. We obtained similar results with SERT using serine replacement mutants and further concluded, from a variety of approaches, that Cys-200 and Cys-209 in SERT were likely to form a disulfide in the native protein (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Neither Cys-200 nor Cys-209 reacted with external cysteine reagents, but Cys-109 in EL 1 was sensitive to modification with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives. A mutant in which Cys-109 was replaced with alanine was fully functional and insensitive to inactivation by extracellular MTS reagents (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). MTS reagents have been useful in identifying residues exposed to the external medium in receptors and channels (19Akabas M. Stauffer D. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 20Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Javitch J. Li X.

Two MTS derivatives, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) and (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), are membrane-impermeant, but (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), is able to permeate lipid bilayer membranes (24Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In a transmembrane protein, cysteine residues that are exposed on the external surface, or are in contact with a water-filled channel or binding site, will react with external impermeant MTS reagents. Site-directed mutants in which native amino acid residues are replaced with cysteine will be inactivated by the reagents if the cysteine replacement is exposed and is in a position crucial for function. The C109A mutant of SERT provided a good background for cysteine insertions since transport activity in cells expressing C109A was insensitive to MTSEA and MTSET (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Lin et al. (17Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) found that mutations at Asn-177 in TM 3 of SERT affected the conductance mediated by the protein in the presence of 5-HT. These results are consistent with Asn-177 lining the pore through which ions move while the transporter acts as a channel. Alternatively, mutations at Asn-177 may affect the channel conductance indirectly. To assess these possibilities, and to examine whether the Asn-177 was related to binding sites for 5-HT and cocaine, we mutated 20 of the residues in TM 3, one at a time, to cysteine and studied MTS reactivity of the resultant mutants Mutant transporters were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated region was excised by digestion with NdeI and BbsI and then subcloned back into pCGT137, a recombinant SERT that contains c-Myc and FLAG epitope tags engineered at the N and C termini, respectively (14Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because A181C and A173C introduced a new NdeI site, they were subcloned using the unique restriction sites EcoRV and RsrII in pCGT137. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confluent Intestine 407 cells (CCL-6, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were infected with recombinant vTF-7 vaccinia virus and transfected with plasmids bearing mutant SERT cDNA under control of the T7 promoter as described previously (25Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C and then used to assay transport activity, β-CIT binding, or surface expression. Cell surface expression of the transporters was determined using the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) by a modification of the procedure of Gottardi et al. (26Gottardi C. Dunbar L. Caplan M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 37: F285-F295Crossref Google Scholar) as described previously (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were labeled with NHS-SS-biotin, the excess reagent was quenched, and the cells were solubilized. Cell surface proteins were isolated from the cell extract with immobilized streptavidin, and transporter was detected in the pool of surface proteins by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT). Immunoblots were quantitated using an Alpha Innotech IS-1000. Transport of 5-HT was measured by adding 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2 (PBS/CM) containing (unless indicated otherwise) 20.5 nm [3H]5-HT (3400 cpm/pmol, NEN Life Science Products) to each well and incubating for 10 min at 22 °C. Reactions were terminated by aspiration of the substrate and rapid washing three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed with 250 μl of 1% SDS and the well contents transferred to scintillation vials for counting. Parallel wells were used to measure protein content (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All uptake measurements were corrected by subtracting the blank values measured in the presence of 100 mm cocaine. Binding of the high affinity cocaine analog, 2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-[125I]iodophenyl)tropane (β-CIT), was measured as described previously (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transfected cells in 24-well plates were washed with PBS/CM and then incubated with MTSET or MTSES as follows. Stock MTSET or MTSES solutions in H2O were freshly prepared and diluted 40-fold directly into 400 μl of PBS/CM in each well to achieve the required final concentration. After the indicated incubation period, cells were washed twice with PBS/CM before initiation of uptake. The effects of MTSET and MTSEA on binding were measured after a 30-min incubation with [125I]β-CIT in the presence of 1 mm MTS reagent at 22 °C. Preincubation with MTSET for 10 min before the addition of β-CIT gave similar results to the simultaneous addition of MTSET and β-CIT. Nonlinear regression fits of experimental and calculated data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA), which uses the Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm. The statistical analysis was done with data from single experiments. All the experiments were repeated a total of two to four times and in all cases gave essentially the same results. Unless otherwise indicated, data with error bars represent the mean ± standard deviation for duplicate samples. Using the SERT C109A mutant, which is not sensitive to external MTS reagents, as a starting point, the residues from Ala-164 to Leu-184 were replaced, one at a time, with cysteine. Cys-166 was not changed. This region is predicted to form the third transmembrane domain (TM 3) of SERT. Almost all of the cysteine replacement mutants had normal transport activity when expressed in Intestine 407 cells using the vaccinia T7 transient expression system (25Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Of the mutants, only Y175C and Y176C were seriously impaired for transport (Fig.1, left panel). In particular, transport into cells expressing Y176C was indistinguishable from background, but cells expressing Y175C transported 5-HT at 25–30% of the wild type rate. Of the other replacement mutants, only I179C was consistently less active than C109A, ranging from 50 to 70% in repeated measurements. To investigate the reason for the decreased activity of Y175C, Y176C, and I179C, we measured the level of transporter expression on the cell surface (Fig. 2). Cells expressing each mutant were treated with an impermeant biotinylating reagent, and surface proteins were isolated using streptavidin-agarose. The total cell extract and the surface fraction were subjected to gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibody against the FLAG epitope tag added to the SERT C terminus (14Tate C. Blakely R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No significant differences were detected in the total expression of the cysteine replacement mutants (Fig. 2, left) and only minor differences in surface expression were detected (Fig. 2,right). Relative to C109A, the levels of surface expression for I172C, Y175C, Y176C, and I179C were 100%, 84%, 69%, and 75%, respectively. Decreased surface expression may account for the small decrease in transport activity in I179C, but the transport activity for Y175C and Y176C was significantly lower than expected from their expression levels. Incubation with 1 mm MTSET for 5 min had no effect on transport by C109A and most of the cysteine insertion mutants. However, I172C and I179C were extremely sensitive to these reagents (Fig. 1, right, and Fig. 3). I172C was more sensitive, with a t½ for inactivation of 4.5 ± 1.2 min, and I179C was inactivated with a t½ of 15 ± 3 min (Fig. 3, upper panel). I172C was inactivated also at lower MTSET concentrations (Fig. 3, lower panel). In contrast to the rapid inactivation by MTSET, the negatively charged MTSES was much less effective at inactivating transport by I172C and I179C (Table I, lines 1 and 2). MTSES is about 10% as reactive toward simple thiols as MTSET (28Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), so we used a 10-fold higher concentration of MTSES in these experiments. The relative lack of effect of MTSES could be due to a much lower reaction rate, or MTSES may react rapidly but lead to a modified transporter that retains activity. To test which of these possibilities was the case, we treated cells expressing I172C and I179C with 10 mm MTSES for 10 min and then 1 mm MTSET for a second 10-min incubation. The results, shown on line 3 of Table I, indicate that treatment with MTSES did not protect either mutant from inactivation by MTSET. Thus, MTSET is more reactive than MTSES toward the I172C and I179C mutants.Table IRelative ability of MTSET and MTSES to inactivate I172C and I179CI172CI179CMTSET (1 mm, 10 min)16 ± 2.819 ± 5.3MTSES (10 mm, 10 min)63 ± 5.777 ± 10.9MTSES, then MTSET13.5 ± 2.110.7 ± 4.5Cells transfected with I172C or I179C were incubated with 1 mm MTSET or 10 mm MTSES for 10 min, or 1 mm MTSET for 10 min followed by 10 mm MTSES for 10 min. The cells were then washed and assayed for transport. Transport rates are given as a percentage of the rate observed in a parallel incubation, which did not contain MTSET or MTSES. Open table in a new tab Cells transfected with I172C or I179C were incubated with 1 mm MTSET or 10 mm MTSES for 10 min, or 1 mm MTSET for 10 min followed by 10 mm MTSES for 10 min. The cells were then washed and assayed for transport. Transport rates are given as a percentage of the rate observed in a parallel incubation, which did not contain MTSET or MTSES. The rate of I172C inactivation by MTSET was sensitive to 5-HT and cocaine. Both ligands for the transporter decreased the rate of inactivation by MTSET (Fig.4, upper panel). This protection was half-maximal at 1.3 ± 0.3 μm 5-HT and 2.0 ± 0.4 μm cocaine. These concentrations are in the same range as the affinities of these ligands for SERT (29Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar) and are likely to represent 5-HT and cocaine binding to the active site of the transporter. In contrast, neither 5-HT nor cocaine inhibited MTSET inactivation of the I179C mutant (Fig. 4, lower panel). Since the reaction of MTSET with a protein sulfydryl group produces a disulfide, free cysteine was added to I172C and I179C that had been inactivated with MTSET to test the accessibility of the modified cysteine residue. MTSET-inactivated I179C was reactivated readily by incubation with 12 mm free cysteine for 10 min, but I172C treated the same way was resistant to reactivation, suggesting that access to Ile-172 is more restricted than to Ile-179 (data not shown). The two mutants with severely reduced transport activity, Y175C and Y176C, retained significant affinity for the high affinity cocaine analogue, β-CIT (Fig.5). To test whether these mutants also retained wild type affinity for 5-HT and cocaine, we measured the ability of these ligands to displace β-CIT from binding sites on membranes prepared from cells expressing these mutant transporters. Fig. 5 (upper panel) shows that, relative to C109A, Y176C affinity for 5-HT was reduced 8-fold, although Y175C affinity was close to normal. The affinity for cocaine was reduced in both Y175C and Y176C (lower panel). Mutant Y175C affinity was reduced 2.5-fold and Y176C affinity was reduced 4.6-fold. By comparison, both I172C and I179C mutants gave 5-HT and cocaine affinities indistinguishable from those of the C109A control. Equilibrium dissociation constants for 5-HT and cocaine (1.2 ± 0.1 μm and 0.51 ± 0.04 μm, respectively) were similar to values determined previously (29Rudnick G. Wall S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 421-426PubMed Google Scholar) and in the concentration range that afforded protection against MTSET inactivation to I172C (Fig. 4). Using membranes containing the mutant transporters, we tested the ability of MTSET to inactivate β-CIT binding. In membranes, MTSET was more effective at inactivating C109A than in intact cells. Treatment with 1 mm MTSET led to loss of 25–30% of the binding activity of membranes (Table II, line 1), although transport in intact cells was completely resistant to such treatment (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Table II shows that 1 mm MTSET completely inactivated β-CIT binding to both I172C and Y176C (lines 2 and 4), although I179C was largely resistant to this treatment (line 3). Binding of β-CIT by I172C and Y176C was also completely inactivated by the more permeant reagent MTSEA (data not shown). In addition, one other cysteine replacement mutant, A169C, was consistently about twice as sensitive to MTSEA than was C109A, suggesting that this smaller reagent may penetrate further along TM 3 past Ile-172.Table IIInactivation of β-CIT binding to cysteine substitution mutants by MTSETMutantRemaining activity%C109A70.3 ± 7.3I172C5.8 ± 1.7I179C59.7 ± 21.3Y176C−3.0 ± 2.5Membranes from cells expressing the SERT mutants C109A, I172C, Y176C, and I179C were treated with MTSET, and β-CIT binding was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For each column, the percentage of binding activity remaining is shown, relative to a control incubation with no MTSET present.

The inactivation of β-CIT binding by MTSET was not reversed by washing membranes by centrifugation and resuspension. TableIII shows that when membranes from cells expressing SERT mutants I172C or Y176C were treated with MTSET and washed extensively, inactivation was still observed. The extent of this inactivation was reduced in the presence of either 5-HT or cocaine. Consequently, a larger percentage of the initial binding activity was recovered after washing when 5-HT or cocaine was present during the inactivation reaction (Table III). Treatment of membranes with low concentrations MTSET resulted in greater inactivation of I172C when compared with MTSET treatment of intact cells (compare 94% inactivation at 25 μm for membranes in Table III with 70–80% inactivation at 100 μm for cells in Fig. 4). For this reason, lower concentrations of MTSET were used in protection experiments with membranes.Table IIIProtection by 5-HT and cocaine against MTSET inactivation of β-CIT bindingActivity remaining (% of control)MTSET alone+25 μm 5-HT+25 μm cocaineI172C6.0 ± 1.159.1 ± 1.257.2 ± 4.6Y176C27.3 ± 4.353.6 ± 2.852.5 ± 12.0Membranes from cells expressing the SERT mutants I172C and Y176C were suspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml.

The results shown are from a representative experiment, which was repeated twice for I172C and once for Y176C. The C109A mutant used as a starting point for cysteine replacement mutagenesis contained 18 cysteine residues but was not inactivated by external MTSET (18Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It was possible that replacement of residues with cysteine changed the structure of the protein so as to allow other endogenous cysteine residues to react with MTSET in the mutant transporters. To test this possibility, we replaced Ile-172, Tyr-176, and Ile-179 with alanine, serine, and methionine. TableIV shows that all of these replacements at Ile-172 were functional, although the activity ranged from less than 30% of C109A activity for I172S to full activity for I172M (first data column). Despite the range of activities, all these mutants were insensitive to treatment with 1 mm MTSET for 10 min (second data column). Similar results were observed with replacements of Ile-179. Although I179S was inactive for transport, I179A retained a small fraction of C109A activity, and I179M was similar in activity to I179C (third data column). Neither I179A nor I179M was sensitive to MTSET (fourth data column). Only when Ile-172 or Ile-179 was replaced with cysteine did MTSET inactivate the mutant transporter.Table IVActivity and MTSET sensitivity of replacements at Ile-172 and Ile-179Ile-172Ile-179C109AMTSETC109AMTSET%%Ala70.5 ± 1.6100.5 ± 136.5 ± 1.399 ± 5.7Ser28.5 ± 0.7106 ± 1.41 ± 0.1Met110 ± 17104 ± 368 ± 1199 ± 3.4The transport activity of Ile-172 and Ile-179 replacement mutants relative to C109A was measured and is shown in the first and third data columns, respectively.

Similar results were obtained with replacements of Tyr-176. Although data are not shown, Y176A and Y176M were inactive for transport, like Y176S. All of these mutants retained affinity for β-CIT. Table V demonstrates that β-CIT binding to Y176S and Y176M (rows 2 and 3) was inactivated by 1 mm MTSET to roughly the same extent as in C109A (row 1). In contrast, insertion of cysteine at this position rendered the binding process extremely sensitive to the same MTSET treatment (row 4).Table VActivity and MTSET sensitivity of replacements at Tyr-176Tyr-176Binding after MTSETTyrosine66 ± 6.0Serine43 ± 12.7Methionine48 ± 5.7Cysteine2.3 ± 3.2Membranes from cells expressing C109A, Y176S, Y176M, and Y176C were incubated with [125I]β-CIT in the presence or absence of 1 mm MTSET for 30 min at 22 °C.

The amount of β-CIT bound is expressed as a percentage of the amount bound after a similar incubation in the absence of MTSET. The results presented here suggest that residues in the third transmembrane domain of SERT are in proximity to, and may constitute part of, the binding sites for 5-HT and cocaine. While other residues in the transporter also are expected to contribute to this binding site, these results represent the first association of specific residues in SERT with ligand binding. One of these residues, Tyr-176, is highly conserved throughout the NaCl-coupled transporter family and is likely to form part of the binding pocket in each of these proteins. Replacement of endogenous residues with cysteine renders SERT sensitive to MTSET, a small, impermeant sulfhydryl reagent (Figs. 1 and 3, TableII). For a particular insertion mutant to be sensitive to MTSET, the inserted cysteine must be in contact with the external medium, and modification of that cysteine residue must lead to a detectable change in function. The results in Fig. 1 and Table II indicate that Ile-172, Tyr-176, and Ile-179 fit these criteria. The spacing of Ile-172, Tyr-176, and Ile-179 suggests that they form a vertical patch on an α-helical structure. Fig.6 shows a helical net representation of TM 3. The alignment of three sensitive positions (and the somewhat sensitive position at 169) supports the idea that TM 3 is an α-helix and that one side of the helix faces toward the binding pocket. Aside from these residues, cysteine replacement at other positions between Ala-164 and Leu-184 did not increase the MTSET sensitivity of the transporter. These residues, therefore, are not exposed to the external medium, or are not in a critical position for transporter function. It is of interest that N177C was not sensitive to MTSET, despite the proposal that Asn-177 is in the lumen of the ion channel formed by SERT (17Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding of β-CIT to membranes of cells expressing I172C or Y176C was completely inactivated by MTSET treatment (Table II), and this inactivation was decreased in the presence of 5-HT or cocaine (TableIII). These results suggest that both Ile-172 and Tyr-176 are close enough to the β-CIT binding site that their modification interferes with binding and that ligand binding interferes with MTSET modification of these residues. For Tyr-176, further evidence suggests that this residue may contribute to the binding site for 5-HT and cocaine. When mutated to cysteine in Y176C, the affinity for both 5-HT and cocaine was dramatically diminished (Fig. 5). The fact that this residue is highly conserved through the gene family lends further support that it is required for an essential function, such as substrate binding. In agreement with this role for Tyr-176, Bismuth et al. (30Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) recently reported that mutation of the corresponding Tyr-140 in the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, GAT-1, disrupted proper binding of γ-aminobutyric acid and the inhibitor SKF100330A. Other highly conserved residues in this region include Ile-168, Ile-172, Tyr-175, Ile-179, Ala-181, and Tyr-182. The concentration of conserved residues in this transmembrane domain reinforces the idea that it is critical for transporter function. For Ile-172, evidence of a similar nature supports its role in binding 5-HT and cocaine. The ability of these ligands to protect the I172C mutant from inactivation by MTSET indicates that bound ligand prevented MTSET from reaching the sensitive cysteine residue in both intact cells and membranes (Fig. 4 and Table III). Modification of the cysteine at position 172 with MTSET prevented the cocaine analog β-CIT from productive interaction with its binding site (Table II). Taken together, these two observations strongly suggest that Ile-172 is close to the binding site. The only evidence that argues against this conclusion is the fact that replacement of Ile-172 with cysteine, methionine, or alanine did not dramatically disrupt transport function, in contrast to Tyr-176 where the same substitutions completely blocked transport. Replacement of Ile-172 with serine, however, resulted in a mutant with less than 30% of wild type function. Furthermore, Ile-172 and Tyr-176 obviously fulfill different roles in binding, and cysteine, methionine, and alanine are likely to be better replacements for isoleucine than for tyrosine. Although the data do not rule out the possibility that Ile-172 and Tyr-176 lie in an allosteric site that is not accessible when the binding site is occupied, the evidence strongly supports the proposal that these two residues are in proximity to the 5-HT and cocaine binding site. Although 5-HT and cocaine completely protected I172C from inactivation in intact cells (Fig. 4), high concentrations of these ligands afforded only partial protection against MTSET inactivation of I172C or Y176C in membranes (Table III). Together with the greater MTSET sensitivity of I172C in membranes, this result suggests that additional inactivation processes occur in membranes relative to intact cells. It is possible, for example, that in membranes, but not in intact cells, MTSET gains access to positions 172 and 176 from the cytoplasmic face of the transporter and that this process is not completely blocked by bound ligand. The facts that replacement of Tyr-176 with cysteine decreases affinity for both 5-HT and cocaine, and that both 5-HT and cocaine protect I172C from MTSET inactivation, suggest that the binding sites for substrate and cocaine are close to each other in the biogenic amine transporters, and may overlap significantly. The position of Ile-172 and Tyr-176 in the middle of the third transmembrane domain further suggests that the binding sites for substrate and cocaine are formed by transmembrane domains and are not located on the external surface of the protein. This conclusion is consistent with a model for transport in which the substrate and cotransported ions bind to a site deep within the protein that is accessible from the cell exterior. Substrate transport would be accomplished by a conformational change that blocked access to that site from the external medium and opened a pathway for dissociation from that site to the cytoplasm. In contrast to the close association of Ile-172 and Tyr-176 with the 5-HT and cocaine binding site, these ligands did not protect mutant I179C from MTSET inactivation (Fig. 4). Neither did reaction of I179C with MTSET block β-CIT binding (Table II). Although these results indicate that Ile-179 is not associated with the binding site, MTSET inactivated transport by I179C (Figs. 1 and 3). Ile-179 must, therefore, be involved in some transport step or conformational change that follows substrate binding. One possibility is that Ile-179 is part of the gate that closes to prevent bound substrates from dissociating to the external medium. Modification of this position in I179C with MTSET introduces a positively charged quaternary ammonium derivative that might sterically or electrostatically interfere with the conformational change associated with closing the gate. The positively charged reagent MTSET inactivated I172C and I179C much faster than did the negatively charged MTSES (Table I). Some of the difference between the reactivity of these two agents is likely to stem from their intrinsic reactivity toward thiolate anions (28Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, even taking this difference into account, MTSET reacted 4–6-fold faster than MTSES with these positions. It is conceivable that a negatively charged residue from another part of the protein influences the electrostatic environment near the cysteine residue. In SERT, only two negatively charged residues are found in transmembrane domains. They are Asp-98 in TM 1 and Glu-508 in TM 10. Asp-98 and its equivalent in the dopamine transporter are known to be essential for normal function of these transporters (12Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D. Uhl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 31Blakely R. Moore K. Qian Y. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1993; 48: 283-300PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the role of this residue in transport is to coordinate the free amino group of 5-HT or dopamine (12Kitayama S. Shimada S. Xu H. Markham L. Donovan D. Uhl G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7782-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A positively charged amino group is a feature common to all substrates transported by members of the NaCl transporter family, although the aspartate in TM 1 is found only in biogenic amine transporters. It is possible that Asp-98 helps to coordinate the amino group of biogenic amine substrates in the binding site formed by the invariant Tyr-176. It may also influence the reactivity of Cys-172 in I172C and Cys-179 in I179C. Future studies will investigate the proximity of Asp-98 to the TM 3 residues proposed here to form part of the binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2040624923,"Sentrin is a ubiquitin-like molecule that has been shown to interact with the death domains of Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), PML, Rad51, Rad52, and RanGAP1. We have reported previously that sentrin can be conjugated to other proteins in a manner analogous to protein ubiquitination (Kamitani, T., Nguyen, H. P., and Yeh, E. T. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14001–14004). Furthermore, the conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly residues are required for sentrinization to occur. To identify enzymes which play a role in sentrinization, the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a human placenta cDNA library using sentrin as bait. A strong positive interacting clone was found to contain a cDNA insert encoding the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. The interaction between sentrin and Ubc9 required the ubiquitin domain and the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues of sentrin. This interaction appears to be specific because sentrin could only interact weakly with UbcH5B, but could not interact with HHR6B, UbcH6 nor E2-EPF. In vitro translated sentrin could be precipitated by a GST-Ubc9 fusion protein, but not by glutathione S-transferase. A β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive Ubc9-sentrin conjugate could also be identified in the in vitro binding assay. Substitution of the conserved cysteine residue of Ubc9 by serine abolished the formation of the Ubc9-sentrin conjugate. Taken together, Ubc9 is a strong candidate to be the key conjugating enzyme in the sentrinization pathway."

The CD95 ligand (CD95L) is a 40-kDa Type II transmembrane protein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor family of cytokines (1Nagata S. Golstein P.

CD95L is expressed in activated T lymphocytes (3Suda T. Okazaki T. Naito Y. Yokota N. Arai S. Ozaki K. Nakao K. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3806-3813PubMed Google Scholar) but its expression can also be induced by cytostatic agents in a variety of different cell lines (14Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.-M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD95L expression has been observed in hepatocytes in vivo in patients with alcoholic hepatitis (16Galle P.R.

Thus, CD95L expression seems to be induced by different mechanisms of cellular injury and might be an important tool for the organism to eliminate damaged cells. Little is known about the exact mechanism of induction of CD95L. The CD95L promoter has been described to contain NF-κB binding sites (17Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Inazawa J. Abe T. Suda T. Nagata S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, induction of CD95L mRNA might involve reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. In line with this assumption is the observation of apoptotic cell death in different cell lines after oxidative stress (18Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 19Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the model of bleomycin-induced apoptosis to investigate the possible role of ROS in the induction of CD95L mRNA. Bleomycin has been described as a potent inducer of apoptosis, involving up-regulation of CD95 receptor and ligand expression (15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Whereas up-regulation of the CD95 receptor in response to cell damage apparently involves activity of the p53 tumor suppressor gene product, the mechanism of CD95L induction is unclear to date. Because bleomycin treatment induces oxidative stress (20Kilinc C. Ozcan O. Karaoz E. Sunguroglu K. Kutluay T. Karaca L. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1993; 4: 249-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21An J. Hsie A.W. Mutat. Res. 1992; 270: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22An J. Hsie A.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 289: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) it provides a suitable model for the investigation of the potential association between induction of ROS and CD95L. In this study we demonstrate that CD95L mRNA induction indeed involves the action of ROS which can be blocked by the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine. HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Bleomycin (Cell Pharm, Hannover, Germany) was used at 3 mg/ml. N-Acetylcysteine (Sigma) was used at 50 μm, deferoxamine (desferrioxamine mesylate; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) at 50 mm. At these concentrations N-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine proved to be nontoxic for HepG2 cells as demonstrated by viability assays, lactate dehydrogenase release, and morphological analysis (data not shown). Poly(A)+-RNA was purified from about 5 × 105 HepG2 cells treated with bleomycin using the Oligotex Direct mRNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. RNA was eluted with 50 μl of H2O. RT-PCR was performed using the Gen-Amp RNA-PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer. Reverse transcription was done with oligo(dT)16 and 3 μl of the poly(A)+-RNA under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The primers used for amplification of the CD95L mRNA have been described recently (23Peter M.E. Dhein J. Ehret A. Hellbardt S. Walczak H. Moldenhauer G. Krammer P.H. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1873-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and were used at a final concentration of 0.2 μm. Human β-actin primers were from Stratagene (Catalog No. 302010) and used at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. 35 PCR cycles were performed at 94 °C for 30 s, at 56 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 2 min in a volume of 100 μl. 10 μl of the PCR sample were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels. In all cases at least three independent sets of experiments were performed. Floating cells from the tissue culture supernatant were collected by centrifugation at 200 ×g. Adherent cells were harvested by incubation with 1% trypsin. HepG2 cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 ×g, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. This was followed by staining with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml PBS). DNA fluorescence was measured in a Becton Dickinson FACScan according to the method of Nicoletti et al. (24Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Paggliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C.A J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar). A minimum of 10,000 events was measured per sample. Data analysis was performed with Lysis II software. HepG2 cells were maintained on 35-mm plates. After bleomycin treatment cells were harvested with a cell scraper, washed in PBS, and finally taken up in 300 μl of 2.5% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed for intracellular glutathione and glutathione disulfide as described (25Eck H.-P. Gmünder H. Hartmann M. Petzhold D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1989; 370: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). O·̄2 generation was detected by a chemiluminescence reaction as described previously (26Galle J. Bengen J. Schollmeyer P. Wanner C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were subconfluently seeded in sterile scintillation vials and treated with 3 mg/ml bleomycin for 24 h. Thereafter, medium was discarded and replaced by the scintillation solution containing 0.25 mmol/L lucigenin (Sigma) dissolved in 2 ml of Krebs-HEPES buffer. Counts were obtained at 1-min intervals at room temperature. To determine the specificity of the reaction the O·̄2 scavenger 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid (Tiron, 10 mmol/L, Sigma) was added. Treatment with bleomycin in concentrations between 10 μg/ml and 3 mg/ml induces apoptosis as demonstrated by the appearance of a sub-G1 fraction of fragmented nuclei using propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis according to Nicolettiet al. (24Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Paggliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C.A J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A; see also Ref. 15Müller M.

This is accompanied by an induction of CD95 mRNA (15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) and also of CD95L mRNA (Fig. 1 B). The functional relevance of this observation has been demonstrated by blocking access of CD95L to the CD95 receptor using F(ab′)2 antagonistic antibody fragments which largely inhibited induction of apoptosis (15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Here, HepG2 cells were treated with 3 mg/ml bleomycin for 0, 5, 10, 24, 32, and 48 h, and expression of CD95L mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR. CD95L mRNA expression was detectable after 5 h, showed its highest level between 24 and 32 h, and decreased around 48 h (Fig.1 B). Recently we demonstrated dependence of CD95 induction on the presence of the tumor suppressor gene product p53 (15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). CD95 expression took place only in hepatoma cell lines with p53 wild type configuration (HepG2) but not with p53 mutant configuration (Huh7) or in the absence of p53 (Hep3b). In contrast, CD95L mRNA was found to be inducible independently of the presence of p53 wild type and thus, seems to be regulated in a different manner (15Müller M. Strand S. Hug H. Heinemann E.-A. Walczak H. Hofmann W.J. Stremmel W. Krammer P.H. Galle P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Since bleomycin treatment has been described to result in oxidative stress (21An J. Hsie A.W. Mutat. Res. 1992; 270: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22An J. Hsie A.W. Mutat. Res. 1993; 289: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we posed the question whether CD95L mRNA activation is correlated to the generation of ROS in response to bleomycin treatment. In initial experiments we investigated the induction of oxidative stress following bleomycin treatment in hepatoma cells. As a parameter of oxidative stress intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels were assessed. Bleomycin treatment resulted in a rapid depletion of total GSH from initial values of 18 nmol/mg of protein in untreated controls to 0.7 nmol/mg of protein after 48 h (Fig.2 A) indicating disturbances in the cellular redox status. Additional treatment withN-acetylcysteine partially prevented GSH depletion of bleomycin-treated cells, with GSH levels of 14.8 nmol/mg of protein after 48 h. As a direct measure of induction of reactive oxygen species in bleomycin-treated cells we investigated generation of superoxide (O·̄2) using a chemiluminescence assay (26Galle J. Bengen J. Schollmeyer P. Wanner C. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1582-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We observed a strong induction in chemiluminescence following treatment with 3 mg/ml bleomycin for 24 h. This signal could be completely blunted by addition of the O·̄2 scavenger Tiron, demonstrating specificity of the reaction. To establish a causative relationship between the observed induction of CD95L mRNA and presence of reactive oxygen species we treated HepG2 cells with H2O2. In a manner similar to bleomycin treatment H2O2 at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 μm induced expression of CD95L mRNA (Fig.3 A). Higher concentrations proved to be cytotoxic as demonstrated by a decrease in cell number and a consecutive decrease in β-actin and CD95L mRNA expression (data not shown). Further evidence for ROS-mediated CD95L mRNA expression was obtained from experiments with the antioxidants deferoxamine andN-acetylcysteine. Deferoxamine is an iron chelator. It prevents the formation of the hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide via the Fenton reaction (27Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar).N-Acetylcysteine interferes with the generation of ROS and is a glutathione precursor. A direct effect of glutathione depletion on the induction of apoptosis seems unlikely, because glutathione depletion alone (using buthionine sulfoximine treatment of human leukocytes) failed to induce apoptosis (28Sato N. Iwata S. Nakamura K. Hori T. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3194-3203PubMed Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were treated with bleomycin (3 mg/ml) for up to 48 h in the absence or presence of antioxidants as shown in Fig. 3 B. At ∼32 h maximum expression of CD95L mRNA was reached. This expression was reduced in the presence of N-acetylcysteine. A further reduction to almost undetectable levels is observed in the presence ofN-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). Deferoxamine alone did not result in a reproducible decrease of CD95L mRNA expression (data not shown). In a similar fashion, H2O2-induced CD95L expression was reduced in the presence of N-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine (data not shown). Taken together the above data point to an important role of ROS in the transcriptional regulation of CD95L expression. Interestingly and in agreement with our experimental evidence in hepatoma cells, a positive correlation between the intracellular levels of ROS and CD95L expression has been observed recently in activation-induced death of mature T lymphocytes and hybridomas (29Williams M.S. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2395-2402PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of CD95L mRNA induction via ROS remains to be clarified. Potentially involved regulatory proteins include redox-dependent transcription factors such as NF-κB or AP-1. Our data suggest a coordinated activation of the CD95 system in induction of apoptosis and thus elimination of injured cells, which involves p53-mediated expression of the CD95 receptor in response to DNA damage and ROS-mediated expression of the CD95 ligand. This might result in autocrine suicide of damaged cells and might add to the concept of maintenance of genomic integrity as it has been suggested as an important functional role of p53. Any alteration of the cellular capability to respond to cytostatic agents both on the level of CD95 or CD95L might result in a decreased sensitivity toward chemotherapeutic drug action and could thus add to primary or secondary resistance to anti-cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2025468090,"Cleland and Kreevoy recently advanced the idea that a special type of hydrogen bond (H-bond), termed a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB), may account for the “missing” transition state stabilization underlying the catalytic power of many enzymes, and Frey et al. have proposed that the H-bond between aspartic acid 102 and histidine 57 in the catalytic triad of serine proteases is an example of a catalytically important LBHB. Experimental facts are here considered regarding the aspartic acid–histidine and cis– urocanic H-bonds that are inconsistent with fundamental tenets of the LBHB hypothesis. The inconsistencies between theory and experiment in these paradigm systems cast doubt on the existence of LBHBs, as currently defined, within enzyme active sites."

Calmodulin, a ubiquitous Ca2+-dependent effector protein, regulates multiple processes in eukaryotic cells, including cytoskeletal organization, vesicular trafficking, and mitogenesis. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase participates in events downstream of the receptors for insulin and other growth factors. Here we demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography that Ca2+/calmodulin associates with Src homology 2 domains in the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, thereby significantly enhancing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, CGS9343B, a calmodulin antagonist, inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in intact cells.

Here we demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography that Ca2+/calmodulin associates with Src homology 2 domains in the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, thereby significantly enhancing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, CGS9343B, a calmodulin antagonist, inhibited basal and Ca2+-stimulated phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol in intact cells. These data demonstrate a novel mechanism for modulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and provide a direct link between components of two fundamental signaling pathways. A critical aspect of protein and/or lipid kinase regulation is the tight coupling of catalytic activity to various extracellular or intracellular signals.

Since CaM and PI3-kinase modulate similar cellular events, we evaluated a possible interaction between these two signaling components.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase (p85) was precipitated from lysates of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing p85 with CaM-Sepharose but not with Sepharose alone, demonstrating an interaction between these two proteins (Fig.1 A). To identify the CaM-binding region of p85, CaM-Sepharose was incubated with GST fusion proteins containing various regions of p85. Probing with anti-GST antibody disclosed that the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain bound to the CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1 B). Longer exposure of the blot revealed association of the amino-terminal SH2 domain with CaM-Sepharose, suggesting that this region also interacts with CaM albeit with a lower affinity (data not shown). Binding to either SH2 domain was significantly reduced when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (data not shown). Furthermore, endogenous p85 from CHO cell lysates bound to CaM-Sepharose only in the presence of Ca2+(Fig. 1 C). No binding of CaM to the SH3 or breakpoint cluster homology regions was detected.Insulin activates PI3-kinase by inducing the association of the SH2 domains of p85 with specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of IRS proteins (19Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that a phosphorylated YMXM peptide (pY608), derived from amino acids 605–615 of IRS-1, activates PI3-kinase by binding to its SH2 domains (23Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Mirapleix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Incubation with pY608, but not with the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide (Y608), resulted in displacement of baculovirus-expressed p85 from CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that CaM binds in or near the pocket occupied by phosphorylated YMXM motifs. Among the functional possibilities that may be inferred from this observation are that CaM may directly activate PI3-kinase or may modulate PI3-kinase activity by competing with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins for binding to the SH2 domains of p85.To resolve this question, the PI3-kinase activity associated with CaM was examined. The binding of PI3-kinase from CHO cell lysates to CaM-Sepharose was Ca2+-dependent (Fig.2 A). Anti-CaM and anti-p85 antibodies immunoprecipitated p85 and p110, the catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, from CHO cell lysates (Fig. 2 B); however, p85 was not coimmunoprecipitated with an irrelevant isotype-identical monoclonal antibody (anti-myoglobin) or preimmune serum (Fig.2 B). Even though more p85 and p110 were present in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates than in anti-CaM immunoprecipitates, the PI3-kinase activity in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitates was 6-fold greater than that in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C). These data, coupled with the relatively small amount of catalytic p110 subunit bound to CaM, strongly support the contention that CaM significantly stimulates PI3-kinase activity. HPLC analysis of the PtdIns-P produced by PI3-kinase in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitate revealed that 80% was phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P) (Fig. 2 D). Greater than 95% of the phosphatidylinositol kinase activity in CHO cell lysates was phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (data not shown), supporting a specific interaction of CaM and PI3-kinase. Furthermore, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) decreased the PI3-kinase activity in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitates by greater than 90% (Fig.2 E), further substantiating the identity of this enzyme as PI3-kinase.Figure 2Isolation of p85 and PI3-kinase activity from CHO cells. A, CHO cell lysates were incubated with CaM-Sepharose. After washing, PI3-kinase activity was determined by incubating the beads with [γ-32P]ATP and phosphatidylinositol, and resolving the samples by TLC. An autoradiograph is shown with the position of migration of PtdIns-3-P (PIP) indicated. B, CHO cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-myoglobin (anti-Myo), anti-CaM, preimmune serum (preimmune), or anti-p85 antibody and treated as inA. The immunoblots were probed with antibody to p85 or p110 and visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The positions of migration of the p85 and p110 subunits of PI3-kinase are indicated. C, PI3-kinase activity in the anti-CaM and anti-p85 immunoprecipitates was measured as described inA. An autoradiograph is shown with the position of migration of PtdIns-3-P indicated. D, following TLC, PtdIns-P from the anti-CaM sample was isolated from the TLC plate and analyzed by HPLC. The migration of PtdIns-3-P (16 min) and PtdIns-4-P (17.5 min) is indicated. E, anti-CaM immunoprecipitates of CHO cell lysates were preincubated with or without 100 μmLY294002, and PI3-kinase activity was measured. In all cases, representative data from two independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since CaM binds to IRS-1 in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (25Munshi H.G.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15883-15889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the possibility of a ternary complex between CaM, p85, and IRS-1 was evaluated in 32D cells, which lack endogenous IRS-1 and IRS-2 (26Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Essentially identical amounts of p85 from lysates of 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells were precipitated with CaM-Sepharose (Fig.3), indicating that the binding is independent of IRS proteins.Figure 3Isolation of p85 from 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells. 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells were lysed and incubated with Sepharose or CaM-Sepharose in the presence of 0.1 mmCaCl2. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF, and blots were probed for p85. The data are representative of two separate experimental determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm our results, activation of PI3-kinase by pY608 or CaM was compared using anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of CHO cell lysates. In anti-p85 immunoprecipitates, 5 μm CaM stimulated PI3-kinase activity by 50%, while 100 μm pY608 enhanced PI3-kinase activity by 38% (Fig. 4). EGTA did not significantly alter basal or pY608-stimulated PI3-kinase activity in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (data not shown) but abolished the activation of PI3-kinase by CaM (Fig. 4). These data verify that CaM stimulated PI3-kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The activity of baculovirus-expressed PI3-kinase was similarly augmented by CaM (data not shown). Thus, the activation of PI3-kinase by CaM was comparable to that obtained by occupancy of the SH2 domains with a phosphopeptide, implying that the binding of CaM to the SH2 domains of p85 is a novel mechanism for the regulation of PI3-kinase activity.Figure 4CaM stimulation of PI3-kinase.PI3-kinase activity was measured in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates preincubated with various concentrations of CaM or 100 μmpY608. 100 μm Ca2+ was present in all samples, except where chelated with EGTA.

Treatment with A23187 increased PtdIns-3-P by 30% (TableI). The CaM antagonist, CGS9343B, decreased basal levels of PtdIns-3-P and prevented the stimulation by increased [Ca2+] i . A23187 induced the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2) (which was not detected in lipids extracted from control cells), and this effect was abrogated by concomitant incubation with CGS9343B.

It has been demonstrated that a phosphorylated YMXM peptide (pY608), derived from amino acids 605–615 of IRS-1, activates PI3-kinase by binding to its SH2 domains (23Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Mirapleix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Incubation with pY608, but not with the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide (Y608), resulted in displacement of baculovirus-expressed p85 from CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that CaM binds in or near the pocket occupied by phosphorylated YMXM motifs. Among the functional possibilities that may be inferred from this observation are that CaM may directly activate PI3-kinase or may modulate PI3-kinase activity by competing with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins for binding to the SH2 domains of p85.To resolve this question, the PI3-kinase activity associated with CaM was examined. The binding of PI3-kinase from CHO cell lysates to CaM-Sepharose was Ca2+-dependent (Fig.2 A). Anti-CaM and anti-p85 antibodies immunoprecipitated p85 and p110, the catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase, from CHO cell lysates (Fig. 2 B); however, p85 was not coimmunoprecipitated with an irrelevant isotype-identical monoclonal antibody (anti-myoglobin) or preimmune serum (Fig.2 B). Even though more p85 and p110 were present in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates than in anti-CaM immunoprecipitates, the PI3-kinase activity in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitates was 6-fold greater than that in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C). These data, coupled with the relatively small amount of catalytic p110 subunit bound to CaM, strongly support the contention that CaM significantly stimulates PI3-kinase activity. HPLC analysis of the PtdIns-P produced by PI3-kinase in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitate revealed that 80% was phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns-3-P) (Fig. 2 D). Greater than 95% of the phosphatidylinositol kinase activity in CHO cell lysates was phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (data not shown), supporting a specific interaction of CaM and PI3-kinase. Furthermore, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) decreased the PI3-kinase activity in the anti-CaM immunoprecipitates by greater than 90% (Fig.2 E), further substantiating the identity of this enzyme as PI3-kinase.Since CaM binds to IRS-1 in a Ca2+-sensitive manner (25Munshi H.G. Burks D.J. Joyal J.L. White M.F. Sacks D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15883-15889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the possibility of a ternary complex between CaM, p85, and IRS-1 was evaluated in 32D cells, which lack endogenous IRS-1 and IRS-2 (26Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Essentially identical amounts of p85 from lysates of 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells were precipitated with CaM-Sepharose (Fig.3), indicating that the binding is independent of IRS proteins.Figure 3Isolation of p85 from 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells. 32D and 32D/IRS-1 cells were lysed and incubated with Sepharose or CaM-Sepharose in the presence of 0.1 mmCaCl2. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF, and blots were probed for p85. The data are representative of two separate experimental determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm our results, activation of PI3-kinase by pY608 or CaM was compared using anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of CHO cell lysates. In anti-p85 immunoprecipitates, 5 μm CaM stimulated PI3-kinase activity by 50%, while 100 μm pY608 enhanced PI3-kinase activity by 38% (Fig. 4). EGTA did not significantly alter basal or pY608-stimulated PI3-kinase activity in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates (data not shown) but abolished the activation of PI3-kinase by CaM (Fig. 4). These data verify that CaM stimulated PI3-kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The activity of baculovirus-expressed PI3-kinase was similarly augmented by CaM (data not shown). Thus, the activation of PI3-kinase by CaM was comparable to that obtained by occupancy of the SH2 domains with a phosphopeptide, implying that the binding of CaM to the SH2 domains of p85 is a novel mechanism for the regulation of PI3-kinase activity.Figure 4CaM stimulation of PI3-kinase.PI3-kinase activity was measured in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates preincubated with various concentrations of CaM or 100 μmpY608. 100 μm Ca2+ was present in all samples, except where chelated with EGTA.

We demonstrate that changes in [Ca2+] i regulate PI3-kinase in a manner distinct from the canonical phosphotyrosine-dependent pathway, providing an additional level of control of this fundamental enzyme. Our findings expand the repertoire of enzymes that are regulated by Ca2+/CaM and accentuate the myriad interconnections between intracellular signaling pathways. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase (p85) was precipitated from lysates of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing p85 with CaM-Sepharose but not with Sepharose alone, demonstrating an interaction between these two proteins (Fig.1 A). To identify the CaM-binding region of p85, CaM-Sepharose was incubated with GST fusion proteins containing various regions of p85. Probing with anti-GST antibody disclosed that the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain bound to the CaM-Sepharose (Fig. 1 B). Longer exposure of the blot revealed association of the amino-terminal SH2 domain with CaM-Sepharose, suggesting that this region also interacts with CaM albeit with a lower affinity (data not shown). Binding to either SH2 domain was significantly reduced when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA (data not shown). Furthermore, endogenous p85 from CHO cell lysates bound to CaM-Sepharose only in the presence of Ca2+(Fig. 1 C). No binding of CaM to the SH3 or breakpoint cluster homology regions was detected. Insulin activates PI3-kinase by inducing the association of the SH2 domains of p85 with specific phosphotyrosine-containing motifs of IRS proteins (19Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Myers Jr., M.G.

The PLDγ cDNA is 3.3 kilobases in length and codes for an 855-amino acid protein of 95,462 Da with a pI of 6.9. PLDγ shares a 66% amino acid sequence identity with PLDβ, but only a 41% identity with PLDα. A potential N-terminal myristoylation site is found in PLDγ, but not in PLDα and -β. Catalytically active PLDγ was expressed inEscherichia coli, and its activity requires polyphosphoinositides. Both PLDγ and -β are most active at μm Ca2+ concentrations, whereas the optimal PLDα activity requires mm Ca2+concentrations. Binding studies showed that the PLDs bound PIP2 in the order of PLDβ > PLDγ > PLDα. This binding ability correlates with the degree of conservation of a basic PIP2-binding motif located near the putative catalytic site. The binding of [3H]PIP2 was saturable and could be competitively decreased by addition of unlabeled PIP2. Neomycin inhibited the activities of PLDγ and -β, but not PLDα.

Such an interaction is believed to either recruit or activate proteins essential for signaling or membrane trafficking pathways, thus allowing coordinated regulation of different cellular processes (14Camilli P.D. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which polyphosphoinositides affect PLD activities has not been elucidated. Direct phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding has not been demonstrated previously for PLDs from any source. In this report, we first describe the cloning and molecular analysis of a new Arabidopsis PLD, PLDγ, whose activity is regulated by polyphosphoinositides. To delineate the mechanisms of the polyphosphoinositide modulation of PLDs, we then provide evidence indicating that plant PLDs directly bind PIP2 and that this binding is required for the activities of PLDγ and -β, but not PLDα. Additionally, the regulation by Ca2+ and the domain structures of plant PLDγ, -β, and -α are compared. Dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho[inositol-2-3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate and dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho[methyl-3H]choline were products of Amersham Corp. PC from soybean and PIP2from bovine brain were purchased from Sigma and American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Other lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. An expression sequence-tagged cDNA clone, ∼1 kilobase in length, was identified as a putative incomplete new Arabidopsis PLD cDNA by searching the GenBank™ Data Bank against the cloned PLD sequences. A full-length PLD cDNA, named PLDγ, was isolated from a ZAPII cDNA library, constructed from 3–6-kilobase mRNA isolated from hypocotyls of 3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings (15Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). The library was screened using the expression sequence-tagged cDNA clone as a probe with hybridization conducted at 65 °C. The subsequent DNA manipulation of the positive clones, sequencing, and sequence analysis were based on previously described procedures (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final sequence was determined from both strands. The expression sequence-tagged clone and cDNA library were kindly provided by the Ohio State University Arabidopsis Information Center. The expression of the PLDγ cDNA was performed in two constructs: pBluescript SK(−) and the vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) containing the sequence encoding the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Oligonucleotides with an added BamHI site were used as primers to amplify a 2.9-kilobase fragment by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′-end primer corresponded to nucleotides 342–360 of the PLDγ cDNA. AfterBamHI digestion, the insert was ligated into pBluescript SK or pGEX-2T, and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli JM109. The expression of PLDγ was induced using the same procedure as described for PLDα and -β (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed by sonication in the resuspension buffer, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Protein content in the supernatant was measured by the Bradford method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the supernatant were assayed for PLD activity or stored at −80 °C until use. In addition to the GST-PLDγ fusion protein, GST-PLDα and GST-PLDβ also were used in this study. The construct of GST-PLDα was reported previously (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the GST-PLDβ fusion protein was generated by excising the PLDβ cDNA insert in pBluescript SK (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) withEcoRI digestion and then ligating it into pGEX-2T. The procedures for induction and protein harvest were the same as those described for the pBluescript constructs (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), except that 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used for induction. GST-PLDα, GST-PLDβ, GST-PLDγ, and GST alone were purified as described (16Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, induced bacteria were pelleted and rinsed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in rinsing buffer containing 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and was incubated on ice for 15 min. Dithiothreitol was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the samples were briefly sonicated on ice. To solubilize the expressed protein, N-laurylsarcosine was added to 1.5% (v/v), and then the samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 4% (v/v). Samples of GST-PLDα, GST-PLDβ, and GST-PLDγ with equal amounts of GST activity were then absorbed to swollen glutathione-agarose beads (50%, v/v) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were rinsed with 15 bed volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Both the GST activity and protein content of the rinsed beads were measured. GST activity was measured using a 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and calculated in units of ΔA 340/min/ml. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method using purified GST fusion proteins eluted from the glutathione beads with 10 mmglutathione. Phospholipid binding by the GST-PLD proteins and GST was performed according to a method adapted from Davletov and Sudhof (17Davletov B.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock vesicles of PIP2 were prepared by mixing 0.9 μCi of [3H]PIP2 with 1.0 μmol of unlabeled PIP2 in chloroform, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of N2. The phospholipids were dispersed in 0.5 ml of H2O by sonication at room temperature. The fusion proteins attached to the glutathione-agarose beads (30-μl wet volume) were incubated with 20 nmol of [3H]PIP2 vesicles in buffer (50 mm MES (pH 7), 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm KCl) containing 1 mm EGTA and 0.1 or 5 mm Ca2+ in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation, PIP2 bound to PLDs was pelleted with the affinity beads by centrifugation at 2000 × g. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of the incubation buffer, and PIP2bound to PLDs was measured by scintillation counting of [3H]PIP2. GST bound to glutathione-agarose was used as the control for background PIP2 binding. Binding was expressed as dpm/unit of GST activity (dpm/ΔA 340/min). The above method was also used to examine the binding of [3H]PC to the GST fusion proteins. In competition experiments, 20 nmol of [3H]PIP2 was incubated with GST-PLD fusion proteins attached to glutathione beads in the presence of 1 mm EGTA, and then 5, 20, or 40 nmol of unlabeled PIP2 was added to a final volume of 100 μl. The incubation, rinsing, and quantitation were performed as described above. A 14-amino acid peptide was synthesized that consisted of a cysteine and 13-amino acids corresponding to residues 838–851 of PLDγ. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as an antigen to raise antibodies in rabbits (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with antiserum that contained JM109 lysate to remove nonspecific reactive bacterial proteins. The immunoblot analysis was performed as described (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PIP2-dependent PLD activity (see Figs. 3 A, 4, and 5) was assayed using the conditions described previously (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The basic assay mixture contained 100 mm MES (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.4 mm lipid vesicles, and 30 μg of pBluescript SK-expressed protein in a total volume of 100 μl. CaCl2 was added to the reactions at the concentrations noted below. Lipid vesicles contained 35 nmol of PE, 3 nmol of PIP2, and 2 nmol of PC. PLD-mediated hydrolysis of PC was measured using either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl[oleoyl-1-14C]glycero-3-phosphocholine or dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho-[methyl-3H]choline as substrate. The reaction was initiated by addition of substrate and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a shaking water bath. Choline, PA, and phosphatidylethanol produced in the PLD reaction were separated and quantitated as described previously (12Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the phospholipid activation experiments, PIP2 was replaced with 3 nmol of PE, PA, PG, PS, PI, or PIP. In the Ca2+ dependence experiments, varying amounts of Ca2+ were added to the reaction mixture, and the free Ca2+ was determined using arsenazo III, a Ca2+-sensitive dye (18Michaylova V. Ilkova P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1971; 53: 194-198Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar), in reconstituted reaction mixtures. Control assays were performed using 30 μg of protein from lysed bacteria harboring the pBluescript SK(−) plasmid without a PLD cDNA insert. The background activity from bacteria was very low (5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and was subtracted from the activity of the samples containing the recombinant PLDs.Figure 4Ca2+ concentration dependence of PLDγ, -β, and -α. The activities of PLDα, -β, and -γ were measured in response to various free Ca2+concentrations and in 0.4 mm vesicles composed of PC/PE/PIP2 (5:87.5:7.5 mol%) without SDS. Varying amounts of CaCl2 were added to reconstituted reaction mixtures, and the free Ca2+ was determined colorimetrically using arsenazo III.

Values are means ± S.E. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PIP2-independent PLD assay (see Fig. 3, B and C) used a reaction mixture of 100 mm MES (pH 6.5), 0.5 mm SDS, 1% (v/v) ethanol, 30 μg of protein, and 0.4 mm PC (egg yolk) containing dipalmitoylglycero-3-phospho[methyl-3H]choline. CaCl2 was added to reactions as noted below. The substrate preparation, reaction conditions, and separation of products were performed as described previously (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of [3H]choline into the aqueous phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. Control assays used 30 μg of protein from lysed bacteria harboring the pBluescript SK(−) plasmid without a PLD cDNA insert. The background PLD activity was negligible (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subtracted from the activity of the samples containing the recombinant PLDs. Genomic DNA was isolated from Arabidopsis leaves and digested with different restriction enzymes. Full-length cDNAs of PLDα, -β, and -γ were used as probes to hybridize the digested DNA at 65 °C under the previously described conditions (3Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLDα-deficient plants were generated by introducing a PLDα antisense cDNA toArabidopsis (12Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes were obtained from leaves of the PLDα antisense gene-suppressed and wild-type plants and then extracted with 0.44 m KCl following a described method (12Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that most of the PIP2-dependent PLD activity from the antisense plants was recovered in the salt extract (12Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The salt-extracted PLD was assayed in the presence of varying concentrations of neomycin. An Arabidopsis expression sequence-tagged cDNA was identified as a putative, new PLD cDNA by searching the GenBank™ Data Bank against the plant PLD cDNAs. This cDNA, ∼1 kilobase in length, was used as a probe to screen a ZAPIIArabidopsis cDNA library constructed using 3–6-kilobase mRNA from hypocotyls of 3-day-old seedlings (15Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). A full-length PLD cDNA, designated PLDγ, was identified and sequenced from both strands. The PLDγ cDNA is composed of 3234 nucleotides, with the longest open reading frame from nucleotides 312 to 2876, and imparts a deduced protein sequence of 855 amino acids (Fig.1). The PLDγ polypeptide has a calculated molecular mass of 95,462 Da and a pI of 6.9. The previously cloned PLDα from Arabidopsis consists of 809 amino acids with a pI of 6.0, and PLDβ has 968 amino acids and a pI of 7.9. The amino acid and nucleotide sequences of PLDγ are more closely related to PLDβ than to PLDα from Arabidopsis. PLDγ has a 66% amino acid identity to PLDβ and an overall similarity of 81%. In contrast, PLDγ displays only 41% identity and 60% overall similarity to PLDα from Arabidopsis. The C-terminal regions of the three PLDs share a higher degree of amino acid sequence similarities than their N-terminal residues. Phylogenetic alignments of PLD sequences from various sources show that PLDγ and -β form a cluster that is divergent from PLDα cloned fromArabidopsis, castor bean, rice, and maize. PLDα from different plant species shares ∼75–90% amino acid sequence identity. PLDγ and -β are more closely related than PLDα to the PLDs cloned from human and yeast. Sequence analysis indicates that PLDγ, -β, and -α share some common structural motifs and differ in others (Fig. 1). PLDγ possesses a myristoylation consensus sequence (19Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), MGXXXS, that is not present in PLDα or -β. PLDγ contains a Ca2+/phospholipid-binding C2 domain near its N terminus, and this domain is conserved in all cloned plant PLDs, but not in yeast and human PLDs. C2 domains have been identified in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction and membrane trafficking and are important in Ca2+-regulated binding to phospholipids (10Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding is coordinated by four to five amino acid residues provided by bipartite loops within the C2 domain (21Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Essen L. Perisic O. Cheung R. Kata M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PLDγ, like PLDβ, conserves all of the calcium-coordinating acidic amino acids, whereas two of the acidic residues in the C2 domain of PLDα are substituted by either positively charged or neutral amino acids, indicating a loss of affinity for Ca2+ in PLDα. Like all PLDs cloned from plants, yeast, and human, PLDγ possesses two HXKXXXXD motifs (Fig. 1). It has been hypothesized that the conserved histidine, lysine, and aspartate residues form a catalytic triad responsible for the formation or hydrolysis of phosphoester bonds (11Ponting C.P. Kerr I.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). PLDγ and the previously cloned PLDβ are activated by polyphosphoinositides (Ref. 5Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and results below). A motif rich in basic amino acids ((K/R)(X)XXXKX(K/R)(K/R)) has been found to be responsible for polyphosphoinositide binding in proteins such as the actin-severing proteins gelsolin and villin and phospholipase C (23Janmey P.A. Lamb J. Allen P.G. Matsudaira P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11818-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Yu F.-X. Sun H.-Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Marcu M.G. Rodrı́guez Del Castillo A. Vitale M.L. Trifaró J.-M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 141: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This motif (RXXXXKXRR) and an inverted sequence (RKXRXXXXR) are present in PLDβ near the catalytic domain of the C terminus. Three of these four consensus basic residues are conserved in PLDγ, whereas PLDα shows the least conservation of amino acids, some of which are replaced by acidic residues (Fig. 1). PLDγ is encoded by a gene distinct from those of PLDα and -β because hybridization of the digested Arabidopsis genomic DNA with the three different PLD probes yielded unique banding patterns (Fig.2). The PLDγ cDNA has oneXbaI site and no site for KpnI, XhoI, and BamHI. One hybridization band was observed in theKpnI-, XhoI-, and BamHI-digested DNAs, whereas three bands were present in the XbaI-cut DNA (Fig.2). The greater than predicted number of bands in the XbaI digestion could be caused by the presence of this restriction site in the intron sequences of the PLDγ gene and/or by the presence of another PLDγ or closely related gene. To verify that the cloned cDNA encodes a PLD, protein from this cDNA was produced in E. coli using pBluescript SK as an expression vector. After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, a unique immunoreactive band from bacterial extracts was recognized by antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide of the deduced PLDγ amino acid sequence (data not shown). The expressed protein hydrolyzed PC in the presence of PE, PIP2, and μmCa2+ (Fig. 3 A). PLDγ displayed the transphosphatidylation activity that is the signature of PLD enzymes (data not shown). In contrast, PLDγ exhibited no PC hydrolytic activity when tested under a condition widely employed to assay the conventional plant PLD activity (Fig.3 B), which is now known to be PLDα (12Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This assay used PC-only vesicles, 25 mm Ca2+, and 0.5 mm SDS. This property of PLDγ was shared by PLDβ (Fig.3 B). On the other hand, PLDα was active under such conditions (Fig. 3 B). When these PLDs were assayed in the presence of 50 μm Ca2+, SDS, and PC vesicles, none of them was active (Fig. 3 C). This result indicated that the lack of PLDβ and -γ activities in the conventional PLD assay was not due to inhibition by mm Ca2+. On the other hand, the lack of PLDα activity at 50 μmCa2+ was due to its requirement for higher Ca2+concentrations (Fig. 4). To compare the effect of Ca2+ on different PLDs, PLDγ, -β, and -α activities were measured in the presence of varying amounts of Ca2+. Compared with PLDβ and -α, PLDγ displayed an ∼2-fold higher basal activity in the absence of Ca2+, and it showed the smallest activation in response to Ca2+ (Fig.4). PLDγ activity peaked at four times its basal level as Ca2+ was increased to ∼50 μm. As Ca2+ concentrations increased above 50 μm, PLDγ activity decreased and showed a near complete inhibition at 20 mm Ca2+. PLDβ exhibited an optimal activation over a broader range of Ca2+ concentrations than PLDγ, and its activity at 50 μm Ca2+ was ∼10-fold higher than its basal activity. In addition, PLDβ activity was not as completely inhibited by mm levels of Ca2+. PLDα, in striking contrast to PLDγ and -β, displayed little activity at μm Ca2+ concentrations, but showed a marked increase in activity as Ca2+ concentrations increased to the mm range. The present Ca2+ dependence study used an unbuffered system in which the free Ca2+ was determined using the Ca2+-sensitive dye arsenazo III in reconstituted reaction mixtures. In this system, the Ca2+ optimum of PLDβ (50 μm) was higher than that (0.5–1 μm) repo"
https://openalex.org/W2124367646,"Palmitoylation of the α subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein G z inhibited by more than 90 percent its response to the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)–accelerating activity of G z GAP, a G z -selective member of the regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Palmitoylation both decreased the affinity of G z GAP for the GTP-bound form of Gα z by at least 90 percent and decreased the maximum rate of GTP hydrolysis. Inhibition was reversed by removal of the palmitoyl group by dithiothreitol. Palmitoylation of Gα z also inhibited its response to the GAP activity of Gα-interacting protein (GAIP), another RGS protein, and palmitoylation of Gα i1 inhibited its response to RGS4. The extent of inhibition of G z GAP, GAIP, RGS4, and RGS10 correlated roughly with their intrinsic GAP activities for the Gα target used in the assay. Reversible palmitoylation is thus a major determinant of G z deactivation after its stimulation by receptors, and may be a general mechanism for prolonging or potentiating G-protein signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2053060651,"We have employed suspension cultured aequorin-transformed tobacco cells to examine the involvement of Ca2+ in signal transduction of the oxidative burst. Use of cultured cells for this purpose was validated by demonstrating that the cells responded to cold shock quantitatively and qualitatively similarly to the intact transgenic plants from which they were derived. Stimulation of the oxidative burst in the cell suspension was achieved by administration of oligogalacturonic acid, Mas-7 (a peptide known to activate G proteins and Ca2+ fluxes), hypo-osmotic stress, or harpin (a protein from the pathogenic bacterium Erwinia amylovora). The latter failed to promote any detectable increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, whereas each of the former three triggered a rapid rise in cytosolic Ca2+followed by a return within seconds to basal Ca2+ levels. Peak Ca2+ concentrations induced by the former three elicitors were ∼0.7, 1.4, and 1.3 μm, respectively. Three lines of evidence suggest that the observed Ca2+pulses are essential to transduction of the oxidative burst signals by their respective elicitors: (i) inhibition of the Ca2+transients with Ca2+ chelators or Ca2+ channel blockers prevented expression of the oxidative burst, (ii) introduction of exogenous Ca2+ into the same cells initiated the burst even in the absence of other inducers of the response, and (iii) the observed Ca2+ transients often returned to near basal levels well before any H2O2 synthesis could be detected, suggesting that the Ca2+ influx is required to communicate the burst signal but not maintain the defense response.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) can also induce biosynthesis of reactive oxygen species in plant cells. Because of its rapid expression, ease of assay, and similarity to the analogous defense response in human neutrophils (21.Low, P. S., Dwyer, S. C., Proceedings of 1994 Korean Botanical Society Symposium on Plant Science, 1994, 75, 87, Ewha Woman's University, Seoul, Korea.Google Scholar), the oxidative burst has recently served as a model for exploring signal transduction pathways in plants. As the numbers of elicitors examined have risen, it has become increasingly clear that different elicitors may inaugurate independent signal transduction pathways that employ distinct sets of second messengers (1Low P.S. Merida J.R. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 96: 533-542Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 22Low P.S. Schroeder A.T Stacey G. Keen N. Plant-Microbe Interactions. Chapman and Hall, New York1997Google Scholar). Indeed, the pathway initiated by oligouronides appears to require participation of phospholipase C but not phospholipase A (12Chandra S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23Legendre L. Yueh Y.G. Crain R.C. Haddock N. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24559-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the pathway triggered by an elicitor from Verticillium dahliae requires exactly the converse (12Chandra S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although all of the independent signaling pathways are believed to converge with the assembly of an oxidase complex on the plasma membrane (24Desikan R. Hancock J.T. Coffey M.J. Neill S.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 25Dwyer S.C. Legendre L. Low P.S. Leto T.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Ca2+ is already believed to serve as a second messenger in such important plant processes as stomatal closure (27McAinsh M.R. Browniee C. Hetherington A.M.

Cell. 1994; 77: 73-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, its accurate quantitation during cellular signaling events has until recently proven very difficult. Thus, 45Ca2+binds avidly to cell walls, often masking the small changes in cytoplasmic 45Ca2+ that could indicate its function as a second messenger (36Demarty M. Morvan C. Thellier M. Plant Cell Environ. 1984; 7: 441-448Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Further, signal transduction pathways that might trigger release of Ca2+ from intracellular organelles are largely invisible to45Ca2+-based methodologies, because no net change in cellular 45Ca2+ content occurs. Although Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dyes have yielded useful information in a few plant systems (37Bush D.S. Jones R.L. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), their general resistance to entry into plant cells has greatly limited their application (37Bush D.S. Jones R.L. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, most membrane-permeant esters of Ca2+-dependent fluorophores hydrolyze to their impermeant forms in the cell wall, preventing their penetration to their intracellular destinations. Fortunately in 1991, Knight et al. (38Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) transformed tobacco plants with a Ca2+-sensitive luminescent protein, termed aequorin, and demonstrated that resting levels of Ca2+ were insufficient to induce photon emission but that stimulus-induced Ca2+increases generated readily measurable levels of bioluminescence. Since this initial discovery, aequorin-transformed plants have been exploited to quantitate intracellular Ca2+ fluxes accompanying such diverse processes/stimuli as direct mechanical perturbation (34Haley A. Russell A.J. Wood N. Allan A.C. Knight M. Cambell A.K. Trewavas A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4124-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Knight M.R. Campbell A.K.

Science. 1995; 269: 1863-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Because the aequorin protein is expressed in the plant cell cytoplasm and because the intensity of light emitted by aequorin is directly proportional to Ca2+ concentration, measurement of aequorin-derived bioluminescence enables direct quantitation of Ca2+ transients in the transformed cytoplasm of the cell. In this report, we have employed suspension cultures of aequorin-transformed tobacco plants to monitor Ca2+transients during elicitation of the oxidative burst. We report here that several but not all elicitors of the oxidative burst induce a rapid and quantifiable influx of Ca2+ and that this Ca2+ is required for expression of the subsequent reactive oxygen species. BAPTA-AM and ionomycin were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), whereas ruthenium red was purchased from Sigma. Coelenterazine was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were reagent grade or of higher purity and were obtained from major chemical suppliers. An OGA 1The abbreviation used is: OGA, oligogalacturonic acid. fraction that elicits the oxidative burst in all plant species tested to date was prepared as described previously (13Legendre L. Rueter S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The OGA preparation used in these studies contained 0.5 mg/ml galacturonic equivalents as determined by the method of Blumenkrantz and Asboe-Hansen (41Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar). Harpin, a potent inducer of both the oxidative burst (11Baker C.J. Orlandi E.W. Mock N.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Chandra S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and the hypersensitive response (42Wei A. Laby R.J. Zumoff C.H. Bauer D.W. He S.Y. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Science. 1992; 257: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), was a kind gift of Dr. Steven Beer (Cornell University). Mas-7, an active analog of mastoparan, and Mas-17, its inactive counterpart, were purchased from Calbiochem. Generation of aequorin-transformed tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginofolia) plants has been previously described (38Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 43Knight H. Knight M.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 49: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transgenic seeds from an F3 generation were a generous gift from Dr. Anthony J. Trewavas (University of Edinburgh). The seeds were sprouted on wet filter paper, and the seedlings were potted in soil. Leaves from these plants were surface sterilized using a solution of 8% calcium hypochlorite and 0.1% Tween 20 and transferred to W-38 agar to promote callus formation, as described previously (18Chandra S. Martin G.B. Low P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13393-13397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The calli were fragmented, transferred to liquid W-38 medium, and maintained in suspension by continuous shaking. The resulting suspension cultures were expanded by transferring 3 ml of culture to 25 ml of fresh media every 10 days. Except where noted in Fig. 4, all cell suspensions were studied between 16 and 30 h after transfer to fresh media, when the cells responded maximally to elicitor stimulation but displayed no activated characteristics in the absence of elicitation. In vivoreconstitution of aequorin was carried out by adding 25 μl of coelenterazine (5 μm final concentration) in ethanol to 3 ml of suspension cultured cells (≈24 h old) and incubating overnight at 22 °C in the dark. Control cells were treated similarly with an equivalent volume of ethanol alone. Luminescence measurements were made using a digital luminometer (LKB BioOrbit model 1250, Gaithersburg, MD). The luminometer was calibrated by setting the background counts to zero and a 0.26 μCi of 14C internal standard to 10 mV. Coelenterazine-treated cultures (0.5 ml) were transferred to a luminometer cuvette and maintained in suspension by mild stirring. Luminescence was measured every 0.1 s for the duration of the experiment. All inhibitors and chelators were added at the start of stirring, whereas elicitors were added at the times indicated in the figures. At the end of the experiment, all of the unconsumed aequorin was discharged by injecting 250 μl of a solution of 10% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm CaCl2 into the luminometer cuvette to determine the total light output. The kinetic profile of intracellular Ca2+ concentration was obtained by transforming data of each luminescence curve using the equation described by Allen et al. (44Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1976; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar), [Ca2+] = {(L/L max)13 + [118(L/L max)13] − 1}/{7 × 106 − [7 × 106(L/L max)13]}. To determine the calcium concentration at each time point, a computer program was written to calculate L, the light intensity at time intervals of 0.1 s. L is obtained by integrating the luminometer output (mV) over these 0.1-s intervals. The sum of allL values is defined as L total (the total area under the curve). The sum of all L values fromt = 0 to any given time point isL cumulative and represents the aequorin that has already been discharged. L max is defined asL total − L cumulative at each time point, and L max represents the residual aequorin yet to be discharged.L max is not a constant but decreases steadily as aequorin is consumed during the experiment. Using the parametersL and L max, we calculated the Ca2+ concentration corresponding to each time point in the luminescence curves. The figures present the raw computer transformations of the digitized luminescence data without any smoothing or noise reduction. H2O2 production in aequorin-transformed cells was monitored spectrofluorimeterically, as described earlier (13Legendre L. Rueter S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 45Apostol I. Low P.S. Heinstein P. Stipanovic R.D. Waltman D.W. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of cultured tobacco cells were transferred to a gently stirred fluorimeter cuvette and treated with 7 μl of pyranine (8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt; 0.2 mg/ml). Desired elicitors and inhibitors were added at the start of stirring. Loss of fluorescence due to peroxidase-dependent quenching of the dye pyranine (λex at 405 nm, λem at 512 nm) was continuously monitored. Incubation of cells with coelenterazine had no effect on either the oxidative burst or peroxidase activity. To study the role of Ca2+ in signaling the oxidative burst, we generated suspension cultures from tobacco plants expressing the aequorin transgene, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, before undertaking to measure elicitor-stimulated Ca2+transients, it was necessary to document that the suspension cultures behaved similarly to the transgenic plants from which they were derived. Three comparisons were undertaken to establish this similarity. First, earlier studies using seedlings from the transgenic tobacco plants established that cold shock is accompanied by a flux of cytoplasmic Ca2+ that has a characteristic signature,i.e. a sharp rise that returns to basal levels within a minute (38Knight M.R. Campbell A.K. Smith S.M. Trewavas A.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.1 A, rapidly lowering the temperature of the suspension cultures (from 23 to 16 °C) also induces a large increase in aequorin luminescence with an overall profile that is remarkably similar to that described for whole plants. Second, because the Ca2+ transient in the seedlings could be partially inhibited by soaking the seedlings in millimolar concentrations of either La+3 or EGTA (46Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), we next examined the sensitivity of our suspension cultures to the same reagents. As also shown in Fig. 1 A, both La+3and EGTA blocked most of the cold shock-induced increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Third, a crude proportionality was previously observed in the transgenic seedlings between the magnitude of the temperature decrease and the amplitude of the Ca2+pulse. Using the transgenic cell cultures, we observed an analogous proportionality, wherein the intensity of the luminescence spike increased with the magnitude of the temperature drop (data not shown). Together these data argue that the transgenic tobacco cell suspension cultures constitute a reasonable model of the transgenic plant. Because the relationship between luminescence and Ca2+ concentration is double logarithmic, presenting data simply as a change in luminescence can greatly exaggerate the extent of any change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Therefore, we wrote a computer program to convert the observed luminescence signal directly into intracellular Ca2+ concentration using the equation described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 B presents the transformation of the data presented in Fig.1 A. This transformation reveals that in response to cold shock, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration peaks at around 2.7 μm, a value in the range observed for whole plants. Furthermore, addition of La3+ and EGTA reduced the peak Ca2+ level to less than 1 μm, once again comparable with the results obtained by Knight et al.(46Knight H. Trewavas A.J. Knight M.R. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). With the ability to characterize the kinetics and magnitude of Ca2+ fluxes in cultured tobacco cells established, it was of interest to examine whether an intracellular Ca2+pulse might participate in an elicitor-induced oxidative burst. We focused our investigation on the elicitors OGA, Mas-7, hypo-osmotic shock, and harpin primarily because of our previous experience with these elicitors. Specifically OGA, a component of the plant cell wall thought to be released during pathogen attack or wounding, was selected because it rapidly induces activation of phospholipase C (23Legendre L. Yueh Y.G. Crain R.C. Haddock N. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24559-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, presumably, release of intracellular Ca2+ through the action of inositol trisphosphate. Mas-7, an activator of heterotrimeric G proteins, was also chosen because it similarly stimulates the oxidative burst via activation of phospholipase C (23Legendre L. Yueh Y.G. Crain R.C. Haddock N. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24559-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypo-osmotic shock, a novel inducer of the burst (17Yahraus T. Chandra S. Legendre L. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), was selected primarily because it is known to trigger oxidant production via some type of mechanosensor (17Yahraus T. Chandra S. Legendre L. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), i.e. a pathway commonly inaugurated by Ca2+ channels (47Ding J.P. Pickard B.G. Plant J. 1993; 3: 83-110Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, harpin, a heat stable protein from the bacteria E. amylovora was chosen, because it induces the oxidative burst (11Baker C.J. Orlandi E.W. Mock N.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1341-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 12Chandra S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and may promote the hypersensitive response (42Wei A. Laby R.J. Zumoff C.H. Bauer D.W. He S.Y. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Science. 1992; 257: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 48Glazener J.A. Orlandi E.W. Baker C.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in tobacco. Importantly, in addition to serving as potent inducers of the oxidative burst, all of the above elicitors are available in relatively pure form, confirming that any Ca2+transients observed will have been induced by the same component in the preparation that is responsible for stimulating the oxidative burst. The impact of elicitors on intracellular Ca2+ levels was evaluated by mixing the elicitors with reconstituted aequorin cells and monitoring the increase in aequorin luminescence. As seen in Fig.2 A, OGA induces an influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm that begins immediately following OGA addition and ends within 20 s of its initiation. The peak Ca2+ concentration achieved in the experiment displayed here was 0.67 μm; however, this value varied from 0.28 to 0.9 μm, depending on the responsiveness of the particular flask of cells employed. Mas-7 also induces a rapid increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+, although the magnitude (1.4 μm) and duration of the pulse are much larger than observed with OGA (Fig. 2). Mas-17, an inactive analog of Mas-7, has little effect on aequorin luminescence, confirming that the Mas-7 effect is indeed specific. Osmotic shock, unlike the other elicitors, triggers two contiguous phases of Ca2+ release that last for a total of ∼4–5 min (Fig. 2). The peak Ca2+concentration is 1.34 ± 0.39 μm for the first pulse and 1.44 ± 0.12 μm for the second (n = 5). Interestingly, harpin, even at concentrations sufficient to induce both the burst and the hypersensitive response does not cause an increase in aequorin luminescence, even when the luminescence measurements are extended to 40 min following stimulation. Because the signal to noise ratio in these studies is greater than 50:1 (actual data are shown without any noise reduction), it can be concluded that Ca2+ is not necessary for transduction of the harpin-stimulated oxidative burst. Using untreated cells from the same flasks, we simultaneously monitored the oxidative burst initiated by the above elicitors using a fluorimeteric assay. Although the oxidative burst patterns for these elicitors have been previously published (12Chandra S. Heinstein P.F. Low P.S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), they are presented here to allow a direct comparison of the kinetics of the Ca2+pulse with the kinetics of oxidant production by the same cells. Fig.2 B shows that the different elicitors, including harpin, induce bursts characterized by different lag periods following elicitor addition and by different rates of H2O2production. Nevertheless, in all cases where a Ca2+transient is observed (Fig. 2 A), the Ca2+ influx precedes the biosynthesis of H2O2 (Fig.2 B). In fact, for each of the three Ca2+-mediated pathways, the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ is seen to return to its unstimulated level before production of the oxidative species terminates. Importantly, this rapid expulsion of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm cannot be an artifact of aequorin depletion, because cell permeabilization at the end of each experiment demonstrated that only a small fraction of the intracellular aequorin had been consumed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Further, the Ca2+ influx cannot be dependent on oxidant production, because addition of sufficient catalase to eliminate any detectable H2O2 had no effect on the Ca2+ influx (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the Ca2+ pulses associated with elicitor stimulation exhibit the properties of a true second messenger in that they precede initiation of the biological response but are not required to maintain it, nor do they depend on it. The observation that harpin can induce a burst without participation of Ca2+ as a second messenger raises the question of whether the Ca2+ influx stimulated by the other three elicitors is an epiphenomenon or an essential step in signaling their oxidative bursts. To investigate this issue, we decided to block the influx of Ca2+ induced by OGA, Mas-7, and osmotic shock, and then monitor the effect on H2O2 biosynthesis. As shown in Fig. 3,A–F, incubation of cells with ruthenium red, a Ca2+ channel inhibitor known to be active in plant cells (49Allen G.J. Muir S.R. Sanders D. Science. 1995; 268: 735-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), eliminates most of the elicitor-evoked Ca2+ flux as well as most of the oxidative burst for all three elicitors. Furthermore, t"
https://openalex.org/W2007727729,"The Rho-like GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and Rho play key roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and are implicated in transcriptional activation and cell transformation. We have previously identified the invasion-inducing Tiam1 gene, which encodes an activator of Rac. In fibroblasts, Tiam1 induces Rac-mediated membrane ruffling, which requires the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PHn) domain. Here we show that this PHn domain is part of a protein interaction domain, which mediates membrane localization of Tiam1. After subcellular fractionation, up to 50% of Tiam1 is recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble high speed pellet that contains small protein complexes. The regions in Tiam1 that are responsible for these protein interactions comprise the PHn domain, an adjacent putative coiled coil region (CC), and an additional flanking region (Ex). Deletions in each of these regions abolish membrane localization of Tiam1 and membrane ruffling, suggesting that they function cooperatively. Indeed, only polypeptides encompassing the PHn-CC-Ex region, and not the PHn-CC or the Ex region, localize at the membrane. These results indicate that the N-terminal PH domain is part of a larger functional Tiam1 domain that mediates protein complex formation and membrane localization of Tiam1. The Rho-like GTPases Cdc42, Rac, and Rho play key roles in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and are implicated in transcriptional activation and cell transformation. We have previously identified the invasion-inducing Tiam1 gene, which encodes an activator of Rac. In fibroblasts, Tiam1 induces Rac-mediated membrane ruffling, which requires the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PHn) domain. Here we show that this PHn domain is part of a protein interaction domain, which mediates membrane localization of Tiam1. After subcellular fractionation, up to 50% of Tiam1 is recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble high speed pellet that contains small protein complexes. The regions in Tiam1 that are responsible for these protein interactions comprise the PHn domain, an adjacent putative coiled coil region (CC), and an additional flanking region (Ex). Deletions in each of these regions abolish membrane localization of Tiam1 and membrane ruffling, suggesting that they function cooperatively. Indeed, only polypeptides encompassing the PHn-CC-Ex region, and not the PHn-CC or the Ex region, localize at the membrane. These results indicate that the N-terminal PH domain is part of a larger functional Tiam1 domain that mediates protein complex formation and membrane localization of Tiam1.

The precise binding properties of PH domains in vivo are largely unknown, but in vitro studies indicate that PH domains can bind to specific phosphoinositol lipids as well as to βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (3Shaw G.

Many PH domains show in vitro a rather promiscuous interaction with phospholipids and βγ subunits, which raises the question how specificity is achieved in vivo.A large group of proteins containing a PH domain is formed by regulators of Ras- and Rho-like small GTPases. Ras-like proteins primarily regulate growth and differentiation (8Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Rho-like proteins, including RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42, regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton which plays an important role in adhesion and motility of cells (9Hall A. Annu. Rev.

Small GTPases are activated by the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, which is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs that activate Rho-like GTPases invariably contain a PH domain C-terminally adjacent to the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain (see Refs. 18Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T.

Indeed, deletions in either the DH domain or the flanking PH domain of the proto-oncogenes Dbl, Ost, Dbs and Lfc resulted in loss of transforming capacity (20Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Zuydgeest D. Kammen van der R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tiam1 encodes a GEF that activates the Rho-like GTPase Rac in vitro as well as in vivo (22Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. Kammen van der R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We recently showed that Tiam1 induces Rac-mediated membrane ruffling and stimulation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity but only when Tiam1 is associated with the plasma membrane (23Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. Kammen van der R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The Tiam1 protein is myristoylated at the N terminus and contains various conserved domains implicated in membrane localization. In addition to the DH-PH combination, Tiam1 contains a second, N-terminally located PH domain and a discs large homology region (DHR), also named PDZ domain. DHRs have been implicated in the intracellular localization of proteins, especially by binding to membrane protein networks (24Ponting C.P. Phillips C. Trends Biochem.

By deletion analysis we found that only the N-terminal PH domain (PHn) is required for the membrane localization of Tiam1 in fibroblasts. This domain could be functionally replaced by the membrane localization domain of c-Src (23Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. Kammen van der R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).In this study we show that, in addition to the PHn domain, sequences downstream of the PHn also are involved in proper function and membrane localization of Tiam1. We have identified a protein interaction domain in Tiam1 that encompasses the PHn domain, a C-terminally flanking putative coiled coil region (CC) and an additional adjacent region (Ex). This complete region (PHn-CC-Ex) is required for translocation of Tiam1 to the plasma membrane. Moreover, co-expression of the isolated PHn-CC-Ex domain with Tiam1 inhibits induction of membrane ruffling in COS-7 cells, whereas the PHn-CC domain alone does not. Our data indicate that the PHn-CC region and the adjacent Ex region both constitute protein interaction domains, which together determine the membrane localization and biological activity of Tiam1.

This can be explained by their possession of a common protein motif that interacts with a binding site on protein phosphatase-1. The existence of such a motif was established by the panning of a random peptide library in which peptide sequences are displayed on the Escherichia colibacterial flagellin protein for bacteria that bound to protein phosphatase-1. There were 79 isolates containing 46 unique sequences with the conserved motif VXF or VXW, whereX was most frequently His or Arg. In addition, this sequence was commonly preceded by 2–5 basic residues and followed by 1 acidic residue. This study demonstrates that binding to protein phosphatase-1 can be conferred to a protein by the presentation of a peptide motif on a surface loop.

In yeast, over a dozen genes that encode PP1-binding proteins have been identified, based largely on the use of a two-hybrid screen. These include genes that are variously required for control of glycogen metabolism, glucose repression, meiosis and/or sporulation, and mitotic cell cycle regulation (19Ohkura H. Kinoshita N.

Thus, PP1 is unusual in that this single enzyme is involved in the regulation of a number of diverse cellular processes.Few, if any, of the PP1 proteins share any major sequence identity, although examination of different glycogen-binding subunits has revealed the presence of two small regions of sequence similarity that is shared between several glycogen-binding proteins (20Tu J.

The unusually large number of PP1-binding proteins that have been described suggests either that PP1 contains a motif that is recognized by a common binding structure on this diverse group of proteins or that the latter contain a protein motif that is recognized by a single binding site on PP1. To test the latter possibility, we have used a panning technique to isolate PP1-binding peptides using a random peptide display library and found that there is a consensus binding motif for PP1.RESULTSThe FliTrx library displays random dodecapeptides flanked by the sequences CPG and GPC at their N and C termini, respectively, and has a diversity of 1.77 × 108 individual peptides. The peptides are inserted into the active-site loop of thioredoxin, which is itself fused into the major flagellin protein of E. coli. The peptides are thus displayed on the flagella. Six rounds of panning on Petri dishes to which PP1 was adsorbed were performed (see “Experimental Procedures”), after which the plasmids from individual E. coli isolates were isolated and analyzed. To confirm that these isolates were indeed binding to PP1, they were examined for the expression of thioredoxin-flagellin fusion proteins that would bind to PP1. This was done by SDS-PAGE of the E. coli proteins and transfer to nitrocellulose, after which PP1 binding was determined using digoxigenin-conjugated PP1. A typical set of results are shown in Fig. 1. Of 13 isolates examined, it can be seen that there are 10 positives for a protein of 68 kDa. This is consistent with the expected size of the fusion protein since E. coli thioredoxin has a molecular mass of ∼12 kDa (31Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and E. coli flagellin has a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa (32Kondoh H. Hotani H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 117-139Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar).DNA sequence analysis of the encoded peptides from a total of 104 isolates was performed. Seventy-nine of these isolates harbored peptide sequences that could be aligned as shown in TableI. These represent 46 unique sequences that share the common motif VX(F/W). Twenty-three of the sequences fell in the VXF family (Table I, series A–C), with the most frequent of the motifs being VRF (series A1–A16). Nineteen of the sequences fell in the VXW family (series D—F), of which 13 were VHW. Four other peptides (series G) were not as well conserved. In the VXF series, X was also found as His, Ser, Thr, and Lys, whereas in the VXW series,X was also found as Arg, Thr, Ser, Met, and Ala. Both the VXF and VXW series were generally preceded by 2–5 basic residues and most commonly by 2 basic residues immediately preceding the conserved valine. The residue immediately N-terminal to the conserved valine was frequently Arg or Lys, although Gln and His were also well represented. On the C-terminal side of the VX(F/W) motif, it was also evident that an acidic residue was present in 1 of the next 2 residues. Thus, the consensus motif that emerges is (R/K)(R/K)X 0–2V(R/H)(F/W)X(D/E). The frequency of amino acids at various positions is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 2. These findings demonstrate the existence of a peptide binding motif for PP1.Table IAlignment of peptide sequences that bind to PP1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Shown is an alignment of 79 peptide sequences that were obtained by analysis of the pFliTrx plasmids obtained after six rounds of panning against immobilized PP1 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The peptide sequence derived from the NIPP sequence (11Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which contains the motif RVTFSE, and a scrambled sequence of the same amino acids were tested for the ability to inhibit phosphorylase phosphatase activity. The NIPP peptide was inhibitory, with an IC50 of ∼3 μm (Fig.3). That this inhibition is specific is supported by the failure of the scrambled sequence to inhibit PP1 activity at concentrations up to 10 μm. Above this value, the scrambled NIPP peptide was inhibitory, with an IC50 of 100 μm. We also tested a peptide (Table I, A1) that harbors the VRF motif. This peptide was inhibitory, with an IC50 of ∼10 μm. This is consistent with the finding that a N-terminal peptide (residues 349–430) of the splicing factor PSF, which harbors an RVRF motif, is inhibitory to PP1 (15Hirano K. Erdodi F. Patton J.G. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two peptides (Table I, D1 and D2) containing the most frequently encountered VHW motif were not inhibitory at low concentrations and behaved in a similar way to the scrambled NIPP peptide in that inhibition was observed at high concentrations. Because of the basic nature of these peptides, it is possible that this inhibition is similar to the inhibition of phosphorylase phosphatase activity by polyamines, which has previously been shown to be likely a substrate-directed effect (33Killilea S.D.

Commun. 1978; 81: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Figure 3Inhibition of PP1 by synthetic peptides.Peptides corresponding to the NIPP sequence RPKRKRKNSRVTFSEDDE (residues 191–208) (13Chun Y.S.

LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), which itself is fused into a nonessential domain of the bacterial flagellin protein (28Lu Z. Murray K.S. Van Cleave V. LaVallie E.R. Stahl M.L. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 266-373Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that a short peptide sequence containing the general motif VXF or VXW preceded by 1 or more basic residues is sufficient to generate a capacity for the fusion proteins to bind to PP1. These results strongly support the thesis that the binding of proteins to PP1 can be specified by presentation of this binding motif. During the course of this work, the crystal structure of PP1δ in a complex with a peptide corresponding to the region on the muscle glycogen-binding subunit, GM, that had previously been implicated in binding to PP1 was determined (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reveals that the sequence RRVSFA of GM binds in an extended conformation to a hydrophobic groove, adjacent to a region of acidic residues that accommodates the N-terminal basic residues. This site is located on a side of PP1 that is nearly opposite to the active site and is thus ideally situated as a site for the binding of targeting subunits. Taken together with our findings that binding to this region can be specified by a relatively short consensus peptide sequence, there is now a strong structural basis for the concept that PP1 contains a site that recognizes a novel peptide motif that can confer PP1-binding ability to a given protein.An examination of the coding regions of a number of yeast genes as well as the sequences of mammalian PP1-binding proteins for the presence of the binding motif is shown in Table II. Table II includes sequences encoded by the yeast genesGAC1, REG1, REG2,SCD5, GIP1, SHP1, and GIP2 and several yeast open reading frames, most of which were identified by a two-hybrid screen (20Tu J.

With one exception, these all exhibit the VXF motif, and only one occurrence of the VXW sequence was found. Both inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 contain sequences at their N termini (KIQF) that are similar to the RVXF motif and that are required for inhibition of PP1 (35Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F.

Interestingly, the results of the random peptide screen did not yield any substitution of Val for Ile. It should also be noted that there are several sequences that fit the consensus in GIP2, SCD5, and YFL023W (Table II), but that are inconsistent with the results of the two-hybrid screen in that the fusions are ones in which these sequences are deleted. Clearly, identification of any of these sequences as a PP1-binding motif needs to be experimentally confirmed by mutagenesis studies.Table IISequences corresponding to the VX(F/W) motif in PP1-binding proteinsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Listed below are sequences in PP1-binding proteins that contain the VX(F/W) motif (shown in boldface letters).

Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); this would eliminate residues 216–227 as a binding sequence. Similarly, SCD5 fusions were found at codons 53 and 239, eliminating sequence 26–37, and YFL023W fusions were found at codon 106, eliminating sequence 31–42 (20Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as candidates for PP1 binding.2-d Both the PTG and human GM glycogen-binding sequences have two sequences that could fit the consensus. The more C-terminal of the two falls in a region of sequence similarity between the glycogen-binding proteins and glucoamylase, and it is a putative carbohydrate-binding sequence (20Tu J. Song W. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4199-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Wu et al. (25Wu J. Kleiner U. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13858-13864Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have also suggested that this region might be involved in PP1 binding. Open table in a new tab Our data indicate that binding of the peptides containing the NIPP sequence and a peptide containing a VRF motif was inhibitory in the micromolar range. This is much weaker than the inhibition observed with several inhibitory proteins of PP1, which have IC50 values in the nanomolar range (2Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Brautigan D.L. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1994; 49: 197-214PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shenolikar S. Nairn A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 1-121PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, two other peptides containing the VHW motif were not inhibitory. The differential effects on the inhibition of phosphorylase phosphatase activity observed with the peptides are not surprising, given that the binding of the GM subunit has been shown to partially inhibit phosphorylase phosphatase activity, but to increase activity toward glycogen synthase (15Hirano K. Erdodi F. Patton J.G. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). It remains a possibility that binding of variants of the PP1-binding motif could produce differential effects on either activity or substrate specificity. In this regard, it is of interest to note that both inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 contain sequences at their N termini (KIQF) that are similar to the RVXF motif and that are required for inhibition of PP1 (35Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Endo S. Connor J.H. Forney B. Zhang L. Ingebritsen T.S. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6986-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Irrespective of whether occupancy of the VXF binding site can affect either activity or substrate specificity, there is support for a model in which a high affinity interaction with PP1 involves at least two binding sites of lower affinity, as has been suggested for inhibitor-1 and DARPP-32 (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 35Kwon Y.G. Huang H.B. Desdouits F. Girault J.A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Endo S. Connor J.H. Forney B. Zhang L. Ingebritsen T.S. Lee E.Y.C. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6986-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The analysis of putative PP1-binding proteins for motifs that could represent a binding sequence is obviously facilitated by the information provided by the availability of the family of peptides that are shown in Table I. The structural information that only a small peptide motif is involved in the interaction with the PP1 binding site (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) and the demonstration that presentation of peptides conforming to a consensus motif on a surface loop is sufficient to endow PP1 binding to the thioredoxin-flagellin fusion protein have other implications for the identification of PP1-binding proteins. The motif K(V/I)XF occurs in 10% of known sequences, so that the occurrence of the motif is very common, and the issue of whether such a sequence functions to bind PP1 may depend on its structural context (34Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Thus, caution is needed in the sole use of the yeast two-hybrid system for the identification of PP1-binding proteins, particularly since this commonly involves the ability of partial protein sequences to interact with PP1. Expression of a fusion protein with a partial sequence or even fusion of a full-length sequence may lead changes in the structural context of sequences that have the potential for PP1 binding, but that are cryptic in the native protein, such that these are now surface-accessible and functionally active in PP1 binding. The identification of putative PP1-binding proteins that are of physiological relevance by the two-hybrid system needs to be confirmed experimentally by the biochemical demonstration of binding of the native protein with PP1. For example, it was found that the PSF protein inhibited PP1 with an IC50 that is ∼30-fold higher than for a partial fragment, and it was concluded that PSF, at least in an unmodified form, was unlikely to function to inhibit PP1 in vivo (15Hirano K. Erdodi F. Patton J.G. Hartshorne D.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The same caveat holds for the use of digoxigenin-conjugated PP1 for the detection of PP1-binding proteins following SDS-PAGE. Nevertheless, it is evident that the number of mammalian PP1-binding proteins is likely to be quite large, as demonstrated by the use of immobilized microcystin affinity chromatography (37Campos M. Fadden P. Alms G. Qian Z. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28478-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Recent findings have now provided a basis for understanding the complex enzymology and regulation of PP1, which have been an enigma for half a century (1Cori G.T. Green A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 31-38Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Brautigan D.L.

Haycox G. Hardie D.G. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Second, PP1 exhibits a broad specificity that is seemingly inconsistent with its multiple regulatory functions. Third, targeting of PP1 to the molecular proximity of its substrates appears to be essential for the expression of its function. This is a critical concept, first shown for the effect of mutations of PP1 in yeast that prevent its association with the yeast glycogen-binding subunit (39Feng Z.H. Wilson S.E. Peng Z.Y.

Here we identify the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), as a repressor of insulin gene transcription in conditions of supraphysiological glucose levels. C/EBPβ is expressed in primary rat islets. Moreover, after exposure to high glucose concentrations the β-cell lines HIT-T15 and INS-1 express increased levels of C/EBPβ.

In non-β-cells C/EBPβ stimulates the activity of the rat insulin I gene promoter through the CEB box.

Chronic hyperglycemia may contribute to the pancreatic β-cell dysfunction observed in patients with type II diabetes, a phenomenon attributed to the concept of glucose toxicity (4Robertson R.P. Olson L.K. Zhang H.J. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies usingin vivo animal models and in vitro β-cell lines have demonstrated that a reduction of insulin gene transcription by glucose toxicity is associated with the loss of transactivator proteins such as IDX-1/IPF-1/STF-1 and RIPE3b1-binding protein (5Robertson R.P.

Because insulin gene transcription is both positively and negatively regulated, we sought to identify repressors that might also mediate the effects of glucose toxicity on insulin gene transcription. In this report we describe CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) as a glucose-induced repressor of insulin gene transcription. C/EBPs are a family of transcription factors that regulate genes of the acute phase response, cell growth, differentiation, and the expression of cell type-specific genes (11Vasseur-Cognet M.

The C/EBPs consist of the activators C/EBP α, β, γ, δ, and ε and the repressors CHOP, LIP, and C/EBP-30; the latter two repressors arise by alternative downstream translation of the mRNAs (17Ossipow V. Descombes P. Schibler U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8219-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The C/EBPs bind to DNA exclusively as dimers and contain a conserved C-terminal basic region-leucine zipper domain that is characterized by a DNA-contacting basic region linked to a leucine zipper dimerization motif (18Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). They bind preferentially to a consensus DNA sequence T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G) (19Akira S. Isshiki H.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The founding member of the family of C/EBP transcription factors, C/EBPα, is expressed during terminal differentiation of cells such as adipocytes (13Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and keratinocytes. C/EBPβ is abundant in liver, is expressed in response to stress-activated signaling pathways, and activates the expression of genes involved in the acute phase response such as cytokine genes. It has been shown that the expression of C/EBPβ transactivates the transcription of genes encoding the insulin receptor and glucose transporter-2 (21Webster N.J. Kong Y. Cameron K.E. Resnik J.L. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 305-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), suggesting that C/EBPβ may play an important role in glucose homeostasis and the metabolic stress associated with diabetes mellitus. The promoters of both of the rat insulin I and II gene, as well as the human insulin gene, contain sequence elements that closely resemble the consensus C/EBP-binding site (see Fig. 1). The sequence similarities among the elements imply that the C/EBP family of DNA-binding proteins may regulate the expression of the insulin gene. In addition, the activity of the insulin gene promoter is regulated by glucose and hormones, which elevate β-cell [Ca2+] and cAMP levels and possibly protein kinase C activity (2Philippe J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 2: 21-27Google Scholar, 23Goodison S. Kenna S. Ashcroft S.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ may mediate the effects of multiple second messengers on insulin gene expression, since its activity can be influenced by Ca2+, cAMP, and protein kinase C signaling pathways (24Metz R. Ziff E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 25Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin.

In the present study, we find that C/EBPβ is expressed in pancreatic β-cells and is up-regulated by supraphysiologic glucose concentrations in the culture media of pancreatic β-cell lines. C/EBPβ inhibits insulin promoter activity in β-cell lines, but not in the non-β-cell HeLa and BHK cell lines. In pancreatic β-cells C/EBPβ specifically interacts with a heptad leucine repeat sequence within activation domain 2 (AD2) of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E47, thereby inhibiting the DNA binding activity and the transactivation potential of E47. DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Boehringer Mannheim; radioactive compounds were from NEN Life Science Products;d-luciferin-potassium was from the Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (San Diego, CA); RPMI 1640 and DMEM medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Nucleotides were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15 (27Santerre R.F. Cook R.A. Crisel R.M. Sharp J.D. Schmidt R.J. Williams D.C. Wilson C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) at passage 64 and COS-7 cells were purchased from the ATCC. Ins-1 (28Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) cells at passage 99 were a gift from Dr. Claes B. Wollheim (University of Geneva, Switzerland). HIT-T15 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere as described (7Olson L.K. Sharma A. Peshavaria M. Wright C.V. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9127-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ins-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm HEPES as reported (28Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were passaged weekly. For the model of long term exposure, HIT cells were cultured from passage 64 to passage 82 in 11.1 mmd-glucose or 0.8 mmd-glucose with adjustment of osmolality by the addition of mannitol to the low glucose medium. Glucose concentrations for HIT-T15 cells were chosen according to the left-shifted insulin response curve as previously reported (29Zhang H.J. Walseth T.F. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Ins-1 cells were grown in 25 mm or 5.6 mmd-glucose, respectively, with mannitol adjustment as reported previously (30Olson L.K. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45 (abstr.): 243Google Scholar). The βTC-6 cell line (31Efrat S. Linde S. Kofod H. Spector D. Delannoy M. Grant S. Hanahan D. Baekkeskov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9037-9041Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Shimon Efrat (Albert Einstein University College of Medicine, New York). The βTC-6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS. Passages from 23 to 33 were used for transfection experiments. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium. Islets were isolated from the pancreata using an adaptation for rat islets of the method of Gotoh et al. (32Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cannulation of the common bile duct and instillation of 10 ml of a prewarmed (37 °C) solution containing 1 mg/ml Collagenase P and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I, the pancreas was removed and digested for 30 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath followed by dilution and washing of the digest and hand picking of the released islets under a dissecting microscope. Liver nuclei were prepared by the method of Gorski et al. (33Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antisera for C/EBPβ and E47 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The IDX-1 antiserum was described previously (34Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis was performed on nuclear extracts prepared from the cell lines according to standard techniques (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Extracts of pancreatic islet whole cells and liver nuclei were prepared by lysing isolated rat islets and liver nuclei in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). In each lane, a sample containing 100 μg of protein was loaded. A C/EBPβ protein fragment containing the basic region-leucine zipper binding domain that starts at an internal methionine site (12Poli V. Mancini F.P. Cortese R. Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) was made by insertion into the BamHI-XhoI site of the pRSET-A vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). The protein was transcribed and translated and was purified with a nickel-chelating resin column and eluted by a pH gradient. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (34Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), using bacterially expressed C/EBPβ or nuclear extracts prepared from HIT-T15, βTC-6, and Ins-1 cells (37Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used for EMSA are as follows: CEB oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCTGAGGGGCTGAAGCTGTAATTTCCAAACACTTGCCTAGTGCTAAGTG-3′ (antisense strand); CEB mutated oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCTGAGGGGCTGAAGCCTCGGCTTCCAAACACTGCCTAGTGCTAAGTG-3′; P1 element oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCCTACCTACCCCTCCTAGAGCCCTTAATGGGCCAAACGGCAAAGTCCAGGGGGCAGA-3′; CRE oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCTAGAGTTGTTGACGTCCAATGAGCG-3′; FLAT oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCCTTCATCAGGCCATCTGGCCCCTTGTTAATAATCTAATTACCCTAGGTCTA-3′. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes comprising the E1 elements (Nir, RIPE3) of the rat insulin I and II promoters were as follows: Nir, 5′-GATCCAGCTTCAGCCCCTCTCGCCATCTGCCTACCTACCCCTCCTAGAGCCCTT-3′; RIPE3, 5′-GATCTGGAAACTGCAGCTTCAGCCCCTCTGGCCATCTGCTGATCCG-3′. DNA-binding probes were incubated in a 20-μl volume with the indicated combinations of in vitro translated proteins in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 200 ng of poly(dI-dC). To adjust the salt concentration, each reaction was equilibrated to a mock reticulocyte lysate reaction. Binding complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer. C/EBPβ isolated from bacteria was incubated with a fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the rat insulin I gene (nucleotides −280 to +1). The fragment was end-labeled on the coding strand by the polymerase chain reaction. The DNase I footprinting analysis was carried out as described previously (38Vallejo M. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12868-12875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid −410INS-LUC contains a fragment of the rat insulin I gene promoter from base pairs −410 to +49 cloned into the pXP2 vector containing the coding sequence of firefly luciferase cDNA. The luciferase-reporter plasmid DNA containing the CEB mutation within the rat insulin I gene promoter was created by mutation of the CEB box from−128TGTAAT−133 to−128CTCGGC−133 using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (39Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). The luciferase plasmid containing 190 bp of the promoter of IDX-1 (−190IDX-LUC) was a gift from Dr. Marc Montminy (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and has been described previously (40Sharma S. Leonard J. Lee S. Chapman H.D. Leiter E.H. Montminy M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2294-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter construct containing the proximal 180 bp of the promoter sequence of the human islet sulfonylurea receptor (−180SUR-LUC) 3J. Ferrer, unpublished results. was a gift from Dr. Jorge Ferrer (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). All insulin promoter deletions were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis and subsequently sequenced. For expression of C/EBPβ in COS-7 cells and in vitro transcription/translation, the plasmid C/EBPβ-pcDNA I was used (41Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). For bHLH factors, the plasmid shPanI.pBAT14 (42German M.S. Blanar M.A. Nelson C. Moss L.G. Rutter W.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (hamster homolog of E47; a gift from Dr. M. German, University of California, San Francisco, CA) was used for expression in COS cells. Pan I (rat homolog of E47) was produced byin vitro transcription/translation from the plasmid pARP5/P2 (43Nelson C. Shen L.P. Meister A. Fodor E. Rutter W.J. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1035-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (gift from C. Nelson, University of California, San Francisco). To produce the leucine zipper minus mutant form of Pan I, two point-mutations were introduced into the plasmid pARP5/P2 by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to replace the second and the third leucines within the heptad leucine repeat of the AD2 of Pan I/E47 by phenylalanines. The mutated sequences were confirmed by sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (44Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 12: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with Sequenase version 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The plasmid for bacterial expression of the GST-C/EBPβ-fusion protein (pGEX-KG) has been described (41Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). At 50% confluence (10-cm culture dishes), HIT-T15 or βTC-6 cells were transfected with 3 μg of the rat insulin I promoter-luciferase plasmid DNA using the DEAE-dextran method in cell suspension (45Vallejo M. Penchuk L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12876-12884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected using CaPO4 (46$$Google Scholar) with 3 μg of the −410INS-LUC (or deletion constructs) and 0.5 μg of C/EBPβ-pcDNA I expression plasmid. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined as described previously (47Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids containing fusions between the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and either AD1 or AD2 of E47 (48Robinson G.L. Henderson E. Massari M.E. Murre C. Stein R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Roland Stein (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). At 50% confluence (10-cm culture dishes), HIT-T15 cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of a luciferase reporter-construct containing a multimerized Gal4-binding site ((GBS)3-p59RLG) and one of each of the GAL4 constructs with a C/EBPβ expression plasmid (C/EBPβ-pcDNA I) or empty vector (pcDNA I) using the DEAE-dextran method in cell suspension (45Vallejo M. Penchuk L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12876-12884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rous sarcoma virus-CAT was used as an internal control for monitoring of transfection efficiency. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was determined as described previously (47Brasier A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. Biotechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar). Values were expressed as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Transfection of COS-7 cells for protein expression was performed by liposomal transfer (Lipofectin®, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's manual. Recombinant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/translation with the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions using T7 polymerase for all plasmids transcribed. Each translation reaction was performed in duplicate with and without inclusion of [35S]methionine, and protein identity was confirmed by autoradiography of products separated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis or Western immunoblot analysis. Proteins from transfected COS-7 cells were labeledin vivo by incubation inl-methionine/l-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) and 10% dialyzed FBS for 4 h. Nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells and from the β-cell lines HIT-T15 and Ins-1 were prepared as described previously (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, nuclear extracts and in vitro translated protein solutions were adjusted to 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After the addition of the respective antisera for C/EBPβ and E47 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation at 4 °C for 15 h, the immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose, washed, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western immunoblot analysis. For GST pull down analysis, the GST fusion proteins of C/EBPβ were prepared as described by Ron and Habener (41Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), except the proteins were not eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose. Interacting proteins were precipitated with the glutathione-Sepharose-coupled fusion proteins in the same buffer used for immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE autoradiography and Western immunoblot as described. All values were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed via Student's t test for paired and unpaired values (49Baillar III, J.C. Mosteller F. Medical Uses of Statistics. The New England Journal of Medicine, Waltham, MA1992Google Scholar). Potential C/EBPβ-binding Sites in the Promoters of the Rat and Human Insulin Genes—Inspection of the promoters of the rat insulin I, rat insulin II, and human insulin genes reveals nucleotide sequence elements that resemble the consensus motif that binds the C/EBP family of transcription factors (Fig.1, A and B). Isolated rat pancreatic islets and several β- and non-β-cell lines were assayed for C/EBPβ expression by Western immunoblot using liver nuclei extracts as a positive control, since C/EBPβ was originally defined as the liver-enriched activator protein, LAP (14Descombes P. Chojkier M. Lichtsteiner S. Falvey E. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1541-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The 32-kDa C/EBPβ protein was detected in isolated rat islet whole cell extracts (Fig.2 A), although the antiserum also recognized a more abundant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa. C/EBPβ was also detected in the nuclear extracts from Ins-1, βTC-6, and HIT-T15 cells, which are islet β-cell lines derived from rat, mouse, and hamster, respectively. To determine whether the expression of C/EBPβ is altered in β-cells during chronic or short term exposure to supraphysiologic concentrations of glucose, we used standard in vitro glucose desensitization models (6Olson L.K. Redmon J.B. Towle H.C. Robertson R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Olson L.K. Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1996; 45 (abstr.): 243Google Scholar). HIT-T15 cells were serially passaged in RPMI 1640 medium containing 11.1 mm glucose or 0.8 mm glucose for 16 weeks. Since the EC50 for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is left-shifted to 1 mm in HIT-T15 cells rather than about 8 mm in normal islets (50Regazzi R. Li G.D. Deshusses J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15003-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 11.1 mm glucose was chosen as a supraphysiological concentration, and 0.8 mm was considered a physiological concentration of glucose for the HIT-T15 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the expression of IDX-1 decreased from week 4 to 16, confirming the published observations (9Sharma A. Olson L.K. Robertson R.P. Stein R. Mol.

These observations indicate that the level of C/EBPβ in HIT-T15 cells is up-regulated by prolonged exposure to high glucose concentrations and that C/EBPβ might serve as a repressor of insulin gene transcription. The increased expression of C/EBPβ in HIT-T15 cells after chronic exposure to high glucose was prevented by culturing HIT-T15 cells in the RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.8 mmglucose (Fig. 2 B). To validate the in vitro long term model and to show an effect of high glucose concentrations on the regulation of insulin secretion, we measured the insulin concentration in the culture medium in response to increasing glucose concentrations in HIT-T15 cells at different passages in 2-h static incubation intervals. Whereas HIT-T15 cells cultured in high glucose displayed a passage-dependent decrease in glucose-responsive insulin secretion (50 ± 7.7% after 16 weeks in 11.1 mmglucose), no such decrease was seen in cells cultured in low glucose (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2038681771,"PS2, the chromosome 1 familial Alzheimer's disease gene, has been shown to be involved in programmed cell death by three complementary experimental approaches. Reduction of PS2 protein levels by antisense RNA protects from apoptosis, whereas overexpression of an Alzheimer's PS2 mutant increases cell death induced by several stimuli. In addition, ALG-3, a truncatedPS2 cDNA, encodes an artificial COOH-terminal PS2 segment that dominantly inhibits apoptosis. Here we describe a physiological COOH-terminal PS2 polypeptide (PS2s, Met298-Ile448) generated by both an alternative PS2 transcript and proteolytic cleavage. We find that PS2s protects transfected cells from Fas- and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, a similar anti-apoptotic COOH-terminal PS2 polypeptide (PS2Ccas) is generated by caspase-3 cleavage at Asp329. These results suggest that caspase-3 not only activates pro-apoptotic substrates but also generates a negative feedback signal in which PS2Ccas antagonizes the progression of cell death. Thus, whereas PS2 is required for apoptosis, PS2s and PS2Ccas oppose this process, and the balance between PS2 and these COOH-terminal fragments may dictate the cell fate.

Programmed cell death (PCD) 1The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. is a biological process under genetic control that regulates the life span of different cell types and is required for normal development and survival of multicellular organisms. Disregulation of PCD can cause pathological processes such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, immunodeficiency, and auto immune diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Consequently, much interest has been focused on characterizing the molecular cascade that specifies cell death. To study the biochemical events leading to apoptosis, we have used as a model system cell death induced by T cell receptor-triggering in a mouse T cell hybridoma (2Ashwell J.D. Cunningham R.E.

In this experimental paradigm, Fas ligand is induced after T cell receptor stimulation, and the engagement of Fas by Fas ligand activates the cell death program (4Dhein J. Walczack H. Baumler C.

Recombinant caspases were produced as described previously (17Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W.

The PS2s cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). cDNA probes 1–5 (see Fig. 1 a) were generated using the polymerase chain reaction and mouse PS2 cDNA as a template. Cloning of mouse PS1 was described previously (10Vito P. Wolozin B. Ganjei J.K. Iwasaki K. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. J. Biol.

Human PS2 and caspase-3 cDNAs were cloned by polymerase chain reaction from a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) and inserted in pcDNA3. D320A, D326A, and D329A PS2 mutants were generated byin vitro site-directed mutagenesis using the human PS2 expression vector as a template. PS2Ncas and PS2Ccas human constructs were made using polymerase chain reaction. The reverse primer utilized to amplify PS2Ncas contained a stop codon downstream of the codon for Asp329, and the forward oligonucleotide for PS2Ccas had a consensus sequence for initiation of translation and an ATG upstream of the codon for Ser330. Protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) and PARP cDNAs were derived as described previously (17Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H.

HeLa and COS7 cells were transfected with lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 2 μg of pcDNA3 expressing the indicated cDNAs, following the manufacturer's indications. 293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cotransfections of PS2 constructs and caspase-3 cDNAs were done using 1 μg of each plasmid. In apoptosis experiments, a mixture of 0.2 μg of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase (CLONTECH) with 2 μg of the listed vectors was transfected. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with TNFα or anti-Fas antibody along with cyclohexamide. The β-galactosidase activity was visualized as described (10Vito P. Wolozin B. Ganjei J.K. Iwasaki K. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31025-31028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the live blue cells present in 20 fields were counted. The percent reduction corresponds to the ratio of treatedversus untreated β-Gal+ cells for each individual transfection. The transfection efficiency was comparable in all samples. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer plus the protease inhibitors aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (100 μg/ml, Sigma). Immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Modified 5 × loading buffer (320 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 10% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 8m urea), used to reduce aggregation of PS2, was added to immunoprecipitates or 10 μg of cell lysates. Samples were heated at 37 °C for 45 min, 75 °C for 5 min, and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. In vitro labeled proteins were detected by x-ray exposure; unlabeled proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Gelman Science) and probed with the specified antibodies. Immunoblots were developed using the ECL System (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). [3H]leucine- or [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were made using a TNT-coupled transcription and translation system (Promega), and cleavage reactions were performed and examined as described (17Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The mouse PS2 gene is expressed as a ubiquitous 2.4-kilobase transcript coding for the full-length PS2 protein and a liver-specific ∼1.1-kilobase mRNA (7Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This 1.1-kilobase mRNA, called PS2short (PS2s), contains the 3′ portion of PS2 and includes the artificial ALG-3transcript (Fig. 1 a). Sequence analysis of several PS2s cDNAs cloned from a mouse liver cDNA library revealed that PS2s encodes for the 151 COOH-terminal amino acids of PS2 (Met298-Ile448; Fig. 1, b andc). PS2s was translated into a PS2 COOH-terminal polypeptide named PS2s both in vitro and in transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 1 d). The smaller and fainter band detected in COS7 cells transfected with PS2s could derive from usage of a downstream start codon. As expected, a protein identical in size and immunoreactivity to transfected PS2s was found in liver (Fig.2 a). Surprisingly, a PS2s-like protein was also detected in cells transfected with the full-lengthPS2 cDNA (see COS7 cells in Fig. 2 b and in 293 cells in Fig. 5) and in tissues that do not express thePS2s mRNA (see thymus (T) in Fig.2 a). This PS2s-like protein arises from proteolytic cleavage because an antibody specific for the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids of PS2 detects the corresponding NH2-terminal proteolytic fragment in transfected cells (not shown). Moreover, PS2 processing has also been reported recently by others (18Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T. Hideaki K. Shinozaki K. Tokuhiro S. Capell A. Walter J. Grunberg J. Haass C. Iwatsubo T. Obata K.

Since the two COOH-terminal fragments generated by either proteolysis or the PS2s transcript have the same gel mobility and pattern of immunoreactivity, we will refer to both polypeptides as PS2s. Thus, PS2s can be generated by both alternative transcription and proteolytic cleavage.Figure 5PS2 is cleaved by caspase-3 at the predicted Asp-Ser site. a, in vitro metabolically labeled PS2 and PS1 proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with recombinant human caspase-1 (5 μg/ml), -2 (75 μg/ml), -4 (5 μg/ml), -5 (5 μg/ml), -3 (2.5 μg/ml), -6 (5 μg/ml), -7 (5 μg/ml), caspase buffer (m), or nothing (−). b, human and mouse PS2 are cleaved by caspase-3 with the same efficiency.c, comparison of PS2, PKCδ, and PARP cleavage by caspase-3.

Dis. 1997; 3: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which corresponds to Met298 of PS2, suggesting that both PS1 and PS2 are cleaved by the same or closely related protease(s). Since PS2s is a COOH-terminal fragment of PS2 and potentially encompasses the inhibitory domain found in ALG-3, we tested whether it could confer resistance to cell death. HeLa cells were transfected with various PS2 constructs, and cell death was induced with TNFα or an anti-Fas antibody. Like ALG-3, PS2s partially protects transfected cells from cell death induced by both stimuli (Fig.3). An additional ∼18-kDa COOH-terminal PS2 fragment was noticed in thymic lysates (see PS2Ccas in Fig. 2 a). This was of particular interest because >90% of developing T cells undergo cell death during differentiation in the thymus. To determine whether this 18-kDa PS2 polypeptide was specifically produced during apoptosis, HeLa cells were induced to die by TNFα or Fas engagement. Both stimuli induced the appearance of the ∼18-kDa COOH-terminal PS2 polypeptide (Fig. 4 a). The same treatments also resulted in activation of caspase-3, which is present in the cell as a proenzyme and is activated by proteolysis during apoptosis (23Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G.

To determine whether PS2 cleavage was dependent on caspase activity, HeLa cells were treated with TNFα together with the specific caspases inhibitor ZDEVD-fmk. As shown in Fig. 4 b, PS2 cleavage was inhibited by ZDEVD-fmk, whereas no effect was seen with the irrelevant reagent ZFA-fmk (Fig. 1 a). These results demonstrate that the 18-kDa PS2 fragment is produced during PCD and that PS2 cleavage requires caspase activity. In looking at the amino acids sequence of PS2, we noticed a putative caspase-3 consensus cleavage sequence (26Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T.

Cleavage of PS2 at the predicted Asp329-Ser330site would give rise to a COOH-terminal segment compatible with the 18-kDa PS2 polypeptide generated during PCD. To address whether PS2 is directly cleaved by caspases, we tested seven recombinant caspases in an in vitro cleavage assay using in vitrotranslated, recombinant proteins as substrates. PS2 was cleaved only by caspase-3 (Fig. 5 a) to generate two fragments of ∼40 and ∼18 kDa (Fig. 5 b). This cleavage was specific for PS2 since the highly homologous Alzheimer's disease protein PS1, which lacks the putative caspase-3 cleavage site, was not processed (Fig. 5 a). Caspase-3 cleaved PS2 and the two known substrates PARP and PKCδ (17Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Huang Y. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R.

The ∼18-kDa fragment was immunoprecipitated by the αPS2c antiserum (Fig. 5 d), indicating that it represented the COOH-terminal PS2 cleavage product. Hence, we will refer to the 18- and 40-kDa clipped fragments as PS2Ccas and PS2Ncas, respectively. If cleavage occurred at the predicted Asp329-Ser330 (Fig. 1 c), PS2Ncas and PS2Ccas would consist of Met1-Asp329 and Ser330-Ile448, respectively. Two constructs encoding for these portions of PS2 were translated into PS2 polypeptides that co-migrated with the cleavage products PS2Ncas and PS2Ccas (Fig. 5 d). Caspases have an absolute requirement for aspartic acid at position P1 of their substrate and a less stringent one for the amino acid at position P4 (26Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C.

PS2 mutants in which positions P1 (Asp329, mutant D329A) or P4 (Asp326, mutant D326A) were substituted with an alanine were made. Whereas the D326A mutant was a very poor substrate for caspase-3 and cleavage was detectable only after longer exposure (not shown), D329A was not processed at all (Fig. 5 d). Mutation of an unrelated aspartic acid (D320A) did not affect PS2 cleavage (Fig.5 d). Thus, caspase-3 cleaves PS2 at the predicted Asp329-Ser330 site. To verify whether the 18-kDa COOH-terminal PS2 fragment generatedin vivo during apoptosis was identical to PS2Ccas, 293T cells were transfected with wild type PS2, mutant D329A, and PS2Ccas human cDNAs alone or together with a plasmid coding for caspase-3. PS2 was processed in cells cotransfected with caspase-3, and the 18-kDa COOH-terminal PS2 polypeptide co-migrated with transfected PS2Ccas (Fig. 6). Moreover, the PS2 mutant D329A, which is expressed at similar levels of wild type PS2, was not cleaved in cells coexpressing caspase-3 (Fig. 6). Together, these results indicate that PS2 is a physiological substrate of caspase-3. PS2Ccas includes ALG-3 and is included in PS2s (Fig. 1 c), raising the interesting possibility that it could have an anti-apoptotic function. Expression of PS2Ccas in HeLa cells conferred partial protection from cell death triggered by the Fas and TNF receptor molecules (Fig. 7). The D329A mutant, which cannot be cleaved to generate PS2Ccas, appeared to increase the number of dead cells in some experiments (Fig. 7,second panel), consistent with the lack of a negative feedback. However, to properly address this point, the reproducibility of this effect must be tested, and cells that do not express the wild type PS2 protein should be used. Thus, caspase-3 cleavage generates a proteolytic fragment, PS2Ccas, that can inhibit PCD. In this study, we have identified two physiological PS2 COOH-terminal polypeptides, PS2s and PS2Ccas, that oppose apoptosis induced through the death receptors Fas and TNF. PS2s is derived by two distinct processes: one is by translation of an alternative short PS2transcript, expressed in mouse liver and human placenta 2P. Vito, and L. D'Adamio, unpublished observations. ; the other is by proteolysis, mediated by a still unknown protease, of the PS2 protein. The latter would lead to inactivation of a protein critical for cell death and concomitantly generate an anti-apoptotic fragment of the same protein. Consequently, both the alternative transcript and PS2 proteolysis can modulate the PS2/PS2s balance and, ultimately, provide a means for the cell to regulate its susceptibility to death. An additional anti-apoptotic PS2 COOH-terminal protein termed PS2Ccas is produced during apoptosis by caspase-3 cleavage of PS2. Of note, the highly homologous Alzheimer's disease protein PS1 was not cleaved. After submission of this paper, it was reported that PS1 is cleaved during apoptosis, and that this cleavage is blocked by inhibitors of caspases (29Kim T.-W. Pettingell W. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the authors claimed that PS1 is a substrate of a caspase-3 family member. The discrepancy between our data and these findings could indicate that either PS1 is cleaved by a caspase other than those assayed or that PS1 conformation in an in vitro assay is such that the caspase cleavage site is not accessible. On the other hand, the conclusion that PS1 is cleaved by caspases might be inaccurate. An alternative interpretation of their data could be that PS1 is cleaved by a different protease whose activation during programmed cell death is dependent on caspases. Thus, further experiments should be performed to distinguish among these possibilities. Interestingly, both caspase-3 and PS2 play a critical role in the central nervous system. Caspase-3 is essential for cell death in the brain (30Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A.

Disassembly of poly-Ub by this enzyme is restricted to the distal-end Ub of the substrate, i.e. the Ub farthest from the site of protein attachment in poly-Ub-protein conjugates. The determinants recognized by the isopeptidase were probed by the use of mutant ubiquitins incorporated into Lys48-linked poly-Ub substrates. PA700 could not disassemble poly-Ub chains that contained a distal Ub(L8A,I44A). This suggested either that the enzyme interacts directly with Leu8 or Ile44 or that it recognizes a higher order structure that caps the distal end of a poly-Ub substrate and is destabilized by Ub(L8A,I44A). The previously determined di-Ub crystal structure (Cook, W. J., Jeffrey, L. C., Carson, M., Chen, Z., and Pickart, C. M. (1992) J. Biol.

In addition to Lys48-linked chains, PA700 also could disassemble Lys6- and Lys-11-linked poly-Ub, but, surprisingly, not α-linked di-Ub.

This pathway has emerged as the major system of non-lysosomal intracellular proteolysis in eukaryotes (reviewed in Refs. 1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar and 2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Ub is a highly conserved 76-residue protein that is found both free and as a covalent adduct with other proteins. Ub-protein conjugation (“ubiquitination”) is catalyzed by multiple enzymes that ultimately form an isopeptide bond that links the C-terminal α-carboxylate of Ub to an ε-amine of a lysine within the protein substrate. Many molecules of ubiquitin can be conjugated to a single protein target (3Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and a distinction can be made between substrates with multiple lysines that are ubiquitinated and those in which multiple ubiquitins are elaborated from a single lysine via secondary Ub–Ub isopeptide linkages (4Chau V.

This latter “poly-Ub” structure has been implicated as an essential determinant for efficient recognition by the 26 S proteasome of many (4Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J.

Kania M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4015-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Ub-dependent degradation substrates. Depending upon the particular Ub-conjugating enzyme and substrate involved, a variety of Ub–Ub linkages can be found in poly-Ub chains. Typically, the poly-Ub chains on substrates for degradation are linked via the Lys48 side chains of the ubiquitins (4Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 5Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell.

Whether a protein is degraded by the Ub system has been thought to depend primarily on recognition by Ub-conjugating enzymes. However, the existence of a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes (“isopeptidases”) offers additional opportunities for the regulation of substrate turnover. On the one hand, deubiquitinating enzymes may selectively down-regulate the degradation of a limited subset of ubiquitinated proteins through interactions that are influenced by substrate identity. Such a role has been suggested for the enzymes encoded by the Drosophila fat facets and murineDUB-1 genes (12Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer-Vize J.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 13Zhu Y. Carroll M. Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. D'Andrea A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, other deubiquitinating enzymes appear to promote proteolysis in a generalized fashion by preventing the accumulation of degradation products derived from poly-Ub chains (14Papa F.R. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1993; 366: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). An isopeptidase whose activity depends solely upon the structure of the substrate-linked poly-Ub chain(s) might also down-regulate degradation selectively, but in a manner that does not depend upon the properties of the substrate moiety. This general idea, which we will refer to as “editing” by an isopeptidase, has been discussed by Ellison and Hochstrasser (16Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in an early form, by Hershko et al. (17Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Evidence of editing by isopeptidases recently has been described. When added to a reticulocyte lysate, low concentrations of the isopeptidase inhibitor Ubal were found to enhance the Ub-dependent degradation of α-globin, a poor ubiquitination substrate, but not other, more efficiently ubiquitinated proteins (18Shaeffer J.R. Cohen R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10886-10893Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results from this and a related study (19Shaeffer J.R. Cohen R.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 1300-1308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were interpreted in terms of the kinetic partitioning of poly-Ub-protein or Ub-protein conjugates between two fates: degradation by the 26 S proteasome and rescue of the protein via deubiquitination by an editing isopeptidase. A candidate for an editing isopeptidase has been found within the PA700 (19 S) regulatory complex of bovine 26 S proteasomes (20Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). This enzyme, which is a tightly bound, stoichiometric component of the PA700 complex, was found to promote the selective rescue of poorly ubiquitinated proteins from degradation by reconstituted 26 S proteasomes in vitro. The PA700 isopeptidase is uniquely specific for the distal (i.e.growing) ends of Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains, and this property may help bias degradation by the 26 S proteasome to highly ubiquitinated conjugates (20Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have probed the PA700 isopeptidase activity with a variety of wild-type and mutant poly-Ub substrates to understand the specificity for the distal Ub of poly-Ub chains. In particular, the potential roles of Leu8 and Ile44, Ub residues that are known to be important for poly-Ub binding to the 26 S proteasome (21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), were investigated. We considered whether recognition by the isopeptidase involves a structure similar to that determined crystallographically for Lys48-linked di-Ub (22Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the distal end of a poly-Ub chain could be “capped” with such a structure, which might be recognized by the isopeptidase. To address this possibility, we have used two-dimensional 1H NMR methods to examine the structure of di-Ub in solution, and di-Ub derivatives designed to destabilize the conformation of this hypothetical cap were tested as substrates. We also examined the ability of the PA700 isopeptidase to cleave α-linked di-Ub and poly-Ub conjugates that contain isopeptide linkages through Lys6 or Lys11. Bovine Ub, creatine phosphokinase (type III), yeast hexokinase (type C-300), and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were purchased from Sigma, and bovine histone H2b was from Boehringer Mannheim. Affinity-purified Ub-activating enzyme (E1) was prepared from bovine red blood cells or rabbit liver (23Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15076-15082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); recombinant E225K was purified after its expression inEscherichia coli (25Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14418-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and recombinant E2EPF and Rad6p-conjugating enzymes were provided by A. Haas (Wisconsin College of Medicine, Milwaukee, WI). The bovine PA700 complex was isolated as described previously (26Chu-Ping M. Vu J.H. Proske R.J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3539-3547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ub(K48R), Ub(L8A), Ub(I44A), and Ub(L8A,I44A) were purified after expression in E. coli as described (4Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and Ub(L8W) was made similarly. Ubdiol was synthesized by carboxypeptidase Y-catalyzed exchange of (±)-3-amino-1,2-propanediol for Gly76 in Ub and was purified by cation-exchange chromatography 2R. E. Cohen, E. Swain, J. R. Shaeffer, Y. A. Lam, and N. Khodadadi, manuscript in preparation. ; the C-terminal diol derivatives of mutant forms of Ub (see below) were made in a like manner. Ubal was produced from Ubdiol by periodate oxidation (27Dunten R.L. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioiodinations of proteins with carrier-free Na125I and chloramine T (28Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were done by the University of Iowa Diabetes and Endocrinology Core Radioiodination Facility. Lys48-linked di-Ub was synthesized from Ub with purified E1 and E225K enzymes according to Chen and Pickart (29Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variants of di-Ub were made with mutationally altered forms of Ub incorporated specifically into either the distal or proximal position of the chain. To accomplish this, the Ub unit intended for the proximal position was first modified to replace the C-terminal carboxylate with a diol. This modification not only restricted incorporation to the proximal end of the dimer, but also facilitated chromatographic separation of the products from the syntheses. These diubiquitins were synthesized essentially as described (21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), but with a 1:2 ratio of (mutant) Ub to Ubdiol. Syntheses of Ub(K48C)-Ub and Ub(K48Aec)-Ub, forms of di-Ub altered specifically in the distal Ub moiety, are reported elsewhere (30Piotrowski J. Beal R. Hoffman L. Wilkinson K.D. Cohen R.E. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23712-23721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The products were purified by cation-exchange HPLC (POROS HS/H column eluted at 4 ml/min with 0.05–0.85 m NaCl in 25 mmNH4OAc, pH 4.5) monitored at 235 nm. Concentrations of wild-type and mutant mono- and di-Ub were determined by use of the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.16 ml/mg·cm (31Haas A.L. Wilkinson K.D. Prep. Biochem. 1985; 15: 49-60PubMed Google Scholar). Poly-Ub chains labeled at the proximal Ub with the fluorophore Lucifer Yellow (LY) were synthesized with purified E1 and E225K enzymes as described previously (20Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). For Lys48-linked chains that contained Ub(L8A,I44A), a 1:1 mixture of Ub(T66C-LY)diol and Ub(L8A,I44A) was used. The C terminus of the fluorescently labeled Ub was converted to a diol, Ub(T66C-LY)diol, to restrict it to the proximal position of the chain. In this manner, a Lys48-linked trimer consisting of mutant and fluorescently labeled ubiquitins was made to have the sequence Ub(L8A,I44A)-Ub(L8A,I44A)-Ub(T66C-LY)diol. Because Ub(L8A,I44A) retained the C-terminal carboxylate, there was concomitant formation of homopolymers of unlabeled Ub(L8A,I44A). These were resolved from the LY-labeled products by cation-exchange HPLC as described above; protein absorbance (235 nm) and LY fluorescence (excitation at 426 nm and emission at 530 nm) were monitored. Concentrations of LY-labeled proteins were determined from the absorbance of the LY fluorophore by use of the extinction coefficient at 436 nm of 1.3 × 104m−1cm−1 (32Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1992: 11-13Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm fluorescently labeled chains made with wild-type Ub or Ub(L8A,I44A), and 8 nm PA700; these were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 40 μl of 1 m acetic acid. The fluorescently labeled products were separated by cation-exchange HPLC (TSK SP-NPR column eluted at 1.25 ml/min with 0.05–0.45 m NaCl in 25 mmNH4OAc, pH 4.5) and quantified by their fluorescence as described above. NMR samples of Ub (7 mm) or di-Ub (2 mm) were prepared in 10% D2O and 90% H2O in 50 mm sodium Pi, pH 6.0. Where indicated, 20 mm4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy (HyTEMPO; Aldrich) was included as a paramagnetic relaxation agent. 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz on a Varian UNITY-500 spectrometer with samples maintained at 30 °C. Chemical shifts are reported relative to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)tetradeuteriopropionate. Phase-sensitive DQF-COSY spectra (33Piantini U. Sorenson O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem.

Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) were obtained with a sweep width of 6000 Hz; 1024 complex data points were collected in the directly detected (f2) dimension, and from 460 to 512 complex data points were collected in the indirectly detected (f1) dimension. Before Fourier transformation, spectra were processed by zero-filling the f2 dimension to 4096 points and the f1 dimension to 2048 points; gaussian apodization was applied to both dimensions (0.79 s with a π/6 phase shift in f2 and 0.04 s with a π/6 phase shift in f1). The HDO resonance was suppressed by presaturation with low-power irradiation during the 1.6-s relaxation delay. Saturation curves for the disassembly of nonfluorescent di-Ub derivatives to Ub (and, depending on the substrate, Ubdiol) were determined as follows. Reaction mixtures (50–300 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5–40 μm di-Ub, and 8–80 nm PA700. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for various times up to 1 h, and the reactions were stopped by additions of equal volumes of 1m acetic acid. Substrates and products were separated by cation-exchange HPLC (TSK SP-NPR column eluted at 1.25 ml/min with 0.05–0.45 m NaCl in 25 mm NH4OAc, pH 4.5) and quantified by their absorbance at 235 nm; all Ub and Ubdiol species were assumed to have identical extinction coefficients. For studies of inhibition by Ub or Ubdiol, Ub-Ub(L8A,I44A)diol was used as the substrate, and the reactions were monitored by quantifying either the Ub or Ub(L8A,I44A)diol released. This substrate was chosen because one of the two products always could be resolved by HPLC from the exogenously added Ub or Ubdiol inhibitor. Measured velocities were converted to molecules of substrate processed per enzyme·min and are based on a single isopeptidase active site in each 700-kDa PA700 complex (20Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). K m, K i, andk cat parameters were determined from initial velocity data and nonlinear least-squares fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation, modified where appropriate for competitive inhibition, by use of the program Ultrafit (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The E2EPF Ub-conjugating enzyme undergoes auto-ubiquitination to generate a poly-Ub chain linked through Ub Lys11 (11Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Synthesis and disassembly of Ub n -E2EPF conjugates were done as follows. The conjugation reaction (90 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 μm E2EPF, 0.2 μm E1, and 0.3 mg/ml 125I-Ub (3 × 104 cpm/μg); the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. To prevent further synthesis of poly-Ub conjugates during the disassembly assay, EDTA or hexokinase + glucose were used to inhibit the ATP-dependent activation of Ub by E1. To 40 μl of the conjugation reaction was added 20 μl containing 16 units of hexokinase and 4 mmglucose; to another 40 μl of the original reaction was added 20 μl of 10 mm EDTA, and both mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. For the disassembly assay, each of the two 60-μl reaction mixtures was further divided into aliquots of 15 μl. One aliquot was used as the “no PA700” control; to another was added 2 μl of 0.44 mg/ml PA700. To a third aliquot was added 2 μl containing 0.44 mg/ml PA700 and 2 μm Ubal, which had been preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. All reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, heated at 100 °C for 2 min, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). The gel was dried and autoradiographed. For Lys6-linked poly-Ub (11Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), conjugate synthesis was done as described above but for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.4 μm Rad6p as the E2 enzyme and 24 μm histone H2b as the conjugation substrate. Plasmid pRS-Ub2.0, which encodes a linear di-Ub in which Gly76 of the second Ub is directly followed by a stop codon, was constructed from pRS-Ub (provided by K. Wilkinson, Emory University) and pSP64-Ub2.0 (provided by D. Weeks, University of Iowa) (37Agell N. Bond U. Schlesinger M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3693-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSP64-Ub2.0 contains a linear di-Ub gene in which Gly76 of the second Ub is followed by the codon for Tyr prior to the stop codon; pRS-Ub contains a single Ub gene in which Gly76 is followed directly by a stop codon. Both plasmids have a unique PvuII site within each Ub gene, and thePvuII fragment from pSP64-Ub2.0 was subcloned into pRS-Ub. Orientation of the di-Ub gene in the product, pRS-Ub2.0, was verified by the size of BglII restriction DNA fragments. Expression and purification of linear di-Ub from pRS-Ub2.0 were done essentially as described for Ub (21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the purified di-Ub was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP spectrometer and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for the sample matrix (molecular mass found, 17,111 Da; molecular mass calculated: 17,112.7 Da). We have examined whether Leu8 and Ile44, residues on Ub that affect the targeting of conjugates to the 26 S proteasome (21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), also are required for recognition by the Ub isopeptidase in the PA700 regulatory complex of the 26 S particle. Leu8 and Ile44 are part of the hydrophobic patch on the surface of Ub (38Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) and are essential for the interaction between poly-Ub chains and S5a, a poly-Ub-binding protein in the 26 S proteasome (21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We had shown previously that the PA700 isopeptidase disassembles Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains specifically from the distal ends of these substrates (20Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). By the incorporation of Ub(L8A,I44A) into the distal position (see Fig. 1legend for definitions of distal and proximal Ub) of fluorescent LY-labeled poly-Ub chains, we developed substrates to test whether Leu8 or Ile44 is involved in processing by the PA700 isopeptidase. Assays of PA700 isopeptidase activity with the wild-type and mutant LY-labeled tri-Ub substrates indicated that Ub(L8A,I44A) resists cleavage (Fig.2). These results implicated Ub residue Leu8 or Ile44 (or both) as important for substrate recognition by the PA700 isopeptidase. Assays that compared LY-labeled di-Ub substrates that contained Ub or Ub(L8A,I44A) at the distal position similarly showed that the altered Ub prevented cleavage.Figure 2The PA700 Ub isopeptidase cannot remove Ub(L8A,I44A) from Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains. Tri-Ub derivatives with fluorescent Lucifer Yellow-labeled Ubdiol at the proximal position were used as substrates for the PA700 isopeptidase, and the products were separated by HPLC and monitored by their fluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”). A, with wild-type Ub at the distal position, fluorescently labeled monomer and dimer were released from Ub-Ub-Ub(T66C-LY)diol after 30 min.B, with Ub(L8A,I44A) at the distal position, no disassembly of Ub(L8A,I44A)-Ub(L8A,I44A)-Ub(T66C-LY)diol was detected. Experiments that used Ub-Ub(T66C-LY)diol and Ub(L8A,I44A)-Ub(T66C-LY)diol as substrates similarly showed release of Ub, but not Ub(L8A,I44A) (data not shown). The asterisk indicates a fluorescent impurity that was not changed upon incubation with PA700.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of the L8A and I44A mutations on PA700 isopeptidase activity are not likely to be due to an altered Ub tertiary structure. The Leu8 and Ile44 side chains are exposed at the Ub surface (38Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 39Petros A.M. Mueller L. Kopple K.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10041-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and both the singly and doubly modified ubiquitins can be activated and conjugated to proteins (this work and Ref. 21Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, our results with Ub(L8A,I44A) most likely reflected the specificity of the PA700 isopeptidase rather than a global unfolding of individual Ub units within poly-Ub chains. We next considered two other explanations as to why the PA700 isopeptidase cannot process these altered poly-Ub chains. Possibly, Leu8 or Ile44interacts directly with residues on the isopeptidase. Alternatively, as is evident from the crystal structure of Lys48-linked di-Ub (22Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these same hydrophobic residues can stabilize a unique and compact structure formed from two adjacent ubiquitins (Fig.3 A); presentation of the substrate in such a conformation may be required for recognition and cleavage of the distal-end Ub by the PA700 isopeptidase. This latter possibility was addressed by the studies described below. In the di-Ub crystal structure, Leu8, Ile44, and Val70from each Ub are found within a hydrophobic core that is bisected by an approximate 2-fold symmetry axis. The stability of this structure, depicted in Fig. 3 A, is thought to be due in part to the nonpolar side chain interactions and exclusion of solvent at this interface (22Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Carson M. Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16467-16471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 are exposed to solvent in the Ub monomer (38Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 39Petros A.M. Mueller L. Kopple K.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10041-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the di-Ub crystal structure offered the first indication of a role for these residues, whether this conformation would be propagated through longer poly-Ub chains was unclear. Subsequently, a crystallographic study of Lys48-linked tetra-Ub showed that the di-Ub conformation was not conserved and that the contacts between ubiquitins differed drastically in the dimer and tetramer (40Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In particular, the side chains of Leu8, Ile44, and Val70, which are buried in the di-Ub crystal, are exposed to solvent in the tetra-Ub crystal (Fig. 3 B). This difference is a consequence of rotations within the isopeptide linkages that join the ubiquitins. As a result, the orientation of each Ub withi"

Using the yeast two-hybrid system, in vitro binding studies, and human cell culture coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we show here that a region of the HRX protein that is consistently retained in HRX leukemic fusion proteins interacts directly with SET, another protein implicated in leukemia. We have identified the binding sites on HRX for SET and show that these sequences are clustered near the A·T hooks that have been shown to bind DNA. We also show that carboxyl-terminal SET sequences, possibly the acidic tail of SET, bind to HRX. We have also found serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase activity in anti-HRX coimmunoprecipitates. Using the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid and Western blotting, the phosphatase was identified as protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Mutation of a single amino acid in one of the SET binding sites of HRX resulted in lower amounts of both coimmunoprecipitated SET protein and coimmunoprecipitated PP2A. These results suggest that the leukemogenic effects of HRX fusion proteins may be related to interactions with SET and PP2A.

Disruption of the human homologue of the Drosophila Trithorax protein, HRX, by chromosomal translocations to form HRX fusion proteins is one of the most common genetic alterations in human acute leukemia (1Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). These translocations occur in approximately 10% of acute lymphoid leukemias, 5% of acute myeloid leukemias, and 85% of secondary leukemias that occur in patients as a complication of treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors. Moreover, these translocations are present in half of all the de novoleukemias in children less than 1 year of age (2Hunger S.P. Tkachuk D.C. Amylon M.D. Link M.P. Carroll A.J. Welborn J.L. Willman C.L. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1993; 81: 3197-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidating the role of HRX fusion proteins in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia will increase our understanding of the basic mechanisms controlling hematopoietic growth and differentiation and will potentially identify molecules that will serve as useful targets for therapeutic intervention in these fatal diseases. The HRX gene was cloned and found to encode a 3969-amino acid protein that is also referred to as acute lymphoblastic leukemia-1, MLL-1, or HTRX (1Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L.

The gene spans approximately 90 kilobases and consists of 36 exons (6Rasio D. Schichman S.A. Negrini M. Canaani E. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1766-1769PubMed Google Scholar). HRX is a nuclear protein (7Joh T. Kagami Y. Yamamoto K. Segawa T. Takizawa J. Takahashi T. Ueda R. Seto M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1945-1953PubMed Google Scholar) and has at least two regions of strong homology to the similarly sizedDrosophila Trx protein; these include a series of zinc fingers and a stretch of 210 amino acids in the central and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein, respectively (see Fig.1 A). In Drosophila, Trx controls body segment patterning as a positive transcriptional regulator of the homeotic selector genes of the Antennapedia and bithoraxcomplexes (8Breen T.R. Harte P.J. Development. 1993; 117: 119-134PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with transgenic mice have shown that the function of Hrx in mice has features in common with that oftrithorax in Drosophila. Yu et al. (9Yu B.D. Hess J.L. Horning S.E. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) have shown that Hrx is required for proper segment identity and positively regulates Hox gene expression inHrx heterozygous and homozygous deficient mice (9Yu B.D. Hess J.L. Horning S.E. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the Drosophila Trx protein is part of a cellular memory system that is involved in the stable inheritance of gene activity. Some 25 different human leukemic HRX fusion proteins resulting from reciprocal translocations between the HRX gene at chromosome 11q23 and partner genes at other loci are predicted to exist from cytogenetic studies (10Bernard O.A. Berger R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995; 13: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 11Rubnitz J.E. Behm F.G. Downing J.R. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1996; 10: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar). To date, at least 13 of the partner genes have been cloned and characterized (12So C.W. Caldas C. Liu M.M. Chen S.J. Huang Q.H. Gu L.J. Sham M.H. Wiedemann L.M. Chan L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2563-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Young B.D. Saha V. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 225-245PubMed Google Scholar, 64Taki T. Sako M. Tsuchida M. Hayashi Y.

Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8732-8737Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cytogenetic and Northern blot analyses on patient specimens and leukemia cell lines consistently show retention of the derivative 11 fusion product, suggesting that this product is the critical leukemogenic factor (14Kobayashi H. Espinosa 3rd., R Thirman M.J. Davis E.M. Diaz M.O. Le B.M.M. Rowley J.D. Blood. 1993; 81: 3027-3033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent support for this assertion has come from transgenic mice, where expression of a derivative 11 fusion product resulted in leukemia (15Corral J. Lavenir I. Impey H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Larson T.A. Bell S. McKenzie A.N. King G. Rabbitts T.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). All of the derivative 11 fusion products, hereafter simply called HRX fusion proteins, are essentially composed of common amino-terminal HRX sequences fused to a variety of carboxyl-terminal residues donated from one of 25 partner proteins. The fusion partners are structurally and functionally unrelated except for stretches of acidic residues that are typical of transactivation domains. In at least one case, an HRX fusion partner, the ENL protein has been shown to activate transcription from synthetic reporter genes in both human lymphoid and myeloid cells as well as in yeast (16Rubnitz J.E. Morrissey J. Savage P.A. Cleary M.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, one HRX fusion partner, CBP, has a defined enzymatic activity (the ability to acetylate histones), and this activity is predicted to be present in the HRX-CBP fusion proteins (64Taki T. Sako M. Tsuchida M. Hayashi Y. Blood. 1997; 89: 3945-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65Sobulo O.M. Borrow J. Tomek R. Reshmi S. Harden A. Schlegelberger B. Housman D. Doggett N.A. Rowley J.D. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8732-8737Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The HRX fusion partners likely play an important role in leukemogenesis, as neither simple truncated versions of HRX nor HRX fusion proteins with a partner fused out of frame have been found in leukemias (13Young B.D. Saha V. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 225-245PubMed Google Scholar). Studies that support this idea have recently been done with HRX-ENL. HRX-ENL is able to immortalize hematopoietic stem cellsin vitro. However, neither wild-type ENL nor a deletion mutant of HRX-ENL lacking ENL had in vitro transforming ability (66Lavau C. Szilvassy S.L. Slany R. Cleary M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4226-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Two other variant forms of HRX have been described that are not associated with chromosomal translocations. Cases of acute leukemia have been described where HRX has undergone partial duplication, resulting in leukemic HRX “self-fusion” proteins. These self-fusion proteins have a tandem duplication of amino-terminal sequences encoded by exons 2–6 or 2–8 that result in longer than wild-type proteins (17Schichman S.A. Canaani E. Croce C.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1995; 273: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Many of the duplicated amino-terminal sequences are the same as those found in HRX fusion proteins. Also, deletions of HRX exon 8 have been found in some T-cell acute lymphoid leukemias (18Lochner K. Siegler G. Fuhrer M. Greil J. Beck J.D. Fey G.H. Marschalek R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2171-2177PubMed Google Scholar). To date, an actual transforming capability for the self-fused or exon 8-deleted HRX proteins has not been demonstrated. The HRX fusion proteins contain near their amino termini three closely spaced A·T hooks composed of conserved basic amino acids (see Fig.1 B). The A·T hooks were originally described as a DNA binding motif in the high mobility group protein, HMG-I(Y), a nonhistone chromatin-associated protein that preferentially binds to the minor groove of A·T-rich DNA (19Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A·T hooks are unusual in that they recognize DNA structure rather than nucleotide sequence. Reeves and Wolffe (20Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5063-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have shown that HMG-I(Y) can preferentially bind certain types of A·T-rich DNA located on the surface of mononucleosomes. It has been found that nucleosomes positioned on critical regulatory sequences can repress transcription by making regions inaccessible to trans-acting factors (21Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1780-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) itself has been termed an “architectural transcription factor” because not only can HMG-I(Y) directly bind other transcription factors, but also A·T hook binding to nucleosomal DNA appears to bend or distort promoter/enhancer DNA sequences, possibly making these sequences accessible and thereby overcoming the repressive effects of nucleosomes. Thus, HMG-I(Y) facilitates the binding of transcription factors to DNA and promotes the formation of efficient transcriptional initiation complexes (20Reeves R. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5063-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). HRX A·T hooks also bind DNA. To date, HRX has been shown to bind cruciform DNA and scaffold attachment region (SAR) 1The abbreviations used are: SAR, scaffold attachment region; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; coIP, co-immunoprecipitation. 1The abbreviations used are: SAR, scaffold attachment region; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; coIP, co-immunoprecipitation. DNA (24Zeleznik L.N.J. Harden A.M. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10610-10614Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 25Broeker P.L. Harden A. Rowley J.D. Zeleznik L.N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 259-268PubMed Google Scholar). This capacity for DNA binding suggests that both HRX and HRX fusion proteins function in the cell in part through direct protein-DNA interactions, possibly in a manner similar to HMG-I(Y) proteins. At present little is known about the actual function of theHRX gene in hematopoietic development. Fidanza et al. (26Fidanza V. Melotti P. Yano T. Nakamura T. Bradley A. Canaani E. Calabretta B. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1179-1183PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that homozygous Hrx-deleted embryonic stem cells are blocked in hematopoietic differentiationin vitro. Neither a cognate DNA binding sequence nor a definitive targeted transcriptional unit has been described yet for HRX or HRX fusion proteins. However, a candidate target gene isHoxa-7, a Hox family member that was found to be positively regulated by Hrx, during mouse development (9Yu B.D. Hess J.L. Horning S.E. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).Hoxa-7 is also a common site of proviral integration in the BXH-2 inbred mouse strain. Such a retroviral event is thought to induce myeloid leukemia by the insertional mutation of proto-oncogenes. Proviral integration near Hoxa-7 results inHoxa-7 overexpression and correlates with leukemia (27Nakamura T. Largaespada D.A. Shaughnessy J.D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). An attractive approach to understanding HRX gene function is to identify proteins that interact directly with HRX in vivo. Leshkowitz et al. (28Leshkowitz D. Rozenblatt O. Nakamura T. Yano T. Dautry F. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2027-2031PubMed Google Scholar) have found that a region common to the HRX fusion proteins (amino acids 1–1096) is capable of binding the UNR protein, a protein of unknown function that has a high affinity for single-stranded DNA or RNA (29Jacquemin-Sablon H. Triqueneaux G. Deschamps S. le Maire M. Doniger J. Dautry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2643-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Data extrapolated from yeast have suggested that the HRX fusion partners ENL and AF-9 may interact with the human SNF5 component of the human SWI/SNF complex, a chromatin remodeling system (30Cairns B.R. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3308-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this current study, we show that amino-terminal HRX residues associate with the SET protein and coimmunoprecipitate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity. Our findings suggest that HRX fusion proteins might function in conjunction with SET and PP2A to deregulate cellular growth and differentiation controls resulting in leukemia. Human 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (31DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Portions of HRX were cloned into the expression vector pCS2+MT, which allows for in-frame fusions with six copies of the myc epitope tag under the control of a simian cytomegalovirus promoter (32Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 33Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). pCS884 was made by first cloning the SmaI to SspI fragment of HRX (amino acids 110–405) into the SmaI site of pBSSK+. Then anXbaI to HincII fragment was cloned into theXbaI and SnaBI sites of pCS2+MT. pCSN884 and pCSC884 are chimeric inserts using pCS884 and pCS562 as starting materials. pCS1385EI and pCS1385Bpu both begin at the NotI site of HRX (amino acid 79) and continue to the BspEI (amino acid 329) and Bpu1102 (amino acid 370) sites, respectively. pCS1385 begins at theNotI site of HRX (amino acid 79) and continues to theXbaI site (amino acid 741). pCSAR contains the entire HRX-ENL coding sequence beginning at the AvrII site at amino acid 27, blunted with Klenow fragment, and cloned into theStuI and EcoRI sites of pCS2+MT by a multi-step cloning procedure. pCSARXB is a derivative of pCSAR that expresses the same protein but contains a deletion of an XbaI site in the 3′-untranslated region of the pCS2+MT vector. All other individual fragments were made using a polymerase chain reaction-based method and correspond to the amino acids shown in Fig. 2. The pCSHMG-I vector was made with the NaeI toXbaI fragment of pBSHMG-I (clone 7C) cloned into theStuI and XbaI sites of pCS2+MT (34Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Reeves R. Mol. Cell.

Chada and cloned into the StuI and XbaI sites of pCS2+MT (35Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). pCSSETB3 was made with the EcoRI to NcoI (filled-in) fragment of pBSK(+)27 cloned into the EcoRI andStuI sites of pCS2+MT. This clone contains a full-length myc-SET fusion protein with SET amino acids 1–278. Portions of SET were also cloned into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) that has been modified for in-frame fusions with the eight-amino acid IBI FLAGTM marker peptide (Eastman Kodak Co.) (the kind gift of B. Schubach). The construct pSGSET was made with the BamHI to EcoRI fragment of pBSK(+)27 cloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pSG5+FLAG. The construct pSGNSET was made with the BamHI to MscI fragment of pBSK(+)27 cloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pSG5+FLAG. pSGSET and pSGNSET express FLAG-tagged full-length SET protein and an N-terminal 213-amino acid SET protein, respectively. Mutations were introduced into the human HRX cDNA by incorporation of a phosphorylated oligo during polymerase chain reaction amplification as described by Scott Michael (36Michael S.F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 410-412PubMed Google Scholar), with the substitution of 6 mm magnesium chloride for 10 mm magnesium acetate. The yeast two-hybrid library screening was performed as described by Wu et al. (37Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the bait vector pBTM884 contains an in-frame protein fusion between LexA and HRX; the SmaI to SspI 885-base pair fragment of HRX was cloned into the SmaI site of pBTM116 (38Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The pBTM116 vector contains the yeast TRP1 gene. The bait plasmid was used to transform the yeast strain L40 (MATa his Δ200 trp1–90 leu2–3112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4- HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4 gal80). Subsequently, the strain was transformed with a B-cell cDNA library. The B-cell cDNAs are expressed as fusion proteins with a functional GAL4 activation domain (amino acids 768–881) in the plasmid pSE1107 containing the yeast LEU2 gene. Yeast transformants containing interacting proteins were identified by their ability to grow on plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. GST-HRX fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli XL-2 (Stratagene) using the pGEX884 and pGEX562 plasmids. pGEX884 was made as described above, and pGEX562 was made using the polymerase chain reaction amplification to produce a BamHI/NotI fragment coding for HRX amino acids 161–339, which was subsequently cloned into the respective sites of pGEX-4T-1 plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). In vitro translated 35S-labeled SET protein was made using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Promega) with 35S express label (NEN Life Science Products). The plasmid pBSK(+)27 that contains a cDNA for a β isoform of SET was used. GST-HRX fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads (Sigma) and added toin vitro translated 35S-labeled SET protein in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl). The agarose beads were washed three times with binding buffer. Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels. The gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and dried using a Bio-Rad model 583 gel dryer. Fluorography was performed with Kodak XAR-2 film at −70 °C. Human 293T cells were transiently transfected with HRX constructs using the calcium phosphate transfection method, grown for 2 days, and lysed in high salt lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After sonication and centrifugation, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc mouse monoclonal 9E10 (gift from Jim Roberts, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) followed by protein A Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia). To allow binding of HRX-associated proteins, the pellet (after centrifugation) was resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer and diluted with 900 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl) and gently rocked for 30 min before three final washings with binding buffer. Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 14 V for 40 min in a Trans-Blot (Bio-Rad) semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates was performed with antiserum to SET proteins generously provided by Terry Copeland using 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Western blotting of cell lysates was performed with the anti-myc mouse monoclonal 9E10 described above or with antiserum to SET proteins. To detect primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to either rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) or murine IgG (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:5,000. Bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Bio-Rad). Western blotting of co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) for PP2A was done as described previously by Kremmer et al. (39Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) using the 6G3 monoclonal antibody. Cells were transfected with various constructs, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as described above. Protein phosphatase assays were performed as described by Li et al.(40Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, IPs were assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol with 20 μg of32P-labeled histone H1 as substrate in a final volume of 50 μl. Reagents were added on ice, and reactions began by incubation at 30 °C; after 15 min, the reaction was terminated with 100 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged for 6 min, and 120 μl of the supernatant was counted by Cerenkov counting. The substrate, histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim), was prepared as described by Li et al. (40Li M. Guo H. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1988-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), with the substitutions of 5 units/ml rat brain protein kinase C (Calbiochem) and 20% trichloroacetic acid as suggested by the authors. The final pellet was resuspended in a volume of 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (sodium salt; Sigma) was dissolved in water, serially diluted, and stored at −20 °C. The inhibitor was assayed by addition to the phosphatase reactions described above. PP2A, the generous gift of Marc Mumby was used as the standard in the assays. To identify proteins that interact with HRX and therefore may participate in HRX fusion protein-mediated leukemogenesis, we chose to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen with a fragment of HRX-ENL that contains three A·T hooks. This fragment of HRX was selected because of its similarity to the small architectural transcription factor HMG-I(Y), a protein of only 100 amino acids that also contains three A·T hooks, and because HMG-I(Y) has been shown to have protein-protein binding sites near its A·T hooks. We therefore used HRX884 (Figs.1 A and2), a polypeptide of 295 amino acids including three A·T hooks, to identify proteins that bind to the HRX protein. To identify these proteins, we used a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screen (41Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4837) Google Scholar, 42Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Our “bait” was a fusion between the LexA DNA binding domain and amino acids 110–405 of HRX-ENL (pBTM884). The bait protein was used to screen an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B-lymphocyte cDNA library expressed as fusion proteins joined to an activation domain of GAL4 (amino acids 768–881). These two hybrids were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40, which is able to grow in the absence of histidine if the two hybrid proteins interact, due to restoration of transcriptional activation of the HIS3 gene, which contains four upstream tandem LexA binding sites. Of approximately 450,000 TRP LEUtransformants, 15 were also HIS. A secondary screen showed that all 15 also stained positive for expression of the E. coli β-galactosidase gene (data not shown). The L40 strain contains both reporter genes driven from different promoters each containing LexA binding sites. The 15 presumptive positives were also tested by growing yeast colonies in minimal medium containing tryptophan, resulting in the loss of the DNA binding domain vector (pBTM884) from the reporter strain. Mating tests were then performed with strain AMR70 containing either pBTM884 or a LexA human lamin fusion protein (the human lamin protein displays a high degree of nonspecific binding). The diploid progeny were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. As a final test, library cDNAs in the pSE1107 plasmid were recovered from the yeast by transformation into E. coli. These plasmids were then reintroduced into the L40 yeast strain containing the bait vector pBTM884 to affirm activation of the two reporter genes. Of the 15 candidates, 13 passed these subsequent tests. 10 of the 13 were found to code for SET proteins (43Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both isoforms of SET (previously termed TAF-Iα and TAF-Iβ) were recovered in our screen, four α and six β (44Nagata K. Kawase H. Handa H. Yano K. Yamasaki M. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4279-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These two proteins have different amino termini of 37 amino acids (α) and 24 amino acids (β) but are otherwise identical throughout the other 253 amino acids of their sequences (43Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SET protein is a member of a chimeric fusion protein, SET-CAN, that arises as a result of chromosome translocations in acute undifferentiated leukemia (45von Lindern M. van Baal S. Wiegant J. Raap A. Hagemeijer A. Grosveld G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3346-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A nearly full-length SET protein is present in the SET-CAN fusion with only the last seven amino acids of SET lost upon translocation. SET has homology to the nucleosome assembly protein, NAP1, and has been shown to be an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (46Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We confirmed the yeast two-hybrid results by in vitro binding studies using standard gel retention assays with purified bacterial GST-HRX884 fusion proteins and in vitro translated 35S-labeled SET protein. GST-HRX884 and a truncated version, GST-HRX562, (see Fig. 2for constructs) were tested for their ability to interact with SET. Fig. 3 A shows retention of the 39-kDa SET protein by GST-HRX884 in lanes 3 and4, whereas the negative control GST and GST-HRX562 fails to bind SET in lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5and 6, respectively. These experiments show that the SET protein specifically interacts with GST-HRX884 but not GST-HRX562 and binds residues flanking the central A·T hook triplet in HRX8"

Cytochrome b 5 is a ubiquitous eukaryotic membrane protein that is an essential component of a number of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; OLE1p, S. cerevisiae Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase protein; ORF, open reading frame; GC, gas chromatography; Fah1p,S. cerevisiae fatty acid hydroxylase protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; OLE1p, S. cerevisiae Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase protein; ORF, open reading frame; GC, gas chromatography; Fah1p,S. cerevisiae fatty acid hydroxylase protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EST, expressed sequence tag.-linked redox enzyme systems. One of its primary roles in animal cells is in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids. In the process of double bond formation, the membrane-bound cytochrome b 5 transfers electrons by lateral diffusion from NADH cytochromeb 5 reductase to the Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase (1Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8203-8209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5184-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b 5 also appears to function in other fatty acid-modifying reactions. At least one step in the formation of very long chain fatty acids (20–26 carbons) is thought to be cytochrome b 5-dependent (3Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid. Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound fatty acid elongation systems act independent of the soluble fatty acid synthase complex (4Bessoule J. Lessire R. Rigoulet M. Guein B. Casagne C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Their very long chain products, which in yeast are predominantly 26 carbons in length (26:0), 2Fatty acids are denoted by a standard designation that indicates the number of carbons, followed by the number of double bonds (e.g 26:0, a 26-carbon fatty acid with no double bonds; 16:1, a 16-carbon fatty acid with one double bond). 2Fatty acids are denoted by a standard designation that indicates the number of carbons, followed by the number of double bonds (e.g 26:0, a 26-carbon fatty acid with no double bonds; 16:1, a 16-carbon fatty acid with one double bond). are minor but physiologically important fatty acids that are incorporated into sphingolipids. In these lipids, the hydrophobic ceramide portion is composed of the long chain base phytosphingosine, which is amide-linked to the very long chain fatty acid, the majority of which is hydroxylated at the α-position (5Lester R.L. Wells G.B. Oxford G. Dickson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 845-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Nurminen T. Suomalainen H. Biochem J. 1971; 125: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is suggested that cytochrome b 5 is also the intermediate electron donor for α-hydroxylation (7Shigematsu H. Kishimoto Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1987; 19: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and that this reaction appears to involve the direct hydroxylation of a sphingolipid-bound fatty acid (8Kaya K. Ramesha C.S. Thompson Jr., G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3548-3553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The oleate 12-hydroxylase (FAH12) activity ofRicinus communis is also shown to be dependent upon cytochrome b 5 (10Smith M.A. Jonsson L. Stymne S. Stobart K. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome contains a number of sequences related to cytochrome b 5. A gene encoding a microsomal cytochrome b 5 analogous to the mammalian enzyme, was cloned by Truan et al. (11Truan G. Epinat J.-C. Rougeulle C. Cullin C. Pompon D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is a small 120-amino acid polypeptide that contains the typical carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic membrane-anchoring sequence that is necessary for its binding to the ER (12Vergeres G. Waskell L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12583-12591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also recently identified a cytochrome b 5-like sequence as a carboxyl-terminal extension to the Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase (OLE1). This gene appears to have originated from a fusion of the ancestral cytochrome b 5 and fatty acid desaturase genes. The cytochrome b 5 domain ofOLE1 was shown to be essential for desaturase activity (13Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae Ole1p is not the only occurrence of a cytochrome b 5 gene fusion in eukaryotes. Our analysis of the Histoplasma capsulatum Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase reported by Gargano et al. (14Gargano S. Di Lallo G. Kobayashi G.S. Maresca B. Lipids. 1995; 30: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicates that it also possesses a cytochrome b 5 carboxyl-terminal extension. An amino-terminal cytochrome b 5fusion to a protein similar to an acyl lipid desaturase was found inArabidopsis (15Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and recently an amino-terminal cytochromeb 5 to a Δ-6 fatty acid desaturase was identified in Borago officinalis (16Sayanova O.

A search of the S. cerevisiaegenome 3Available on the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/saccharomyces 3Available on the World Wide Web at http://genome-www.stanford.edu/saccharomyces revealed a presumptive cytochrome b 5-containing gene, YMR272C, which also had the characteristics of a fatty acid desaturase. These enzymes have been shown to contain the conserved general motif HX (2–3)(XH)H, where the histidine residues act to coordinate a μ-oxo-bridged diiron cluster (Fe-O-Fe) that functions as part of the reaction center (18Shanklin J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16927-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The YMR272C ORF contains five putative HX (2–3)(XH)H motifs that are conserved in its homologs. On the basis that this gene might encode a fatty acid-modifying enzyme, GC fatty acid methyl ester profiles of wild type and YMR272C gene-disrupted strains were compared. While no changes in fatty acid desaturation were observed, a peak identified as α-HO 26:0 was shown to be reduced in the disruption strain. Standard molecular biological techniques were used for all cloning procedures (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for the amplification reactions, and the resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pCRscript SK+ vector (Stratagene). Three independent amplifications were confirmed by Sequenase sequencing (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The PCR primers AGM039 and AGM040 (Life Technologies, Inc.) (Table I) were designed to allow amplification of the YMR272C ORF (chromosome XIII base pair coordinates 810777–809623) from DTY-11A genomic DNA (Table II). This PCR product was subcloned to create pAM109. To prepare a gene disruption, the HindIII site of pAM109's multiple cloning site was first destroyed by Klenow fill in and religation (pAM111). This plasmid was then cut asBstEII/NcoI, blunt-ended with Klenow, and religated with HindIII linkers (pAM113). AHindIII-linked LEU2 gene was ligated into this site (pAM116). A linear NotI/PstI DNA fragment was excised from pAM116 and used for transformation of the DTY-10A and 11A strains. The YEASTMAKER yeast transformation system (CLONTECH) was used for these transformations. The resulting transformants were confirmed by PCR and Northern blot analysis, as described previously (13Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 88, 1731–1735Elledge, S. J., Mulligan, J. T., Ramer, S. W., Spottswood, M., and Davis, R. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 88, 1731–1735.Google Scholar). The resulting PCR product was subcloned to create pAM129. For overexpression of the YMR272C andA. thaliana ORFs in yeast, bluntSacI/BamHI fragments of pAM109 and pAM129 were independently ligated into a bluntHindIII/BamHI-cut YCpGAL plasmid (containing the galactose-inducible (GAL1) promoter) to create pAM132 and pAM133, respectively. These plasmids were then transformed into the YMR272C gene disruption strain (fah1 Δ) (TableII). The cytochrome b 5 domain was excised from pAM109 using BstYI, which cuts within YMR272C and at the BamHI site of the polylinker. This 471-base pair fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pET11d (Novagen) and orientation establishing (pAM151). To remove the remaining polylinker and to restore the reading frame, pAM151 was cut as NcoI and SalI, blunt ended with Klenow, and religated (pAM154). The pET11d and pAM154 plasmids were transformed into the BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli expression strain. To induce expression of the recombinant protein, 2 ml of an overnight culture were used to inoculate 100 ml of LB (200 μg/ml ampicillin). The cultures were then grown with shaking (250 rpm) at 37 °C for 2 h. Thirty minutes before induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, a 75 μg/liter concentration of the heme precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid was added (27Nishimoto M. Clark J.E. Siler Masters B.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 32: 8863-8870Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the cells were then grown for 20 h at the reduced temperature of 30 °C (28Schein C.H. Noteborn M.H.M. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 1141-1148Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min and washed once with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then lysed in the same buffer by French press, and the extract was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The soluble fractions were analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 12 spectrometer. Redox absorbance spectra (400–600 nm) were obtained by comparison of air-oxidized against sodium dithionite-reduced samples. Cytochrome b 5content was determined from the α-band absorbance maxima (558 nm) of the reduced cytochrome b 5 using an absorption coefficient of 26.5 mm−1 cm−1(29Ozol J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis as described previously (24Stukey J.E. McDonough V.M. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16537-16544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gas chromatography was performed on a Varian 3400CX GC using a Supelcowax™10 30 m × 0.32 mm column (Supelco) run at 240 °C. Data were collected and analyzed using the Class-VP Chromatography Data System version 4.1 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) software. Gas chromatographic electron-ionizing mass spectroscopy was performed on a Varian 3400 gas chromatograph connected to a Finnigan MAT 8230 mass spectrometer, using the same column under similar conditions. α-Hydroxyhexacosanoic acid (α-hydroxy 26:0) was obtained from Sigma. Sphingolipid and glycerolipid fatty acids were fractionated from logarithmic phase cells as described by Pinto et al. (30Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5% trichloroacetic acid-washed cell pellets were subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis. The methanolic-KOH extract, which contains saponifiable fatty acids, was then acidified and removed from the cell pellet by centrifugation. Sphingolipids were then extracted from the saponified cell pellets with an ethanol/water/diethylether/pyridine/NH4OH (15:15:5:1:0.018) solvent. After drying under nitrogen, sphingolipid fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis. Cytochrome b 5 is an essential component of a number of ER-linked redox enzyme systems. It functions in the modification of xenobiotic substances by P450 enzymes (35Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in a number of fatty acid-modifying enzyme systems, such as desaturation (1Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8203-8209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dailey H.A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 6743-6747Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A number of cytochrome b 5 fusion proteins have recently been reported. These are the OLE1 gene, where the cytochrome b 5 is a carboxyl-terminal extension to the desaturase domain, and two plant genes that include anArabidopsis amino-terminal cytochromeb 5 fusion to a polypeptide similar to the plant acyl lipid desaturases (15Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and a Δ-6 fatty acid desaturase identified in B. officinalis (16Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4211-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The animal Δ-9 fatty acid desaturases do not possess this cytochromeb 5 extension and are dependent on the diffusible microsomal cytochrome b 5 for activity (13Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Our previous observation that the rat desaturase can function in anole1Δ strain is due to the existence of the diffusible microsomal cytochrome b 5 protein, which provides electrons to the mammalian enzyme. The b 5 fold is also found in a number of other heme-binding proteins such the yeast cytochrome b 2, sulfite oxidases, and nitrate reductases (37Guiard B. Lederer F. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 135: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the x-ray crystal structure of the bovine cytochromeb 5, residues 21–78 define a heme-containing crevice, the walls of which are formed by two roughly antiparallel α-helices, with a floor of β-pleated sheets (31Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Histidines 36 and 63 of this region are responsible for binding the heme iron group. This region is highly conserved among eukaryotic cytochromesb 5 and is referred to as the cytochromeb 5 “fold.” The homologous cytochromeb 5 fold amino acid sequence of the yeast microsomal protein (32Lederer F. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was used for the data base search. This search identified a number of cytochrome b 5-like sequences (Table III and Fig.1), including the microsomal cytochromeb 5, the b 5 domain ofOLE1, cytochrome b 2, and a previously undescribed sequence that has 52% identity and 70% similarity to the yeast microsomal cytochrome b 5 heme binding domain. This predicted 1.152-kilobase pair open reading frame is located on chromosome XIII at locus YMR272C and encodes a 384-amino acid protein that contains an approximately 100-amino acid amino-terminal cytochrome b 5 domain (Fig.2).Table IIIResults of a search of the S. cerevisiae genome database for the microsomal cytochrome b5 fold motifGeneChromosomeLocusIdentitySimilarity%%Cytochromeb 5XIVYNL111C100100Identified as FAH1XIIIYMR272C52.269.6OLE1VIIYGL055W43.560.9Cytochromeb 2XIIIYML054C35.360.0 Open table in a new tab Figure 2Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the YMR272C ORF.

These residues appear to be part of a highly dynamic surface that is able to adapt its conformation to interact with numerous substrates (33Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9682-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that this region of the microsomal cytochrome b 5has 13 such residues. YMR272C is comparable in having 11, while Ole1p and cytochrome b 2 each have only 4 of these residues. It was previously proposed (13Mitchell A.G. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29766-29772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that the lower number of charged residues in the b 5 domain of Ole1p results from the reduced need to form many charge-pair interactions with the desaturase domain because this domain is directly linked to its electron-accepting substrate. The closer homology of theb 5 domain of YMR272C to the native cytochromeb 5 may reflect a more recent evolutionary fusion event than the b 5 fusion to the Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase. The different positions of their b 5domains also suggest that the these two fusions occurred as independent evolutionary events rather than the divergence of a commonb 5 fused ancestral gene. The YMR272C ORF was PCR-amplified from wild type DTY-11A genomic DNA, and this sequence was disrupted with the LEU2gene as described under “Materials and Methods.” Linear DNA disruption of this gene in either DTY-10A or 11A did not give any visible phenotype. Wild type levels of growth were observed on media containing either glucose or the nonfermentable carbon source glycerol. Present in the GenBankTM data base are a number of homologs to YMR272C (Z49260). Table IV shows these homologies, and Fig. 3 shows the peptide sequence alignment of these ORFs. Based on the presence of the conserved histidine residues of the b 5 fold, theCaenorhabditis elegans (Z81038) sequence appears to have a cytochrome b 5-like region; however, theSchizosaccharomyces pombe (Z97209) and a reconstructedA. thaliana sequence (Fig. 4) do not.Table IVOrganismAccession numberIdentitySimilarity%%S. cerevisiaeZ49260100100S. pombeZ9720946.067.7A. thaliana4-aSee “Materials and Methods.”42.662.1C. elegansZ8103836.159.94-a See “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab Figure 4Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of theA. thaliana FAH1 ORF.

As reported for the expression of other cytochromes b 5 (16Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 1141-1148Google Scholar), cells containing the cytochrome b 5 sequence appear reddish in color, as compared with pET11d control cell inductions. Spectral analysis of a soluble extract from these cells demonstrates the oxidized versus reduced absorbance differential typical of a cytochrome b 5. Absorbance maxima are observed at 558 and 426 nm (Fig.5). Using the absorption coefficient of 26.5 mm−1 cm−1 for the α-band (558 nm) (29Ozol J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the cytochrome b 5 content was determined to be 7.6 μg/mg of soluble protein extract. This low expression level compares with that reported by Sperling et al. (15Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for the expression of the Arabidopsis acyl desaturase cytochrome b 5 domain. Similarly, the recombinant protein was not detected by SDS-PAGE in initial soluble cell lysate (data not shown). A number of A. thaliana ESTs that have homology to theS. cerevisiae FAH1 gene are present in the GenBankTM data base. This sequence information, which covers almost the whole ORF, allowed us to design PCR primers to amplify the entire coding sequence from a cDNA library (as described under “Materials and Methods”). The sequence of the resulting PCR was found to be consistent with the overlapping EST data, except for a single base discrepancy (C to A at base pair 565; Fig. 4), which converts a threonine to a lysine residue. The lysine residue appears to be more consistent with the multiple sequence alignment data shown in Fig. 3. There is a region of this ORF that is not covered by an EST. The sequence and ORF presented for this region (lowercase letters in Fig. 4) comes from sequenced PCR products (GenBankTM, accession number AF021804). This A. thaliana Fah1p shows 42.6% identity and 62.1% similarity to theS. cerevisiae Fah1p. From the EST data there does not appear to be any cytochrome b 5-like sequences in any reading frame 5′ to the predicted start methionine. Examination of the non-b 5 domain of YMR272C revealed a number of motifs that are found in lipogenic enzymes. Sequence comparisons between known membrane-bound desaturases, including OLE1 and the Arabidopsis sequence (15Sperling P. Schmidt H. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), revealed the conserved general motif HX (2–3)(XH)H. These are a characteristic of membrane-bound desaturases (19Fox B.G.

In inherited prion diseases, mutations in the prion protein (PrPM) engender the conversion of PrPM into PrPres. We developed a cell model of Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, a neurodegenerative condition characterized by PrPM-containing amyloid deposits and neuronal loss, by expressing the Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker haplotype Q217R-129V in human neuroblastoma cells. By comparison to PrPC, this genotype results in the following alterations of PrPM: 1) expression of an aberrant form lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, 2) increased aggregation and protease resistance, and 3) impaired transport to the cell surface. Most of these alterations are temperature-sensitive, indicating that they are due to misfolding of PrPM.

Prion diseases include inherited and sporadic forms as well as forms that are acquired by infection (1Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 1-7Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). They are commonly associated with three major phenotypes referred to as: 1) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 1The abbreviations used are: CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; GSS, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; FFI, fatal familial insomnia; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase-C; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; RITC, rhodamine isothyocyanate; PK, proteinase K; PNGase,N-glycosidase-F; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]-glycine; Endo-H, endoglycosidase H. 2) fatal familial insomnia (FFI), and 3) Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) (1Parchi P.

All prion diseases are believed to share the same basic pathogenic mechanism that involves the conversion of a normal protein called cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a form that is partially resistant to proteases (PrPres) and is infectious (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4611-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PrPC, a glycoprotein encoded by a gene (PRNP) located on human chromosome 20 (3Prusiner S.B. DeArmond S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), undergoes the non-obligatory addition of one or two N-linked oligosaccharide chains leading to the expression of three glycoforms containing none, one, or two glycans (4Haraguchi T.

Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). PrPC is transported to the plasma membrane through the secretory pathway and is then reinternalized and cleaved in the endocytic compartment to generate N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, the latter being returned to the cell surface (9Harris D.A. Huber M.T. van Dijken P. Shyng S.L. Chait B.T. Wang R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 10Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC to PrPres entails the switch from a predominantly α-helical to a β-sheet conformation resulting in a form that, beside being protease-resistant and infectious, is insoluble in non-ionic detergents, has the propensity to aggregate, and can polymerize into amyloid fibrils (2Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4611-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In sporadic prion diseases, PrPres is thought to form initially as the result of a spontaneous stochastic event, and the conversion process would then be maintained autocatalytically by the endogenous PrPres. In inherited prion diseases, it has been hypothesized that the mutant PrP (PrPM) spontaneously converts into PrPres (11DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 785-811PubMed Google Scholar). A distinctive feature of inherited prion diseases is the phenotypic heterogeneity (1Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Semin. Virol. 1996; 7: 1-7Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). One determinant of this heterogeneity is thePRNP codon 129, the site of a common methionine (129M)/valine (129V) polymorphism (12Goldfarb L.G. Brown P. Goldgaber D. Am. J. Hum. Genect. 1989; 45 (abstr.): 189Google Scholar). Therefore, the PRNPdeterminant of the phenotype in inherited prion diseases is the haplotype established by the pathogenic mutation and codon 129. The Q217R-129V haplotype, which segregates with GSS, is associated with a phenotype characterized by prominent PrP deposits, often with the characteristics of amyloid, which contain PrPres forms of all sizes but especially N-terminal and C-terminal truncated forms (13Tagliavini F. Prelli F. Porro M. Rossi G. Giaccone G. Farlow M.R. Dloughy S.R. Ghetti B. Bugiani O. Frangione B. Cell. 1994; 79: 695-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To understand the individual steps involved in the pathogenesis of inherited prion diseases, we have generated several transfected cell models using a human neuroblastoma cell system to characterize PrPM. In this study we report on the metabolism of the PrPM expressed in cells transfected with the Q217R-129VPRNP construct. We observed complex changes in the biogenesis of PrPM which include the following: 1) expression of aberrant PrPM forms, some of which lack the GPI anchor and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-cis Golgi compartment; 2) presence of aggregated forms that exhibit decreased protease sensitivity in intracellular compartments and fail to reach the plasma membrane; and 3) underrepresentation of PrPM at the cell surface. Remarkably, these changes largely revert at reduced temperature, suggesting that abnormal folding of PrPM plays a major role in the pathogenesis of this GSS variant.

Farquhar, University of California, San Diego), and anti-cathepsin-D (R. A. Nixon, Harvard University). In a typical experiment, 9 × 106 cells were used for each condition. An equal amount of total protein was used from cells expressing either normal or mutant PrP. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid according to the manufacturer (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To detect PrP molecules in cellular extracts, cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 10 mm EDTA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, Tris 20 mm, NaCl 150 mm, pH 7.4), containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 290 × g, and the protein in the supernatant was precipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C. Cellular proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) for 2.5 h at 70 V at 4 °C. Membranes containing transferred proteins were blocked in TBS containing 10% non-fat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C and probed with anti-PrP antibodies (anti-N diluted 1:4000, 3F4 diluted 1:50,000, or anti-C diluted 1:3000) dissolved in antibody dilution buffer (TBS, 1% normal goat serum and 0.05% bovine serum albumin) as described (18Chen S.G.

Immunoreactive bands were detected with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (anti-rabbit diluted 1:3000 and anti-mouse diluted 1:4000) and visualized on autoradiographic film by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). To quantitate the relative density of immunoreactive bands, exposed autoradiographic film was scanned at 42-mm resolution with a GE10 densitometer and quantitatively analyzed using Quantity One software (PDIG20, QS30). To detect PI-PLC-cleaved PrP in the culture medium, cells were treated with PI-PLC as described below, and the released PrP was methanol-precipitated and detected as described above. Cells plated overnight in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed with Opti-MEM without serum and incubated with 59 ng/ml PI-PLC in fresh medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 290 ×g to pellet cell debris. PI-PLC-released proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the PrP was detected by immunoblotting as described above. Unlabeled proteins or radiolabeled, immunoprecipitated PrP were re-precipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol and resuspended in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). Samples were boiled for 10 min and deglycosylated with PNGase-F (1000 units in 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) or endoglycosidase-H (1000 units in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5) for 1–3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were re-precipitated with 5 volumes of cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h, dissolved in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE fluorography. For immunofluorescent staining of cell surface PrP, cells were grown to 50% confluency on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips 18–24 h before staining. Cells were rinsed with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 3F4 antibody (diluted 1:25) at 4 °C for 35 min. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for an additional 35 min at 4 °C. After thorough rinsing with PBS, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and mounted on a glass slide in 95% glycerol containing 2% N-propyl gallate. Surface immunofluorescence/cell was quantitated by estimating the intensity of 10 different fields, divided by the number of cells. For intracellular staining, cells were washed as above and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. All subsequent processing was done at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS as above, free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Nonspecific sites were blocked with PBS containing 10% goat serum, followed by 0.2% gelatin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-PrP antibody (3F4) followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 35–40 min each. For subcellular immunolocalization, subsequent incubations were done with anti-calnexin, anti-α-mannosidase II, or anti-cathepsin D antibodies, respectively, followed by RITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cells were rinsed in PBS, mounted, and observed using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Bio-Rad). In a typical pulse-chase experiment, ∼9.6 × 106 cells plated overnight in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were used for each time point. Cells were washed with methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and preincubated in the same medium for 1 h at 37 or 24 °C. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with 0.166 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN) in labeling medium (methionine-cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% dialyzed serum) for 2 or 30 min at 37 or 24 °C, as indicated. The cells were washed and chased in serum-free Opti-MEM with 1 mm cold methionine and cysteine for indicated times. Where indicated, PI-PLC was added 30 min before the end of chase, and the cells were reincubated at 37 °C. At the end of the chase, the medium was collected, and the cells were washed with cold PBS followed by lysis in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin, and 1 mmPMSF. Clarified cell lysate and medium samples were rocked overnight with anti-PrP antibodies in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine. Protein-antibody complexes were collected with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and washed four times with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.1 mm PMSF). Bound protein was eluted by boiling in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE fluorography. PrP bands were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of Western blot lysis buffer (TBS, Tris 20 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 10 mm, Nonidet P-40 0.5% and deoxycholate 0.5%) containing protease inhibitors and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 ×g in a Beckman SW50 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant was collected, and the pellet fraction was redissolved in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins in the supernatant and pellet fraction were precipitated with cold methanol at −20 °C for 2 h, dissolved in sample buffer, and immunoblotted as above. For proteinase K treatment, cells were lysed as above in the absence of protease inhibitors, and clarified lysates were treated with 3.3 μg/ml proteinase K for 5 or 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm PMSF, and the proteins were methanol-precipitated and immunoblotted. Subconfluent cell cultures were washed with PBS (containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and biotinylated at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml cold sulfo-NHS-biotin (dissolved in PBS) for 10–15 min, as described (19Singh N. Liang L.-N. Tykocinski M.L. Tartakoff A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12879-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Excess biotin was quenched with 50 mmglycine in PBS. The cells were washed with PBS, lysed as above, and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min. PrP in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated as described above, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P. Biotinylated PrP molecules were revealed by blotting with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Alternatively, biotinylated cellular proteins were retrieved by incubating the cell lysate at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose for 16–18 h. Non-biotinylated cellular proteins in the supernatant were methanol-precipitated and dissolved in sample buffer. Biotinylated proteins were recovered after washing the beads several times with increasing stringency and eluting bound proteins by boiling in sample buffer (20Le Bivic A. Real F.X. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9313-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Intracellular and biotinylated samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of PrP in each was revealed by immunoblotting with 3F4 or anti-C antibody. N and C termini of the 32-kDa form were evaluated by peptide mapping using endoproteases Asp-N and Lys-C. Cells were radiolabeled in the presence of tunicamycin to achieve a clear separation between the 27-kDa normal and 30-kDa aberrant form on SDS-PAGE. After immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, the bands were visualized by autoradiography, excised, and soaked in elution buffer (Tris 20 mm, pH 8.0, SDS 1%, dithiothreitol 2 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. The gel pieces were homogenized and incubated at 60 °C for 2 h, followed by treatment with 5 mm iodoacetic acid for 1 h at 4 °C. The gel debris was removed by centrifugation of the homogenate in a Micropure filter (0.22 mm) inserted into a Microcon 10 unit (Amicon) at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein sample was digested overnight at 37 °C with Asp-N or Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, as described (17Monari L. Chen S.C. Brown P. Parchi P. Petersen R.B. Mikol J. Gray F. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Ghetti B. Goldfarb L.G. Gajdusek D.C. Lugaresi E. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2839-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were separated on Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (21Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar) and visualized by fluorography. Immunoblots of the total cell-associated PrPCstained with the 3F4 antibody to PrP residues 109–112 show three distinct bands corresponding to the three PrP glycoforms as follows: a diffuse band of 33–42 kDa with two highly modified glycans (H), an intermediate band of 29–30 kDa with one complex glycan (I), and a discrete band of 27 kDa representing the unglycosylated form (U) (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) (6Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the H and I forms co-migrate with the unglycosylated form at 27 kDa upon deglycosylation with N-glycosidase-F (PNGase-F) (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Deglycosylation also reveals an additional minor band that migrates at 20 kDa and, probably, represents the N-terminal truncated PrP fragment designated as “C2” in a previous study (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and4) (18Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This band is more prominent in radiolabeling experiments (see below). Immunoblots reacted with the anti-C terminus (anti-C) antibody to PrP residues 220–231 reveal two additional minor bands migrating at ∼22 and 18 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) which are N-terminal truncated forms of the I and U isoforms, and lack the 3F4 epitope (IT, UT; Ref. 18Chen S.G. Teplow D.B. Parchi P. Teller J.K. Gambetti P. Autilio-Gambetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19173-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These two bands are also more prominent following radiolabeling (see below). The N-terminal truncated H form is not detectable probably because it is obscured by the full-length forms. However, it is likely to comigrate at 18 kDa with the truncated I and U forms following PNGase-F treatment since the 18-kDa band markedly increases following deglycosylation (Fig.1 B, lane 2). Immunoblots to detect PrPM with the 3F4 antibody show a prominent band of 32 kDa in addition to the three glycoforms present in PrPC (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) (see below for detailed description). The pattern after deglycosylation is similar to that of PrPC, except that the deglycosylated product of 32-kDa form migrates at 30 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Immunoblots with the anti-C antibody demonstrate that PrPMdiffers from PrPC in three ways as follows: 1) the I truncated form is replaced by ill defined bands of 25–22 kDa (Fig.1 B, lane 3); 2) deglycosylation reveals additional truncated forms at approximately 17 and 14 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 4); and 3) the 32-kDa PrPM form is not detected by the anti-C antibody. Quantitative analyses reveal that the total amounts of cell-associated PrPM and PrPC are not significantly different (total PrPM 92 ± 7% of total PrPC;n = 8), but the percentage distribution of the various glycoforms differs and shows greater than 50% reduction of the PrPM U form. The H, I, and U glycoforms account for 47 ± 9, 33 ± 9, and 7 ± 3%, respectively, of the total PrPM and are significantly different (p < 0.006) from the corresponding values of PrPC that are 64 ± 5; 20 ± 3, and 15 ± 2%, respectively. The 32-kDa form accounts for 11 ± 3% of the total PrPM. Cell surface PrPC was released with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that specifically cleaves GPI anchors. Immunoblots of the released protein reacted with the 3F4 or anti-C antibodies reveal the same forms as in total cell extracts, i.e. all three full-length and truncated PrPC forms (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and3). The amount of cell surface PrPM released by PI-PLC is 45 ± 21% (p < 0.03; n= 4) less than that of PrPC, and the I and U truncated forms and the 32-kDa form are not detected (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2and 4). The underrepresentation of PrPM at the cell surface after PI-PLC cleavage may be due to its resistance to PI-PLC because of aggregation or aberrant association with the plasma membrane (22Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24589-24597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 23Lehmann S. Harris D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined cell surface expression of PrPC and PrPM by biotinylation and immunofluorescence. PrPC and PrPM present at the cell surface were biotinylated and either 1) immunoprecipitated, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by blotting with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase or 2) retrieved with streptavidin-agarose following cell lysis, fractionated, and detected by immunoblotting. The results obtained with either of these procedures are similar to those obtained with PI-PLC cleavage and show a reduction of the total surface PrPM of 48 ± 23% (p < 0.006;n = 4) (data not shown). The PrPC and PrPM present on the plasma membrane were further investigated by quantitative immunofluorescence using 3F4 (Fig. 1 D). Compared with PrPC, the fluorescence intensity of PrPM preparations is reduced on average by 62 ± 3% (p < 0.0004;n = 3), further confirming the underrepresentation of PrPM (Fig. 1 D, panel 1 versus 2). Treatment with PI-PLC results in a 57 ± 8% decrease of the immunofluorescence associated with PrPC and 77 ± 5% of that associated with PrPM (Fig. 1 D, panel 3 versus 4). Together, these findings show that although comparable amounts of total PrPM and PrPC are present in the intracellular compartments, PrPM is underrepresented at the plasma membrane, consistent with its impaired transport to that cell locale. In addition, PrPM is processed aberrantly, producing at least two additional fragments of 14 and 17 kDa. Therefore, metabolic studies were carried out to investigate the synthesis, processing, turnover, and transport of PrPMemploying a pulse-chase paradigm. Immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized PrP with 3F4 after a 2-min labeling with Tran35S-label reveals three bands that are common to both PrPC and PrPM. The two upper bands represent the precursors of the H and I forms (HP, IP; Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 5, upper panel) and exhibit gel mobilities different from those of the mature forms because they contain immature glycans. The lowest band comigrates with the U form (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 5, upper panel) (6Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PrPM preparations show two additional forms migrating at 32 and 24 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 5, upper and lower panels, respectively). After a 40-min chase period, modification of the high mannose core glycans yields the mature H and I glycoforms that were observed in the immunoblots (Fig.2 A, lanes 4 and 8, upper panel). An additional 20-kDa form is detected in both PrPC and PrPMpreparations. Thus, the synthesis and early kinetics of the H, I, and U forms are comparable in both PrPC and PrPMcells. However, when chased for longer times, the turnovers of PrPC and PrPM are markedly different (Fig.2 B). Following a 30-min labeling and chase periods from 1 to 6 h, “intracellular” (i.e. PI-PLC-treated) PrPC and PrPM progressively decrease in quantity, although PrPM decreases more rapidly, becoming less than half the amount of PrPC after a 6-h chase (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–5 versus 6–10). The 32-kDa form is relatively stable for 2 h and decreases thereafter (Figs. 2 B, lanes 6–10). Throughout the chase, this form accounts for 21–45% of the cell-associated PrPM, whereas the 24-kDa peptide, which is less represented, becomes undetectable after a 2-h chase (Fig.2 B, lanes 6–10). Immunoprecipitation of the intracellular PrPM with the anti-C antibody indicates that the truncated forms are more prominent in PrPM than in the PrPC preparations after 2 or 4 h of chase (Fig.2 C, lanes 3–5 versus 8–10). The PrP released from the plasma membrane by PI-PLC, and immunoprecipitated with the 3F4 antibody, peaks at the 2-h chase time point in both PrPC and PrPM cells (Fig.2 D, lanes 3 and 8). The amount of PrPM released is approximately 60% less than that of PrPC (17 ± 5% versus 42 ± 7% of the total cell-associated PrPM and PrPC, respectively; p < 0.002; n = 3) (Fig.2 D, lanes 7–10 versus 2–5), and only the H form of PrP is detected at the surface of the mutant cells (Fig. 2 D, lanes 7–10), whereas all three full-length glycoforms are well represented in the control cells (Fig. 2 D, lanes 2–5). Immunoprecipitation of the PI-PLC-released PrPC with the anti-C antibody reveals a delay in the appearance of the I- and U-truncated forms with respect to the full-length forms (Fig. 2 E, 3–5) consistent with the notion that these peptides result from the cleavage of full-length PrP (9Harris D.A.

In contrast, in PrPM cells, the ill-defined 25–22 kDa (probably corresponding to PrPC I-truncated form) and the U-truncated forms are not transported to the surface in significant quantities (Fig. 2 C, lanes 8–10 versus Fig. 2 E lanes 8–10).

In vivo cross-linking studies were performed to establish at the biochemical level the interaction between FhuA and TonB. In an E. coli strain in which both proteins were expressed from the chromosome, a high molecular mass complex was detected when the ferrichrome homologue ferricrocin was added immediately prior to addition of cross-linker. The complex included both proteins; it was absent from strains of E. coli that were devoid of either FhuA or TonB, and it was detected with anti-FhuA and anti-TonB monoclonal antibodies. These results indicate that,in vivo, the binding of ferricrocin to FhuA enhances complex formation between the receptor and TonB. An in vitro system was established with which to examine the FhuA-TonB interaction. Incubation of TonB with histidine-tagged FhuA followed by addition of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose led to the specific recovery of both TonB and FhuA.

High affinity iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria such asEscherichia coli is a stepwise process that involves recognition of a ferric iron chelator (siderophore) by a receptor within the outer membrane, translocation of the siderophore-Fe(III) complex into the periplasm, and internalization of the iron by a cytoplasmic membrane permease in a periplasmic binding protein-dependent manner (reviewed in Refs. 1Postle K.

Myers P.S. Skare J.T. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physical association between TonB and a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor was first demonstrated biochemically byin vivo cross-linking experiments in which TonB was coupled to the E. coli enterobactin (also known as enterochelin) receptor, FepA (17Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding substantiated genetic analyses that suggested interactions between TonB and other outer membrane transporters, namely the ferrichrome-iron receptor FhuA (18Schöffler H. Braun V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 19Günter K. Braun V. FEBS Lett. 1990; 274: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and the vitamin B12 receptor BtuB (20Heller K. Kadner R.J. Günter K. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 64: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Bell P.E. Nau C.D. Brown J.T. Konisky J. Kadner R.J. J.

However, formation of the FepA-TonB complex appeared to be independent of the presence of ferric enterobactin, since the strains used carried mutations in the enterobactin biosynthetic genes and were negative on chrome azurol S plates used for detecting siderophore excretion (23Schwyn B. Neilands J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, TonB did not appear to form cross-links with any of the other outer membrane receptors. BtuB and FhuA have subsequently been shown to compete for a limiting amount of TonB function; ferrichrome decreased the rate of vitamin B12 transport, and, conversely, vitamin B12 inhibited ferrichrome uptake if BtuB were overexpressed (24Kadner R.J. Heller K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4829-4835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results imply that ligand-bound outer membrane receptors have a means of signaling to TonB that they are occupied. Indeed, outer membrane receptors have been demonstrated to change conformations following addition of cognate ligands (25Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13274-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Turnbull J. Ismail A.A. Coulton J.W. Mol.

Science. 1997; 276: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The binding of ferrichrome-iron to purified FhuA led to a conformational change in the receptor detectable both as a reduction in reactivity of certain anti-FhuA mAbs and as a gain in resistance to trypsinolysis at lysine 67 but not at lysine 5 of FhuA (26Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Turnbull J. Ismail A.A. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We proposed that such a conformational change in FhuA may act as a signal to TonB in vivo, indicating that the receptor is loaded with ligand. To understand the functional relevance of the ligand-induced conformational change in FhuA and to investigate whether receptors other than FepA can form complexes with TonB, we initiated studies of FhuA-TonB interactions. We now report that FhuA can be cross-linked to TonB and that the cross-linking between FhuA and TonB is significantly enhanced by the presence of the ligand ferricrocin. Additionally, we have established an in vitro system with which to evaluate the coupling between FhuA and TonB and the effect of normally membrane-impermeant macromolecules upon the interaction. Complementary results from in vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that ligand binding to FhuA enhanced its physical association with TonB.

FeCl3 was added to a final concentration of either 2 μm (for tonBstrains) or 20 μm (for aroB andentF strains). Cultures were grown with aeration at 37 °C to an A 550 of 0.5 (spectrophotometer path length, 1.5 cm). Ten nmol of the FhuA-specific hydroxamate siderophore ferricrocin-iron (hereafter referred to as ferricrocin) was added to 1 ml of cells at 0.5A 550 (ml) equivalents in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8. Following an incubation of 5 min, formaldehyde was added to a final concentration of 1%. Cross-linking (17Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol.

Lysine, cysteine, and tyrosine, and to a lesser extent tryptophan, histidine, aspartate, and arginine, are targets for cross-linking by formaldehyde (37Means G.E. Feeney R.E.

After formaldehyde cross-linking, cells were pelleted and solubilized in 4 × concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer with heating at 60 °C for 5 min. SDS-solubilized proteins (0.25 A 550 (ml) equivalents/lane) were resolved (200 mA·h/gel) on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 1/30 volume of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by two passes through a French cell press (Aminco) at 18,000 p.s.i., 4 °C. The cleared cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet unbroken cells and much of the outer membrane fraction (40Nikaido H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged at 185,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellet from ultracentrifugation, enriched for cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (40Nikaido H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), was solubilized with stirring for 45 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2% LDAO, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to give a total soluble protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml. Extracts were stored at −20 °C. Immediately prior to column experiments the samples were thawed, diluted 10-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% LDAO, 100 mm NaCl (TLN) plus 5 mm imidazole, and filtered over 0.45-μm pore size cellulose acetate filters (Millipore Corp.). Hexahistidine-tagged FhuA (FhuA.H6) from the outer membrane of the E. coli K-12 strain AW740(pHX405) was purified to apparent homogeneity over Ni2+-NTA-agarose (26Moeck G.S. Tawa P. Xiang H. Turnbull J. Ismail A.A. Coulton J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To construct the FhuA.H6-Ni2+-NTA-agarose column, a 2-mg aliquot of concentrated FhuA.H6 was diluted 1:10 in TLN and loaded onto a bed of 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose in an HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used for all column chromatography. The column was washed with 10 volumes of TLN plus 5 mm imidazole. A sample of TLN-solubilized proteins from the ultracentrifugation pellet of E. coli strain GSM02 containing TonBΔ66–100 was loaded onto the column. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of TLN plus 5 mmimidazole and a linear gradient of imidazole to 500 mm was applied over 20 column volumes. A major peak was eluted at an imidazole concentration of approximately 80 mm. Samples (8 μl) of column fractions (1 ml) were mixed with an equal volume of 4 × concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, and then resolved on 9% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with anti-FhuA and anti-TonB mAbs. The primary antibodies were detected either with an anti-mouse κ chain-specific alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (187.1; Ref. 41Yelton D.E. Desaymard C. Scharff M.D. Hybridoma. 1981; 1: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) followed by visualization using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium or with a goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence. In a parallel experiment, a duplicate 2-mg aliquot of concentrated FhuA.H6 was diluted 1:10 in TLN, mixed with a 20-fold molar excess of ferricrocin, and loaded onto a bed of 1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin. Addition of solubilized proteins from E. coli strain GSM02 (containing TonBΔ66–100), column washing, and elution with imidazole was performed exactly as described above for the FhuA.H6 sample. To eliminate the possibility that the presence of TonBΔ66–100 in the eluate was due to some affinity of TonBΔ66–100 for the Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin, the experiment was repeated without application of FhuA.H6 to the resin. To investigate the influence of FhuA-specific ligands upon the protein-protein interaction, an in vitro experiment of smaller scale was devised. Aliquots (5 μg) of either FhuA.H6 or FhuAΔ021–128.H6 in TLN were incubated in solution with a 20-fold molar excess of ferricrocin, with 50 μl of undiluted RK4691 cell lysate containing colicin M (Ref. 34Carmel G. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 28-fold dilution of stock gave a clear zone of lysis on the indicator strain MC4100), with 50 μl of undiluted AY261 cell lysate containing microcin 25 (Ref. 42Salomón R.A. Farı́as R.N. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7428-7435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; 28-fold dilution of stock gave a clear zone of lysis), or with 1011 plaque-forming units of the FhuA-specific phages T5 or φ80 for 10 min. All incubations were at 25 °C. For some experiments, hybridoma supernatants (specific Ig concentration, 5–10 μg/ml) containing anti-FhuA mAbs Fhu8.3 (G2a isotype), Fhu5.1 (G3 isotype), Fhu6.3 (M isotype), or Fhu8.1 (A isotype) were then added and incubated for another 10 min. These mAbs bind determinants located between amino acids 1–20, 21–59, 381–417, and 417–550 of FhuA, respectively (35Moeck G.S. Ratcliffe M.J.H. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6118-6125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To these mixtures was added an aliquot (100 μl) of TLN-solubilized lysate (total protein concentration ∼1 mg/ml) from KP1060fhuA cells, prepared as described above. In some experiments, the TLN-solubilized lysate from KP1060fhuAcells was mixed with 1 μl of a 1 mm stock of either peptide 1 (corresponding to amino acids 1–18 of FhuA) or peptide 2 (corresponding to amino acids 636–651 of FhuA) for 10 min prior to the addition of the TonB-containing sample to FhuA.H6. Before use, the pH of the peptide solutions was adjusted to neutrality with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After a 15-min incubation, 2.5 μl of TLN-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin was added and mixed for 10 min. The resin was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with TLN containing 5 mm imidazole, and bound proteins were eluted by addition of 30 μl of TLN containing 50 mm EDTA. Aliquots (5 μl) of the eluate were mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 1 min, and loaded onto 9% polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and probed with anti-FhuA mAb Fhu8.4 and anti-TonB mAb 4H4, both of which are of the G1 isotype. Primary antibodies were detected by goat anti-mouse IgG1-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and chemiluminescence. Relative amounts of FhuA.H6, FhuAΔ021–128.H6, and TonB were assessed by scanning (Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIcx flatbed scanner; 600 dots per inch resolution as a black and white photo; default settings of brightness and contrast) of the developed x-ray film and quantitation (ImageQuant software, Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) of the bands by volume integration. To account for slight differences in loading of FhuA, TonB bands were normalized relative to each FhuA.H6band after background subtraction. At least three replicates of experiments with FhuA.H6 were performed. Previous results demonstrated the existence of a high molecular mass complex containing both FepA and TonB (17Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We posited that a complex between FhuA and TonB could be identified by using a similar in vivoformaldehyde cross-linking protocol. The anti-TonB mAb 4H4 detected prominent bands with apparent molecular masses of 57–59 kDa and ∼175 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Anti-TonB mAb-reactive bands with relative mobilities greater than the band at 69 kDa are not displayed because they have been characterized previously (10Larsen R.A. Thomas M.G. Wood G.E. Postle K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Larsen R.A. Myers P.S. Skare J.T. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J.

It should be noted that unequivocal assignments of molecular masses of bands based on their mobility in SDS-PAGE was not possible (as noted in Refs. 16Larsen R.A. Myers P.S. Skare J.T. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1363-1373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 17Skare J.T. Ahmer B.M.M. Seachord C.L. Darveau R.P. Postle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since formaldehyde cross-links are heat-labile, protein samples were not completely denatured by boiling prior to application to the polyacrylamide gel. The prominent band of ∼175 kDa was present in cells in which FhuA was expressed at chromosomal levels (E. coli strain SG303) but absent from SG303fhuA cells. This band was detected when FhuA was expressed from the multicopy plasmid pGC01 in SG303fhuA cells but was lost in the isogenictonB::kan strain GSM01(pGC01). This band therefore represented a candidate FhuA-TonB complex. To establish the specificity of the candidate FhuA-TonB complex, the effect of adding the FhuA-specific siderophore ferricrocin immediately prior to formaldehyde cross-linking was examined. Ferricrocin induced the appearance of the band migrating to ∼175 kDa in strain SG303 and increased the abundance of the complex in SG303fhuA(pGC01). Addition of ferricrocin did not significantly change the SDS-soluble protein profile of either SG303fhuA or GSM01(pGC01). To verify that the ∼175-kDa complex contained FhuA, an identical panel of cross-linked proteins was probed by immunoblotting with the anti-FhuA mAb Fhu8.3 (Fig. 1 B). In the SDS-soluble cross-linked proteins from strain SG303, the most prominent band corresponded to monomeric wild-type FhuA of 80 kDa. Less intensely mAb-reactive bands of ∼90, 100, and 110 kDa were also identified. Upon longer exposures of the x-ray film (Fig. 1 C), a band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼175 kDa was detected in the SDS-soluble extract from SG303 cells that had been preincubated with ferricrocin. As was apparent upon probing with the anti-TonB mAb, no band migrating to ∼175 kDa was present when FhuA was expressed from the chromosome in the absence of exogenously added ferricrocin. The formation of this ∼175-kDa complex was dependent upon both FhuA and TonB since in strains SG303fhuA and GSM01(pGC01) the complex was absent. Furthermore, the complex that was detected by the anti-FhuA mAb displayed an identical pattern of abundance as influenced by addition of ferricrocin. These data therefore demonstrated that a complex between FhuA and TonB was formed in vivo and that its amount increased by preincubation with ferricrocin. When FhuA was expressed from the high copy number plasmid pGC01, a family of FhuA-containing, formaldehyde-cross-linked complexes appeared above the FhuA monomer in the range of 90–130 kDa (Fig.1 B). These bands had mobilities identical to the less prominent bands that were seen above the FhuA monomer when FhuA was expressed from the chromosome in strain SG303 (particularly in longer exposures; see Fig. 1 C) and were independent of the presence of TonB since their profile was unchanged between SG303fhuA(pGC01) and GSM01(pGC01). At present, we have not established the identity of these FhuA-containing complexes. A similar set of anti-FhuA mAb-reactive bands was disclosed after in vivo cross-linking with E. coli strain SG303fhuA(pCG405) (data not shown). In these experiments, the FhuA-containing complexes migrated slower than the FhuAΔ021–128.H6 monomer, which had a relative mobility of ∼72 kDa. This observation indicates that amino acids 21–128 of FhuA are apparently not required for the formation of these higher molecular mass complexes. We developed anin vitro system with which to examine the interaction between FhuA and TonB and that would allow for further assessment of its specificity. Purified FhuA.H6 protein was applied to a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. Detergent-solubilized samples containing TonB were introduced into the column, the resin was washed and bound proteins were eluted with imidazole. Initial experiments showed that trace amounts of wild-type TonB were retained by the Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin even in the absence of FhuA.H6. Two modifications were employed to circumvent this limitation. We postulated that the proline-rich region of TonB might be responsible for the interaction"
https://openalex.org/W1992555003,"The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is able to modulate gene activity by binding to its response element, interacting with other transcription factors, and contacting several accessory proteins such as coactivators. Here we show that GRIP120, one of the factors we have identified to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor, is identical to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), a nuclear matrix protein binding to RNA as well as to scaffold attachment regions. GR·hnRNP U complexes were identified by blotting and coimmunoprecipitation. The subnuclear distribution of GR and hnRNP U was characterized by indirect immunofluorescent labeling and confocal laser microscopy demonstrating a colocalization of both proteins. Using a nuclear transport-deficient deletion of hnRNP U, nuclear translocation was seen to be dependent on GR and dexamethasone. Transient transfections were used to identify possible interaction domains. Overexpressed hnRNP U interfered with glucocorticoid induction, and the COOH-terminal domains of both proteins were sufficient in mediating the transcriptional interference. A possible functional role for this GR binding-protein in addition to its binding to the nuclear matrix, to RNA, and to scaffold attachment regions is discussed. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is able to modulate gene activity by binding to its response element, interacting with other transcription factors, and contacting several accessory proteins such as coactivators. Here we show that GRIP120, one of the factors we have identified to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor, is identical to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), a nuclear matrix protein binding to RNA as well as to scaffold attachment regions. GR·hnRNP U complexes were identified by blotting and coimmunoprecipitation. The subnuclear distribution of GR and hnRNP U was characterized by indirect immunofluorescent labeling and confocal laser microscopy demonstrating a colocalization of both proteins. Using a nuclear transport-deficient deletion of hnRNP U, nuclear translocation was seen to be dependent on GR and dexamethasone. Transient transfections were used to identify possible interaction domains. Overexpressed hnRNP U interfered with glucocorticoid induction, and the COOH-terminal domains of both proteins were sufficient in mediating the transcriptional interference. A possible functional role for this GR binding-protein in addition to its binding to the nuclear matrix, to RNA, and to scaffold attachment regions is discussed. The nuclear matrix is involved in the structural organization of the chromatin and the integrity of the nucleus. In addition, DNA replication, RNA processing, and gene transcription are connected to the nuclear matrix, suggesting matrix interactions with chromatin and transcription factors. Chromatin binding to the nuclear matrix during replication has been reported as well as the enrichment of transcribed genes in this nuclear subcompartment (1Nelkin B.D. Pardoll D.M. Vogelstein B.

HnRNP U belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins that are abundant in the eukaryotic cell nucleus. They are believed to be involved in transcription by participating in pre-mRNA processing (12Dreyfuss G. Philipson L. Mattaj I.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) belongs to the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors, which are ligand-dependent transcription factors (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). They are known to modulate gene transcription by binding to hormone response elements. In addition, several studies have led to the conclusion that interactions of the receptor molecule with other nuclear proteins are important (14Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). In general, these proteins could be divided into three classes: (i) components of the basal transcription machinery; (ii) other transcription factors; and (iii) proteins that interact with the nuclear receptors and transmit the gene regulatory signal to other components of the transcriptional machinery (15Baniahmad A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Papavassiliou A.G. Steroid, Thyroid, and Retinoid Receptors as Transcription Factors. R. G. Landes Company, Austin1997Google Scholar). Several of these last factors have been described which function as coactivators, e.g. RIP140, SRC-1, CBP, and TIF2 (16Cavailles V. Dauvois S. Lhorset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this gave rise to the idea of a functional interaction between nuclear transcription factors and structural components of the nuclear matrix. In our experiments we identified the nuclear matrix protein hnRNP U to be complexed in vivo with the GR. HeLa S3 cells were cultured as described elsewhere (29Eggert M. Moews C.C. Tripier D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30755-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and dexamethasone (Sigma) was added 45 min before harvesting to a final concentration of 10−7m at a density of 5×105 cells/ml. The nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Shapiro et al. (30Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA (N. Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) with minor modifications described by Nickel et al. (31Nickel J. Short M.L. Schmitz A. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4785-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ltk− cells were grown and transfected by the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method as described (32Baniahmad A. Muller M. Steiner C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For hormonal induction experiments the serum was depleted of steroids by charcoal stripping. CAT assays (33Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (32Baniahmad A. Muller M. Steiner C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were carried out 1 day after transfection. The CAT activities shown represent independent triplicate experiments. COS-1 cells were grown in hormone-depleted medium; for immunofluorescent analysis, cells were incubated with 10−7m dexamethasone 2 h before fixation. 800 μg of crude nuclear extract (8 mg/ml) from dexamethasone-induced HeLa S3 cells was incubated with 60 μl of protein A solution (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) and 840 μl of incubation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg of leupeptin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) under mild agitation at 4 °C. After centrifugation (750 × g) for 3 min, the supernatant was incubated with 70 μl of protein A solution that had been mixed with the respective antisera (α-GR antibody kindly provided by Elisabeth Stöcklin, Tumor Biology Center, Freiburg, Germany; α-alien control antibody, kindly provided by Renate Renkawitz-Pohl, Universität Marburg, Germany) for 1.5 h under mild agitation at 4 °C. The solution was centrifuged for 3 min (750 ×g), and the supernatant was removed carefully. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Crude nuclear protein extracts, bacterial protein extracts, and chromatographically purified protein fractions were precipitated as described (34Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Electroblotting was carried out for 2 h in a semidry blotting system with a constant current of 1 mA/cm2 gel using a ternary buffer system (buffer 1: 200 mm Tris, pH 10.4; buffer 2: 20 mm Tris, pH 10.4; buffer 3: 40 mmcaprioc acid, pH 7.6; all buffers contain 20% methanol). After electroblotting the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Germany) was blocked overnight with PBS containing 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) and 5% milk powder (Carnation). The membranes were incubated with the respective antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature and with the secondary, peroxidase-coupled antibody for 1 h. The immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham). The cross-linked far South-Western analysis was performed as described (29Eggert M. Moews C.C. Tripier D. Arnold R. Michel J. Nickel J. Schmidt S. Beato M. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30755-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear protein extracts were separated on different columns, and buffers and conditions were as described recently (29Eggert M. Moews C.C. Tripier D. Arnold R. Michel J. Nickel J. Schmidt S. Beato M. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30755-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) except for heparin-Sepharose, where a linear gradient between 0 and 1 m salt was applied. Positive fractions were identified by cross-linked far South-Western analysis. Fractions highly enriched for GRIP120 were separated by preparative SDS-PAGE, and protein digestion and reversed phase HPLC separation and microsequencing were performed as described (36Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The cells were incubated for 30 min with a blocking solution containing 10% glycerol, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm glycine. Antibody incubations were done in incubation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). Cells were incubated for 45 min with the respective polyclonal antibodies against hnRNP U (37Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or against human α-fibrillarin diluted 1:100 or 1:400, respectively. An FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dakopatts) or an FITC-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Cappel Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody. After fixation, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of the monoclonal antibody BuGR2 (Dianova) and a TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dakopatts). DNA staining was done in PBS containing 3 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindol). The slides were embedded in 50% glycerol and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2.2.2)-octane). Transfected cells were treated as described above and incubated with monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the specific c-Myc epitope and a TRITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dakopatts). A Leitz DMRXE confocal laser microscope was used for analysis of subnuclear distribution. The model-based segmentation algorithm used to extract the parameters of labeled nuclear domains is described in detail elsewhere (38Bornfleth H. Zink D. Sätzler K. Eils R. Cremer C. Jähne B. Geissler P. Haussecker H. Hering B. Modellgestützte Segmentierung von Replikationsdomänen in dreidimensionalen konfokalen Mikroskopiebildern. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1996: 408-419Google Scholar). The distribution of distances between differentially labeled nuclear targets was compared with a random distance distribution that resulted from a Monte Carlo simulation. It consisted of 50 model cell nuclei with the following parameters, which were taken from the segmentation results of experimental data. (i) For the nuclear area, an ellipse with radii of 6.4 and 5.9 μm was modeled. (ii) For the FITC channel, 42 spots with radii of 144 nm were distributed randomly in the ellipse. The spot radii were allowed to vary according to a Gaussian distribution, with an S.D. of 20 nm. Similarly, for the TRITC channel, 37 spots with radii of 150 nm were distributed randomly in the ellipse area. Spot radii varied with an S.D. of 25 nm. All spots had to fulfill volume exclusion criteria as described by Münkel et al. (39Münkel R. Imhoff J. Dietzel S. Cremer C. Cremer T. Bioimaging. 1995; 3: 108-120Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), i.e. they were not allowed to overlap with spots in the same channel. (iii) For both experimental and simulated data, the distance to the nearest neighbor of each spot in the other color channel was determined. To obtain the distance distribution, the distances were weighted with the spot volumes and binned (each distance bin comprised 100 nm). For the Monte Carlo simulations, the binned distances were averaged over all model cell nuclei. The expression vector for hGR (40Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by R. Evans. Expression vectors for GR mutants have been described (41Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) as well as the vector for Gal-GR and the reporter plasmid dGREtkCAT (42Baniahmad C. Muller M. Altschmied J. Renkawitz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the cDNA for hnRNP U (9Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This cDNA was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, generating BamHI and EcoRI sites, and was inserted in a pBSK+vector. This construct was used to express full-length hnRNP U as well as deletions in the expression vector pAB linker (43Baniahmad A. Köhne A.C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) which was combined with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the T-antigen of SV40 virus (5′-CCCAAGAAGAAGAAGAAGGTGGAG-3′) at theBglII/SalI-digested pAB linker and named pAB-NLS. The Gal-hnRNP U fusion, pABgal-hnRNP U1–806, was constructed by cutting pBSK+-hnRNP U with NotI, Klenow fill in, and HindIII and inserting in a BamHI, Klenow fill in, and HindIII-digested pABgal. The pAB-NLS-hnRNP U1–806 was generated by cutting the pBSK+-hnRNP U vector withXbaI, Klenow fill in, HindIII, and insertion of the insert into the pAB-NLS, which was cut with Cfr9I, Klenow fill in, and HindIII. HnRNP U1–406 was generated by digesting the pABgal-hnRNP U1–806 with SalI, Klenow fill in, and BglII and was ligated into pABgal, which was digested with BglII, Klenow fill in, and BamHI (thereby losing the Gal-DBD)). HnRNP U1–199 was made by digesting pABgal-hnRNP U1–806 with SalI, Klenow fill in, andNarI and was inserted into pAB-NLS, digested withCfr9I, Klenow fill in, and AccI. HnRNP U406–806 was constructed by cutting the pBSK+-hnRNP U1–806 withBglII, Klenow fill in, and HindIII and inserting into pAB-NLS cut with PvuII and HindIII. HnRNP U517–806 was generated by cutting pBSK+-hnRNP U1–806 withBspMI, Klenow fill in, and HindIII, and the insert was ligated into pAB-NLS cut with Cfr9I, Klenow fill in, and HindIII. HnRNP U685–806 was made by cutting the pBSK+-hnRNP U1–806 with MscI/HindIII and inserted into Eco47III/HindIII-digested pAB-NLS. The constructs for colocalization and cotransport were generated as follows. pBSK+-hnRNP U1–806 was digested withBglII, Klenow fill in, and HindIII, and the insert was ligated into pABgal and digested withPvuII/HindIII, resulting in pABgal-hnRNP U406–806. This construct was digested withBglII/XbaI (thereby losing the Gal-DBD), and thec-myc-oligonucleotid (5′-GATCTGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAATC-3′) was inserted, resulting in pJMyc-hnRNP U406–806. Similarly, the pBSK+-hnRNP U1–806 was digested withMscI/HindIII and inserted intoEco47III/HindIII-digested pABgal, resulting in pABgal-hnRNP U685–806. Consequently this construct was digested withBglII/XbaI (thereby losing the Gal-DBD) and the c-myc-oligonucleotide was inserted, resulting in pJMyc-hnRNP U685–806. To identify and characterize possible interaction partners of the GR, we analyzed HeLa nuclear proteins for their ability to interact with the DNA-bound GR in vitro. To delimit such a search to those proteins interacting with a functional hormone-responsive unit, we used a probe consisting of baculovirus-expressed, activated human GR bound to a32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide with two adjacent GRE sequences. Before incubation with the blotted nuclear extract the probe was UV cross-linked in the presence of hormone (29Eggert M. Moews C.C. Tripier D. Arnold R. Michel J. Nickel J. Schmidt S. Beato M. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30755-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, four prominent bands were detected (lane 1), whereas there was no signal in bacterial extracts (data not shown). These GRIPs were designated in accordance with their molecular masses: GRIP170, GRIP120, and GRIP95. Except for the band at the molecular mass position of 115 kDa, which shows direct DNA binding, we have shown previously that the binding was specific for GR cross-linked to a double GRE, suggesting that the proteins identified are putative interaction partners of GR (29Eggert M. Moews C.C. Tripier D. Arnold R. Michel J. Nickel J. Schmidt S. Beato M. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30755-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification and characterization of GRIP120. The purification started with an anion exchange chromatography of 2 g of HeLa nuclear extract, and the resulting fractions were assayed with the cross-linked probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GRIP120 eluted in a range of 380–530 mm salt, together with GRIP170, GRIP95, and a fraction of the DNA-binding 115-kDa protein (Fig. 1, lane 2). Cation exchange chromatography of GRIP-positive Q-Sepharose fractions led to separation of the four proteins. GRIP120 eluted between 550 and 720 mm NaCl (Fig.1, lane 3), together with a small amount of GRIP95. GRIP170 was detected in fractions containing 350–450 mm salt, and the residual amounts of the 115-kDa protein were found in fractions containing 375–525 mm salt. Further purification was achieved by heparin-Sepharose, where GRIP120 eluted in a range of 725–980 mm salt (Fig. 1, lane 4). Finally, GRIP120 was concentrated by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 1,lane 5), resulting in a strong enrichment of GRIP120 which could be visualized with Coomassie staining (Fig. 1, lane 6). The purification steps for GRIP120 enrichment are summarized in Fig. 1 B. Subsequently the GRIP120 fraction was digested with endoproteinase Lys-C, and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC. Sequence analysis of six fractions resulted in six different peptide sequences, all of which are identical to the human hnRNP U sequences (Table I).Table ISequence of GRIP120 peptidesPeptide sequenceHnRNP U residuesSSGPTSLFAVTVAPPGARQ187–205RPREDHGRGYFEYIEENK229–246PYFPIPEEYTFIQNVPLEDRVR446–467YNILGTNTIMDK506–517MMVAGFK518–524RNFILDQTNVSAAAQRRK556–573 Open table in a new tab HnRNP U had been identified previously in the context of two different activities. First, this protein had been demonstrated to be a component of the nuclear hnRNA particles (7Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Second, it had been shown to be identical to a protein attached to the nuclear scaffold (SAF A) and binding to several scaffold attachment regions from vertebrates (8Romig H. Fackelmayer F.O. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3431-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here we wanted to analyze whether the third function we have seen in vitro, binding to GR, could be confirmed further by coimmunoprecipitation of GR and hnRNP U. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated proteins from HeLa nuclear extract with an antibody against GR or with an antibody specific for hnRNP U. As shown in Fig.2 A the GR-specific antibody coprecipitates hnRNP U; an immunoblot probed with the anti-hnRNP U antibody clearly detects hnRNP U in the precipitate (Fig.2 A, lane 2) migrating at a position identical to that of the 120-kDa band detected in the anti-hnRNP U precipitate (Fig.2 A, lane 3) as well as in the untreated nuclear extract (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). A control antibody, used to detect unspecific interactions with antibodies in general, or using only the protein A-Sepharose matrix (Fig. 2 A,lanes 4 and 5) led to no specific hnRNP U enrichment in the precipitate. A second band with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa seen in both specific precipitates might be the result of protein degradation during incubation or caused by an unknown protein modification. To substantiate further the occurrence of GR·hnRNP U complexes we carried out the reverse experiment, by testing whether GR could be coprecipitated by an hnRNP U-specific antibody. Analysis of the precipitates by GR-specific immunoblotting resulted in a clearly detectable band in the hnRNP U-specific precipitate (Fig.2 B, lane 3). This band comigrates with GR, detected in the GR-specific precipitate (Fig. 2 B, lane 2) and is also seen in unfractionated nuclear extract. In addition, the GR antibody identifies several degradation bands, most prominently the already published 45-kDa degradation product of GR (44Eisen L.P. Reichman M.E. Thompson E.B. Gametchu B. Harrison R.W. Eisen H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11805-11810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a protein of about 190 kDa, probably caused by cross-reactivity of the polyclonal serum (note that this protein is only bound in denaturated Western blot, whereas the native protein is not precipitated by the same antibody; see lane 2). The precipitates with the control antibody and using no antibody did not generate any GR-specific signal (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4and 5). Thus, nuclear complexes having GR and hnRNP U molecules in common support the idea of an in vivoassociation. In addition to the biochemical evidence for the existence of GR·hnRNP U complexes we wanted characterize the subnuclear location of hnRNP U and of GR. Therefore, we analyzed the distribution of both endogenous proteins within HeLa cell nuclei, without any overexpression, by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig.3, immunolocalization of GR confirmed previous results (45van Steensel B. Brink M. van der Meulen K. van Binnendijk E.P. Wansink D.G. de Jong L. de Kloet E.R. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3003-3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the focal clustering within the nucleus. Using the laser confocal microscope we could dissect stained nuclei into several adjacent optical layers, three of which are shown for a single nucleus (Fig. 3). We detected roughly about 30–70 stained GR clusters or speckles distributed evenly within the three-dimensional nuclei. Immunolocalization of hnRNP U revealed two types of patterns (Fig. 3). HnRNP U is found to be concentrated in larger clusters. The merged images of both antibodies reveal that the GR speckles and the large clusters of hnRNP U colocalize in all optical sections analyzed (Fig.3, d–f). In addition, there was an almost even distribution of granular patterns with the majority of granules much smaller compared with the GR speckles. In addition to this pattern, for control, the distribution of a different antigen (fibrillarin) shows clearly a different pattern and no colocalization with GR (Fig.3 j). Fibrillarin is found in the nucleolus and in regions adjacent to the nucleoli (46Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Spohn W.H. Busch H. Biol. Cell. 1985; 54: 123-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To substantiate further the significance of the colocalization we applied several statistical methods to the confocal data sets. We wanted to determine whether signals distributed randomly within a nucleus would result in colocalization with the GR signals as well, or whether the measured colocalization of GR and hnRNP U could only be observed if both antigens would be indeed different components of identical focal clusters. Therefore, we used a model-based segmentation algorithm (see “Experimental Procedures”) and determined the distances between individual GR signals and the hnRNP U signal next to it. We found that about half of the determined distances were within less than 250 nm (Fig. 4), with none of the distances longer than 500 nm. In contrast, the distances between individual GR signals and the nearest signal from a random, simulated pattern generated by a Monte Carlo simulation (see “Experimental Procedures”) were significantly longer (Fig. 4); the calculated distances reached up to 2,000 nm. Thus, we conclude that the colocalization seen between GR and hnRNP U is significant and not the result of an overlap between randomly distributed hnRNP U signals and the GR speckles. Because the NLS of hnRNP U has been identified on the NH2-terminal region (7Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) we tested whether deletion of the NLS resulted in a cytoplasmic location of hnRNP U. This was indeed the case (data not shown), and therefore we could make use of the nuclear cotranslocation assay to"

Although tau isolated from PHFs (PHF-tau) is abnormally phosphorylated, the role of this abnormal phosphorylation in PHF assembly is not known. Previously, neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) was shown to phosphorylate tau on sites that are abnormally phosphorylated in PHF-tau (Paudel, H. K., Lew, J., Ali, Z., and Wang, J. H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23512–23518). In this study, phosphorylation by NCLK was found to promote dimerization of recombinant human tau (R-tau) and brain tau (B-tau) purified from brain extract. Chemical cross-linking by disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), a homobifunctional chemical cross-linker that specifically cross-linked R-tau dimers, and a Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography revealed that R-tau preparations contain mixtures of monomeric and dimeric R-tau species. When the structure of NCLK-phosphorylated R-tau was studied by a similar approach, DSS preferentially cross-linked the phosphorylated R-tau over the nonphosphorylated R-tau, and the phosphorylated R-tau eluted as a dimeric species from the gel filtration column. Phosphorylated R-tau became resistant to DSS upon dephosphorylation and was recovered as a monomeric species from the gel filtration column. In the presence of a low concentration of dithiothreitol (1.65 μm), R-tau formed disulfide cross-linked R-tau dimers. When compared, phosphorylated R-tau formed more disulfide cross-linked dimers than the nonphosphorylated R-tau. B-tau also was specifically cross-linked to dimers by DSS. When B-tau and NCLK-phosphorylated B-tau were treated with DSS, phosphorylated B-tau was preferentially cross-linked over nonphosphorylated counterpart. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation by NCLK promotes dimerization and formation of disulfide cross-linked tau dimers, which is suggested to be the key step leading to PHF assembly (Schweers, O., Mandelkow, E.-M., Biernat, J., and Mandelkow, E. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 8463–8467).

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Neurofibrillary tangles develop in nerve cells that undergo degeneration and contain paired helical filaments (PHFs) as the major fibrous component. Tau, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP) required for the stability of axonal microtubules, is the major component of PHFs (2Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otvos Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 3Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). There does not appear to be any AD-specific mutation in the tau gene, and studies indicate that tau mRNA level does not change in AD brain (4Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar). Thus, it is puzzling how tau, a highly soluble axonal protein, becomes insoluble PHF in degenerating neurons during the ontogeny of AD. Various investigators have attempted to reconstitute PHF to elucidate the biochemical steps involved in PHF assembly (5Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J.

Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recombinant tau fragments derived from microtubule binding repeats of tau spontaneously dimerize (5Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Schweers O. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These dimers, when treated with buffers containing high salt and/or low pH, aggregate into PHF-like filaments (5Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Schweers O. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The full-length tau molecules, on the other hand, have a reduced tendency to dimerize under similar conditions (5Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Schweers O. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that dimerization of tau is a key event leading to PHF assembly and that full-length tau molecules may require some post-translation modification and/or an additional factor to promote their dimerization. PHF-tau (tau found in PHFs) is abnormally phosphorylated (i.e. contains more phosphate than normal tau (1Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otvos Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar)). It has a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE and is incapable of binding to microtubules and promoting microtubule assembly. Upon dephosphorylation, PHF-tau regains its normal mobility on SDS-PAGE and the ability to bind and regulate microtubule dynamics (9Alonso A.D.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 10Wang J.-Z. Gong C.-X. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4854-4860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It is thought that in AD brain, abnormal phosphorylation prevents tau from performing its microtubule-related functions, leading to an unstable cytoskeleton and neurodegeneration (1Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). However, some recombinant tau constructs can assemble into PHF-like filaments without phosphorylation (5Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 6Schweers O. Mandelkow E.-M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As has been pointed out (11Guttmann R.P. Erickson A.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), juvenile tau, which shares many abnormal phosphorylation sites with PHF-tau, does not exist as PHFs (12Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raised the question as to whether the abnormal phosphorylation observed in PHF-tau is required for normal tau molecules to be converted into PHFs or whether it is merely a secondary event occurring during PHF assembly. In a previous report, we showed that neuronal cdc2-like kinase (NCLK), also known as brain proline-directed protein kinase, CDK5, tau kinase II, and PSSLRE kinase co-purifies with microtubules from brain extract (13Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Paudel H. Matsuura I. Matsushita M. Zhu X. Wang J.H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In neurons, NCLK is highly expressed and is the major tau kinase activity (15Hosoi T. Uchiyama M. Okumura E. Saito T. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okuyama A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brain extract, tau and NCLK are associated with each other, forming a large complex. 2A. A. Mawal and H. K. Paudel, manuscript in preparation. 2A. A. Mawal and H. K. Paudel, manuscript in preparation. More importantly, NCLK phosphorylates S-195, S-202, T-205, T-231, S-235, S-396, and S-404 of tau (numbered according to the longest isoform of human tau (4Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar)) (14Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since sites S-202, T-231, S-235, S-396, and S-404 are phosphorylated in PHF-tau (3Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), NCLK was suggested to be one of the kinases that participates in the abnormal phosphorylation of tau occurring in AD brain (13Lew J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, NCLK was used to phosphorylate a recombinant human tau (R-tau) and tau purified from bovine brain homogenate (B-tau), to study the effect of phosphorylation on tau self-association. Herein, it is reported that phosphorylation by NCLK promotes self-association of tau molecules, leading to dimerization. R-tau was purified from lysates ofEscherichia coli that overexpressed the longest isoform of human tau (htau 40) (16Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). B-tau was purified from bovine brain extract using perchloric acid (17Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12241-12245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NCLK was purified from a fresh bovine brain homogenate (18Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin and phosphoprotein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) were generous gifts from Dr. Jerry H. Wang (University of Calgary). Polyclonal antibody against bovine tau was prepared in the Medical Research Council, Signal Transduction Antibody Facility of the University of Calgary. The phosphorylation mixture contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm [γ32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mg/ml R-tau, and 3000 units/ml NCLK (14Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z.

R-tau and phosphorylated R-tau to generate Figs. 3, 4 D, and 5 were prepared by incubating two vials containing all of the components of the phosphorylation mixture, except that one contained buffer and another contained NCLK. After a 4-h incubation at 30 °C, phosphorylated R-tau (R-tau incubated with NCLK) contained 4.9 mol of phosphate/mol of R-tau. Samples in both vials were dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C for 14 h in a same vessel. B-tau and phosphorylated B-tau, to generate Figs. 7,B and D, were also prepared as above. After 4 h at 30 °C, B-tau was found to contain 3.5 mol of phosphate/mol of B-tau.Figure 4Gel filtration of DSS-treated R-tau, phosphorylated R-tau, and R-tau under native and denaturing conditions.

To generate Fig. 6, phosphorylated R-tau was divided into two equal halves. Both halves were treated with all the components of the dephosphorylation mixture except one-half was incubated with PP2B and another half with buffer. After 2 h at 30 °C, phosphorylated R-tau in one half containing PP2B was found to be almost completely dephosphorylated (data not shown). Unless otherwise stated, gel filtration was carried out at 4 °C on a Pharmacia FPLC system using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (1 × 30 cm) in 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 0.1m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Sample (0.5 ml) was injected into the column, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated using the high molecular weight gel filtration kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and two types of calibration curves were generated using marker proteins included in the kit. In the first type,K av ((elution volume of the protein − void volume)/(total bed volume − void volume)) values of the marker proteins were plotted against the log of their molecular weights. In the second type,−log(Kav)values of the marker proteins were plotted against their known Stokes radii. The K av value of R-tau was then determined by passing R-tau through the above column. Based on this determined K av value, the molecular weight and Stokes radius of R-tau were estimated using first and second calibration curves, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, the cross-linking of R-tau and B-tau by disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) (Pierce) was carried out at room temperature by the addition of 1 μl of DSS stock solution in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) to a vial containing 59 μl of the rest of the components of the cross-linking reaction. The cross-linking mixture contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.7% DMF, 166 μm DSS, and 1 mg/ml R-tau or 0.1 mg/ml B-tau. At various time points, aliquots were withdrawn, mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40 mm DTT, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, and 25% glycerol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE or immunoblotting using antibody against tau. To generate Figs. 2 C, 3 A, 3 B, 5,6 A, 7 B, and 7 D, the concentrations of two tau species were normalized, and then the cross-linking was carried out at the same time under identical conditions. Cross-linking in Figs.3 A, 3 B, 5, 6 A, 7 B, and7 D were quantitated from the densitometric scans of the blots using personal densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics). Percent dimer cross-linked was calculated by dividing the optical density of the cross-linked R-tau dimer in a lane of the blot containing DSS-treated R-tau by the optical density of the control R-tau (same amount but treated with the solvent) in that blot. DSS-treated R-tau to generate Figs. 4, A and D, was prepared by treating R-tau (1.0 mg) with DSS as above for 15 min. To purify DSS-cross-linked R-tau, R-tau (0.5 mg) was treated with DSS. After 15 min of treatment, the entire reaction mixture was passed through a FPLC Superose 12 column. The cross-linked R-tau dimer eluted before noncross-linked R-tau from the column. Gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed in continuous 5% polyacrylamide gels (11Guttmann R.P. Erickson A.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described (19Paudel H.K. Zwiers H. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6207-6213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of R-tau and B-tau were determined spectrophotometrically (20Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Concentrations of phosphorylated R-tau and phosphorylated B-tau were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using R-tau and B-tau as standards, respectively. Concentrations of all other proteins were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. The amount of NCLK is based on its activity (18Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M.E.

When R-tau was incubated with DSS, a homobifunctional chemical cross-linker with a spacer arm of 11.4 Å, a progressive increase in the intensity of a protein band heavier than R-tau was observed with increasing time (Fig.1 A, lanes 2–5). When a similar experiment was carried out and the proteins were immunoblotted with antibody against tau protein, both R-tau and the heavier band displayed cross-reactivity (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1–6). The molecular weights of R-tau and the cross-linked band were determined in an SDS-PAGE system using standard protein markers (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the previous report (21Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), R-tau migrated as a 65-kDa band. The apparent molecular mass of the cross-linked band was determined to be 151 kDa, which is ∼2.3 times larger than R-tau. Thus the size of the cross-linked band is that of a dimeric R-tau. These observations are consistent with previous reports (11Guttmann R.P. Erickson A.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Garcia de Ancos J. Correas I. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7976-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that R-tau exists in dimeric form. The densitometric quantitation of bands in Fig. 1 A revealed that at the 15-min time point (lane 5), the amounts of R-tau monomer and cross-linked dimer were 81 and 13%, respectively, that of the control (lane 1) (data not shown). These results indicated that when treated with DSS for 15 min, ∼6% R-tau forms species other than monomer and dimer. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a minor species that migrated with a size of R-tau tetramer was cross-linked by DSS (lane 5). Because of the low intensity of this tetramer band, its amount could not be quantitated with certainty but appeared to be approximately one-tenth that of the dimeric band (i.e. ∼1.3% that of control). Thus in Fig.1 A, lane 5, ∼5% R-tau is unaccounted for. It is possible that this lost 5% R-tau may be a DSS-cross-linked high molecular-sized R-tau species that may not have entered the gel. A FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column previously calibrated with proteins of known molecular weights and Stokes radii resolved R-tau into two protein peaks designated as peak 1 and peak 2 (Fig.2 A). The size and Stokes radius of the R-tau species in peak 2 (fraction 44) was estimated to be 195 kDa and 50 Å, respectively. Peak1 (fraction 40) eluted with a size and Stokes radius of 310 kDa and 55 Å, respectively. Thus, R-tau species in peak1 is 1.6 times larger than the one in peak 2. Since tau is a protein with an asymmetric structure (20Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 23Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the above molecular weights and Stokes radii of R-tau species determined by a gel filtration column calibrated with globular proteins do not reflect the actual molecular sizes of R-tau species with the asymmetric shapes. Therefore, which peak in Fig. 2 A represented R-tau dimer could not be determined from the above gel filtration data. However, the gel filtration data does indicate that the size of R-tau species in peak 1 is approximately double that of the one in peak2. This means that if peak 1 R-tau is a dimer, peak 2 R-tau is a monomer. Similarly, if peak 2R-tau is a dimer, then peak 1 R-tau is a tetramer. To determine which peak is the dimeric R-tau, R-tau species from peak1 and peak 2 were treated with DSS, and the products were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, DSS readily cross-linked the R-tau species in peak 1 (lanes 6–8). In contrast, the R-tau species in peak 2cross-linked poorly, and very little cross-linked dimer was apparent, even after treatment with DSS for 15 min (Fig. 2 C,lanes 2–4). Since peak 1 and peak 2overlap, a small amount of cross-linking of peak 2 R-tau species observed in Fig. 2 C (lane 4) could be due to contamination from peak 1. These results suggest that peak 1 and peak 2 represent R-tau dimer and monomer, respectively. To confirm the above suggestion, R-tau species from peak 1, peak 2, and purified DSS cross-linked R-tau dimer (see “Materials and Methods” for purification) were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2 D, on an SDS gel, DSS cross-linked R-tau dimer migrated as a 151-kDa band (lane 2). R-tau species from peak 1 (lane 3) and peak 2 (lane 4) migrated with mobilities similar to that of control R-tau (lane 5). However, on a nondenaturing gel, R-tau species in peak 1(Fig. 2 E, lane 3) and DSS-cross-linked R-tau dimer (Fig. 2 E, lane 2) migrated with similar mobilities, whereas R-tau species in peak 2 (Fig.2 E, lane 4) migrated faster than DSS-cross-linked R-tau dimer (Fig. 2 E, lane 2). These observations indicate that R-tau in peak 1 is a dimeric species, and because the size of R-tau in peak 2 is approximately one-half the size of R-tau in peak 1, the R-tau species in peak 2 must be the monomeric R-tau. When R-tau and phosphorylated R-tau were treated with DSS and the products were analyzed, a time-dependent increase in the formation of the 151-kDa dimer in both R-tau (Fig.3 A, lanes 2–6) and phosphorylated R-tau (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8–12) was observed. When the gel in Fig. 3 A was autoradiographed, both phosphorylated R-tau and the cross-linked bands in lanes 7–12 were found radiolabeled (data not shown), indicating that the cross-linked bands in lanes 8–12 were derived from phosphorylated R-tau. Interestingly, DSS-cross-linked phosphorylated R-tau dimer was visible within 1 min of incubation of phosphorylated R-tau with DSS (Fig. 3 A, lane 8), whereas DSS cross-linked R-tau dimer was apparent only after 5 min under identical conditions (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Furthermore, the densitometric quantitation of various bands in Fig. 3 Aindicated that at 2-, 5-, 10-, and 15-min time points (lanes 9–12), phosphorylated R-tau dimer cross-linked to 8.5, 12.0, 14.4, and 18.3%, respectively. R-tau dimer at 10 and 15 min (lanes 5 and 6) cross-linked to 3.9 and 6.6%, respectively. Thus, DSS cross-linked phosphorylated R-tau dimer ∼3-fold more than R-tau dimer. To confirm this finding, three different R-tau preparations were phosphorylated by NCLK. Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated species from each preparation were treated with DSS under identical conditions, and the cross-linking was evaluated. In all three preparations tested, DSS preferentially cro"

ORC, in its pre-replicative or in its post-replicative form, is bound to DNA throughout the cell-cycle (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 2Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and could act as a platform for the recruitment of other proteins involved in the replication machinery. One of the proteins believed to be recruited by ORC before the initiation of DNA replication is the CDC6/Cdc18 (S. cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe) protein. CDC6/Cdc18 is closely related in sequence to one of the subunits of ORC, ORC1, over a region that includes a putative nucleotide binding motif. Yeast ORC has been demonstrated to utilize ATP for binding to DNA and to have an ATPase activity that is modulated by binding to the origin of DNA replication (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 12Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), suggesting that like DNA replication initiator proteins in Escherichia coli (DnaA) or the simian virus 40 (T antigen), ATP binding and hydrolysis by the eukaryotic initiator protein will be an important regulator of the initiation process. Although DNA sequences defining an origin of replication have not yet been identified in higher eukaryotes, two members of a putative ORC complex homologous to yeast ORC1 and ORC2 have been identified so far in mammals, both in humans and in mice (13Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 14Takahara K. Bong M. Brevard R. Eddy R.L. Haley L.L. Sait S.J. Shows T.B. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 31: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting a universal mechanism of initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. We report here the identification of a novel member of human ORC homologous to S. cerevisiae ScORC4. Cloning the gene for a third member of the human origin recognition complex is an important step toward the ultimate goal of reconstituting the entire human ORCin vitro. In the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) Data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information), the partial sequence of a mouse cDNA (AA168456) was deposited with significant homology to a portion of ScORC4 from S. cerevisiae. A BLAST search with the AA168456 sequence revealed a homologous sequence human EST W23942, which in its turn identified a mouse EST AA110785. A BLAST search with the latter identified a human EST T80329 with an internal portion with significant homology to amino acids 85–121 of ScORC4. T80329 represented the 5′ end of a cDNA clone 25172 (IMAGE, Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression) obtained from human fetal brain mRNA. This clone was obtained and found to contain a 2.2-kilobase cDNA that corresponds in size to the mRNA detected by Northern blotting. The sequence will be deposited in GenBankTM. A 1-kilobase NcoI fragment from the cDNA encoding amino acids 57–388 of HsORC4P was cloned into the NcoI site of pRSETA. A 35-kDa fragment of HsORC4P was produced in bacteria fused to a 6-histidine epitope tag, purified on a nickel resin column, and used to raise antibodies in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals). Antibody against human ORC2 was raised against a recombinant His6-tagged fragment of HsORC2P from amino acids 27–577, created by cloning the XbaI-SacI fragment ofHsORC2 cDNA into the PvuII site of pRSETC. Where indicated, antibodies were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads with dimethyl pimelimidate for use in immunoprecipitation experiments; immunoprecipitated proteins were released from the cross-linked antibodies with 100 mm triethylamine, pH 11.5, separated by centrifugation, and brought to Laemmli buffer conditions. To ensure that coimmunoprecipitating proteins were not a result of cross-reacting antibody, interactions were disrupted by boiling the immunoprecipitates in 1% SDS. Samples were then diluted to RIPA buffer conditions and immunoprecipitated again with the same antibodies. We expressed recombinant HsORC4P fused with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) in mammalian cells using the pEBG expression plasmid. Polymerase chain reaction with plaque-forming unit polymerase was used to introduce a BamHI site into theHsORC4 cDNA three nucleotides upstream from the initiator methionine of HsORC4P (GGATCCGAAATG). ThisBamHI site was used to clone HsORC4 cDNA into the pEBG vector such that the GST coding region was fused in-frame to the HsORC4P coding sequence. 293T cells transiently transfected for 48 h with pEBG or pEBG-ORC4 were lysed, and the expressed GST or GST-HsORC4P was recovered by affinity purification on glutathione-agarose beads. Coprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting according to standard protocols. Human 293T embryonic kidney cells or HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. Transfections were done by the standard calcium phosphate method. For metabolic labeling of proteins, 293T cells were incubated in methionine-free medium for 4 h. Then 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) was added, and cells were incubated for 6 h before harvesting. Cell-staged human cell cultures were prepared from exponentially growing HeLa cells. Cells were arrested in M phase with 40 ng/ml nocodazole for 18 h. Mitotic cells were then selected by shake-off, washed twice in warm PHEM buffer (60 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2), re-inoculated in plates with fresh medium, and harvested at indicated time points after release. Alternatively, cells were blocked at different cell cycle phases with 10 mm hydroxyurea (S) or 40 ng/ml nocodazole (M) for 18 h. G1 synchronous cells were obtained by nocodazole shake-off as described above and harvested 4 h after re-inoculation. The cell cycle stages of these cells were checked by immunoblotting cell lysates with antibodies to cell cycle-specific cyclin B. Cell extracts were made in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4) at 4 °C. Where indicated, 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide was added to the buffer to disrupt protein-DNA interactions (15Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In all cases, the concentration of total protein in the lysates was determined by Bradford assay, and equal amounts were used for immunoprecipitation or for Western blot. Typically, lysate from 107 cells was used for immunoprecipitation, whereas extracts from 5 × 106cells were loaded for Western blots. Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells as described (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA/lane was hybridized at 42 °C using a fragment of the HsORC4 cDNA (bases 124–861 encoding the first 245 amino acids) as probe. For reference, the membranes were also hybridized with a 1.3-kilobaseHindIII-PstI cDNA fragment of GAPDH and a cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame of cyclin B. Complete sequencing of the cDNA insert revealed an open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 436 amino acids (Fig.1), with an approximate molecular mass of 45 kDa. The initiator methionine is preceded by an untranslated leader sequence of 126 nucleotides that contains stop codons in all three reading frames. The alignment of the protein sequence reveals 29% sequence identity to ScORC4 (Fig. 1). We have tentatively identified this clone as human replication origin recognition complex ORC4(HsORC4). Amino acids 67–73 of HsORC4 contain a putative NTP binding motif (GXXGXGKT) (17Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the sequence of HsORC4 was also significantly related to HsCDC18, SpCdc18, and HsORC1 over areas beyond the nucleotide binding motif (Fig. 2). Nearly 28% of HsORC4 residues were identical to at least one of the three Cdc18/ORC1 sequences shown and have been represented above the alignments as a “consensus sequence.” The identities of HsORC4P with ORC1 and Cdc18 extended over the whole length of the protein, including the six boxes of high homology noted between the Cdc18/ORC1 proteins. Comparing Figs.1 and 2 suggests that ScORC4 contains several of the amino acids that in HsORC4 are related to the Cdc18/ORC1 family. One critical difference, however, is that ScORC4 does not contain the canonical nucleotide binding motif, although ScORC5 has been reported to contain such a sequence motif. Human ORC5 has not yet been identified. It is also clear that the Cdc18/ORC1 molecules are more closely related to each other (especially over the six boxes of homology) than to ORC4 and that the identity of HsORC4P with the HsORC1p or the HsCdc18p is lower (around 17%) than the identity with the budding yeast ORC4P (29%). To study the ORC4 and ORC2 proteins, we raised polyclonal rabbit antibodies to recombinant fragments of the two cloned genes. Fig.3 A shows that immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with the anti-ORC2 antibody (lane 2) isolates a 72-kDa polypeptide that can be detected by immunoblotting with the same antibody. This size is consistent with that reported for HsORC2P. To confirm the specificity of the anti-ORC2 antibody, we expressed Myc epitope-tagged ORC2P by transient transfection of 293T cells with pA3M-ORC2 and immunoprecipitated cell lysates with pre-immune, anti-ORC2, and anti-Myc epitope antibodies (lanes 3–5). The precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-ORC2 antibody. Addition of the Myc epitope to ORC2 produced a longer protein of about 76 kDa, which was precipitated by anti-ORC2 and by anti-Myc antibodies. Thus the anti-ORC2 antibody recognizes ORC2 protein in both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting reactions. Fig. 3 B shows the specificity of the anti-ORC4 antibody. In this case, endogenous 45-kDa HsORC4 protein was detected by direct immunoblotting of cell lysates (lane 2). In most experiments, a doublet of 45 kDa is seen that could be due to post-translational modifications or to partial proteolysis of HsORC4P. When GST-HsORC4P was expressed in 293T cells by transient transfection of pEBG-ORC4, a new 66-kDa protein was detected by the anti-ORC4 antibody. The size of the new protein and its affinity for glutathione-agarose beads (see below, Fig.4 B) suggests that it is GST-ORC4. This result also proves that the anti-ORC4 antibody recognizes the protein encoded by the cloned HsORC4 cDNA. Lysates from different numbers of HeLa cells were compared with different amounts of purified recombinant HsORC4 by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-HsORC4 antibody. Comparison of the relative intensities of signal indicates that approximately 5 × 105 HsORC4 molecules may be present per HeLa cell (data not shown). 293T cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and cellular proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ORC4 and anti-ORC2 antibodies (Fig.4 A). The anti-ORC4 antibody immunoprecipitated a doublet of 45 kDa and also precipitated polypeptides of 100, 72, 35, and 31 kDa (lanes 2 and 5). With the exception of the 72-kDa band, the intensities of the other three bands are significantly lower than the 45-kDa band. This can be for different reasons. They can be interacting in substoichiometric amounts, they may not be recovered quantitatively, or they can have a slow rate of synthesis. The 45-kDa protein co-migrated with a 45-kDa polypeptide produced by in vitro transcription translation of the HsORC4cDNA (not shown). When the immunoprecipitate was denatured and re-precipitated with anti-ORC4 antibody, only the 45-kDa protein was re-precipitated (lane 3). Taken together with the immunoblotting results in Fig. 3 B, the ORC4 antibody appears to directly recognize only the 45-kDa HsORC4 protein and co-precipitate the other cellular polypeptides because they are associated with HsORC4P. The anti-ORC2 antibody precipitates a protein of an apparent molecular mass of 72 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 7), which was the only protein re-immunoprecipitated by the same antibody after denaturation of the proteins (lane 8). Additional polypeptides of 45, 55, 80, and 100 kDa were reproducibly present in the anti-ORC2 immunoprecipitates and are likely to represent proteins associated with HsORC2P. The higher molecular mass polypeptides are better resolved in lane 10. To demonstrate that the 72-kDa protein present in the ORC4 immunoprecipitate was indeed ORC2 and the 45-kDa protein coimmunoprecipitating with ORC2 was ORC4, we repeated the immunoprecipitations with antibodies covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. Bound proteins were eluted, and the presence of the 45-kDa HsORC4P and 72-kDa HsORC2P in the eluates was demonstrated by immunoblotting with the cognate antibodies (Fig. 4 B,lane 2, top and bottom panels). The coimmunoprecipitation experiment was repeated in the presence of 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide (lane 3, top andbottom panels), which is expected to disrupt protein-DNA interactions (15Lai J.S. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The continued coprecipitation of HsORC4P and HsORC2P in the presence of ethidium bromide supports a direct protein-protein interaction between the two rather than an interaction mediated by a DNA bridge. To ensure that the above results were not due to spurious cross-reaction of the anti-ORC4 antibody with HsORC2P or with a non-ORC4 cellular protein that associates with HsORC2P, we used another method to isolate HsORC4P from cells. Transient transfection of pEBG-ORC4 allowed us to express a 66-kDa GST-HsORC4P fusion protein in 293T cells. In parallel cultures, we expressed GST alone as a negative control from the pEBG vector. GST-HsORC4P (or GST) was isolated from the cell lysates by affinity purification on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and5, bottom panel). Immunoblotting of the associated proteins with anti-ORC2 antibody revealed that HsORC2P was specifically co-purified with GST-HsORC4 but not with GST alone (Fig.4 B, lanes 4 and 5, top panel). Although HsORC2P and HsORC4P were readily associated with each other in cells, they did not associate with each other when expressed byin vitro transcription translation (data not shown), suggesting that other cellular factors (perhaps other ORC subunits) or post-translational modifications are necessary to mediate stable complex formation. Fig.5 A shows a Northern blot analysis of HsORC4 mRNA expression in asynchronous HeLa cells and cells blocked in M and S phase nocodazole and hydroxyurea respectively. Comparison with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control indicates that HsORC4 mRNA is essentially unchanged between M and S phases. HeLa cells were also followed as they progressed synchronously after release from an M phase block. HsORC4 mRNA is detected at a constant level during the cell cycle. The level of HsORC4 protein does not vary through the cell cycle either (Fig. 5 B). Western blot analysis of total cellular protein from cells at indicated time points after release from mitotic block shows that overall HsORC4P level remains constant. The cyclin B protein (expressed in G2/M) is shown as a control for a protein expressed in a cell cycle-regulated manner. Identical results have been obtained with transformed COS or untransformed CV-1 cells (not shown). This result is in agreement with the observation in yeast that levels of ORC components remain essentially unaffected during the cell cycle (18Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 293-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The result is also similar to the unchanged cellular protein levels of HsORC1P, HsORC2P, and HsCdc18p through all phases of the cell cycle. 2P. Saha, J. Chen, A. Dutta, unpublished results. In summary, we report here the identification of a third member of the human replication origin recognition complex homologous to ScORC4, after which we name this gene HsORC4. The homology observed between human ORC4 and human Cdc18 and S. pombe Cdc18 and human ORC1 suggests that these proteins may be members of a family of related polypeptides. We also show that endogenous HsORC4P is associated with endogenous HsORC2P in vivo, which argues in favor of the existence of a human ORC homologue. However we have not yet detected HsORC1P by immunoblotting the anti-ORC4 or anti-ORC2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). This negative result may be explained by HsORC1P being recovered in substoichiometric amounts or by the anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC4 antibodies specifically disrupting the association of ORC1 with the ORC2-ORC4 subcomplex. Examination of the HsORC4P-associated proteins and HsORC2P-associated proteins reveals another conundrum. Although the two proteins are clearly associated with each other, most of the other proteins present in the respective immunoprecipitates are different. HsORC4P is coimmunoprecipitated with proteins of 100, 35, and 31 kDa in addition to HsORC2P. However, HsORC2P is coimmunoprecipitated with proteins of 100, 80, and 55 kDa besides HsORC4P. It is possible that all these proteins are part of human ORC and have been dissociated during cell lysis or immunoprecipitation into two subcomplexes. Alternatively, the proteins associated with HsORC4P and HsORC2P are not members of human ORC but are other accessory proteins involved in functions different from the initiation of DNA replication. These possibilities can be resolved only after the molecular identification of the coprecipitating proteins. In humans, the number of origins has been estimated to be about 3–5 × 104/cell on the basis of the observed spacing between active origins of about 100 kilobases (19Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the estimate of HsORC4P (5 × 105/cell) is very approximate, comparison of the two estimates suggests either of the following two cases. Human cells may contain two pools of HsORC4P, only one of which is in ORC capable of activating origins of DNA replication. Alternatively, all the HsORC4P is in ORC bound to DNA, but only a fraction of these sites are active as origins of DNA replication, consistent with the Jesuit model (many are called, but few are chosen) of origin selection. HsORC4 is the third ORC member identified in humans, after HsORC1 and HsORC2 (13Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B. Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Discovery of ORC in yeast was made possible by the identification of specific DNA sequence elements that constitute the replicator (reviewed in Ref. 6Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Identification of analogous sequences in higher eukaryotes has so far remained elusive. We foresee the discovery of additional human ORC members, so that ultimately it should be possible to work in the reverse direction to determine whether human ORC binds specific DNA sequences and whether such sequences constitute true human replicators.

Subsequently, the human and mouse homologs were identified and also shown to be chemoattractants for eosinophils (10Ponath P.D. Qin S. Ringler D.J. Clark-Lewis I. Wang J. Kassam N. Smith H. Shi X.

The genes for CCR3 and the related receptors CCR1–CCR5 are encoded within a 130-kilobase region of human chromosome 3 (13Samson M. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Genomics. 1996; 15: 522-526Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) indicating recent gene duplication and divergence and perhaps explaining the partial overlap of chemokine ligand repertoires. CCR3 is highly expressed on primary human eosinophils (50,000–400,000 sites/cell) (5Ponath P.D.S. Qin S. Post T.W. Wang J. Wu L. Gerard N.P. Neuman W. Gerard C. Mackay C.R. J. Exp.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), consistent with the potent ability of eotaxin to selectively influence the migration of these cells. The mechanisms by which specific cells are attracted by specific chemokines have been a topic of intense interest and clinical relevance. The question is complicated by the fact that a number of closely related chemokine receptors with overlapping specificities are expressed on many different classes of leukocytes. In addition, the affinity of a specific receptor/ligand interaction can vary depending upon the specific cell type expressing the chemokine receptor, perhaps due to posttranslational modification events or G protein coupling. Thus it appears that cells can modulate their responses to chemokines, but how this is done is not yet clear. While most investigations have focused on factors intrinsic to the cell, G proteins, receptor modifications, etc., we wished to investigate whether extracellular factors could act to modify chemokine receptor action. We report here that relatively modest changes in pH and salt over a physiologic range can dramatically alter both the binding affinity and signaling efficacy of eotaxin/CCR3 interactions. Moreover, these biochemical changes are mirrored by functional changes induced by eotaxin on primary human eosinophils. A cell line stably expressing the human CCR3 chemokine receptor was generated using standard protocols. Briefly, the CCR3 open reading frame was cloned into the pME eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into the rat Y3 cell line using electroporation. Stable transfectants in Y3 cells were generated by selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). CCR3 expression was confirmed using calcium signaling with known chemokine ligands (4Heath H. Qin S. Rao P. Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Ponath P.D. Mackay C.R. J. Clin.

Human recombinant chemokines were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) or Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ).125I-Eotaxin was obtained from either NEN Life Science Products or Amersham Corp. A ligand binding protocol using wheat germ agglutinin-coated scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads (Amersham Corp.) (14Bosworth N. Towers P. Nature. 1989; 341: 167-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was employed. Membranes were prepared from the CCR3 transfectant by using hypotonic lysis of the cells with multiple centrifugation steps. Added to 200 μg of wheat germ agglutinin-coated SPA beads in a 200-μl reaction volume were 14 μg (protein units) of the transfectant membrane preparation, ∼0.05 nm125I-eotaxin (specific activity, 2200 cpm/Ci), and the stated concentration of unlabeled eotaxin. The binding reaction buffers contained systematically varied concentrations of NaCl (120, 140, or 160 mm) and final pH levels (7.0, 7.2, 7.4, or 7.6) for a total of 12 individual buffers. However, all reaction buffers additionally contained 25 mm Hepes, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The reactions were incubated from 2 to 5 h at 22 °C with gentle agitation. The reaction binding data were assessed using a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard). The ligand binding data were then analyzed using IgorPro software (Wavemetrics). The Ca2+ response to eotaxin in the presence of different reaction buffers was measured using standard protocols. Briefly, the CCR3 transfectant (and the wild type Y3 cells) was loaded for 60 min at 25 °C with 3 μmINDO-1AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Calcium mobilization was measured using a Photon Technology International spectrophotometer with excitation at 350 nm and dual simultaneous recording of fluorescence emission at 400 and 490 nm. Relative intracellular calcium levels are expressed as the 400 nm/490 nm emission ratio. Experiments were performed at 37 °C with constant mixing in cuvettes each containing 106 cells in 2 ml of the indicated buffer. The reaction buffers were the same as those used for the binding analyses with the one exception that no bovine serum albumin was added. For the EC50 determinations, the maximal amplitude of the signaling response (400/490 ratio) was quantified, and the data were analyzed using IgorPro software (Wavemetrics). Eosinophils were isolated from the buffy coats of normal volunteers. Briefly, erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis from the dextran sedimentation-isolated granulocyte fraction. The granulocytes were then incubated with anti-CD16 microbeads (Mitenyi Biotec Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for 30 min (15Hansel T.T. Pound J.D. Pilling D. Kitas G.D. Salomon M. Gentle Lee S.S. Thompson R.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 122: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and were then passed through a MACS column (Mitenyi Biotec Inc.). The eosinophils collected in the flow-through were shown immunohistochemically to be greater than 99% pure. The migration of eosinophils was measured using a modified Boyden chamber with 5-μm pore size polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters (16Bacon K.B. Camp R.D. Cunningham F.M. Woollard P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 95: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of relatively small changes in the extracellular buffer on the binding affinity of eotaxin for CCR3. Membrane preparations of a human CCR3 transfectant were used in a SPA bead binding format (14Bosworth N. Towers P. Nature. 1989; 341: 167-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) to allow the direct measurement of eotaxin binding and the assessment of dissociation constants (K d ) of binding. A high throughput format was employed to ensure sufficient data points to accurately reflect changes in binding affinity. Initial trials indicated that two critical reaction parameters were the level of sodium chloride and the final pH of the reaction buffers. We therefore varied these two conditions over a fairly narrow physiologic range while other aspects of the ligand binding reaction were kept constant. Displacement profiles observed with the different buffer conditions varied markedly (Fig.1 A). Specifically, total binding as well as the “steepness” of the competitor curves increased as a function of higher pH (7.0–7.6) but lower salt (160–120 mm), as summarized in Fig. 1 B. The comparison includes reactions performed in a “standard” condition with 140 mm NaCl and a final pH of 7.4 (7.4/140), a “high affinity” condition with 120 mm NaCl and pH 7.6 (7.6/120), and a “low affinity” condition with 160 mmNaCl and pH 7.0 (7.0/160). A nearly 5-fold difference of total CCR3 bound 125I-eotaxin is seen between the 7.0/160 and the 7.6/120 conditions, suggesting a profound influence on binding by salt and pH. Scatchard analysis indicated that the differences in the eotaxin/CCR3 interaction observed under different buffer conditions was due to an alteration in the binding affinity (K d ), with the number of binding sites per reaction remaining relatively constant (x axis intercept on Scatchard plots, Fig. 1,A and B). The 7.6/120 conditions resulted in a binding constant (K d ) of 0.03 nm, whereas the 7.0/160 conditions resulted in a 20-fold lower affinity interaction (K d = 0.60 nm). To examine whether the differences in binding affinities were also reflected at the level of eotaxin-induced signal transduction, we examined CCR3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization under these different buffer conditions. Several aspects of the Ca2+response profiles are noteworthy (Fig.2). While the magnitude of maximum Ca2+ mobilization was equivalent, there were striking differences in the efficacy of signaling under the three different conditions. As shown with representative traces in Fig. 2 A, stimulation of the CCR3 transfectant with 1.6 nm eotaxin evoked essentially no Ca2+ flux response with the 7.0/160 conditions, a minimal response with the 7.4/140 conditions, and nearly a half-maximal response with 7.6/120 conditions. Likewise, 16 nm eotaxin stimulation evoked essentially a maximal response with the 7.4/140 and 7.6/120 conditions whereas it only evoked a half-maximal response in the 7.0/160 conditions. These results were further borne out in the full dose-response profiles (Fig.2 B) from which were calculated the concentration of eotaxin giving rise to a half-maximal Ca2+ response (EC50) values. While the standard conditions resulted in an EC50 determination of 5 nm, the other two conditions gave rise to values of 2 and 26 nm. These two values, like the respective binding constants, are over an order of magnitude apart. Thus signaling efficacy is also a function of pH and salt and directly correlates with binding affinity. We next wished to assess if the marked changes on binding and signaling seen with the CCR3 transfectant were relevant to eotaxin-induced responses in native human eosinophils. Using freshly isolated human eosinophils from a normal donor, we examined the Ca2+ response to eotaxin stimulation at the three different conditions previously used. As shown in Fig.3, eosinophils responded to eotaxin stimulation with the same sensitivities as seen with the CCR3 transfectant. When tested at the 7.0/160, 7.4/140, or 7.6/120 conditions, 1 nm eotaxin stimulation of the eosinophils resulted in no response, minimal response, or half-maximal responses, respectively. Likewise, 10 nm eotaxin stimulation resulted in half-maximal, maximal, and maximal responses at the same conditions. Therefore, eotaxin/CCR3-mediated Ca2+ signaling appears to be a function of microenvironmental conditions for both transfected cells and primary native human eosinophils. Eotaxin binding to CCR3 and subsequent signal transduction result ultimately in the migration of eosinophils. We therefore wished to assess whether this effector function was also dependent on relatively subtle microenvironmental conditions. Freshly isolated human eosinophils were tested in a chemotaxis assay for their ability to respond to eotaxin stimulation under the three different conditions used with the Ca2+ signaling and ligand binding experiments. As shown in Fig. 4, two different observations can be made. First, within the experimental range tested, significantly more eosinophils responded at the 7.6/120 conditions than at the 7.0/160 or even 7.4/140 conditions to each level of eotaxin stimulation, in particular 3, 10, and 30 nm. Second, by comparing submaximal response levels (i.e.comparing results from 7.6/120 and 7.0/120 conditions at 3 and 30 nm, or 10 and 100 nm) an order of magnitude difference in response was again observed. Therefore, at least in vitro, the 7.6/120 conditions served to allow greater eosinophil migration mediated through the eotaxin/CCR3 interaction than did the 7.0/160 conditions. The direct measure of the interaction between eotaxin and CCR3 has been marked with difficulties, including low expression of CCR3 in transfected cells and peculiarities in the biophysical characteristics of chemokines in ligand binding studies. In this report, we investigate other factors that may also add to the complexity of interactions between chemokines and their receptors by assessing how subtle changes in the extracellular environment may alter profoundly the affinity of ligand/receptor binding. For eotaxin/CCR3 interactions, we show that ligand binding, Ca2+ signaling, and primary eosinophil migration varied over an order of magnitude as a function of net changes of 40 mm (160–120 mm) sodium chloride and 0.6 pH unit (pH 7.0–7.6). Optimum CCR3/eotaxin interactions occurred at pH 7.6 and 120 mm NaCl, and the biochemical effects were directly mirrored at the level of function, with far more primary human eosinophils migrating to eotaxin under these conditions than under any other. While small variations in the physiologic buffer alone can profoundly influence subsequent eosinophil responses mediated via the eotaxin/CCR3 interaction, the role this possible control mechanism might play in the trafficking of eosinophils in vivo remains to be firmly established. Recently, Helmlinger et al. (17Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) measured mean interstitial pH values between adjacent blood vessels using fluorescent ratio imaging. These high resolution measurements identified pronounced pH gradients, with values dropping to 7.0 just 50 μm (∼5 cell lengths) from the 7.4 values at the vessel walls. This observation establishes the paradigm of significant pH variations occurring within the microenvironment and frames the possibility of altered trafficking patterns of cells under the influence of chemokines. It also is possible that some more widespread local modifications (lower pH and/or higher salt) might help dampen eosinophil recruitment to certain organs (such as the thymus) that constitutively express eotaxin and yet remain eosinophil-free (7Kitaura M.

Med. 1996; 2: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the majority of eosinophil granule proteins, such as major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil peroxidase, are extremely basic in nature, all having isoelectric points around 10.8 (18Gleich G.J. Kita H. Adolphson C.R. Frank M.M. Austen K.F. Claman H.N. Unanue E.R. Samter's Immunologic Diseases. Little Brown and Co., Boston, MA1994: 205-245Google Scholar). Degranulation of these primarily tissue-localized leukocytes, whether as part of an inflammatory response or even as part of eosinophil turnover, might sufficiently increase the local pH levels at those sites to enhance additional eosinophil recruitment mediated through a higher affinity eotaxin/CCR3 interaction, possibly leading to a positive feedback cycle. The effects of salt and pH on receptor/ligand interactions in general can often be correlated with important aspects of biology. In many instances, however, the responses to these variables are the inverse of those seen with the CCR3/eotaxin interactions. For example, neonatal Fc receptors bind maternal IgG from ingested milk in the gut (pH 6.0–6.5) with a high affinity and deliver them to the bloodstream (pH 7.0–7.5) where the binding affinity drops 2 orders of magnitude (19Raghavan M. Bonagura V.R. Morrison S.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14649-14657Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). There are several examples also where the difference in binding affinity at acidic pH, such as would be present in subcellular compartments, might have a biological significance. The affinity of ligand binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor at acidic pH correlates with the final outcome of endosomal sorting (20French A.R. Tadaki D.K. Niyogi S.K. Lauffenburger D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4334-4340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). A similar link to biology is seen with major histocompatibility complex interactions with specific peptide ligands (21Bangia N. Ghumman B. Watts T.H. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). While the effects of salt variations tend to be qualitatively consistent, there are even examples of increases of sodium chloride concentrations increasing ligand function, specific agonists of the somatostatin receptor being one example (22Williams A.J. Michel A.D. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). While it is likely that pH and salt-dependent variations occur with other chemokine/receptor pairs the magnitude of these has not yet been fully characterized. However, our experience to date indicates these variations are not as marked as those observed with the CCR3/eotaxin interactions. In summary, while the precise physiologic implications of alterations in extracellular environment remain to be worked out, we have shown that small compositional changes in the extracellular environment can have profound effects upon chemokine action. Potentially, the modulation of extracellular fluids represents an additional physiologic control mechanism for regulating chemokine/receptor interactions and hence specific aspects of cellular migration and trafficking. With the particular case of eotaxin/CCR3 interactions, the possibility is strong that the extracellular environment has a significant role in governing eosinophil trafficking. We thank Dr. Kenneth S. Soo of the University College London for the kind gift of the Y3 cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2003333173,"The reaction between reduced xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) from bovine milk and NAD has been studied in detail. An understanding of this reaction is necessary for a complete description of XDH turnover with its presumed natural electron acceptor and to address the preference of XDH for NAD over oxygen as a substrate. The reaction between pre-reduced XDH and NAD was studied by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The reaction was found to involve two rounds of oxidation with 2 eq of NAD. The first round goes to completion, and the second round reaches a slightly disfavored equilibrium. Rapid binding of NAD with an apparent<i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> of 25 ± 2 μm is followed by NAD reduction at a rate constant of 130 ± 13 s<sup>−1</sup>. NADH dissociation at a rate constant of 42 ± 12 s<sup>−1</sup>completes a round of oxidation. These steps have been successfully tested and modeled to repeat themselves in the second round of oxidation. The association rate constant for NAD binding was estimated to be much greater than any rate constant measured in the oxidation by molecular oxygen, thus explaining how NAD competes with oxygen for reducing equivalents. Rate constants for NAD reduction and NADH dissociation are respectively 21- and 7-fold greater than<i>k</i> <sub>cat</sub>, indicating that the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme by xanthine is mostly rate-limiting in xanthine/NAD turnover. A steady-state mechanism for XDH is discussed."

J., and Traugh, J. A. (1993)Biochimie 75, 985–989) and is due at least in part to multipotential S6 kinase. When elongation factor 1 (EF-1) from rabbit reticulocytes was examined as substrate for multipotential S6 kinase, up to 1 mol/mol of phosphate was incorporated into the α, β, and δ subunits. Phosphorylation of EF-1 resulted in a 2–2.6-fold stimulation of EF-1 activity, as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. The rate of elongation was also stimulated by approximately 2-fold with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6 by multipotential S6 kinase. When the rates of elongation in extracts from serum-fed 3T3-L1 cells and cells serum-deprived for 1.5 h were compared, a 40% decrease was observed upon serum deprivation. The addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min stimulated elongation to a rate equivalent to that of serum-fed cells. Similar results were obtained with partially purified EF-1, with both EF-1 and ribosomes contributing to stimulation of elongation. These data are consistent with a ribosomal transit time of 3.2 min for serum-deprived cells and 1.6 min following the addition of insulin for 15 min.

These data are consistent with a ribosomal transit time of 3.2 min for serum-deprived cells and 1.6 min following the addition of insulin for 15 min. Taken together, the data suggest that insulin stimulation involves coordinate regulation of EF-1 and ribosomes through phosphorylation by multipotential S6 kinase.

Rudkin B.B. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All four subunits of EF-1 have been shown to undergo phosphorylation in vivoand in vitro. When the α, β, and δ subunits are phosphorylated in rabbit reticulocytes in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a 2–3-fold stimulation of EF-1 activity is observed (6Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11993-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar effect is observed when EF-1 is phosphorylatedin vitro by protein kinase C (7Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect is due to stimulation of the rate-limiting step, GTP/GDP exchange on EF-1α (8Peters H.I. Chang Y.-W.E. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The β and δ subunits are also phosphorylated by protein kinase CKII (13Janssen G.M.C. Maessen G.D.F.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8515-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the γ and δ subunits of EF-1 fromXenopus oocytes are substrates for the cell cycle division control kinase (Cdc2) (17Janssen G.M.C. Morales J. Schipper A. Labbe J.-C. Mulner-Lorillon O.

The physiological function of phosphorylation with CKII and Cdc2 has yet to be elucidated.One of the early events observed in response to insulin is stimulation of protein synthesis. Morley and Traugh (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that stimulation of translation in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells occurs within 7.5 min in response to insulin and is concomitant with increased phosphorylation of initiation factors 4B and 4G and ribosomal protein S6. Phosphorylation of eIF-4F and S6 in response to insulin is due, at least in part, to activation of multipotential S6 kinase as shown by phosphopeptide mapping (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Trevillyan J.M.

Multipotential S6 kinase was first purified from the cytosol of rabbit reticulocytes as an inactive enzyme that could be activated by limited proteolysis in vitro (21Tahara S.M. Traugh J.A. Eur. J.

An endogenously active form has been purified from the cytosol of rabbit liver (23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown by phosphorylation of a number of other substrates including histone 1 (21Tahara S.M. Traugh J.A. Eur. J.

Biophys. 1991; 284: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the type I and type II S6 kinases incorporate 5–6 mol of phosphate into S6 in vivoand in vitro (29Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), whereas multipotential S6 kinase incorporates three or four phosphates into S6 and modifies most, but not all, to the sites phosphorylated in mitogen- or insulin-stimulated cells (25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Trevillyan J.M. Perisic O. Traugh J.A. Byus C.V. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).In this study, we have shown that the α, β, and δ subunits of EF-1 from rabbit reticulocytes are highly phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase. Phosphorylation of EF-1 results in stimulation of EF-1 activity, as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. A stimulatory effect on elongation is also observed with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6 by multipotential S6 kinase. To determine whether insulin regulates translational elongation, the rate of elongation was measured in extracts from serum-fed 3T3-L1 cells, serum-deprived cells, and serum-deprived cells treated with insulin and shown to be due to changes in the function of EF-1 and ribosomes. The insulin-directed changes in the elongation rate were confirmed by measuring the ribosomal transit time.DISCUSSIONInsulin has been shown to rapidly stimulate protein synthesis in a variety of cell types at both initiation and elongation (reviewed in Refs. 39Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 40Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Annu. Rev.

Treatment of serum-deprived cells with insulin results in a 1.4–3-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis within 15–30 min (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Welsh G.I. Proud G.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Upon addition of insulin to serum-deprived or quiescent cells, increased phosphorylation of initiation factors and ribosomal protein S6 was observed (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and S6 coincided with the activation of multipotential S6 kinase, and phosphopeptide mapping confirmed the role of this S6 kinase in insulin stimulation (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-fold stimulation of polypeptide chain elongation was also observed in soleus muscle isolated from 18-h fasted mice treated with insulin, as measured by ribosome transit time (45Yoshizawa F. Tonouchi A. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Funabiki R. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Previously, the rate of elongation (46Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 324: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and EF-1 activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in actively dividing Vero cells were shown to be reduced by deprivation of serum. Readdition of serum led to a rapid restoration of elongation activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To determine the role of elongation in insulin stimulation of protein synthesis, phosphorylation of EF-1 by the insulin-stimulated multipotential S6 kinase was examined. EF-1 was highly phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase in vitro, with the α, β, and δ subunits selectively phosphorylated. Each subunit was subjected to extensive tryptic digestion, and the phosphopeptides analyzed. With EF-1β, one major peptide containing phosphoserine was obtained; this indicated the subunit had one phosphorylation site for S6 kinase. Two acidic phosphopeptides were obtained with the δ subunit phosphorylated by S6 kinase, with an additional peptide observed with α-reduced EF-1, suggesting the latter site was masked by the interaction with EF-1α; only phosphoserine was observed.A total of six phosphopeptides were obtained with EF-1α, with both serine and threonine phosphorylated. It is important to note that the α subunit is modified at two sites by the addition of glycerolphosphorylethanolamine to glutamic acid residues, and five lysine residues are di- or trimethylated, as shown by Dever and co-workers (48Dever T.E. Costello E.C. Owens C.L. Rosenberry T.L. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20518-20525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation would block tryptic cleavage at that lysine, and all of the modifications including phosphorylation, if present next to a lysine or arginine, would block cleavage at that site and possibly adjacent sites. At least two phosphorylation sites are present, one on serine and one on threonine. Although additional sites of phosphorylation cannot be ruled out, changes in the extent of other modifications could result in the multiple phosphopeptides observed.When the effects of phosphorylation of EF-1 by S6 kinase were investigated by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, the activity of phosphorylated EF-1 and EF-1 complexed with ValRS was increased 2.0–2.6-fold over that of nonphosphorylated EF-1. Previously, binding of labeled AUG to 40 S ribosomal subunits and poly(A,U,G)-directed translation were increased following phosphorylation of S6 by multipotential S6 kinase (50Burkhard S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 4-fold stimulation of translation of globin mRNA was observed with a reconstituted protein-synthesizing system (23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3518-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase were assayed by polyphenylalanine synthesis, elongation was increased 2-fold as compared with nonphosphorylated ribosomes. Moreover, phosphorylation of EF-1 and S6 resulted in coordinate stimulation of elongation.The elongation activity in serum-fed cells, serum-deprived cells, and serum-deprived cells treated with insulin for 15 min was examined using postmitochondrial supernatants. Serum deprivation of 3T3-L1 cells for 1.5 h resulted in a 50% reduction in elongation activity as compared with serum-fed cells, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min stimulated elongation 1.8-fold. The stimulation of elongation rate in response to insulin was confirmed by transit time measurements, which showed a 2-fold increase upon the addition of insulin for 15 min to serum-deprived cells.Increases in the rate of elongation of 2–3-fold observed in response to insulin may appear small; however, the extent of stimulation of elongation by insulin is similar to changes in overall protein synthesis when insulin is added to serum-deprived cells (10Motorin Y.A. Wolfson A.D. Orlovsky A.F. Gladilin K.L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 238: 262-264Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A.

Biochem. 1995; 59: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). They are also similar to those observed previously with phorbol ester and protein kinase C at the initiation and elongation steps (6Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11993-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of course, the measured rate of elongation and the transit time are average values of multiple translation events, some of which will be more responsive to insulin and growth-promoting compounds than others.The postribosomal supernatant and ribosomes were shown to contribute to enhanced elongation activity in response to insulin. EF-1 was identified as the component in the supernatant responsible for increased elongation by partial purification. EF-1 was also implicated by analysis of tRNA-binding to ribosomes, in which the binding activity in supernatants from serum-fed and insulin-treated cells was twice that from serum-deprived cells.Multipotential S6 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate eIF-2, eIF-3 p120, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F p220 (27Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ribosomal protein S6 (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3518-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-4F p220 by S6 kinase stimulates translation by 3–5-fold, increases association with capped mRNA, and enhances binding of 32P-labeled mRNA to the initiation complex (51Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Etchison D. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4669-4672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that the phosphorylation of EF-1 by multipotential S6 kinase stimulates elongation, and the rate of elongation is enhanced further with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6. These studies also show that serum deprivation reduces EF-1 activity, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min restores the EF-1 activity. In other studies, Chang and Traugh 2Y.-W. E. Chang and J. A. Traugh, submitted for publication. have shown that the phosphopeptide maps of EF-1 phosphorylated in vitro by multipotential S6 kinase are identical to those obtained in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin for 15 min, with four additional phosphopeptides observed with the α subunit phosphorylatedin vivo. Thus, it appears that EF-1 is involved in the multipotential S6 kinase-mediated regulation of protein synthesis in response to insulin, which includes phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and ribosomal protein S6.Recently, a rapid decrease of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors has been shown to correlate with an enhanced rate of elongation (37Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reduction of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin is due to a decrease of EF-2 kinase activity. Therefore, insulin appears to enhance elongation by the differential regulation of elongation factors 1 and 2.

The mechanisms involved in the regulation of EF-1 activity are not well understood, although EF-1 activity has been shown to be modulated by mitogens, aging, heat shock, and fertilization (12Ryazanov A.G. Rudkin B.B. Spirin A.S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All four subunits of EF-1 have been shown to undergo phosphorylation in vivoand in vitro. When the α, β, and δ subunits are phosphorylated in rabbit reticulocytes in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a 2–3-fold stimulation of EF-1 activity is observed (6Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11993-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar effect is observed when EF-1 is phosphorylatedin vitro by protein kinase C (7Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect is due to stimulation of the rate-limiting step, GTP/GDP exchange on EF-1α (8Peters H.I. Chang Y.-W.E. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The β and δ subunits are also phosphorylated by protein kinase CKII (13Janssen G.M.C. Maessen G.D.F.

GDP has been shown to enhance the phosphorylation of β and δ by CKII, while little phosphorylation is observed in the absence of GDP (16Palen E. Venema R.C. Chang Y.-W.E. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8515-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, the γ and δ subunits of EF-1 fromXenopus oocytes are substrates for the cell cycle division control kinase (Cdc2) (17Janssen G.M.C. Morales J. Schipper A. Labbe J.-C. Mulner-Lorillon O.

One of the early events observed in response to insulin is stimulation of protein synthesis. Morley and Traugh (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that stimulation of translation in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells occurs within 7.5 min in response to insulin and is concomitant with increased phosphorylation of initiation factors 4B and 4G and ribosomal protein S6. Phosphorylation of eIF-4F and S6 in response to insulin is due, at least in part, to activation of multipotential S6 kinase as shown by phosphopeptide mapping (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Trevillyan J.M. Perisic O. Traugh J.A. Byus C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3041-3044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multipotential S6 kinase was first purified from the cytosol of rabbit reticulocytes as an inactive enzyme that could be activated by limited proteolysis in vitro (21Tahara S.M. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,22Lubben T.H. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13992-13997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An endogenously active form has been purified from the cytosol of rabbit liver (23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3518-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as from the membrane of rabbit reticulocytes (24Benson E.S. Umphress J.L. Traugh J.A. Pinna L.A. Tuazon P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Multipotential S6 kinase activity is stimulated in 3T3-L1 cells in response to insulin (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6007-6010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown by phosphorylation of a number of other substrates including histone 1 (21Tahara S.M. Traugh J.A. Eur. J.

Chem. 1983; 258: 13992-13997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), initiation factors (eIF-2, eIF-3, eIF-4B and eIF-4F) (27Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and glycogen synthase (28Khatra B.S. Nguyen O. Tuazon P.T. DeVack C. Traugh J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the type I and type II S6 kinases incorporate 5–6 mol of phosphate into S6 in vivoand in vitro (29Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), whereas multipotential S6 kinase incorporates three or four phosphates into S6 and modifies most, but not all, to the sites phosphorylated in mitogen- or insulin-stimulated cells (25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Trevillyan J.M. Perisic O. Traugh J.A. Byus C.V. J. Biol.

In this study, we have shown that the α, β, and δ subunits of EF-1 from rabbit reticulocytes are highly phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase. Phosphorylation of EF-1 results in stimulation of EF-1 activity, as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. A stimulatory effect on elongation is also observed with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6 by multipotential S6 kinase. To determine whether insulin regulates translational elongation, the rate of elongation was measured in extracts from serum-fed 3T3-L1 cells, serum-deprived cells, and serum-deprived cells treated with insulin and shown to be due to changes in the function of EF-1 and ribosomes. The insulin-directed changes in the elongation rate were confirmed by measuring the ribosomal transit time. DISCUSSIONInsulin has been shown to rapidly stimulate protein synthesis in a variety of cell types at both initiation and elongation (reviewed in Refs. 39Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 40Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Annu. Rev.

Treatment of serum-deprived cells with insulin results in a 1.4–3-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis within 15–30 min (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Welsh G.I. Proud G.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Upon addition of insulin to serum-deprived or quiescent cells, increased phosphorylation of initiation factors and ribosomal protein S6 was observed (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and S6 coincided with the activation of multipotential S6 kinase, and phosphopeptide mapping confirmed the role of this S6 kinase in insulin stimulation (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-fold stimulation of polypeptide chain elongation was also observed in soleus muscle isolated from 18-h fasted mice treated with insulin, as measured by ribosome transit time (45Yoshizawa F. Tonouchi A. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Funabiki R. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Previously, the rate of elongation (46Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 324: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and EF-1 activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in actively dividing Vero cells were shown to be reduced by deprivation of serum. Readdition of serum led to a rapid restoration of elongation activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To determine the role of elongation in insulin stimulation of protein synthesis, phosphorylation of EF-1 by the insulin-stimulated multipotential S6 kinase was examined. EF-1 was highly phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase in vitro, with the α, β, and δ subunits selectively phosphorylated. Each subunit was subjected to extensive tryptic digestion, and the phosphopeptides analyzed. With EF-1β, one major peptide containing phosphoserine was obtained; this indicated the subunit had one phosphorylation site for S6 kinase. Two acidic phosphopeptides were obtained with the δ subunit phosphorylated by S6 kinase, with an additional peptide observed with α-reduced EF-1, suggesting the latter site was masked by the interaction with EF-1α; only phosphoserine was observed.A total of six phosphopeptides were obtained with EF-1α, with both serine and threonine phosphorylated. It is important to note that the α subunit is modified at two sites by the addition of glycerolphosphorylethanolamine to glutamic acid residues, and five lysine residues are di- or trimethylated, as shown by Dever and co-workers (48Dever T.E. Costello E.C. Owens C.L. Rosenberry T.L. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20518-20525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Rosenberry T.L. Krall J.A. Dever T.E. Haas R. Louvard D. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7096-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation would block tryptic cleavage at that lysine, and all of the modifications including phosphorylation, if present next to a lysine or arginine, would block cleavage at that site and possibly adjacent sites. At least two phosphorylation sites are present, one on serine and one on threonine. Although additional sites of phosphorylation cannot be ruled out, changes in the extent of other modifications could result in the multiple phosphopeptides observed.When the effects of phosphorylation of EF-1 by S6 kinase were investigated by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, the activity of phosphorylated EF-1 and EF-1 complexed with ValRS was increased 2.0–2.6-fold over that of nonphosphorylated EF-1. Previously, binding of labeled AUG to 40 S ribosomal subunits and poly(A,U,G)-directed translation were increased following phosphorylation of S6 by multipotential S6 kinase (50Burkhard S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 4-fold stimulation of translation of globin mRNA was observed with a reconstituted protein-synthesizing system (23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3518-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated by multipotential S6 kinase were assayed by polyphenylalanine synthesis, elongation was increased 2-fold as compared with nonphosphorylated ribosomes. Moreover, phosphorylation of EF-1 and S6 resulted in coordinate stimulation of elongation.The elongation activity in serum-fed cells, serum-deprived cells, and serum-deprived cells treated with insulin for 15 min was examined using postmitochondrial supernatants. Serum deprivation of 3T3-L1 cells for 1.5 h resulted in a 50% reduction in elongation activity as compared with serum-fed cells, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min stimulated elongation 1.8-fold. The stimulation of elongation rate in response to insulin was confirmed by transit time measurements, which showed a 2-fold increase upon the addition of insulin for 15 min to serum-deprived cells.Increases in the rate of elongation of 2–3-fold observed in response to insulin may appear small; however, the extent of stimulation of elongation by insulin is similar to changes in overall protein synthesis when insulin is added to serum-deprived cells (10Motorin Y.A. Wolfson A.D. Orlovsky A.F. Gladilin K.L. FEBS Lett. 1987; 238: 262-264Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A.

Biochem. 1995; 59: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). They are also similar to those observed previously with phorbol ester and protein kinase C at the initiation and elongation steps (6Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11993-11998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of course, the measured rate of elongation and the transit time are average values of multiple translation events, some of which will be more responsive to insulin and growth-promoting compounds than others.The postribosomal supernatant and ribosomes were shown to contribute to enhanced elongation activity in response to insulin. EF-1 was identified as the component in the supernatant responsible for increased elongation by partial purification. EF-1 was also implicated by analysis of tRNA-binding to ribosomes, in which the binding activity in supernatants from serum-fed and insulin-treated cells was twice that from serum-deprived cells.Multipotential S6 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate eIF-2, eIF-3 p120, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F p220 (27Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ribosomal protein S6 (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Palen E. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3518-3523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perisic O. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-4F p220 by S6 kinase stimulates translation by 3–5-fold, increases association with capped mRNA, and enhances binding of 32P-labeled mRNA to the initiation complex (51Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Etchison D. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4669-4672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that the phosphorylation of EF-1 by multipotential S6 kinase stimulates elongation, and the rate of elongation is enhanced further with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6. These studies also show that serum deprivation reduces EF-1 activity, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min restores the EF-1 activity. In other studies, Chang and Traugh 2Y.-W. E. Chang and J. A. Traugh, submitted for publication. have shown that the phosphopeptide maps of EF-1 phosphorylated in vitro by multipotential S6 kinase are identical to those obtained in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin for 15 min, with four additional phosphopeptides observed with the α subunit phosphorylatedin vivo. Thus, it appears that EF-1 is involved in the multipotential S6 kinase-mediated regulation of protein synthesis in response to insulin, which includes phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and ribosomal protein S6.Recently, a rapid decrease of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors has been shown to correlate with an enhanced rate of elongation (37Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reduction of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin is due to a decrease of EF-2 kinase activity. Therefore, insulin appears to enhance elongation by the differential regulation of elongation factors 1 and 2. Insulin has been shown to rapidly stimulate protein synthesis in a variety of cell types at both initiation and elongation (reviewed in Refs. 39Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 40Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Annu. Rev.

Treatment of serum-deprived cells with insulin results in a 1.4–3-fold increase in the rate of protein synthesis within 15–30 min (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Welsh G.I. Proud G.C. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 43Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2383-2389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and S6 coincided with the activation of multipotential S6 kinase, and phosphopeptide mapping confirmed the role of this S6 kinase in insulin stimulation (19Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-fold stimulation of polypeptide chain elongation was also observed in soleus muscle isolated from 18-h fasted mice treated with insulin, as measured by ribosome transit time (45Yoshizawa F. Tonouchi A. Miura Y. Yagasaki K. Funabiki R. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1995; 59: 348-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Previously, the rate of elongation (46Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 324: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and EF-1 activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in actively dividing Vero cells were shown to be reduced by deprivation of serum. Readdition of serum led to a rapid restoration of elongation activity (47Hassell J.A. Engelhardt D.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).

A total of six phosphopeptides were obtained with EF-1α, with both serine and threonine phosphorylated. It is important to note that the α subunit is modified at two sites by the addition of glycerolphosphorylethanolamine to glutamic acid residues, and five lysine residues are di- or trimethylated, as shown by Dever and co-workers (48Dever T.E.

Methylation would block tryptic cleavage at that lysine, and all of the modifications including phosphorylation, if present next to a lysine or arginine, would block cleavage at that site and possibly adjacent sites. At least two phosphorylation sites are present, one on serine and one on threonine. Although additional sites of phosphorylation cannot be ruled out, changes in the extent of other modifications could result in the multiple phosphopeptides observed. When the effects of phosphorylation of EF-1 by S6 kinase were investigated by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, the activity of phosphorylated EF-1 and EF-1 complexed with ValRS was increased 2.0–2.6-fold over that of nonphosphorylated EF-1. Previously, binding of labeled AUG to 40 S ribosomal subunits and poly(A,U,G)-directed translation were increased following phosphorylation of S6 by multipotential S6 kinase (50Burkhard S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14003-14008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 4-fold stimulation of translation of globin mRNA was observed with a reconstituted protein-synthesizing system (23Palen E.

Moreover, phosphorylation of EF-1 and S6 resulted in coordinate stimulation of elongation. The elongation activity in serum-fed cells, serum-deprived cells, and serum-deprived cells treated with insulin for 15 min was examined using postmitochondrial supernatants. Serum deprivation of 3T3-L1 cells for 1.5 h resulted in a 50% reduction in elongation activity as compared with serum-fed cells, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min stimulated elongation 1.8-fold. The stimulation of elongation rate in response to insulin was confirmed by transit time measurements, which showed a 2-fold increase upon the addition of insulin for 15 min to serum-deprived cells. Increases in the rate of elongation of 2–3-fold observed in response to insulin may appear small; however, the extent of stimulation of elongation by insulin is similar to changes in overall protein synthesis when insulin is added to serum-deprived cells (10Motorin Y.A.

They are also similar to those observed previously with phorbol ester and protein kinase C at the initiation and elongation steps (6Venema R.C. Peters H.I. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Of course, the measured rate of elongation and the transit time are average values of multiple translation events, some of which will be more responsive to insulin and growth-promoting compounds than others. The postribosomal supernatant and ribosomes were shown to contribute to enhanced elongation activity in response to insulin. EF-1 was identified as the component in the supernatant responsible for increased elongation by partial purification. EF-1 was also implicated by analysis of tRNA-binding to ribosomes, in which the binding activity in supernatants from serum-fed and insulin-treated cells was twice that from serum-deprived cells. Multipotential S6 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate eIF-2, eIF-3 p120, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F p220 (27Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as ribosomal protein S6 (20Morley S.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9589-9592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF-4F p220 by S6 kinase stimulates translation by 3–5-fold, increases association with capped mRNA, and enhances binding of 32P-labeled mRNA to the initiation complex (51Morley S.J. Dever T.E. Etchison D. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4669-4672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that the phosphorylation of EF-1 by multipotential S6 kinase stimulates elongation, and the rate of elongation is enhanced further with 80 S ribosomes phosphorylated on S6. These studies also show that serum deprivation reduces EF-1 activity, while the addition of insulin to serum-deprived cells for 15 min restores the EF-1 activity. In other studies, Chang and Traugh 2Y.-W. E. Chang and J. A. Traugh, submitted for publication. have shown that the phosphopeptide maps of EF-1 phosphorylated in vitro by multipotential S6 kinase are identical to those obtained in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 cells treated with insulin for 15 min, with four additional phosphopeptides observed with the α subunit phosphorylatedin vivo. Thus, it appears that EF-1 is involved in the multipotential S6 kinase-mediated regulation of protein synthesis in response to insulin, which includes phosphorylation of eIF-4B, eIF-4F, and ribosomal protein S6. Recently, a rapid decrease of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors has been shown to correlate with an enhanced rate of elongation (37Redpath N.T. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2291-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The reduction of phosphorylation of EF-2 in response to insulin is due to a decrease of EF-2 kinase activity. Therefore, insulin appears to enhance elongation by the differential regulation of elongation factors 1 and 2. We thank Dr. William C. Merrick for providing antibodies to EF-1H and EF-1α and William Meek for multipotential S6 kinase."

A new alignment of the dimerization domains of RI, RII, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase elucidates fundamental similarities as well as significant differences among these three domains. Many of the proteins that are involved in signal transduction such as protein kinases and transcription factors tend to be modular. Multiple domains with well defined structure and function are assembled into a single polypeptide, thus allowing for the well orchestrated and highly regulated cascade of signaling events. The regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase have long been recognized as highly modular multifunctional proteins (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 2Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The separate domains and their functional independence were initially established as a consequence of their susceptibility to limited proteolysis. Recombinant approaches have subsequently further defined the features of the isolated domains (3Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ringheim G.E.

At the amino terminus, a dimerization domain maintains the R subunits 1The abbreviations used are: R subunit, regulatory subunit; RI and RII, type I and II regulatory subunits, respectively; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; cGPK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: R subunit, regulatory subunit; RI and RII, type I and II regulatory subunits, respectively; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; cGPK, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. as an asymmetric dimer. This region is followed by a variable region, often proline-rich and containing multiple phosphorylation sites (7Weldon S.L. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1129-1135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hemmings B.A. Aitken A. Cohne P. Raymond M. Hofmann F. Eur. J.

Chem. 1982; 257: 10440-10445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next is the inhibitor site, an extended segment that resembles a protein substrate and binds to the active site of the catalytic subunit in the absence of cAMP, thus maintaining the complex as an inactive tetramer. Because of its susceptibility to proteolysis in the absence of the catalytic subunit, this region is often referred to as the “hinge” region. At the C terminus are two tandem cAMP binding sites. Upon cooperative binding of cAMP to the R subunit, the active catalytic subunits are released from the holoenzyme complex. Although much is known about the function and structure of the cAMP binding sites, less is known about the dimerization domain (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 4Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the case of the RII subunit and more recently RI, this dimerization domain is thought to be important for subcellular localization (2Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). There are at least four unique gene products in the R subunit family, and all retain the same general domain structure. With the exception of the R subunit in Dictyostelium discoideum (12Mutzel R. Lacombe M.-L. Simon M.N. deGunzburg J. Veron M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), all of the R subunits are stable dimers, and it is the amino terminus that is responsible for dimerization. The interaction site between the two protomers is associated with the first 40–60 residues, although the precise boundaries of the dimerization domain differ slightly for RI and RII subunits (13Zick S.K. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reimann E.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Scott J.D.

Within the family of R subunits, the sequences at the amino terminus are the most variable. The two general classes are designated as RI and RII, and within each class are at least two variants, α and β (1Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). In the RIα subunit, the dimer region contains two cysteine residues, which form interchain disulfide bonds (13Zick S.K. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Cys16 is disulfide-bonded to Cys37, the two protomers were predicted to be antiparallel (16Bubis J. Vedvick T.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the RII subunit, the N-terminal dimerization domain has been implicated in a critical biological function, namely interaction with AKAPs (A-kinase anchorproteins) (2Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J.

Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) While anchoring proteins so far have been associated primarily with the RII subunits, a recent finding shows that a novel family of anchoring proteins recognizes RI as well as RII (11Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), indicating that the RI subunit is likely to play a role in subcellular targeting of cAPK. Other reports that the RI subunit localizes to the activated T-cell receptor and the neuromuscular junction lend further support to such a role for RI in addition to its role as an inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of cAPK (21Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Faust D.M. Benichou J.-C. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RIα dimerization domain, expressed as a stable disulfide-bonded, trypsin-resistant fragment, is described here with particular focus on the importance of the endogenous interchain disulfide bonds. Biophysical analysis of the reduced fragment as well as mutation of Cys37 confirmed the antiparallel alignments of the chains and established, furthermore, that disulfide bonds are not required for dimerization in vitro or in vivo. Models of the dimerization/docking domain of RIα are discussed and compared with the RII subunit as well as cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The bovine RIα was expressed and purified as described previously (23Saraswat L.D. Filutowics M. Taylor S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To confirm the antiparallel alignment of the protomers and to ascertain the importance of the disulfide bonds for dimerization, Cys37 was replaced with His using thein vitro mutagenesis system from Bio-Rad, which is based on the Kunkel method (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) as described previously. The resulting clones containing the mutant DNA were identified by sequencing using the Sanger dideoxy method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). The mutant double-stranded DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli 222 cells and grown on LB/ampicillin agar plates. Cells were grown and checked for protein expression using SDS-PAGE. The mutant recombinant RIα-(C37H) was purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (23Saraswat L.D. Filutowics M. Taylor S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the N-terminal domain could be expressed independently as a stable disulfide-bonded dimer, two stop codons were introduced at Gln62 in the RIα subunit as described above. To facilitate purification, the deletion mutant was also fused to a polyhistidine tag in the pRSETc vector. The Q62stopRIgene was excised from the RIα:pUC118 vector usingEcoRI and subcloned into the pRSETc vector. The recombinant DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. Expression was tested in the absence and presence of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside by SDS-PAGE. The RIα subunit (2 mg/ml) was incubated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT) (0–100 mm). Samples were then boiled for 2 min in sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Slab gels (1 mm) were prepared with 10% acrylamide as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). In some cases, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) at a final concentration of 1 m was added to quench the reaction prior to the addition of the denaturing SDS solution to guarantee that no reduction occurred following denaturation. Samples were also unfolded in the presence of 8 m urea. RIα (2 mg/ml) was dialyzed against 8 m urea, 10 mmMOPS (pH 7.0) for 2 h and then incubated with increasing amounts of DTT. The effect of quenching the reaction with NEM prior to the addition of the denaturing SDS solution was also evaluated. The Q62stopRI gene was subcloned from puc118 into pRSETc-EcoRI. The fusion protein designated His6-RI(1–61) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) at 37 °C and purified to near homogeneity using cobalt-agarose resin. Bacterial cell lysates containing His6-RI-(1–61) were incubated with cobalt-agarose in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) with 5 mm β-ME at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed with the same buffer with 10 mm imidazole to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. His6-RI-(1–61) was then eluted off the resin with lysis buffer containing 100 mmimidazole. After dialyzing against 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 4 °C, the fusion protein was digested with TPCK-treated trypsin (1:50, w/w) for 20 h at 37 °C. Peptides were then resolved by HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (1.0 × 25 cm) using a 10–50% gradient at pH 2.1 of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile). The flow rate was 3 ml/min, and absorbance was monitored at 219 nm. The fraction containing the disulfide-bonded fragment of RIα comprising residues 12–61 was thus isolated. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal peptide was determined using an automated ABI gas phase peptide sequencer. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis and/or Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Analytical gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 22 °C in a MOPS buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) containing 100 mm KCl with Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography. The retention volume of RIα in the absence of DTT was compared with RIα that had been pretreated in the MOPS/KCl buffer containing 100 mm DTT. To determine the molecular weight of the dimerization domain, RI-(12–61), the protein was loaded onto the Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column at an initial concentration of 1 mg/ml. The column was calibrated using the Pharmacia calibration kit. The lyophilized dimerization domain, RIα-(12–61), (0.14 mg) was redissolved in 1 ml of 25 mmpotassium phosphate and 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, and placed in a cuvette with a 0.2-cm path length. Circular dichroism measurements were made on an AVIV CD spectropolarimeter. The spectrum was scanned from 300 to 200 nm at the temperatures indicated. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ], was calculated as θ/lC r where θ is the ellipticity in degrees, l is the cell path length in cm, and C r is the concentration of amino acid residues in dmol/liter. To further analyze the secondary structure of the dimerization domain, the sequence of the trypsin-resistant segment was analyzed using the CDESTIMA computer program, which combines the CD data with the Chou-Fasman algorithm (27Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). When the RIα subunit of cAPK was purified from mammalian tissues, the two protomers of the dimer were stoichiometrically cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds (13Zick S.K. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2287-2293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No significant amount of monomer was observed in the absence of β-ME. As seen in Fig.1, when the RIα subunit and a deletion mutant, RI-(Δ260–379), were overexpressed in E. coli, the protomers were also totally cross-linked by interchain disulfide bonds just as was observed for the full-length mammalian RIα subunit. To confirm that these disulfide bonds were not formed as an artifact during purification, the total extract was lysed directly in SDS-PAGE buffer. Under these conditions, the two protomers were still stoichiometrically linked by interchain disulfide bonds. No monomeric R subunit was observed. The stability of these interchain disulfide bonds in RIα was assessed first by defining the conditions required for reducing the disulfide linkage. The RIα dimer was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of DTT. Reduction was monitored by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Excess DTT was quenched by adding 1 mNEM prior to adding the sample to the SDS denaturing solution. As seen in Fig. 2 A, significant amounts of monomer were only observed when the concentration of DTT was 50 mm or greater. Even in the absence of NEM, the full disappearance of the dimer required 50 mm DTT (Fig.2 B). To determine whether denatured RIα could be reduced more readily than the native protein, the RIα dimer was unfolded by dialyzing against 8m urea before adding DTT. Under these conditions, the three tryptophans in RIα, located in cAMP-binding domains, are fully exposed to solvent based on iodide quenching (28León D.A. Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The addition of 8m urea had no effect on the reduction of the disulfide bonds when excess DTT was quenched with NEM (Fig. 2 D). Even in the presence of 8 m urea, 50 mm DTT was still required to reduce the interchain disulfide bonds. In the absence of quenching with NEM, some monomer was observed at DTT concentrations of 5 mm; however, this most likely occurred after the addition of the SDS denaturing buffer (Fig. 2 C). The above results indicated that the disulfide bonds in the RIα dimer were extremely resistant to reduction. Even when the rest of the molecule was exposed to 8 m urea, a condition sufficient to unfold the cAMP-binding domains (28León D.A. Dostmann W.R.G. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the disulfides in the dimerization domain remained protected, suggesting that the secondary structure in the disulfide-bonded segment was still intact. To further probe the stability and structural features of this dimerization motif, recombinant techniques were used to overexpress a deletion mutant of RIα that contained only the dimerization region. The N-terminal fragment was overexpressed and purified using the cobalt-agarose affinity resin. Fractions containing His6-RI-(1–61) were then pooled and digested with TPCK-treated trypsin. The tryptic peptide corresponding to residues 12–61 was purified by HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3shows the purified fusion protein as well as the final trypsinized peptide analyzed on SDS-PAGE under reducing as well as nonreducing conditions. The apparent molecular mass for the monomer was 9.0 kDa. In the absence of β-ME, the purified fragment ran with a apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa. Thus, the peptide alone, like the intact RIα, is a stable disulfide-bonded dimer. The tryptic peptide was analyzed by analytical gel filtration column in KMOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, pH 6.5). Under these conditions, the apparent molecular mass was calculated to be 17 kDa based on constructed calibration curves. When the RIα dimer was analyzed by gel filtration in the absence of DTT, it eluted as an asymmetric dimer with a Stokes radius of 46.3 Å (29Zoller M.J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8363-8368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the RI subunit with 100 mm DTT for 1 h was sufficient to achieve complete reduction of the disulfide bonds as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). When this protein was loaded onto the gel filtration column equilibrated with 100 mm DTT in the running buffer, the elution volume was unchanged, indicating that the dimer was intact although the interchain disulfide bonds were no longer present. To confirm that the chains were aligned in an antiparallel arrangement and to further determine whether the disulfide bonds were necessary for a stable dimer, Cys37 was replaced with His. This Cys37→ His mutant migrated on SDS-PAGE in the absence or presence of reducing agent as a monomer (Fig. 4,inset). When analyzed by gel filtration, however, recombinant RIα-(C37H) still migrated as a dimer and was indistinguishable from the wild type RIα (Fig. 4). The finding that the mutation of a single Cys, C37H, abolished the interchain disulfide bonds thus confirmed the previous observation that the two monomers are aligned in an antiparallel orientation and also established that the disulfide bonds are not essential for stable dimer formation in vivo. The CD spectrum for the RIα-(12–61) dimerization domain (Fig.5) showed two minima at 205 and 222 nm, indicating a high content of α-helix. The α-helicity of the peptide was monitored over a wide pH range. The peptide was stable to pH changes and still maintained a considerable amount of secondary structure at extremes of pH (2 and 12). Based on the amino acid sequence of the RIα N-terminal domain, it is speculated that hydrophobic interactions are critical in mediating interfacial packing at the dimeric interface. To test this hypothesis, CD spectra of the N-terminal peptide were taken at 100 mmand 1 m potassium fluoride. As shown in Fig. 5 B, at higher ionic strength there is an increase in the α-helicity of the peptide, confirming that, in fact, hydrophobic interactions are important. The thermal stability of the RIα-(12–61) fragment was also monitored by CD. The spectra were scanned from 300 to 200 nm, and the temperature was increased from 0 to 92 °C. CD spectra at selected temperatures are shown in Fig. 5 C. From 0 to 62 °C, there was a gradual loss of ellipticity, yet at both temperatures, there was still defined α-helical structure. A spectrum typical of a random coil was not observed even at 92 °C, indicating that secondary structure was still present. A complete temperature curve is shown in Fig.5 C. After RIα-(12–61) was incubated at 92 °C, it was allowed to cool to room temperature (25 °C). The spectrum of the refolded RIα-(12–61) was very similar to the original spectrum at 26 °C, indicating that the partial unfolding of dimeric fragment was fully reversible. Based on the CDESTIMA program, which couples the CD data with a Chou-Fasman algorithm, the RIα-(12–61) dimeric fragment was predicted to be approximately 40–50% helical at 0 °C (Table I). Boundaries of the predicted helices are indicated in Fig.6.Table ICalculated secondary structure from circular dichroic dataTemperatureα-Helixβ-structureTurnRandom%%%%0 °C465222726 °C3715212792 °C15282631Renatured at 25 °C36192223A convolution method was used based on the circular dichroic measurement data.

The program CDESTIMA was used to estimate secondary structure from the data by incorporating the Chou-Fasman algorithm. The RIα subunit of cAPK is maintained as a dimeric protein by a dimerization domain at the N terminus. As demonstrated here, this domain is mostly helical and is chemically, kinetically, and thermally stable. Although disulfide bonding is rare in intracellular proteins, the RIα subunit is an exception, since the full-length mammalian and recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli were both found exclusively as disulfide-bonded dimers. Even when deletion mutants of the dimerization domain alone were expressed in E. coli, the two chains were still disulfide-bonded. The disulfide bonds were, furthermore, extremely resistant to reduction, even in the presence of 8 m urea, suggesting that these disulfide bonds are buried and shielded from solvent. The boundaries of the trypsin-resistant core that define this stable dimerization domain are indicated in Fig.6. Although the disulfide bonds were chemically stable, once reduced, the protein did not dissociate into monomers. It remained as a dimer with a Stokes radius that was indistinguishable from that of the wild type protein. To determine whether the disulfide bonds were required for dimerization in vivo, a mutant protein was engineered where one of the two cysteines was replaced with His. This mutation, C37H, was sufficient to abolish disulfide bonding, confirming the antiparallel alignment of the two chains that was shown previously by peptide mapping (16Bubis J. Vedvick T.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation was not, however, sufficient to prevent dimerization. Thus, like the RII subunits that lack interchain disulfide bonds, the RIα subunit is intrinsically a stable dimer, independent of the interchain disulfide bonds. In the absence of a high resolution structure, the structural features of this dimerization domain were probed by CD, which indicated a high degree of a thermostable α-helix. Based on the CD spectrum of the isolated dimerization domain, the proteolytic resistance of the fragment, the resistance of the disulfide bonds to reduction, and secondary structure predictions, it is possible to propose a model for the tertiary structure of the dimerization motif, RIα-(12–61). The circular dichroism coupled with secondary structure prediction algorithms was used as a guide for localizing potential amphipathic helices. Residues 45–59, preceded by prolines, are predicted to be a well defined amphipathic α-helix. The N-terminal portion is predicted to contain an additional α-helix as well as two β-strands. If the segment between Cys16 and Cys37 is predominantly helical, then the two chains must be antiparallel, to accommodate interchain disulfide bonding between Cys16 and Cys37. This would mean that the predicted helices at the C terminus would also be antiparallel, yielding a four-helix bundle motif. If, however, the segment between Cys16 and Cys37 contains both α-helix and β-strand, the predicted C-terminal helix could be parallel, antiparallel, or not interacting at all. From the information described here, we know only that the residues within amino acids 16 and 37 are shielded from the solvent based on the stability of the disulfides and the protease resistance of the fragment. The stability of the RIα dimeric domain is surprising but not unique for helical dimerization motifs. For instance, many DNA-binding proteins have a unique α-helical region that contains a characteristic heptad repeat of leucine residues referred to as a leucine zipper. The motif is found in transcription factors (i.e. GCN4) and in nuclear transforming oncogene products such as Fos, Jun, and Myc (30Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). The stability of these domains has been addressed thermodynamically (31Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) and in fact correlates with the remarkable thermal stability we observe for the RIα dimerization domain. Despite the similarity of the RIα dimerization domain in terms of stability with other known dimerization domains, we believe that the RIα dimerization domain is a novel and unique motif. Further experiments are under way to probe this domain structurally. Is this dimerization motif in RIα conserved in other related members of this enzyme family? Two other members of this family, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGPK) and the RII subunits, are both stable dimers. The N-terminal sequences of all three proteins are compared in Fig. 7. The RII subunits, like cGPK and the RI subunits, are stable dimers, although they do not have interchain disulfide bonds. Previous alignments of the RI and RII subunits were based on the obvious sequence similarities in the cAMP-binding domains and in the autoinhibitor sites (32Takio K. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Walsh K.A. Titani K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2544-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Titani K. Shoji S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Neurath H. Fischer E.H. Takio K. Smith S.B. Krebs E.G. Demaille J.G. Rosen O.M. Krebs E.G. Protein Phosphorylation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 19-32Google Scholar). Similarities in these regions are extensive, with the major difference being that the RI subunits are typically about 20 residues shorter than the RII subunits due to a truncation of cAMP-binding domain B. Based on this original alignment, the sequence similarities in the amino terminus were not initially apparent (16Bubis J. Vedvick T.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if the two molecules are aligned as shown in Fig. 7, where the predicted functional dimerization domains of RI and RII are aligned, similarities in the dimerization domains can also be recognized. For example, the type II holoenzyme, but not free RII, was susceptible to proteolysis at Arg45, and removal of these first 45 residues was sufficient to eliminate dimerization of this protein (14Reimann E.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that the region flanking Arg45 in the RII subunit must be on the surface, since it is accessible to trypsin. This protease-sensitive region is in the exact location as the protease-accessible site in the RI subunit (Ser12–Lys61) when the sequences are aligned as shown in Fig. 7. When the first 50 residues from the RII subunit were subjected to the CON22 program, which predicts secondary structure based on Chou-Fasman and Garnier algorithms (27Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar, 34Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3411) Google Scholar), one major α-helical region was identified, residues 27–45. In the alignment shown in Fig. 7, this segment now aligns with the predicted carboxyl-terminal helix in the dimerization domain of RIα. The dimerization domain in RIIα has a unique functional role. Within this segment is an “anchoring” motif that enables the RII subunit to bind with high affinity to other proteins such as the brain protein, p75 (35Sarkar D. Erlichman J. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the microtubule assembly protein 2 (36Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the dimer is sufficient to abolish this binding. Residues 1–79 of the RII subunit, for example, are required for microtubule assembly protein 2 interaction, and removal of the first 10 residues was sufficient to abolish microtubule assembly protein 2 binding (39Hausken Z.E. Dell'Acqua M.L. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29016-29022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was concluded that dimerization was required for anchoring protein interactions and that residues 1–14 are an essential part of the dimerization domain in the RIIα subunit (15Scott J.D.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect evidence that residues 1–30 in the RIIα subunit have an amphipathic surface comes from the results of Carr et al., who concluded that the RIIα dimer interacts with anchoring proteins (microtubule assembly protein 2, P150, and two thyroid proteins) that contain a 14-residue amphipathic helix (42Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) have identified a whole family of RIIα-binding proteins (AKAPs) that bind to overlapping regions of the extreme N-terminal dimerization domain of RIIα, and their binding is dependent on dimerization of RIIα. Recently, Li and Rubin (44Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have identified key hydrophobic residues (Leu13, Phe36) that are essential for dimerization of RIIβ and its subsequent anchoring to the cytoskeleton. These residues are conserved among all species as highlighted in Fig. 7, and their role as key hydrophobic contacts at the dimer interface is consistent with our model of the dimerization motif in RIα. Recently, another novel anchoring protein was identified that can recognize both RI and RII. His6-RI-(12–61) was able to interact with this protein with high affinity (11Huang L.J. Durick K. Weiner J.A. Chun J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8057-8064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although previous reports indicate that the RIα subunit localizes to activated T-cell receptors and is also localized at the neuromuscular junction (21Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Faust D.M. Benichou J.-C. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this report is the first direct evidence showing that the N terminus of RI, like RII, can play a role in subcellular localization. Experiments are in progress to establish critical residues in the RI dimerization domain that are required for dimerization as well as binding to this novel family of anchoring proteins. In cGMP-dependent protein kinase, the regulatory and catalytic domains are fused into a single polypeptide chain. Like cAPK, the two protomers are joined covalently, but there is only one interchain disulfide bond (45Monken C.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7067-7070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An amino-terminal, 39-residue peptide of cGMP-dependent protein kinase was isolated and, based on circular dichroism and NMR analysis, was also found to be predominantly α-helical (46Landgraff W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.T. Higgins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). cGMP-dependent protein kinase contains a leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat consistent with a leucine zipper motif (47Atkinson R.A. Saudek V. Huggins J.P. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (9385): 9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase have similar regulatory domains, the RIα dimerization domain does not contain an exact leucine/isoleucine heptad repeat like cGPK. In addition, there are prolines in the middle of the RIα dimerization domain. In theory, the leucine zipper in cGPK could be parallel or antiparallel; however, the single disulfide bond involving a Cys at the end of the dimerization motif in the α isoform of cGPK makes it likely that this segment of the helical dimerization motif is parallel in cGPK (48Monken C.E. Gill G.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 888-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, the linking of Cys16 in one chain with Cys37 in the other chain mandates that this amino-terminal segment of the dimerization motif must be antiparallel in RIα. Thus, although both related proteins have a stable helical dimerization motif, there are some striking differences. The orientation of the rest of the molecule, in each of the dimerization domains discussed above, depends critically on the directionality of the C-terminal helix in each of them. This detailed comparison of the N-terminal domains of RI, RII, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase emphasizes that there are some fundamental similarities and differences among the three proteins, although all contain a well defined motif for maintaining a dimeric aggregation state. Ultimately, high resolution structures are necessary to define these differences.

Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5 (513): 517PubMed Google Scholar). The family consists of three members, IL-1α, IL-1β, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP). Signal transduction is initiated by the binding of either IL-1α or IL-1β to its receptor; conversely, as its name suggests, the binding of IRAP to the IL-1 receptor does not activate any downstream effector molecules, but rather, acts as a competitive inhibitor of ligand-receptor binding (2Sims J.E. Dower S.K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 539-546PubMed Google Scholar).The IL-1 family is expressed as precursor proteins; the precursors of IL-1α and IL-1β are translated as 31-kDa proteins, which are processed to the mature carboxyl terminus 17-kDa forms (3March C.J.

Hoover G.A. Stemerman M.B. Weinstein R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The senescent HUVEC population contains elevated steady state levels of the IL-1α transcript, as well as increased levels of IL-1 response genes (21Garfinkel S. Brown S. Wessendorf J.H.M. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of an IL-1α-specific antisense oligomer to the senescent cells extends their proliferative capacityin vitro (22Maier J.A.M. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the elevated levels of intracellular IL-1α in the senescent HUVEC population are biologically active and may be involved in the induction of the senescent HUVEC phenotype.It has been difficult to further define the function of intracellular IL-1α, since HUVEC populations are refractory to conventional stable transfection or transduction techniques. Thus, to study the role of intracellular IL-1α, we have transfected a spontaneous HUVEC transformant, the endothelial cell variant (ECV) cell line (23Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J.-I. Mukai K.

We report that IL-1α p, but not IL-1α m, is functional as an intracellular regulator of ECV cell migration and that nuclear localization of IL-1α p may play a role in mediating this function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe proliferative and migratory responses of HUVEC in vitro are dependent upon the addition of FGF (20Maciag T. Hoover G.A. Stemerman M.B. Weinstein R. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 29Terranova V.P. DiFlorio R. Lyall R.M. Hic S. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2330-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and addition of IL-1α attenuates these effects (19Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Certain strains of senescent HUVEC have an increased steady state level of intracellular IL-1α p (21Garfinkel S. Brown S. Wessendorf J.H.M. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and studies from our laboratory have shown that the elevated levels of IL-1α correlates with an attenuation of the migratory and growth response of senescent HUVEC to FGF-1 (19Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of intracellular IL-1α p in the human endothelial cell, a spontaneous HUVEC transformant, the ECV cell, was stably transfected with the pMEXneo vector alone or with this plasmid containing either IL-1α p, IL-1α m, or the IL-1α p K82N NLS point mutant, which attenuates nuclear traffic of intracellular IL-1α p (8Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ECV cell line was chosen, since (i) it has similar properties to normal endothelial cells, (ii) it expresses extremely low levels of endogenous IL-1α as analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (data not shown) and immunoblot (Fig.1 A) methods, and (iii) serum-induced ECV cell growth is inhibited by exogenous IL-1α by 50–60% (data not shown). Thus, we reasoned that while ECV cell IL-1α transfectants expressing high levels of IL-1α protein would not be selected due to an impaired proliferative phenotype, it should still be possible to select stable IL-1α transfectants with low levels of IL-1α expression, which would permit ECV cell growth and enable studies on the intracellular function of IL-1α. Individual clones were selected and expanded, and cell lysates were analyzed for IL-1α by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 A). While no IL-1α-specific proteins were detected in samples from vector control-transfected cells, a single 31-kDa band was detected in the IL-1α p and IL-1α p K82N transfectants. Similarly, a band of approximately 17 kDa was detected in clones transfected with the IL-1α m-containing plasmid.To determine whether the proteins detected by immunoblot analysis were biologically active, lysates of the transfected cells were prepared and analyzed for functional IL-1α activity using inhibition of A375 human melanoma cell growth (26Nakai S. Mizuno K. Kaneta M. Hirai Y. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The highest concentration of vector control ECV cell lysates inhibited the growth of the A375 cells by approximately 50%. However, addition of lysate from IL-1α p-, IL-1α p K82N-, and IL-1α m-transfected ECV cells inhibited the growth of the cells significantly more than equivalent volumes of vector control lysate. Based on a standard titration, where 100 pg/ml of human recombinant IL-1α inhibited the growth of the A375 cells by 50% (data not shown), the growth inhibition assay detected 2960 pg of IL-1α/107 cells for IL-1α m transfectants, 2108 pg of IL-1α/107 cells for the IL-1α p transfectants, and 5244 pg/107 cells for the IL-1α p K82N transfectants. Only 158 pg/107 cells of IL-1α growth inhibitory activity was detected from lysates of vector control-transfected cells. Further, addition of 100 ng/ml IRAP reversed the growth inhibitory effect of the IL-1α p and IL-1α m lysates (data not shown), suggesting that the specific growth inhibitory factor in these lysates is IL-1α.To determine whether expression of the IL-1α-specific proteins in the ECV cells had any effect on their migration, vector control, IL-1α p and IL-1α m ECV cell transfectants were examined in a wound assay, and the results shown in Fig.2 A represent the mean of four separate experiments. The migration of vector control ECV transfectants increased rapidly as a function of the concentration of serum and reached a maximum at 2% (v/v) FBS. Conversely, IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants cells exhibited a significantly reduced level of migration; the number of cells migrating into the denuded area was approximately 60% of the vector control ECV population. Interestingly, the IL-1α m ECV transfectants exhibited an increased migratory response relative to vector control-transfected cells. Further, the migration of additional IL-1α clones obtained from a second transfection study produced similar results as described in the legend to Fig. 2 A.Figure 2Migratory response of ECV cell transfectants in the presence or absence of IRAP. The results represent the mean of four experiments with each point being measured in duplicate.A, confluent monolayers of vector control (•), IL-1α p (▴), IL-1α m (▪) ECV cell transfectants were wounded with a razor blade as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the number of cells migrating into the denuded area upon serum stimulation determined by counting with a light microscope at × 100 magnification using a grid.

The data represent the mean of four experiments with each point measured in duplicate. C, confluent monolayers of vector control (•) and IL-1α p K82N transfectants were wounded and incubated for 20 h in increasing concentrations of FBS in the presence (▴) or absence (▪) of IRAP (100 ng/ml). The number of cells migrating into the denuded area was determined as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess whether the modification of ECV cell migration by IL-1α p and IL-1α m was a result of their intracellular biological activity, we examined the ability of the various ECV cell transfectants to respond to the addition of exogenous IRAP. We anticipated a reversal of the migratory responses in the presence of IRAP if the observed effects were due to the release of either of the two forms of IL-1α. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the migration of the IL-1α p and the IL-1α m ECV cell transfectant were similar to the results in Fig.2 A, and thus, these cells were not sensitive to the addition of IRAP. The ratio of IL-1α p-transfected ECV cells to vector control-transfected cells migrating into the denuded area remained constant, such that a ratio of 63.4% was determined in the absence of IRAP, while a ratio of 68.9% was found upon IRAP addition. In addition, exogenous IL-1α was able to increase the steady state mRNA levels of the IL-1 response gene, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 in vector control, IL-1α m and IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants (data not shown), suggesting the presence of functional IL-1 receptors at the cell surface. Thus, it is likely that the modulation of ECV cell migration by IL-1α p may be the result of the polypeptide acting as an intracellular modifier in vitro.The FGF and IL-1 prototypes contain a nuclear localization signal, and the nuclear traffic of these proteins has been studied in detail (8Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Maier J.A.M. Statuto M. Ragnotti G. Mol. Cell.

To determine whether nuclear localization of IL-1α p affected the migratory response, the ECV cell was stably transfected with an IL-1α p point mutant in which residue 82 in the NLS was changed from lysine to glutamic acid. This residue is critical for nuclear traffic, since IL-1α p is associated with the nucleus, while the IL-1α p K82N remains cytosolic in transfected NIH 3T3 cells (8Wessendorf J.H.M. Garfinkel S. Zhan X. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22100-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transfected ECV cells (data not shown) as β-galactosidase fusion proteins. Analysis of the migratory ability of the IL-1α p K82N ECV cell transfectants (Fig. 2 C) demonstrated an increased level of migration relative to vector control and IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants (Fig. 2, A and B), which also was refractory to the addition of IRAP. These data suggest that nuclear localization of intracellular IL-1α p may be important for its ability to repress ECV cell migration.Because the low migratory potential of the IL-1α p ECV cell transfectant may be related to an abundance of focal adhesion sites (FAS), to a bulky and stiff cytoskeleton or to the exaggeration of cell-to-cell contacts (31Dunlevy J.R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 489-500PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), the ECV cell transfectants were examined for differences in their intracellular architecture using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). The ECV cell transfectants were stained with an antibody against vinculin, the ubiquitous component of FAS, and no significant differences in the distribution or density of FAS between vector control, IL-1α m, and IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants were detected (data not shown). However, unlike the vector control transfectants (Fig. 3 A), the IL-1α p transfectants (Fig. 3 B) demonstrated a stronger intensity of staining for cell-to-cell contacts as shown by staining with an antibody against β-catenin, an essential component in the formation of adherence junctions of the human endothelial cell (32Dejana E. Corada M. Lampugnani M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-1α m transfectants exhibited a similar staining intensity of cell-to-cell contacts as the vector control-transfected cells upon staining for β-catenin (data not shown). The staining of ECV cell transfectants with an antibody against vimentin, a major component of intermediate filaments of mesoderm-derived cells, revealed a more developed and complex network in the IL-1α p transfectants (Fig. 3 D) than the vector control (Fig. 3 C) transfectants. Further, ECV cells stained with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin revealed a very small number of actin stress fibers in vector control ECV transfectants (Fig.3 E), where the filamentous actin was mostly associated with the cell membrane. In contrast, phalloidin staining of the IL-1α p ECV transfectants demonstrated numerous highly ordered stress fibers (Fig. 3 F). Interestingly, immunofluorescence microscopy of IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants with an antibody against cortactin, a Src substrate (33Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) and F-actin-binding protein (34Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), revealed cortactin-positive cytoplasmic patches (Fig. 3 H), which were not observed in either the vector control or IL-1α m ECV cell transfectants (Fig. 3 G and data not shown).Figure 3Immunofluorescence analysis of precursor IL-1α-transfected ECV cells. Vector control and IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” Photographs were taken using an Olympus fluorescence microscope at × 600 magnification. Vector control (A, C, E, G) and IL-1α p (B, D, F, H) ECV transfectants were stained with antibodies against β-catenin (A, B), vimentin (C, D), and cortactin (G, H), or fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (E, F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have reported that HUVEC senescence in vitro may be mediated by the intracellular function of the signal peptide-less cytokine, IL-1α (21Garfinkel S. Brown S. Wessendorf J.H.M. Maciag T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Maier J.A.M. Voulalas P. Roeder D. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1570-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Since our data suggest that the expression of IL-1α p, but not IL-1α m, in the ECV cell results in an impaired migratory phenotype that is (i) serum-dependent, (ii) refractory to the presence of exogenous IRAP, (iii) sensitive to point mutagenesis of the IL-1α p NLS, and (iv) correlates with an apparent increase in stress fibers, it is likely that these changes are due to the functional properties of intracellular precursor IL-1α as a nuclear protein. Although our data demonstrate that intracellular IL-1α p is able to repress ECV cell migration, we were unable to convincingly correlate this event with a decrease in ECV cell division. While it was possible to obtain IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants whose proliferative capacity appeared to be diminished in comparison with vector control ECV cell transfectants (data not shown), this phenotype was not consistently observed in four different IL-1α p transfectants analyzed.It is interesting that, unlike the IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants, the IL-1α m and IL-1α p K82N ECV cell transfectants were not able to repress cell migration; however, the IL-1α translation product of all forms of the IL-1α protein appear to be functional as exogenous proteins in the inhibition of A375 cell growth. In addition, the steady state levels of the IL-1α-responsive gene PAI-1 is elevated in the IL-1α p, IL-1α p K82N, as well as the IL-1α m ECV cell transfectants (data not shown). Thus it appears that although both forms of IL-1α are functional and can modify steady state gene expression, only the precursor form of IL-1α appears to be involved in the regulation of human endothelial cell migration. Further, the induction of IL-1α-dependent genes does not correlate with the regulation of endothelial cell migration, and this is consistent with our results, which show that the FGF-dependent induction of cell cycle-specific gene expression in senescent HUVEC populations may not be sufficient to promote a proliferative or migratory phenotype (19Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The mechanism utilized by IL-1α p to attenuate endothelial cell migration in vitro is not known, although it does appear likely that intracellular IL-1α p may be able to alter the cytoskeleton of the human endothelial cell. Interestingly, the appearance of prominent actin stress fibers in the IL-1α p ECV cell transfectants resembles a similar morphologic feature observed in the senescent HUVEC 2I. Prudovsky, S. Garfinkel, and T. Maciag, unpublished observations. and human diploid fibroblasts (35Wang E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1466-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These stress fibers were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, unlike stress fibers of migrating cells, which are known to exhibit polarity, being localized at the leading edge (36Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Because it is well established that the lamellipodium is formed by depolymerization and repolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton, and this process is regulated by phosphoinositol turnover (36Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), it is possible that intracellular IL-1α p may be able to modify these events.The bulky actin cytoskeleton and prominent network of vimentin filaments could contribute to the low motility of IL-1α p ECV transfectants. In addition, the prominence of intracellular adhesion sites as observed by the presence of β-catenin in cell-to-cell-contacts may also contribute to the decrease in the motility of the IL-1α p transfectants. Indeed, the redistribution of β-catenin to the region of cell-to-cell contacts has been shown to be regulated by the Src signaling pathway (37Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 538-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The observations that (i) FGF-1 is known to regulate Src activity in human endothelial cells (38Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the phosphorylation of Src and its translocation to focal adhesions are involved in cell migration (39Kaplan K.B. Swedlow J.R. Varmus H.E. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 40Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4745-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and (iii) the kinase activity of the Src protein is decreased in senescent HUVECs, which contain elevated levels of IL-1α p, with a corresponding decrease in the phosphorylation of the Src substrate, cortactin (19Garfinkel S. Hu X. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Kapnik E.M. McDowell S.D. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), are consistent with this premise. However, the high level of endogenous Src kinase activity in the ECV cell precluded a study of the role of Src in the migration of the transfectants. While the functional significance of the cortactin-positive patches observed in the IL-1α p transfectants is not known, the ability of the Src substrate, cortactin, to associate with F-actin (34Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) could represent a novel type of adhesion structure that may impair cell motility.

In HL-60 granulocytes, which do not possess voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) was able to stimulate store-operated Ca2+ influx and to trigger exocytosis of primary granules. An efficient triggering of exocytosis by fMLP required the presence of extracellular Ca2+ and was inhibited by blockers of store-operated Ca2+ influx. However, receptor-independent activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx through thapsigargin did not trigger exocytosis. fMLP was unable to stimulate exocytosis in the absence of cytosolic free Ca2+concentration [Ca2+] c elevations. However, a second signal generated by fMLP synergized with store-operated Ca2+ influx to trigger exocytosis and led to a left shift of the exocytosis/[Ca2+] c relationship in ionomycin-stimulated cells. The synergistic fMLP-generated signaling cascade was long-lasting, involved a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In summary, store-operated Ca2+ influx is crucial for the efficient triggering of exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes, but, as opposed to Ca2+influx through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in neurons, it is not a sufficient stimulus by itself and requires synergistic receptor-generated signals.

Many types of inflammatory cells, in particular granulocytes, possess secretory granules that contain microbicidal and proinflammatory substances. Exocytosis of these granules plays an important role not only in the host defense, but also in the development of inflammatory tissue damage. Thus, understanding the regulation of granule release from these cells is crucial for the understanding of the inflammatory response. However, while research over the last years has greatly advanced our knowledge about the mechanisms of exocytosis in neuronal cells, the mechanisms of exocytosis in inflammatory cells are still poorly understood. Exocytosis in neurons is intimately linked to the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A low affinity Ca2+-sensitive step in the exocytotic machinery of neurons (EC50 up to 200 μm in the synapse) has been demonstrated. It is thought that only Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels is able to achieve submembraneous [Ca2+] which are sufficiently high to activate this low affinity step (2Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 3Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast to excitable cells, inflammatory cells secrete in response to receptor activation, not membrane depolarization. Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are absent in inflammatory cells. Previous reports suggested that the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] c ) 1Abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] c, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration; boc-MLP,N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HL-60, human leukemia cell line 60; LY294,002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SK&F96365, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate). 1Abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] c, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration; boc-MLP,N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HL-60, human leukemia cell line 60; LY294,002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SK&F96365, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate).induces exocytosis in inflammatory cells with a high affinity (EC50 0.5–3 μm in human neutrophils) (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, at this point there is no compelling evidence that Ca2+ influx through ion channels plays the same role in exocytosis by inflammatory cells as it does in excitable cells.Inflammatory cells, however, do have plasma membrane Ca2+channels, and Ca2+ influx occurs in response to stimulation with receptor agonists (5Pozzan T. Lew D.P. Wollheim C.B. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1983; 221: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The predominant type of Ca2+influx in inflammatory cells is the so-called store-operated Ca2+ influx (or capacitative Ca2+ entry) (6Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the underlying channels are referred to as store-operated Ca2+ channels (or ICRAC channels) (7Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As opposed to voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, store-operated Ca2+ channels are found in virtually all cell types, and their most obvious function is the refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores after stimulated Ca2+ release. In neuronal cells, it has been suggested that store-operated Ca2+ channels are important for refilling of Ca2+ stores but do not play a relevant role in shaping the [Ca2+] c transients during cell activation. In inflammatory cells however, store-operated Ca2+ influx is likely to play an important role for cell activation, with the best documented example being lymphocyte proliferation (8Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The role of store-operated Ca2+ influx in the exocytotic secretion by inflammatory cells has hitherto received little attention. It has previously been noted that the Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis in inflammatory cells is modulated by other agonist-generated signals (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the identity of these signals and their relationship to store-operated Ca2+ influx have not been revealed.In this study we demonstrate that store-operated Ca2+influx plays a premier role in the regulation of receptor-stimulated exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes. However, as opposed to the situation in neuronal cells and as opposed to previous results obtained with Ca2+ ionophores in granulocytes, even maximal activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx is not sufficient to induce exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes by itself, and synergistic signals generated through receptor activation are required for exocytosis to occur. The synergistic signaling cascade involves pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that store-operated Ca2+influx plays a key role in the regulation of exocytosis of primary granules in HL-60 granulocytes. Thus, as seen in neuronal cells, there is a similar tight correlation between Ca2+ channel activation and activation of exocytosis.Why Is Store-operated Ca2+ Not Sufficient to Activate Exocytosis?Unlike the situation in neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels is by itself not sufficient to induce exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes. Nevertheless, exocytosis of primary granules has been activated by Ca2+ alone in ionomycin-stimulated intact granulocytes (29Cockcroft S. Bennett J.P. Gomperts B.D. Biochem.

A high [Ca2+] c affinity of primary granule release (EC50 ∼2.6 μm) has been determined using the “ionophore clamp” technique in combination with fluorescence measurements of average [Ca2+] c values (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Our ionophore-clamp experiments (Fig. 5 A) yield similar results; however, the data obtained with thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx are not compatible with such a high affinity for Ca2+. In digitonin-permeabilized and in electropermeabilized cells, a much higher [Ca2+] (between 10 and 100 μm) was needed to achieve primary granule release (31Smolen J.E. Stoehr S.J. Traynor A.E. Sklar L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1987; 41: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 32Smolen J.E. Sandborg R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and in patch-clamp studies pipette Ca2+concentrations up to 4 μm were unable to induce substantial exocytosis (33Nüße O. Lindau M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2117-2123Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, most likely, the Ca2+affinity of primary granule exocytosis in granulocytes is underestimated by the ionophore experiments. In addition, [Ca2+] c elevations at the site of exocytosis achieved through store-operated Ca2+ influx in granulocytes are probably lower than those achieved through voltage-operated Ca2+ influx in neurons. When normalized for the cell surface, peak Ca2+ currents through store-operated channels in inflammatory cells are at least 10 times smaller than currents through voltage-operated Ca2+ channels in excitable cells (current density ∼1–3 pA/pF in inflammatory cells (8Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 34Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar)). The requirement for additional signals that activate exocytosis in synergy with store-operated Ca2+ influx may be a direct consequence of the relatively low amplitude of submembraneous [Ca2+] increases generated through store-operated Ca2+ influx.How Can the Difference in the Ionomycin and the Thapsigargin Response be Explained?Both thapsigargin and ionomycin stimulate store operated Ca2+ influx by emptying intracellular Ca2+ stores. In addition, ionomycin induces Ca2+ influx through ionophore pores in the plasma membrane. This difference is witnessed by the saturation of the steady-state [Ca2+] c levels with increasing extracellular [Ca2+] in thapsigargin-treated, but not ionomycin-treated, cells (Fig. 3 A).Ionomycin, but not thapsigargin, stimulated exocytosis, and ionomycin activated a maximal respiratory burst response at a 10 times lower extracellular Ca2+ concentration than did thapsigargin. Thus ionomycin appears to induce much higher Ca2+concentrations at the site of Ca2+ action (i.e.the submembraneous space) than does thapsigargin. These local Ca2+ elevations are poorly reflected by the average [Ca2+] c measurements probably because (i) the submembraneous space represents a minor portion of the cellular volume and (ii) fura-2 is already saturated below the [Ca2+] c values that can be reached in the submembraneous space.At least two mechanisms might contribute to the generation of much higher submembraneous Ca2+ concentrations by ionomycin compared with thapsigargin: (a) ionomycin insertion into the plasma membrane and (b) Ca2+ buffering by a ionomycin-sensitive, thapsigargin-resistant Ca2+ store. High capacity low affinity Ca2+ stores that might buffer [Ca2+] c elevations in a thapsigargin-resistant fashion include mitochondria (37Herrington J. Park Y.B. Babcock D.F. Hille B. Neuron. 1996; 16: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and recently described endoplasmic reticulum subcompartments (38Pizzo P. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Properties of the Synergistic SignalsThe synergistic signals enhance exocytosis and promote a left-shift of the [Ca2+] c sensitivity of exocytosis. Such a shift through receptor agonists or various pharmacological activators has been observed in intact cells (Fig. 5 C) (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), as well as in permeabilized cells (39Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 40Stutchfield J. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Our results do not favor a role of phospholipase C in the synergistic signaling pathway. Phospholipase D could have a role when its activated above a high threshold. Previous studies have already argued against a role of protein kinase C enzymes in this context, as primary granules release in response to fMLP is not inhibited by various protein kinase C inhibitors and activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester does not induce primary granule release (41Krause K.H. Van Delden C. Huggler E. Monod A. Lew D.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 42Merritt J.E. Sullivan J.A. Tse J. Wilkinson S.E. Nixon J.S. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).fMLP receptor-dependent signaling has been shown to occur in many instances through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. However, biochemical analysis has also suggested that the fMLP receptor may interact with low molecular weight (i.e. pertussis-toxin insensitive) GTP-binding proteins (43Polakis P.G. Evans T. Snyderman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Small GTP-binding proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of exocytosis in various cellular systems (44Ferro Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 5) show that the activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (presumably Gi2 or Gi3) (22Cockcroft S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1992; 1113: 135-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) is an obligatory step in the activation of the second signaling pathway. These results do not exclude the downstream involvement of other G proteins in the exocytotic process.PI 3-kinases are likely to be involved in the regulation of exocytosis (26Dewald B. Thelen M. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16179-16184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was supported by the recent observation that synaptotagmin, a potential Ca2+ sensor in neuronal exocytosis, is able to bind phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (i.e. a product of PI 3-kinase activity) in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (45Schiavo G. Gu Q.M. Prestwich G.D. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In HL-60 granulocytes, we found an inhibition of fMLP-induced exocytosis by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294,002. The IC50for the inhibition of exocytosis (70 nm for wortmannin, 15 μm for LY294,002) was in the range of PI 3-kinase inhibition. Thus, our results suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in the synergistic signaling pathway. However, maximal inhibition obtained through PI 3-kinase inhibitors did not exceed 60%. Therefore, activation of PI 3-kinases alone cannot fully account for the synergistic signal pathway and additional mechanisms are likely to be involved.Relative Importance of the Ca2+ Influx, Ca2+ Release, and the Synergistic Signals in Different Cellular SystemsTo our knowledge, this study is the first in-depth analysis of the role of store-operated Ca2+ influx in the regulation of exocytosis in granulocytes. In previous studies, the consequence of omission of extracellular Ca2+ during chemoattractant-stimulated exocytosis in granulocytes has varied from a minor reduction in exocytosis (10Lew D.P. Wollheim C.B. Waldvogel F.A. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 46Kishimoto A. Takai Y. Mori T. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2273-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to a profound inhibition (29Cockcroft S. Bennett J.P. Gomperts B.D. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,47Naccache P.H. Molski T.F.P. Borgeat P. Sha'afi R.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 48Brandolini L. Bertini R. Bizzarri C. Sergi R. Caselli G. Zhou D. Locati M. Sozzani S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in all studies, chemoattractant stimulation of exocytosis was Ca2+-dependent. Thus, it appears that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can under certain circumstances substitute for Ca2+ influx. Two explanations may be considered. (i) Synergistic receptor-generated signals (e.g. priming) might lead to a more pronounced left-shift of the exocytosis/[Ca2+] c curve, and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores might then suffice to trigger exocytosis. (ii) Positioning of Ca2+ stores close the exocytotic machinery similar to their accumulation around phagosomes (49Stendahl O. Krause K.H. Krischer J. Jerström P. Theler J.M. Clark R.A. Carpentier J.L. Lew D.P. Science. 1994; 265: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) might generate localized high [Ca2+] by Ca2+ release.In summary, store-operated Ca2+ influx is necessary for efficient stimulation of HL-60 exocytosis by fMLP, but it is not a sufficient stimulus by itself and requires the concomitant activation of synergistic signals to activate the exocytotic machinery. Our results suggest that the synergistic signaling pathway is initiated by the interaction of the fMLP receptor with a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and it involves PI 3-kinases. The need for synergistic signals in the regulation of exocytosis in granulocytes might stem from the relatively low amplitude of submembraneous [Ca2+] c changes that can be achieved through store-operated Ca2+ channels. However, the fact that maximal Ca2+ influx through physiological pathways does not induce exocytosis may serve as a safety mechanism. An inappropriate exocytosis of primary granules is most harmful to the organism. It may be vital for the granulocyte to allow the occurrence of Ca2+ influx without invariably inducing exocytosis. Many types of inflammatory cells, in particular granulocytes, possess secretory granules that contain microbicidal and proinflammatory substances. Exocytosis of these granules plays an important role not only in the host defense, but also in the development of inflammatory tissue damage. Thus, understanding the regulation of granule release from these cells is crucial for the understanding of the inflammatory response. However, while research over the last years has greatly advanced our knowledge about the mechanisms of exocytosis in neuronal cells, the mechanisms of exocytosis in inflammatory cells are still poorly understood. Exocytosis in neurons is intimately linked to the activation of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (1Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 191-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A low affinity Ca2+-sensitive step in the exocytotic machinery of neurons (EC50 up to 200 μm in the synapse) has been demonstrated. It is thought that only Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels is able to achieve submembraneous [Ca2+] which are sufficiently high to activate this low affinity step (2Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 3Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In contrast to excitable cells, inflammatory cells secrete in response to receptor activation, not membrane depolarization. Voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are absent in inflammatory cells. Previous reports suggested that the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] c ) 1Abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] c, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration; boc-MLP,N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HL-60, human leukemia cell line 60; LY294,002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SK&F96365, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate). 1Abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] c, cytosolic free Ca2+concentration; boc-MLP,N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; HL-60, human leukemia cell line 60; LY294,002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PLD, phospholipase D; SK&F96365, 1-(β-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate).induces exocytosis in inflammatory cells with a high affinity (EC50 0.5–3 μm in human neutrophils) (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, at this point there is no compelling evidence that Ca2+ influx through ion channels plays the same role in exocytosis by inflammatory cells as it does in excitable cells. Inflammatory cells, however, do have plasma membrane Ca2+channels, and Ca2+ influx occurs in response to stimulation with receptor agonists (5Pozzan T. Lew D.P. Wollheim C.B. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1983; 221: 1413-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The predominant type of Ca2+influx in inflammatory cells is the so-called store-operated Ca2+ influx (or capacitative Ca2+ entry) (6Demaurex N. Monod A. Lew D.P. Krause K.-H. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the underlying channels are referred to as store-operated Ca2+ channels (or ICRAC channels) (7Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 634-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As opposed to voltage-operated Ca2+ channels, store-operated Ca2+ channels are found in virtually all cell types, and their most obvious function is the refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores after stimulated Ca2+ release. In neuronal cells, it has been suggested that store-operated Ca2+ channels are important for refilling of Ca2+ stores but do not play a relevant role in shaping the [Ca2+] c transients during cell activation. In inflammatory cells however, store-operated Ca2+ influx is likely to play an important role for cell activation, with the best documented example being lymphocyte proliferation (8Hoth M. Penner R. J. Physiol. 1993; 465: 359-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The role of store-operated Ca2+ influx in the exocytotic secretion by inflammatory cells has hitherto received little attention. It has previously been noted that the Ca2+ sensitivity of exocytosis in inflammatory cells is modulated by other agonist-generated signals (4Lew D.P. Monod A. Waldvogel F.A. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the identity of these signals and their relationship to store-operated Ca2+ influx have not been revealed. In this study we demonstrate that store-operated Ca2+influx plays a premier role in the regulation of receptor-stimulated exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes. However, as opposed to the situation in neuronal cells and as opposed to previous results obtained with Ca2+ ionophores in granulocytes, even maximal activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx is not sufficient to induce exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes by itself, and synergistic signals generated through receptor activation are required for exocytosis to occur. The synergistic signaling cascade involves pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). DISCUSSIONOur results demonstrate that store-operated Ca2+influx plays a key role in the regulation of exocytosis of primary granules in HL-60 granulocytes. Thus, as seen in neuronal cells, there is a similar tight correlation between Ca2+ channel activation and activation of exocytosis.Why Is Store-operated Ca2+ Not Sufficient to Activate Exocytosis?Unlike the situation in neuronal cells, Ca2+ influx through Ca2+ channels is by itself not sufficient to induce exocytosis in HL-60 granulocytes. Nevertheless, exocytosis of primary granules has been activated by Ca2+ alone in ionomycin-stimulated intact granulocytes (29Cockcroft S. Bennett J.P. Gomperts B.D. Biochem. J. 1981; 200: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), in permeabilized granulocytes (30Barrowman M.M. Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D.

Recently, a considerable diversity of capping structures such as α(2-6)- and α(2-3)-linked N-acetylneuraminic acids, α(2-6)- and α(2-3)-linked N-glycolylneuraminic acids, α(1-3)-linked galactose, as well as β(1-3)-linked and 6-sulfatedN-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine have been shown to be present on bovine corneal KS chains (13Tai G.-H.

Despite the many structural studies there has been little investigation of human corneal keratan sulfate. Thus, this investigation seeks to extend our previous work on bovine cornea (13Tai G.-H.

(Deeside, Clwyd, UK), and an IonPac AS4A SC column (4-mm) from Dionex (Camberley, Surrey, UK). Fourteen human eyes (thirteen from 61- to 86-year-olds, plus one from a 12 year-old) were obtained from the Manchester Eye Bank and came from individuals with no history of ocular disease. The corneas had been removed within 48 h after death and stored in organ culture for periods ranging from 2 to 3 weeks. The organ culture medium (16Armitage W.J. Moss S.J. Easty D.L. Current Ophthalmic Surgery. Bailliere Tindall Ltd., London1990: 193-199Google Scholar) consisted of Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earles salts and HEPES buffer, 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 24 mm sodium bicarbonate, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 units/ml neomycin. The corneas were rinsed several times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove culture medium, and the corneas (with endothelium) were excised immediately, as described previously (13Tai G.-H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The pooled human corneas (2 g wet weight) were extracted three times each with 10 ml of 4 m guanidine-HCl containing 0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.005 m benzamidine-HCl, and 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.8, at 4 °C for 24 h. These three extracts were combined and dialysed thoroughly against 7 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The dialysate was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (15 × 50-mm) and washed with sufficient 0.15 m NaCl, 7 murea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, to remove the unbound material. The bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15m to 2 m NaCl containing 7 m urea and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluate was monitored (Fig. 1) by absorbance at 280 nm and assayed for KSPGs by direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (13Tai G.-H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using an anti-KS monoclonal antibody, 5D4. The KSPG-containing material was recovered by dialysis against water (yield, 11 mg). In a parallel experiment, 3 g of bovine corneas (wet weight, from 4 eyes) were extracted in the same way, and 24 mg of bovine proteoglycans were isolated. These preparations of proteoglycans were directly used for keratanase II digestion and oligosaccharide fingerprinting. A proportion of the human proteoglycans (∼1.1 mg) and bovine proteoglycans (∼1.2 mg) were further purified by gel permeation chromatography on a Superose 6 column (10 × 300-mm) (see Fig. 2for human proteoglycan data). The KSPG-containing material (positive to 5D4) was recovered and used for KS chain-sizing experiments. Aliquots of the purified bovine and human proteoglycans were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase as described above. After precipitation with 3 vol of ethanol to remove CS/DS-oligosaccharides, the KSPGs were recovered and subjected to papain digestion. 100 μg of KSPGs were dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 10 mmcysteine hydrochloride, and incubated with 20 milliunits papain at 65 °C for 24 h. The digests were dialysed using Spectra/Por membrane 1 (molecular mass cut-off: 6–8000 kDa protein) to remove small peptides and chromatographed on a Bio-Gel TSK-30 XL column (300 × 7.8-mm). The column was eluted with 0.15 mNaCl and monitored by absorbance at 208 nm (Fig. 3). Crude preparations of human and bovine proteoglycans (∼10 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and incubated with 20 milliunits keratanase II. After 30 h of incubation at 37 °C the digests were heated at 100 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h to remove precipitate. The supernatant was chromatographed on a Bio-Gel P30 column (100 × 10-mm) to separate the oligosaccharides derived by keratanase II digestion from the intact CS/DSPGs and the core proteins of KSPGs, which eluted in the void volume (data not shown). After reduction with NaBH4 the oligosaccharides were chromatographed on an analytical Spherisorb S5 SAX column (4.6 × 250-mm), eluted first with 2 mm LiClO4, pH 5.0, for 10 min, followed by a linear gradient from 2 to 250 mm LiClO4within 60 min and finally from 250 to 500 mmLiClO4 within 10 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored by absorbance at 206 nm. Partial profiles are shown in Fig.4. Fractions corresponding to individual peaks, except peaks 7, 8, and 9, which were pooled, were recovered and re-chromatographed using a calibrated IonPac AS4A SC column (4-mm) as described previously (14Brown G.M. Nieduszynski I.A. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Huckerby T.N. Block J.A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The chromatograms on IonPac AS4A SC of peaks 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 18 are shown in Fig. 5.Figure 5IonPac AS4A SC anion-exchange chromatography. Samples corresponding to peaks 3, 4, 18, and the pool of peaks 7, 8, and 9 in Fig. 4 were chromatographed individually on an IonPac AS4A SC column (4-mm). The partial chromatograms of each sample are assembled into a single figure. The column was eluted with 50 mm NaOH for 5 min followed by a linear gradient of 0 to 1.425 m sodium acetate containing 50 mm NaOH within 48 min. The elution was monitored using a pulsed electrochemical detector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The entire population of KSPGs from the human corneal stroma (plus endothelium) was prepared after dissociative extraction and initially, one stage of chromatography. This step (Fig.1) involved ion-exchange chromatography to separate the proteoglycans from protein contaminants. The KS-containing proteoglycans from this human preparation elute at a similar salt concentration to those from the bovine preparation (13Tai G.-H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) indicating similar charge densities. The material recovered (Fig. 1,pooling bar) contained nearly all of the KS and presumably (see below) substantial amounts of decorin, although the lack of response with the antibody LF95 (data not shown) indicates that this antibody does not recognize human decorin. A small peak of 5D4-positive material is observed prior to the start of the salt gradient, which was possibly due to column overloading. The gel permeation chromatography step (Fig. 2) permitted further purification on the basis of size. The material recovered (pooling bar) contained all of the KSPGs and decorin but the procedure had removed protein contaminants such as the tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein, TRAMP (17Forbes E.G. Cronshaw A.D. MacBeath J.R.E. Hulmes D.J.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gel permeation chromatographic behavior of the peptido-KS chains released from the entire population of human KSPGs was compared with that from the bovine KSPGs (Fig.3), and they were seen to be of the same size. In the case of the bovine preparation the chromatogram of free corneal KS chains released by the enzyme peptideN-glycosidase F is shown. These chains were estimated (13Tai G.-H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to have a weight average M r of 14,000 and a number average M n of about 10,000. It would, therefore, seem that these sizes also pertain to the human KS chains, although, as discussed before (13Tai G.-H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23535-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the M r andM n values may be slight underestimates because the column was calibrated (18Dickenson J.M. Morris H.G. Nieduszynski I.A. Huckerby T.N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with linear rather than biantennary oligosaccharides. The nonreducing terminal and repeat region oligosaccharides derived from the entire population of human KSPGs after keratanase II digestion followed by borohydride reduction were examined on calibrated ion-exchange chromatography columns. The results (Fig. 4) of the chromatography on an analytical Spherisorb S5 SAX column for human and bovine samples are compared and the peaks numbered 1–21. Clearly, there are several resolution problems, particularly in peaks 7, 8, and 9. (In addition, only minor amounts of fucose-containing peaks had been observed in the bovine KSPG preparation and hence the SAX column had not been calibrated for such peaks.) Consequently, every peak from the SAX column was recovered, and these samples were individually re-chromatographed on a fully calibrated IonPac AS4A SC column. Those corresponding to peaks 3, 4, 18, and the composite of peaks 7, 8, and 9 are shown in Fig. 5. Each and every oligosaccharide fragment has been fully characterized previously by NMR spectroscopic studies and was used in calibrating the elution positions on both ion-exchange columns. Detailed structural analyses for fractions 2 and 21 have previously been presented (19Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4836-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where they were labeled as fractions R1 and C5. Similar identifications for fractions 1, 3b, 4a, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18a, 18b, and 19 have been presented (20Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Eur. J.

Open table in a new tab These results demonstrate that the human KS chains have a smaller subset of nonreducing termini than do the bovine ones. The NeuGcα(2-3)- (absence of peaks 7b, 16, and 20), NeuGcα(2-6)- (absence of peak 7a), GlcNAc(S)β(1-3)- (absence of peak 18c) capping structures which had been identified in bovine corneal KS were absent. However, NeuAcα(2-6)- (peaks 3a, 8, and 18a), NeuAcα(2-3)- (peaks 9, 17, 18b, and 21) and GalNAc(S)β(1-3)- (peak 15), in decreasing order of abundance, were detected in the human KS chains. Observation of minor peaks at 4b and 12 also suggested the presence of some Galα(1-3)- structures in the human KS. The repeat region oligosaccharides derived from the human sample are similar to those from the bovine but show a higher proportion of fucosylation. Comparison of these results on human KSPGs with those from bovine cornea show that the proteoglycans have similar charge densities and KS chain sizes. The similarity of KS chain size between human and bovine KSPGs is particularly interesting in the light of the double-stranded glycosaminoglycan model (3Scott J.E. J. Anat. 1992; 180: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar), which has been proposed for controlling the regular collagen interfibrillar spacing. Indeed, the collagen fibril surface-to-surface spacing (21Meek K.M. Leonard D.W. Biophys. J. 1992; 64: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in human (31 nm, but decreases with increasing age) and bovine cornea (25.4 nm) are similar. However, great care must be taken in interpreting our results, because in both our bovine and human studies the KS chain preparation from the entire population of KSPGs has been examined, but not that from a single collagen fibril-associated proteoglycan such as lumican. Comparison of the carbohydrate structures present in the human and bovine KS chains show differences both in levels of fucosylation and in nonreducing termini (capping structures). In our previous study of bovine corneal KS only low levels of α(1-3)-fucose (perhaps 1/10 chains) were observed. However, the bovine cornea were from young (15-month-old to 3-year-old) animals. By contrast, this study of human KS detects 2–4 times higher α(1-3)-fucose levels (see Figs. 4 and5), but the human samples predominantly derive from older individuals (61- to 86-year-olds). Previous studies on bovine and human articular cartilage KS have shown that fucose levels increase with age, 2G. M. Brown, T. N. Huckerby, M. T. Bayliss, and I. A. Nieduszynski, submitted for publication. and thus it is probable that the fucose levels noted in this study relate more to age than species. The capping structures from human corneal KS do not contain NeuGcα(2-3)- or NeuGcα(2-6)-, which are generally absent from human adult tissues (23Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) nor was the GlcNAc(S)β(1-3)- cap found. Surprisingly, because humans do not normally have a functional α(1-3)-galactosyltransferase (22Galili U. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 480-482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), a low level of Galα(1-3)- caps was detected and this was not believed to be a contaminant. When identified in humans the Galα(1-3)- structure is normally believed to be associated with autoimmune conditions. The relative abundance of the three major caps detected in the human corneal KS were NeuAcα(2-6)- >NeuAcα(2-3)- >GalNAc(S)β(1-3)- (although these data are not fully quantitative), and these relative proportions are similar to those observed in the bovine sample. It is interesting to note the differences here with the capping proportions in articular cartilage KS where for both bovine and human samples the content of NeuAcα(2-3)- >NeuAcα(2-6)-, and there are age-related changes in NeuAcα(2-6)- content.2 A further understanding of the significance of the diverse capping structures in corneal KS will require a closer description of how they are distributed between antennae and specific KSPGs. In an as yet unreported part of these studies, we have made considerable but unsuccessful efforts to fractionate the bovine KSPGs on a preparative scale to permit characterization of the individual KS chains present. We believe that the best future chance of achieving this goal will depend upon antibody-based KSPG fractionation followed by high sensitivity keratanase II fingerprinting using a fluorescence-based method. Such a methodology should permit the full characterization of lumican and keratocan KS chains and may establish whether any relationship exists between specific chain capping and chain length, as the control of KS chain length in the cornea would seem to be a requirement for any precise collagen fibril spacer mechanism (3Scott J.E. J. Anat. 1992; 180: 155-164PubMed Google Scholar). We thank Dr. G. M. Brown for helpful discussions and H. Morris and R. Berry for technical assistance."

Recently we showed that cyclooxygenase-1, but not cyclooxygenase-2, was induced in CMK cells during the differentiation (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cyclooxygenase-1 is well known as a constitutive enzyme present in platelets (16Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 17Takahashi Y. Ueda N. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Yokoyama C. Miyata A. Tanabe T. Fuse I. Hattori A. Shibata A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and is responsible for the production of proaggregatory thromboxane A2essentially as a sole cyclooxygenase metabolite. However, we found that the TPA-treated CMK cells produced PGD2 as a major product in addition to thromboxane A2 (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Since PGD2was reported not to be produced in platelets (18Watanabe T. Narumiya S. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14847-14853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in the megakaryoblastic production of PGD2 and attempted to characterize the responsible enzyme. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (2.1 GBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham International (Amersham, UK); arachidonic acid from Nu-Chek-Prep (Elysian, MN); lyophilized powder of sheep seminal vesicle microsomes from Novamed (Jerusalem, Israel); glutathione (reduced form), dithiothreitol, cysteine, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan); 2-mercaptoethanol from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan); precoated Silica Gel 60 F254 glass plates for TLC (20 cm × 20 cm, 0.25-mm thickness) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); fetal calf serum from Nippon Bio-Supplies Center (Tokyo, Japan); RPMI 1640 medium and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium from Life Technologies, Inc.

Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) blots were purchased as described previously. CMK cells were kindly provided by Dr. Eiji Shimizu of the Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tokushima University School of Medicine, with the consent of Dr. Takeyuki Sato of Chiba University, and Dami cells by Dr. Hiroshi Miyazaki of Kirin Brewery Company (Takasaki, Japan). Standard PGs and thromboxane B2 were gifts from Ono Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). The antiserum was raised in a rabbit against the recombinant human hematopoietic PGD synthase which was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by glutathione-affinity chromatography (7Kanaoka Y. Kikuno R. Nanayama T. Maruyama T. Irikura D. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent.Fatty Acids. 1996; 55: 123Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum against human lipocalin type of PGD synthase was prepared as described previously (20Yamashima T. Sakuda K. Tohma Y. Yamashita J. Oda H. Irikura D. Eguchi N. Beuckmann C.T. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2376-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA for human hematopoietic PGD synthase was isolated by the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end method (7Kanaoka Y. Kikuno R. Nanayama T. Maruyama T. Irikura D. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent.Fatty Acids. 1996; 55: 123Google Scholar). CMK cells (1 × 107cells/dish) and Dami cells (0.5 × 107 cells/dish) were plated in a 150-mm plastic dish with 30 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 23.8 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 34.3 μm streptomycin sulfate or with 30 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% horse serum, 35.7 mm sodium bicarbonate, 69 μmstreptomycin sulfate, and 0.28 mm penicillin G, respectively. The Petri dishes were placed in a humidified 7% CO2, 93% air incubator at 37 °C. The cells were subcultured every 3 days. For cell differentiation, TPA was dissolved in 30 μl of ethanol, and added to the cells in 30 ml of the medium. After incubation for various periods, the cells were scraped from the dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline per 1 × 107 cells. Platelets were prepared from whole blood as described previously (21Takahashi Y. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cells were sonicated three times for 3 s at 30 kHz with an interval of 1 min after each sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 187,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, and the resultant supernatant was used as the cytosol. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The cytosol (2 ml containing 10 mg of protein) of CMK cells was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (a bed volume of 10 ml) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 including 1 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were eluted from the column with the same buffer, and 1.2-ml fractions were collected. The column was regenerated by washing with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9) including 5 mm glutathione. The purified enzyme was stabilized by adding γ-globulin at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. [1-14C]PGH2 as the radioactive substrate was prepared by incubation of 100 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (2,500 cpm/nmol) with sheep seminal vesicle microsomes (5 mg) at 24 °C for 2 min in a 2-ml reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 μm hematin, and 5 mm tryptophan. The radioactive PGH2 was extracted with diethyl ether, and purified by TLC in a solvent system consisting of diethyl ether/petroleum ether/acetic acid (85:15:0.1, v/v) at −20 °C. The PGD synthase assay was performed using 40 μm[14C]PGH2 (10,000 cpm/5 μl of ethanol) for 1 min at 24 °C. The 100-μl reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm glutathione. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.3 ml of diethyl ether/methanol, 1 m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v). The ethereal extracts were then separated by TLC with a solvent system of diethyl ether/methanol/acetic acid (90:2:0.1, v/v) at −20 °C. Distribution of radioactivity on the plate was detected by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). The cyclooxygenase assay was performed as described previously (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cytosol (15 μg of protein) was subjected to 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Immunostaining was performed as described for cyclooxygenase (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by the use of rabbit antiserum against recombinant human hematopoietic PGD synthase (1:2000 dilution). Immunostained bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Total RNA was extracted with an ISOGEN solution (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and transfer of RNA onto the membrane were carried out as described for cyclooxygenase (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized with32P-labeled cDNA probes for human hematopoietic PGD synthase or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham International). Distribution of the radioactivity on the membrane was detected by a BAS2000 imaging analyzer. When the homogenate of human megakaryoblastic CMK cells was incubated with [14C]PGH2, the major product was PGD2 (lane 2 of Fig.1 A). Under this assay condition only a small amount of unstable PGH2 was spontaneously converted to PGD2 and PGE2 in a protein-free buffer used as a control (lane 1). The activity to generate PGD2 in the homogenate was mostly recovered in the cytosol fraction (lane 4), but was hardly detectable in the particulate fraction (lane 3). The enzyme activity required glutathione and the PGD2 production was very low in the absence of glutathione (lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, when pretreated at 90 °C for 5 min, the cytosol totally lost the activity (lane 7). These results showed the presence of a cytosolic glutathione-dependent PGD synthase in CMK cells. It should be noted that the cytosol fraction of human platelets did not significantly convert PGH2 to PGD2 either in the presence (Fig. 1, lane 8) or absence (lane 9) of glutathione. In addition, the cytosol fractions of porcine and rat platelets did not show any significant activity to produce PGD2 (data not shown). The PGD synthase activity was dependent on the concentration of PGH2 (Fig. 2 A), and a high K m value for PGH2 (about 200 μm) was obtained by Lineweaver-Burk plots. The specific enzyme activity was about 150 nmol/min/mg with a subsaturating concentration (40 μm) of PGH2. The enzyme activity was also dependent on the concentration of glutathione (Fig.2 B), and the K m for glutathione was about 1 mm. However, the enzyme was inactive when glutathione was replaced by other sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteine, dithiothreitol, and 2-mercaptoethanol at the same concentration. These sulfhydryl compounds activated the lipocalin type PGD synthase but not the hematopoietic type enzyme which required selectively glutathione (3Urade Y. Watanabe K. Hayaishi O. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signalling. 1995; 12: 257-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at 1 mm, which is known to inhibit the lipocalin-type enzyme but not the hematopoietic-type enzyme (5Urade Y. Fujimoto N. Ujihara M. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3820-3825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hardly inhibited the PGD synthase activity of CMK cells. These properties suggest that the PGD synthase of the CMK cells is of the hematopoietic type rather than the lipocalin type. In view of the glutathione requirement, the cytosol of CMK cells was applied to glutathione-affinity chromatography (Fig.3 A). A bulk of proteins passed through the column, and the PGD synthase activity was eluted with a significant delay in the absence of glutathione, suggesting a weak interaction between the enzyme and glutathione. The enzyme was highly purified by the glutathione-affinity chromatography, and the specific activity of three active fractions pooled was about 300 μmol/min/mg protein. Active fractions showed a 26-kDa protein band stained with silver nitrate (Fig. 3 B). This protein band was immunostained with rabbit antiserum against human hematopoietic PGD synthase (Fig. 3 C), but not with antiserum against human lipocalin type PGD synthase. The PGD synthase activity was followed during differentiation of CMK cells. When the cells were cultured in the presence of 0.1 μm TPA for different days, the cyclooxygenase activity in the cell homogenate was almost undetectable at first, but increased markedly in a time-dependent manner (Fig.4 A) as we reported previously (15Ueda N. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Ishimura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1344: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PGD synthase activity was considerably high at day 0, and increased only about 2-fold during the incubation with TPA. The maximum PGD synthase activity was observed at day 2, and thereafter the enzyme activity decreased. As examined by Western blotting with anti-human hematopoietic PGD synthase antibody, the intensity of the immunopositive band changed in agreement with the enzyme activity (Fig.4 B). When the amount of PGD synthase mRNA was followed by Northern blotting, two radioactive bands were detected at positions around 1.8 and 1.0 kilobases through the 5 days, and the most intense bands were seen at day 1 (Fig. 4 C). Another megakaryoblastic cell line, Dami (24Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also treated with TPA, and the cyclooxygenase and hematopoietic PGD synthase activities were followed. The cyclooxygenase activity increased in a similar time course as in the case of CMK cells but to a lower specific enzyme activity. In contrast to CMK cells, Dami cells showed a low PGD synthase activity at time 0, and the addition of TPA increased the enzyme activity by 10-fold at day 3 (Fig.5 A). Thereafter the enzyme activity decreased. Western blot analysis also indicated a marked increase in PGD synthase protein at days 2 and 3 (Fig. 5 B). As examined by Northern blotting, the content of the PGD synthase mRNA also increased and then decreased with the highest content at days 1 and 2. CMK and Dami cells were established from the peripheral blood of patients with megakaryoblastic leukemia. The cells exhibit various biochemical and morphological characteristics of megakaryoblasts or megakaryocytes of bone marrow, and are useful tools for biochemical studies on megakaryoblast differentiation (13Sato T. Fuse A. Eguchi M. Hayashi Y. Ryo R. Adachi M. Kishimoto Y. Teramura M. Mizoguchi H. Shima Y. Komori I. Sunami S. Okimoto Y. Nakajima H. Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 72: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we revealed potent PGD2 production by the cytosol fraction of CMK cells with a specific activity as high as about 150 nmol/min/mg protein. This value is comparable to the PGD synthase activity in the cytosol of rat peritoneal mast cells (105 nmol/min/mg protein under the same assay conditions) which was reported to be the highest among various rat tissues (8Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Igarashi M. Nagata A. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 371-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serum albumin was previously shown to convert PGH2 to PGD2 in a glutathione-independent manner (18Watanabe T. Narumiya S. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14847-14853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the PGD synthesis in CMK cells was absolutely dependent on glutathione. Therefore, it is unlikely that the PGD2 formation which we observed is attributed to albumin derived from fetal calf serum in the cell culture medium. Several lines of evidence including catalytic properties and Western and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the enzyme activity was due to the hematopoietic type of PGD synthase rather than the lipocalin type. Dami cells also contained the hematopoietic type of the enzyme. The hematopoietic PGD synthase has so far been found in mast cells of various tissues (8Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Igarashi M. Nagata A. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 371-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and antigen-presenting cells (9Urade Y. Ujihara M. Horiguchi Y. Ikai K. Hayaishi O. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2982-2989PubMed Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for the presence of PGD synthase in megakaryoblastic cell lines, precursor cells of platelets which have no PGD synthase. The cyclooxygenase-1 activity was almost undetectable in untreated CMK cells, but increased for 5 days up to 10 nmol/2 min/mg protein by the addition of TPA. In contrast, the PGD synthase activity was detected in the untreated cells with a specific activity of about 40 nmol/min/mg protein of the homogenate, and increased only by 2-fold in the presence of TPA. These observations indicate that the cyclooxygenase reaction rather than the PGD synthase reaction is a rate-limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway of PGD2 starting with arachidonic acid released from phospholipid. Interestingly, the original level of PGD synthase activity in Dami cells was low, but the enzyme activity was increased markedly by the addition of TPA. The induced cyclooxygenase was also lower than the increased PGD synthase in Dami cells. Previously it was a debatable subject whether or not platelets generated PGD2. Later, it was clearly demonstrated that the capacity to generate PGD2 in platelet-rich plasma was attributable to serum albumin and that neither washed platelets nor platelet lysate formed PGD2 enzymatically (18Watanabe T. Narumiya S. Shimizu T. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14847-14853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed we could not detect the PGD synthase activity in the cytosol of peripheral platelets from different animal species. Unlike cyclooxygenase-1 and thromboxane A synthase, the induced PGD synthase is not transferred to platelets which are derived from megakaryocytes. Since CMK and Dami cells are leukemia cells, a high expression of PGD synthase may not be a physiological event. Therefore, it is important to examine its expression level in native megakaryoblasts and megakaryocytes, especially by immunohistochemical study, which may lead to a finding of unknown physiological function of PGD2. Furthermore, PGD2 may be further transformed to PGJ2 and its derivatives which are known to have anti-proliferative activity and may regulate cell proliferation (25Fukushima M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1991; 47: 1-12Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Recently, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, a further metabolite of PGJ2, was reported to be a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ which determined differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes (26Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2069051906,"Shortly after initiating promoter-specific transcription in vitro, mammalian RNA polymerase II becomes highly susceptible to arrest in a promoter-proximal region 9–13 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site (Dvir, A., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 23352–23356). Arrest by polymerase in this region is suppressed by TFIIH in an ATP-dependent reaction (Dvir, A., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 9006–9010). In this report, we present evidence that, in addition to TFIIH and an ATP cofactor, efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II through this promoter-proximal region requires formation of an “escape-competent” transcriptional intermediate. Formation of this intermediate requires template DNA 40–50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. This requirement for downstream DNA is transient, since template DNA downstream of +40 is dispensable for assembly of the preinitiation complex, for initiation and synthesis of the first 10–12 phosphodiester bonds of nascent transcripts and for further extension of transcripts longer than ∼14 nucleotides. Thus, promoter escape requires that the RNA polymerase II transcription complex undergoes a critical structural transition, likely driven by interaction of one or more components of the transcriptional machinery with template DNA 40–50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. Shortly after initiating promoter-specific transcription in vitro, mammalian RNA polymerase II becomes highly susceptible to arrest in a promoter-proximal region 9–13 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site (Dvir, A., Conaway, R.

Thus, promoter escape requires that the RNA polymerase II transcription complex undergoes a critical structural transition, likely driven by interaction of one or more components of the transcriptional machinery with template DNA 40–50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. Initiation of eukaryotic messenger RNA synthesis is a complex process catalyzed by multisubunit RNA polymerase II and governed by the concerted action of a diverse collection of transcription factors. Biochemical studies have resolved transcription by RNA polymerase II into multiple stages that include (i) assembly and ATP-dependent activation of the preinitiation complex, which evidence suggests involves unwinding of promoter DNA surrounding the transcriptional start site by the TFIIH DNA helicase, (ii) transcription initiation, and finally (iii) escape of polymerase from the promoter and formation of the stable elongation complex (1Roeder R.G.

Although substantial information is currently available on the mechanisms underlying assembly and ATP-dependent activation of the preinitiation complex and transcription initiation, relatively little is known about how RNA polymerase II escapes the promoter to form the stable elongation complex. In a recent study carried out with a reconstituted basal transcription system composed of recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF and highly purified RNA polymerase II and TFIIH from rat liver, we observed that, shortly after initiating transcription, RNA polymerase II becomes highly susceptible to arrest in a promoter-proximal region 9–13 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site (4Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that arrest by RNA polymerase II in this region is suppressed by TFIIH in an ATP-dependent reaction that may be catalyzed by the TFIIH DNA helicase (5Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter at 28 °C by a 45-min preincubation of 105-μl reaction mixtures containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 7% (v/v) glycerol, 18 units of RNasin, ∼30 ng of the EcoRI to NdeI fragment from pDN-AdML (16Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ∼150 ng of recombinant yeast TBP, ∼30 ng of recombinant TFIIB, ∼60 ng of recombinant TFIIF, ∼60 ng of recombinant TFIIE, ∼450 ng of TFIIH, and ∼0.03 unit of RNA polymerase II. Transcription was initiated by addition of nucleotides as indicated in the figure legends. For analysis of short transcripts, 15 μl of each reaction mixture were added to 6 μl of 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K in 100 mm EDTA. Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min, 25 μl of 10 m urea containing 0.025% bromphenol blue and 0.025% xylene cyanol FF were added to each sample. The samples were vortexed for 10 s, heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and subjected to 25% acrylamide, 3% bisacrylamide, 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (17Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of runoff transcripts, 35 μl of each reaction mixture were added to 35 μl of 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.6 mg/ml yeast tRNA in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, and 2% (w/v) SDS. Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min, transcripts were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. Samples were resuspended in 10 m urea containing 0.025% bromphenol blue and 0.025% xylene cyanol FF and subjected to 6% acrylamide, 0.8% bisacrylamide, 7 m urea gel electrophoresis. Gels were imaged by autoradiography or on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. In experiments investigating the mechanism of formation of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex in a basal transcription system composed of recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF and purified polymerase and TFIIH from rat liver, we discovered that promoter escape by RNA polymerase II has a transient requirement for template DNA 40–50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. To investigate the role of downstream template DNA in promoter escape, we took advantage of the plasmid pDN-AdML (16Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains AdML core promoter sequences from −50 to +10 inserted between theKpnI and XbaI sites in the polylinker of pUC-18. The EcoRI to NdeI fragment of pDN-AdML was used as DNA template in transcription reactions. The NdeI site is located ∼250 base pairs downstream of the AdML transcriptional start site. As illustrated in Fig. 1, pDN-AdML can also be cleaved by the restriction enzymes PstI,SphI, HindIII, and HaeIII, which cut the template strand at sites 22, 29, 39, and 48 nucleotides downstream of the AdML transcriptional start site. By digesting theEcoRI to NdeI fragment of pDN-AdML with these restriction enzymes before transcription initiation or after synthesis of short transcripts, we could assess the requirements for downstream template DNA during initiation, promoter escape, and subsequent elongation by RNA polymerase II. To determine how much downstream template DNA is required for transcription initiation, we used the dinucleotide-primed abortive initiation assay. As shown previously, RNA polymerase II will utilize dinucleotides to prime synthesis of promoter-specific transcripts (16Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2962-2968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14990-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jiang Y. Yan M.

Chem. 1984; 259: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription initiation from the AdML promoter can be primed by a variety of dinucleotides within a small region centered around the transcriptional start site (20Samuels M. Fire A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for example, in the presence of [α-32P]CTP and the dinucleotide CpU, which supports initiation at a position 3 base pairs upstream of the AdML transcriptional start site, RNA polymerase II will initiate and synthesize the radioactively labeled trinucleotide CpU*pC (see Fig. 1). To determine how much downstream template DNA is required for very early elongation and promoter escape, we carried out transcription in the presence of CpU, ATP, UTP, [α-32P]CTP, and the chain-terminating nucleotide analog 3′-O-MeGTP. Under these conditions, RNA polymerase II can initiate and synthesize transcripts that have a maximum length of 18 nucleotides (terminated at the first G residue, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1). In the experiment of Fig. 2, preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter by preincubation of the EcoRI to NdeI fragment of pDN-AdML with RNA polymerase II and initiation factors. Following treatment of preinitiation complexes with either HaeIII,HindIII, SphI, or PstI, reaction mixtures were divided into three equal portions and assayed for synthesis of CpU-primed trinucleotide transcripts, for synthesis of CpU-primed 3′-O-MeG-terminated 18-nucleotide-long transcripts, and, to control for efficient restriction enzyme digestion of the template, for synthesis of CpU-primed full-length runoff transcripts. As shown in lanes 15 and 19, transcription of the undigested KpnI to NdeI fragment of pDN-AdML resulted in synthesis of the full-length ∼250-nucleotide-long runoff transcript. Synthesis of theNdeI-terminated ∼250-nucleotide runoff transcript was almost completely abolished by treatment of preinitiation complexes with HaeIII, HindIII, SphI, orPstI (lanes 16–18, 20, and 21), arguing that the DNA templates were digested to near completion by each restriction enzyme. Synthesis of CpU-primed trinucleotide transcripts was unaffected by digestion of preinitiation complexes with HaeIII (comparelanes 1 and 3) and only modestly reduced by digestion with either HindIII (compare lanes 1and 5) or SphI (compare lanes 1 and7 and lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, synthesis of trinucleotide transcripts was almost completely inhibited by digestion of preinitiation complexes with PstI (comparelanes 9 and 11). Thus, transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II does not require template DNA downstream of +29, but is strongly dependent on the presence of template DNA between +23 and +28, even though the preinitiation complex does not protect DNA in this region from digestion by restriction enzymes. Like synthesis of CpU-primed trinucleotide transcripts, synthesis of CpU-primed 3′-O-MeG-terminated 18-nucleotide-long transcripts was unaffected by digestion of preinitiation complexes withHaeIII prior to initiation (compare lanes 2 and4). In contrast, little or no 3′-O-MeG-terminated 18-nucleotide transcripts were synthesized when preinitiation complexes were digested with HindIII (lane 6) orSphI (lanes 8 and 13). Under these conditions, CpU-primed transcripts reached a maximum length of only ∼10–12 nucleotides. Thus, promoter escape by very early RNA polymerase II elongation complexes is strongly dependent on the presence of template DNA located between 40 and 47 base pairs downstream of the AdML transcriptional start site (or between 30 and 40 base pairs downstream of the polymerase catalytic site), even though this region of the DNA template is not essential for assembly of the preinitiation complex formation and transcription initiation. Although digestion of preinitiation complexes with HindIII prior to transcription initiation is sufficient to inhibit synthesis of transcripts longer than ∼10–12 nucleotides, digestion of preinitiation complexes with HindIII after synthesis of ∼14-nucleotide-long transcripts does not prevent their further extension. In the experiment of Fig. 3, preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter by preincubation of the EcoRI to NdeI fragment of pDN-AdML with RNA polymerase II and initiation factors. Transcription was carried out in the presence of the initiating dinucleotide CpA, [α-32P]CTP, UTP, and dATP to satisfy the energy requirement for transcription initiation. Under these conditions, RNA polymerase II can initiate and synthesize transcripts that have a maximum length of 14 nucleotides (terminated at the U residue immediately preceding the first A residue that must be incorporated into the transcript, marked with a circle in Fig. 1). Following treatment of preinitiation complexes with eitherHaeIII or HindIII, RNA polymerase II transcription intermediates were assayed for their abilities to extend the CpA-primed 14-nucleotide-long transcripts to 3′-O-MeG-terminated 16-nucleotide transcripts or to full-length runoff transcripts. As shown in lanes 1–6, digestion of preinitiation complexes with eitherHaeIII or HindIII had no effect on the efficiency with which CpA-primed 14-nucleotide-long transcripts were chased into 3′-O-MeG-terminated 16-nucleotide transcripts. In addition, full-length runoff transcripts of the expected length were synthesized when nascent transcripts were chased into longer products in the presence of all four ribonucleoside triphosphates (lanes 7–9). Similar results were obtained when transcription was initiated with the dinucleotide CpU (data not shown). As summarized in Fig. 4, in the process of investigating the mechanism of formation of the stable RNA polymerase II elongation complex, we have discovered that promoter escape by RNA polymerase II has a transient requirement for template DNA between 40 and 50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. We observe that, in the absence of downstream DNA in this region, very early RNA polymerase II elongation complexes are unable to synthesize transcripts longer than ∼10–12 nucleotides. In contrast, elongating RNA polymerase II does not normally require an extended region of downstream template DNA for transcription; indeed, RNA polymerase II is able to transcribe to the extreme 3′-end of most DNA templates during synthesis of longer runoff transcripts (21Weil P.A. Luse D.S. Segall J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1979; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 22Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q. Mote J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2290-2297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observe that template DNA downstream of +40 is not required for assembly of the preinitiation complex, for initiation and synthesis of the first 10–12 phosphodiester bonds of nascent transcripts, or for further extension of transcripts longer than ∼14 nucleotides. Taken together, our findings argue that promoter escape requires that the RNA polymerase II initiation complex undergoes a critical structural transition that is likely driven by interaction of one or more components of the transcriptional machinery with template DNA 40–50 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site and that results in formation of an escape-competent transcriptional intermediate. Finally, it is not yet clear which components of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery require downstream DNA for promoter escape. In light of our recent findings (i) that RNA polymerase II is highly susceptible to arrest in a very similar promoter-proximal region (∼9–13 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site) during promoter-specific transcription reconstituted with TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (4Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and (ii) that arrest by polymerase at this site is suppressed by TFIIE and TFIIH in a step that requires an ATP cofactor (5Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate TFIIE, TFIIH, ATP, and downstream DNA are all involved in formation of the same escape-competent transcriptional intermediate. In this regard, it is noteworthy that results of previous footprinting (10Conaway J.W. Bradsher J.N. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10142-10148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) suggest that TFIIH and/or TFIIE may be positioned at the leading edge of the preinitiation complex, consistent with the possibility that they could facilitate promoter escape through interactions with downstream DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2002128462,"Desensitization and recovery of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+] i ) responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were measured in HEK293 cells stably expressing the G protein-coupled TRH receptor. TRH caused a large, rapid, and transient increase in IP3 and a biphasic increase in [Ca2+] i. Desensitization of the TRH response was measured by exposing cells to TRH, washing, and then incubating the cells in hormone-free medium before reintroducing TRH and measuring IP3, [Ca2+] i, and intracellular Ca2+ pool size. When cells were incubated with 1 μm TRH for 10 s or 10 min and reexposed to TRH, there was almost no IP3 or [Ca2+] i increase. The IP3 response recovered first, followed by the [Ca2+] i response. The ionomycin-releasable intracellular Ca2+ pool was almost completely depleted by TRH, and pool refilling was slow. Thrombin, endothelin, and carbachol, when combined, stimulated large increases in IP3 and [Ca2+] i, but did not block the IP3 or [Ca2+] i responses to TRH measured 10 min later. In contrast, cells exposed to TRH first responded to combined agonists with a nearly normal increase in IP3, but no rise in [Ca2+] i. Thus, the IP3 response to TRH displays homologous desensitization, whereas the [Ca2+] i response displays heterologous desensitization because depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools prevents responses to other hormones.

The Ca2+-mobilizing pathway for G protein-coupled receptors involves multiple steps (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Agonist binding causes the activation of G protein, resulting in the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ and increased hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate, producing inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; [Ca2+] i, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. and diacylglycerol. IP3 binds to its receptor, a Ca2+ channel on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, releasing Ca2+ from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and increasing the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) acts on receptors in lactotrophs and thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary that are coupled to Gq/11 to cause a biphasic increase in [Ca2+] i (2Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The initial transient [Ca2+] i spike, which is primarily due to release of intracellular Ca2+, is followed by a sustained [Ca2+] i elevation that results from increased influx through L-type Ca2+ channels and capacitative Ca2+ influx. The initial [Ca2+] i spike is terminated as IP3 concentrations decline, intracellular Ca2+ stores become exhausted, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ is resequestered and pumped from the cell. Desensitization is defined as a decline in the response to an agonist over time or a decline in the response to a subsequent agonist exposure. There are conflicting reports about whether the TRH response undergoes either form of desensitization in pituitary cells or following expression of the receptor in other cell types (3Gershengorn M.C.

The contradictory findings may be a consequence of differences in the methods used to assess the TRH response. In some cases, IP3mass has been measured at intervals after TRH has been given (5Drummond A.H. Bushfield M. Macphee C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 201-208PubMed Google Scholar, 8Torjesen P.A.

Physiol. 1995; 430: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), only the [Ca2+] i response has been followed. There is little information about the IP3response to repetitive applications of TRH, although it is well documented that the [Ca2+] i response to high doses of TRH requires 5–20 min to recover (2Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the refractory period results from desensitization of the receptor or exhaustion of calcium pools. In this study, we have carried out a detailed analysis of desensitization of the TRH response. To establish the molecular basis for desensitization, we have monitored IP3 mass, [Ca2+] i, the size of the intracellular Ca2+ pool, and the responsiveness to other Ca2+-mobilizing hormones in the continued presence of TRH and following the withdrawal and re-administration of TRH. We show that the TRH response undergoes profound desensitization over time and that the receptor is desensitized and unable to stimulate IP3production after TRH is withdrawn. The rate-limiting step in the recovery of the [Ca2+] i response to TRH is refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ pools. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Thrombin, carbachol, endothelin, trichlorotrifluoroethane, and trioctylamine were purchased from Sigma. [3H]TRH, [3H](N 3-methyl-His2)TRH, and kits for the detection of IP3 were from NEN Life Science Products. Fura-2/AM and BAPTA were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), TRH and ionomycin from Calbiochem, cyclosporin from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (East Hanover, NJ), and (N 3methyl-His2)TRH from Bachem (Philadelphia, PA). A HEK293 cell line stably expressing the wild-type mouse TRH receptor (301 cells) has been described previously (12Shupnik M.A. Weck J. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 90-99PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum as monolayer cultures at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air and 5% CO2environment. Ca2+imaging was carried out essentially as described by Nelson and Hinkle (13Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All Ca2+ measurements were performed on cells in HBSS buffered to pH 7.4 with 15 mm HEPES. Cells plated on coverslips were loaded with 4 μm Fura-2/AM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml cyclosporin A in HBSS at room temperature for 50–60 min. The coverslip was washed and put into a Sykes-Moore chamber on a Nikon inverted microscope on a heated stage at 37 °C. The chamber was perfused with medium at 37 °C, and 340/380 nm fluorescence ratios were acquired every 1200 ms. The length of [Ca2+] i imaging experiments was limited by gradual leaking of the Fura-2; similar difficulties were encountered with Fura-2/PE (data not shown). To estimate the size of the intracellular Ca2+ pool, 1.5 mmBAPTA was added to the medium to chelate extracellular Ca2+30–60 s before 500 nm ionomycin was added. The increase in [Ca2+] i stimulated by ionomycin was used as the measure of pool size. Ionomycin (500 nm) completely eliminated the TRH-induced increase in [Ca2+] i measured 2.5 min later, indicating that the IP3-releasable pool was completely empty. Conversely, pretreatment of cells with 1 μm TRH for 10 min almost eliminated subsequent ionomycin-induced Ca2+ release. Ionomycin did not increase [Ca2+] i in cells that had been pretreated with thapsigargin, whether extracellular Ca2+ was present or not, indicating that extracellular Ca2+ entry was minimal. Cells plated in 35-mm dishes were rinsed twice with HBSS and incubated at 37 °C with or without hormone as described below. At the end of the treatment, the medium was aspirated; 0.8 ml of 20% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added; and the dish was put on ice immediately. Cells were scraped off the dish, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and pelleted at 12,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature. The supernatant was extracted with 2 volumes of trichlorotrifluoroethane/trioctylamine (3:1), and the aqueous phase was saved. The radioreceptor assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the reaction mixture was filtered through Whatman GF/C paper from NEN Life Science Products. Cells plated in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with HBSS and incubated at 37 °C in buffer containing [3H]TRH or [3H](N 3-methyl-His2)TRH with or without a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled hormone. Cells were then washed three times with HBSS. The 301 cell line expresses ∼200,000 TRH receptors/cell, with an apparent K d of 10 nm (12Shupnik M.A. Weck J. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 90-99PubMed Google Scholar). [Ca2+] i was monitored in single 301 cells loaded with Fura-2. TRH stimulation produced a biphasic increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig.1), with an early transient peak and a later maintained phase. The initial [Ca2+] i spike was abolished by thapsigargin treatment, indicating that the Ca2+ came from an intracellular pool, and the sustained [Ca2+] i increase quickly subsided after the addition of the extracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, indicating that it depended on the influx of extracellular Ca2+. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] i spike depended on TRH concentration, reaching an apparent maximum at 1 nm (Fig. 1 and Table I). The [Ca2+] i response occurred earlier and more synchronously, and the upstroke of the response was steeper at higher doses of TRH (Table I).Table IConcentration dependence of TRH-mediated [Ca2+]iresponsesPeak increase in [Ca2+] i (340/380 nm ratio)LagRate of [Ca2+] i risessTRH 0.1 nm1.22 ± 0.1310.4 ± 0.410.9 ± 0.31 nm5.39 ± 0.545.5 ± 0.130.7 ± 0.110 nm4.13 ± 0.321.9 ± 0.060.2 ± 0.11000 nm5.02 ± 0.37—1-a—, Responses complete within time resolution of the system.—301 cells were loaded with Fura-2 and treated with TRH.

The lag is defined as the time between the addition of TRH and the point where the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio reached half of the peak value. The rate of [Ca2+] i rise is defined as the time between the start of the upstroke in the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio and the point halfway to the peak. The intracellular concentration of IP3 was measured in 301 cells at different times after the addition of TRH. The TRH-stimulated increase in IP3 was also biphasic and strongly concentration-dependent (Fig.2). The peak concentration of IP3 occurred within 10 s at TRH concentrations of 10 nm or higher, and IP3 increased ∼15-fold at 1 μm TRH. In contrast to the [Ca2+] i response, the IP3 response increased with TRH concentrations between 10 and 1000 nm, the highest dose tested. The IP3 concentration dropped rapidly within 1 min of TRH addition, but remained at more than twice the basal level for at least 10 min. At 1 nm, TRH caused no more than a 70% increase in the overall IP3 concentration at times from 2 s to 10 min, and this increase was not highly significant (p = 0.07), even though the peak [Ca2+] i response was essentially maximal under these conditions. The concentration dependence of the [Ca2+] i and IP3 responses is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3Concentration dependence of TRH-mediated increases in [Ca2+] i and IP3 in 301 cells. The peak increases in [Ca2+] i and IP3, measured in experiments like those shown in Figs. 1and 2, are shown. [Ca2+] i values represent the means ± S.E. of 16–20 cells from a single experiment and are representative of the results of 2–10 experiments. Errors in the IP3 measurements were within symbol size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Desensitization of the TRH response was measured by exposing cells to TRH, washing to remove free hormone, and then incubating the cells in hormone-free medium for various times before reintroducing TRH and measuring IP3, [Ca2+] i, and the intracellular Ca2+ pool size. Cells were first incubated with 1 μm TRH for 10 s or 10 min or with 1 nm TRH for 10 min. The amplitude of the initial [Ca2+] i spike was the same in all three protocols, but the ability of the cell to respond to a subsequent challenge with TRH depended on both the dose and the duration of the first exposure. When cells were incubated with 1 μm TRH for either 10 s or 10 min, washed, and immediately challenged again with TRH, there was almost no IP3 response (Fig.4). Cells gradually recovered the ability to respond to TRH and gave a full IP3 response by 40 min. The t½ for recovery was ∼5 min after an initial 10-s incubation with TRH versus ∼10 min after an initial 10-min incubation. Since the K d for TRH is 10 nm, 1 nm TRH occupies only ∼10% of receptors at equilibrium. Nonetheless, incubation with 1 nm TRH for 10 min (Fig. 4) significantly desensitized the IP3 response to a subsequent challenge with 1 μm TRH. Immediately after withdrawal of 1 nm TRH, 1 μm TRH increased IP3 to only 63% of the IP3 level reached in naive cells. The ability of the cell to respond to a second challenge with TRH may be limited by how fast bound TRH dissociates from receptors following the first exposure to agonist. To measure ligand dissociation rates, cells were incubated with 1 μm [3H]TRH for either 10 s or 10 min and washed, and specifically bound [3H]TRH was followed over time (Fig. 5, left panel). The amount of [3H]TRH bound was the same after 10 s or 10 min of incubation, indicating that receptors were essentially saturated in both protocols. However, [3H]TRH dissociated faster from receptors after the 10-s incubation than after 10 min. An additional assay was used to measure the number of unoccupied receptors on the cell surface at various times after cells had been incubated with TRH and then washed (Fig. 5, right panel). Again, TRH receptors became available more rapidly when the initial incubation was brief. These data agree with previous findings in pituitary cells (14Hinkle P.M. Kinsella P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5462-5470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reflect the fact that the TRH-receptor complex internalizes extensively in 10 min in 301 cells. 2R. Yu and P. M. Hinkle, unpublished observations. Incubation of 301 cells with 1 μm TRH for 10 min completely abolished the [Ca2+] i response to a second exposure to 1 μm TRH (Fig. 6). The [Ca2+] i response recovered partially after 5 min, but remained at only 25% of the control response at 25 min, even though the IP3 response was almost fully recovered at this point. When cells were initially exposed to 1 μm TRH for 10 s, the ability of the cells to mount an [Ca2+] i response to 1 μm TRH was half of the control 2 min after washing and nearly 100% after 10 min (Fig. 6). Preincubation with 1 nm TRH for 10 min also prevented an [Ca2+] i response to 1 μm TRH immediately after washing (Fig. 6), even though the IP3 response was quite large. The [Ca2+] i response recovered to ∼70% of the control response by 10 min. The size of the intracellular Ca2+ pool was estimated by adding BAPTA to chelate extracellular Ca2+ and then adding 500 nm ionomycin to dump intracellular Ca2+ stores. The intracellular Ca2+ pool was almost completely depleted by 1 μm TRH within 1 min (Figs. 7 and8). The pool was also fully depleted by 1 nm TRH, but in this case, only after 10 min (Fig. 7). Ca2+ pools refilled slowly, such that they were just 25% replenished after 10–25 min in cells that had been exposed to TRH for 10 min (Fig. 8). Refilling was faster and more complete in cells that had been exposed to 1 μm TRH for only 10 s (Fig. 8). Interestingly, the [Ca2+] i response to TRH recovered before Ca2+ pools had refilled, indicating that partially full stores were adequate for a maximal response.Figure 8Intracellular Ca2+ pool refilling after TRH treatment. 301 cells were loaded with Fura-2 and treated with or without TRH at 37 °C as follows: 1 μm TRH for 10 min, 1 nm TRH for 10 min, or 1 μm TRH for 10 s. At the end of this treatment, the chamber was perfused with hormone-free medium. At intervals from 0 to 25 min, the intracellular Ca2+ pool size was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pool size is expressed relative to the Ca2+ pool in control cells determined in the same experiment. Values shown are the means ± S.E. of 16–20 cells in each experiment and are representative of multiple experiments; where not visible, errors fell within symbol size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because dye leakage became a problem in long experiments, we also measured Ca2+ pool sizes after loading with Fura-2/AM during the refilling period. In this protocol, Ca2+ pools seemed to recover fully within 1 h after cells had been incubated with 1 μm TRH for 10 min and washed. Ca2+pool sizes, determined as the increase in 340/380 nm fluorescence ratios caused by ionomycin, were 2.6 ± 0.2 (n = 26) in control cells and 2.8 ± 0.2 (n = 56) and 3.2 ± 0.7 (n = 24) 1 and 2 h after removal of TRH, respectively. The results described above imply that following TRH treatment, 301 cells should not be able to increase [Ca2+] i in response to any other agonist until the Ca2+ stores are replenished. Thrombin, endothelin, and carbachol all increase [Ca2+] i in 301 cells, although none of these agonists gives a response as large as TRH (data not shown). When combined into an agonist mixture, thrombin, endothelin, and carbachol stimulated large increases in IP3and [Ca2+] i (Fig. 9and Table II). The IP3response to the combined agonists occurred as quickly as the IP3 response to TRH, but the peak was lower (7.5-versus 15-fold), and the IP3 level fell to base line in 40 s, whereas it remained elevated for at least 10 min in the continued presence of TRH (Fig. 2 and Table II). The peak increase in [Ca2+] i stimulated by the mixture was indistinguishable from that stimulated by TRH (Fig. 9 and TableII).Table IIHeterologous effects of TRH and an agonist mixture[Ca2+] i (340/380 nm ratio)IP3Ca2+pool, (340/380 nm ratio)InitialPeakInitialPeakpmol/mg cell proteinTRH then mixture 0 min, TRH0.13 ± 0.014.83 ± 0.536.70 ± 1.7986.60 ± 0.257.99 ± 0.76 10 min, mixture0.69 ± 0.071.00 ± 0.0820.97 ± 0.0450.49 ± 5.790.25 ± 0.03Mixture then TRH 0 min, mixture0.19 ± 0.015.58 ± 0.536.16 ± 0.1944.87 ± 0.447.99 ± 0.76 10 min, TRH0.21 ± 0.014.66 ± 0.638.03 ± 0.6182.50 ± 5.302.14 ± 0.57In experiments like those shown in Fig. 9, TRH was added to 301 cells, followed 10 min later by the combined agonist mixture, or vice versa. IP3 was measured immediately before and 10 s after the addition of hormones. Ca2+ pool size was measured immediately before the first hormone addition and 10 min later before the second. Values are the means ± S.E. of three dishes for IP3 or of 20–30 cells for [Ca2+] i and Ca2+ pool size. Open table in a new tab In experiments like those shown in Fig. 9, TRH was added to 301 cells, followed 10 min later by the combined agonist mixture, or vice versa. IP3 was measured immediately before and 10 s after the addition of hormones. Ca2+ pool size was measured immediately before the first hormone addition and 10 min later before the second. Values are the means ± S.E. of three dishes for IP3 or of 20–30 cells for [Ca2+] i and Ca2+ pool size. As predicted, when cells were first exposed to 1 μm TRH for 10 min and then to the mixture, the combined agonists did not increase [Ca2+] i substantially, although they caused an IP3 increase that was close to that in untreated cells (Fig. 9 and Table II). These results support the idea that Ca2+ pool depletion, not impaired IP3generation, prevents [Ca2+] i responses to other hormones. The converse was not true. When cells were preincubated with the mixture for 10 min, they could still respond to TRH with a normal elevation of [Ca2+] i, even though the Ca2+ pool was substantially reduced by the agonist mixture (Fig. 9 and Table II). These results again suggest that a full [Ca2+] i response requires only a partly full intracellular Ca2+ pool. The IP3 response to TRH, administered after the combined agonists, was close to that of control cells (Table II). In this report, we have demonstrated that the TRH response undergoes profound desensitization. Restoration of the [Ca2+] i response to TRH involves multiple steps, including ligand dissociation, recovery of receptor 1G protein 1 phospholipase C coupling, and intracellular Ca2+ pool replenishment. The characteristics of the IP3 response measured in 301 cells expressing the TRH receptor closely resemble those reported previously for cell lines expressing an endogenous TRH receptor (5Drummond A.H. Bushfield M. Macphee C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 201-208PubMed Google Scholar, 8Torjesen P.A. Bjoro T. Ostberg B.C. Haug E. Mol. Cell.

Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5301-5306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRH stimulates a rapid and transient increase in IP3 mass, which reaches a peak between 5 and 15 s (Fig. 2). In 301 cells, the dose dependence of the IP3 and [Ca2+] i responses to TRH was very different. A low dose of TRH (1 nm) produced an essentially maximal peak of [Ca2+] i, but only a small increase in IP3. A similar although less pronounced discrepancy in the dose-response curves for IP3 and [Ca2+] i has been reported previously for pituitary cells (3Gershengorn M.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 515-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Drummond A.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1986; 124: 337-358PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gershengorn M.C. Heinflink M. Nussenzveig D.R. Hinkle P.M. Falck-Pedersen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6779-6783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the activity of phospholipase C has been reported to increase with TRH doses up to 1–10 μmin isolated membranes (18Martin T.F. Lucas D.O. Bajjalieh S.M. Kowalchyk J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2918-2927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic studies have shown that the [Ca2+] i peak precedes the IP3 peak (19Tashjian Jr., A.H. Heslop J.P. Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings all indicate that a very small increase in the average IP3 concentration is sufficient to trigger a large increase in [Ca2+] i. There are a number of possible explanations. Single cell Ca2+ imaging has shown that there is a highly variable delay between the addition of a low dose of TRH and the onset of the [Ca2+] i rise (Table I) (2Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Akerman S.N. Zorec R. Cheek T.R. Moreton R.B. Berridge M.J. Mason W.T. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). If there is a similar asynchrony in the TRH-mediated increase in IP3, then the average IP3 value will seriously underestimate the amplitude of a short-lived increase in IP3 in individual cells. High concentrations of TRH stimulate a rapid and highly synchronous increase in [Ca2+] i (Table I) (2Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Imaging studies have provided strong evidence for spatial heterogeneity in intracellular Ca2+ release (20Berridge M.J. Dupont G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and biochemical evidence supports the existence of heterogeneous Ca2+ stores in pituitary cells responsive to TRH (21Koshiyama H. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The small amount of IP3 generated by low concentrations of TRH may release Ca2+ from stores near the plasma membrane, and the resultant increase in [Ca2+] i may sensitize IP3 receptors (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 20Berridge M.J. Dupont G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or otherwise contribute to Ca2+ release as it spreads through the cell. At the other extreme of the dose-response relationship, very high concentrations of TRH produced much higher levels of IP3than necessary for a maximal [Ca2+] i spike. Very high levels of IP3 are likely to alter the kinetics of pool refilling, even though they do not increase the size of the initial [Ca2+] i spike. In addition, the peak Ca2+ concentration in the vicinity of the secretory granules may increase as the agonist dose is raised, even though the average Ca2+ concentration reported by fluorescent indicators does not. Desensitization is defined as a diminishing response in the continued presence of an agonist or a diminished response to a subsequent exposure to an agonist. In this study, we documented both of these forms of desensitization. In the continued presence of TRH, IP3 increased 15-fold and then fell rapidly to a plateau 1.5–3 times the basal level. This IP3 response is typical of many receptors coupled to Gq (22Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 23Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 25Wojcikiewicz R.J. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Gershengorn and co-workers found that the rate of total inositol phosphate production, measured over 30 min, decreases with time of exposure to TRH in pituitary cells (7Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and in several other cell types (6Falck-Pedersen E. Heinflink M. Alvira M. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 684-689PubMed Google Scholar), but not in HEK293 cells (6Falck-Pedersen E. Heinflink M. Alvira M. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 684-689PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy is not known, but it may be because the transient IP3 response to TRH was obscured in measurements done over a 30-min period or because the density of receptors was much greater when they were introduced by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (6Falck-Pedersen E. Heinflink M. Alvira M. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 684-689PubMed Google Scholar) rather than stable transfection, as in our work. In principle, IP3 concentrations could rise and then fall for several reasons. 1) Metabolism of IP3 may be accelerated. 2) Substrate (phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate) may be depleted. 3) Downstream kinases may turn off phospholipase C. 4) The receptor/G protein/phospholipase signal pathway may become uncoupled. Since TRH causes a biphasic increase in diacylglycerol as well as IP3 and a burst followed by a gradual increase in total inositol phosphates (16Drummond A.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1986; 124: 337-358PubMed Google Scholar), the activity of phospholipase C must change over time, not the metabolism of IP3. The concentration of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate declines after TRH is added, but quickly recovers (26Rebecchi M.J. Gershengorn M.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), making substrate exhaustion unlikely. Downstream kinases do not turn off phospholipase C generally because TRH caused little reduction in the IP3 response to other Gq-coupled receptors. Activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters does decrease the subsequent phospholipase C response to TRH (6Falck-Pedersen E. Heinflink M. Alvira M. Nussenzveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 684-689PubMed Google Scholar, 7Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Drummond A.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1986; 124: 337-358PubMed Google Scholar), but this level of regulation is probably exerted later. The simplest explanation is that the TRH receptor became uncoupled. It is not clear how the TRH receptor/G protein/phospholipase C cascade becomes uncoupled. Phospholipase C has GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity (27Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) that may account for the rapid turnoff of G protein activation. However, since other agonists activated phospholipase C normally when the TRH response was uncoupled, it is necessary to postulate that the G proteins and phospholipase C coupled to the TRH receptor are spatially restricted if the GAP activity of the effector is responsible. An alternative, or additional, mechanism may involve uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein, possibly as a result of phosphorylation by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase or other downstream kinase (28Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). There is no evidence about whether the TRH receptor is phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases or other kinases (28Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar), but we have shown that a truncated form of the TRH receptor, which lacks probable G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites, does not undergo this form of desensitization effectively.2 When TRH was withdrawn from the medium, a second form of desensitization was observed, whereby the cell was refractory to re-addition of TRH for up to 30 min. The pattern of recovery is shown schematically in Fig. 10. Cells first recovered the ability to increase IP3, but elevated IP3 did not increase [Ca2+] i because intracellular Ca2+ pools were almost completely depleted. The [Ca2+] i response recovered ∼10 min behind the IP3 response and was maximal when Ca2+pools were partially full. The Ca2+ pool eventually recovered fully. The consequence of depleted Ca2+ pools was heterologous desensitization of the [Ca2+] i response. Although other agonists were able to evoke a nearly normal increase in IP3after TRH, they could not increase [Ca2+] i because the intracellular Ca2+ pool was empty. Hormone dissociation is a necessary first step before a previously occupied receptor can be activated again. Ligand dissociation is not likely to be the only factor in desensitization of the IP3response, however. There was a sizable plasma membrane receptor pool available for activation shortly after a 10-s exposure to 1 μm TRH, but TRH could not stimulate phospholipase C activity effectively. A cell-surface receptor pool of similar size was present 25 min after exposure to 1 μm TRH for 10 min, and in this case, TRH could generate a nearly maximal IP3response. Desensitization of the [Ca2+] i response to agonists has been documented in many other studies (22Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 23Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Andersonet al. (4Anderson L. Alexander C.L. Faccenda E. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) expressed rat and human TRH receptors in HEK293 cells and found that the [Ca2+] i response mediated by the receptors was desensitized by high concentrations of TRH and did not recover at all, even in the face of normal Ca2+ pool refilling. The difference between previous results and ours may be due to the much higher concentration of TRH receptors in the transfected HEK293 cells used by Anderson et al. (4Anderson L. Alexander C.L. Faccenda E. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In GH-cells and primary pituitary cell cultures, pool refilling does not seem to occur until TRH is withdrawn and then requires as long as 20 min (2Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our study highlights the importance of regulation of the Ca2+ pool as a means of desensitizing receptor-mediated [Ca2+] i responses. Pool replenishment was the rate-limiting step in recovery of the TRH response in 301 cells. The other agonists tested here did not deplete Ca2+ pools as thoroughly as TRH, even though the IP3 responses were large. One of the reasons that TRH depletes the Ca2+ pool so thoroughly is that it stimulates efflux of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm, apparently by activating a plasma membrane Ca2+pump (29Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30854-30860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, all methods used to quantitate Ca2+pool sizes are indirect. If TRH treatment changes cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering capacity or Ca2+ reuptake, then the increase in [Ca2+] i caused by ionomycin, used here to estimate pool size, might be altered (30Wagner K.A. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as might any localized release of Ca2+ from specialized domains on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (31Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 32Parker I. Yao Y. Ciba Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 50-60PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the signal transduction pathway to TRH becomes profoundly desensitized at multiple levels. In 301 cells, the IP3 response to TRH undergoes homologous desensitization, but the [Ca2+] i response undergoes heterologous desensitization because the TRH-treated cell cannot respond to any Ca2+-mobilizing agonist until pool refilling has occurred. Additional study is needed to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for these complex levels of desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2102305767,"We recently cloned cDNAs encoding three subtypes of human α1-adrenergic receptors (α1ARs), α1a, α1b, and α1d (Schwinn, D. A., Johnston, G. L., Page, S. O., Mosley, M. J., Wilson, K. H., Worman, N. P., Campbell, S., Fidock, M. D., Furness, L. M., Parry-Smith, D. J., Peter, B., and Bailey, D. S. (1995) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 272, 134–142) and demonstrated predominance of α1aARs in many human tissues (Price, D. T., Lefkowitz, R. J., Caron, M. G., Berkowitz, D., and Schwinn, D. A. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 171–175). Several lines of evidence indicate that α1aARs are important in clinical diseases such as myocardial hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, we initiated studies to understand mechanisms underlying regulation of α1aAR gene transcription. A genomic clone containing 6.2 kb of 5′-untranslated region of the human α1aAR gene was recently isolated. Ribonuclease protection and primer extension assays indicate that α1aAR gene transcription occurs at multiple initiation sites with the major site located 696 base pairs upstream of the ATG, where a classic initiator sequence is located. Transfection of luciferase reporter constructs containing varying amounts of 5′-untranslated region into human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells indicate that a region extending 125 base pairs upstream from the main transcription initiation site contains full α1aAR promoter activity. Furthermore, distinct activator and suppressor elements lie 2–3 and 3–5 kilobase pairs upstream, respectively. Although the α1aAR promoter contains neither TATA or CAAT elements, gel shift mobility assays targeting three GC boxes immediately upstream of the main transcription initiation site confirm binding of Sp1. Activity of the α1aAR promoter is cell-specific, demonstrating highest activity in cells endogenously expressing α1aARs. The human α1aAR gene also contains several cis regulatory elements, including several insulin and cAMP response elements. Consistent with these observations, we provide the first evidence that treatment of SK-N-MC cells with insulin and cAMP elevating agents leads to an increase in α1aAR expression. In conclusion, these data represent the first characterization of the α1aAR gene; our findings should facilitate further studies designed to understand mechanisms regulating α1AR subtype-specific expression in healthy and diseased human tissue. We recently cloned cDNAs encoding three subtypes of human α1-adrenergic receptors (α1ARs), α1a, α1b, and α1d (Schwinn, D. A., Johnston, G. L., Page, S. O., Mosley, M. J., Wilson, K. H., Worman, N. P., Campbell, S., Fidock, M. D., Furness, L. M., Parry-Smith, D. J., Peter, B., and Bailey, D. S. (1995) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 272, 134–142) and demonstrated predominance of α1aARs in many human tissues (Price, D. T., Lefkowitz, R. J., Caron, M. G., Berkowitz, D., and Schwinn, D. A. (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 45, 171–175). Several lines of evidence indicate that α1aARs are important in clinical diseases such as myocardial hypertrophy and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, we initiated studies to understand mechanisms underlying regulation of α1aAR gene transcription. A genomic clone containing 6.2 kb of 5′-untranslated region of the human α1aAR gene was recently isolated. Ribonuclease protection and primer extension assays indicate that α1aAR gene transcription occurs at multiple initiation sites with the major site located 696 base pairs upstream of the ATG, where a classic initiator sequence is located. Transfection of luciferase reporter constructs containing varying amounts of 5′-untranslated region into human SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells indicate that a region extending 125 base pairs upstream from the main transcription initiation site contains full α1aAR promoter activity. Furthermore, distinct activator and suppressor elements lie 2–3 and 3–5 kilobase pairs upstream, respectively. Although the α1aAR promoter contains neither TATA or CAAT elements, gel shift mobility assays targeting three GC boxes immediately upstream of the main transcription initiation site confirm binding of Sp1. Activity of the α1aAR promoter is cell-specific, demonstrating highest activity in cells endogenously expressing α1aARs. The human α1aAR gene also contains several cis regulatory elements, including several insulin and cAMP response elements. Consistent with these observations, we provide the first evidence that treatment of SK-N-MC cells with insulin and cAMP elevating agents leads to an increase in α1aAR expression. In conclusion, these data represent the first characterization of the α1aAR gene; our findings should facilitate further studies designed to understand mechanisms regulating α1AR subtype-specific expression in healthy and diseased human tissue. α1-Adrenergic receptors (α1ARs) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, adrenergic receptor; αARTF, α-adrenergic receptor transcription factor; ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; bp, base pair(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; 125I-HEAT, 2-[β-(4-hydroxy-3-[125I]iodophenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone; Inr, initiator; kb, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PERE, phenylephrine response element; TAF, TBP-associated factors; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TF, transcription factor; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region. are members of the larger family of G protein-coupled receptors, mediating various sympathetic nervous system responses such as smooth muscle contraction and myocardial inotropy (1Terzic A. Puceat M. Vassort G. Vogel S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 147-175PubMed Google Scholar). α1ARs couple predominantly via Gq to activation of phospholipase C-β and hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids. Resultant formation of inositol triphosphate leads to release of calcium from intracellular stores and ultimately to muscle contraction (2Graham R.M. Perez D.M. Hwa J. Piascik M.T. Circ.

We have previously demonstrated species heterogeneity (rat, rabbit, and human) and distinct tissue distribution for each α1AR subtype, with α1aARs predominating in many human tissues (10Price D.T.

Clinically, α1aARs have been shown to be important in the dynamic component of benign prostatic hyperplasia, with α1aAR-mediated prostate contractions correlating with urinary symptoms (13Marshall I.

In cardiac myocytes, α1AR activation induces selective transcriptional activation of a “hypertrophic gene program,” including expression of embryonic genes (such as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun), up-regulation, accumulation, and assembly of constitutively expressed contractile proteins (including skeletal actin, β-myosin heavy chain, and smooth muscle α-actin), activation of Raf-1 kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and increases in cell size without cellular proliferation. While the precise signaling mechanisms through which α1AR-stimulated transcriptional activation occurs are not known, multiple pathways involving Gq and several protein kinases have been implicated (16Simpson P.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 17Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S.

Circulation. 1997; 95: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These enzymes presumably alter gene transcription via activation of transcription factors such as serum response factor, AP-1, and perhaps some cell-specific nuclear proteins, which in turn bind to distinct regulatory sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of ANF and other α1AR-responsive genes such as α-actin, and β-myosin heavy chain. While some of these pathways are common to other receptors and agents that activate protein kinase C, at least one pathway is specific for α1ARs. This is demonstrated by characterization of the α1AR-sensitive phenylephrine response element (PERE) found in the 5′-UTR of the ANF gene, acis regulatory element that is not responsive to hypertrophic agents that activate only the protein kinase C signaling pathway (e.g. phorbol esters) (22Ardati A. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5131-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This finding emphasizes that α1AR stimulation provides a unique pathway for inducing muscle hypertrophy. Recent studies demonstrate that α1ARs themselves are regulated by agonist. Furthermore, regulation by agonist appears to be subtype-specific. Chronic norepinephrine stimulation of α1ARs in neonatal rat ventricular primary myocyte cultures leads to repression of α1b and α1dAR mRNA expression, while concurrently transcription of α1aAR mRNA is induced. These changes are not explained by altered mRNA stability, and are accompanied by increased α1aAR subtype-specific protein expression, as well as myocardial hypertrophy (15Rokosh D.G. Stewart A.F.R. Chang K.C. Bailey B.A. Karliner J.S. Camacho S.A. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This phenomenon of differential up-regulation of cardiac α1AR subtypes is also exhibited by other hypertrophic agonists such as endothelin-1, prostaglandin F2α, and phorbol esters, which increase α1aAR transcription while repressing α1band α1dAR mRNA expression (15Rokosh D.G. Stewart A.F.R. Chang K.C. Bailey B.A. Karliner J.S. Camacho S.A. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hence, α1aARs appear to play a critical role in the induction of myocardial hypertrophy, and are themselves transcriptionally induced by catecholamines and other agonists commonly found in clinical settings of myocardial hypertrophy. Despite the importance of α1aARs in pathophysiologic states, no studies have examined mechanisms underlying α1aAR transcriptional regulation. Understanding mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation of human α1aARs is important, given that these receptors play a role in prostate disease and cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we cloned 6.2 kb of 5′-UTR of the human α1aAR gene and, in the present study, we delineate various elements involved in its transcription. Our data indicate that the human α1aAR has multiple transcription initiation sites and contains a TATA-less promoter within 125 bp upstream of the main transcription initiation site in a region where we document Sp1 binding. The α1aAR promoter is cell-specific, and the receptor is up-regulated by cAMP and insulin. Finally, we identify the presence of two PERE consensus sequences upstream of transcription initiation sites, a finding that may explain the observed agonist-induced up-regulation of α1aARs in rat heart (15Rokosh D.G. Stewart A.F.R. Chang K.C. Bailey B.A. Karliner J.S. Camacho S.A. Long C.S. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5839-5843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To isolate 5′-UTR sequence in the human α1aAR gene, a human genomic library (female peripheral blood leukocytes in EMBL3 SP6/T7, average insert size 15 kb, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened. A probe containing 450 bp of 5′-UTR (DNA immediately upstream from the initiator ATG) was generated fromEcoRI/NcoI digestion of a human α1aAR cDNA (5Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.L. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Positive clones were initially characterized by restriction analysis, followed by southern hybridization (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992: 9.3.1-9.3.3Google Scholar). DNA sequencing of the entire 5′-regulatory region of each distinct clone was performed using Sanger dideoxy chain termination methods (fmol™ DNA sequencing system; Promega, Madison, WI). Ligation of overlapping clones produced a final genomic construct containing 6.2 kb of 5′-UTR, which was subcloned into pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) at SacI/PstI sites using standard molecular biology methods. This final construct provided a template for further 5′-deletion reporter constructs used in examining transcriptional regulation of the human α1aAR gene. SK-N-MC (human neuroblastoma cell line containing endogenous α1aARs (see Ref. 10Price D.T. Chari R.S. Berkowitz D.E. Meyers W.C. Schwinn D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 221-226PubMed Google Scholar)), Chang liver (human liver), DU145 (human prostatic carcinoma (epithelial)) (ATCC, Rockville, MD), and rat-1 fibroblast cells were grown in monolayers utilizing minimum essential medium (SK-N-MC, DU145), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (rat-1 fibroblasts), and basal medium-Eagle's (Chang liver) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% (SK-N-MC) or 10% (all other cell lines) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In addition, SK-N-MC cells were supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mm) and nonessential amino acids (100 nm). Control rat-1 fibroblasts stably expressing each human α1AR subtype (5Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.L. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar) were grown under identical conditions as untransfected rat-1 fibroblasts except for selection with G418 (400 μg/ml). Total RNA was extracted from cells (SK-N-MC, Chang liver, DU145, rat-1 fibroblast cells (wild type and stably expressing each human α1AR subtype)) using the RNazol method (Teltest Inc., Friendswood, TX). Each RNA sample was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm and stored at −70 °C as an ethanol precipitate. RNase protection assays were used to confirm the site(s) of transcription initiation and to measure α1AR subtype mRNA concentrations in various cells. Two probes were utilized to determine the transcription initiation site, probes (−485, +4) and (−898, −481). Probe (−485, +4) consists of a 0.48-kbSalI/NcoI fragment of the human α1aAR 5′-UTR (−485 to +4 relative to the human α1aAR translational initiation site) (GenBank™ accession no. U72653) (24Lee K. Richardson C.D. Razik M.A. Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. DNA Seq. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) subcloned into pGEM-5Zf(+) (all pGEM vectors are from Promega). Probe (−898, −481) consists of a 0.42-kbBamHI/SalI fragment of the human α1aAR 5′-UTR (−898 to −481 relative to the human α1aAR translational initiation site) (GenBank™ U72653) (24Lee K. Richardson C.D. Razik M.A. Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. DNA Seq. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar) subcloned into pGEM3Zf(+). To determine expression of α1AR subtype mRNA in various cell lines, coding region probes for each α1AR subtype were used. The human α1aAR coding region probe consists of a 0.33-kbPvuII (blunted)/HindIII fragment subcloned into pGEM-4Z (SmaI/HindIII sites), corresponding to nucleotides 958–1283 (GenBank™ L31774) (5Schwinn D.A.

The human α1bAR probe consists of a 0.670-kbXhoI/BamHI fragment in pGEM-4Z (SalI/BamHI sites), corresponding to nucleotides 94–766 (GenBank™ L31773) (5Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.L. Page S.O. Mosley M.J.

The human α1dAR cDNA probe consists of a 0.38-kb EcoRI/PstI fragment in pGEM-4Z (EcoRI/PstI), corresponding to nucleotides 520–896 (GenBank™ L31772) (5Schwinn D.A. Johnston G.L. Page S.O. Mosley M.J. Wilson K.H. Worman N.P. Campbell S. Fidock M.D. Furness L.M. Parry-Smith D.J. Peter B. Bailey D.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 134-142PubMed Google Scholar). A human cyclophilin control probe was obtained from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX) and consists of a 0.103-kb KpnI/EcoRI fragment in pTRI, corresponding to nucleotides 38–140 of the cloned human cyclophilin gene (GenBank™ X52856) (25Haendler B. Hofer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Antisense single-stranded radiolabeled RNA probes were generated from linearized α1AR cDNA constructs using RNA polymerase T7 (probe (−485, +4), α1aAR, cyclophilin), SP6 (probe (−898, −481), α1bAR, α1dAR), and [α-32P]UTP (NEN Life Science Products) as described previously (26Titus D. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991: 58-64Google Scholar). All probes were purified on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (300 V for 1.5 h); after exposure to film for 3 min, radiolabeled RNA probes were excised and eluted passively overnight into 400 μl of RPA II kit (Ambion) elution buffer at 37 °C. RNase protection assays were conducted as described previously (27Zinn K. DiMaio D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1983; 34: 865-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) with a few modifications using the RPA II kit (Ambion). To determine the α1aAR transcription initiation site, 30 μg of total RNA from SK-N-MC cells was dissolved in 20 μl of RPA II kit hybridization buffer containing >20-fold excess of radiolabeled probe (−485, +4) or probe (−898, −481) (3 × 105cpm/reaction), and incubated overnight at 42–65 °C. In experiments designed to quantitate α1AR subtype mRNA expression in cells, 30 μg of total RNA from each cell line was dissolved in 20 μl of RPA II kit hybridization buffer containing excess α1aAR probe (3 × 105 cpm/reaction) and control cyclophilin probe (1 × 105 cpm/10 μg of total RNA), and incubated at 55 °C (α1aAR, α1bAR) and 65 °C (α1dAR) overnight. After digestion with RNase A (50 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (700 units), protected RNA fragments were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel; radiolabeled RNA size markers and a DNA sequencing ladder using the same primer and genomic DNA were loaded on the same gel. The dried gel was exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 24–36 h. Each RNase protection assay gel was further analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Volume integration of protected radiolabeled bands was corrected for background and total number of radiolabeled uracils contained in each RNA probe, normalized for cyclophilin signal, and expressed as arbitrary density units using ImageQuant gel image analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). A 36-bp oligonucleotide (5′-GCAGTTACCTACATTTTGAGCTGCCCCACCGAAGGC-3′) was made complementary to the region (−530 to −566 upstream from the translation initiation site (ATG)) of the human α1aAR gene. The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and primer extension assays performed as described previously (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.79-7.83Google Scholar) with 100 μg of total RNA from SK-N-MC cells. Final products were separated electrophoretically using an 8% polyacrylamide gel; a sequencing reaction using human α1aAR genomic DNA as a template and identical primer utilized for primer extension were run side-by-side on the gel. Serial deletions of the 5′-UTR of the human α1aAR gene were used to determine the general promoter region, to determine the presence of basal activator and suppressor sequence, and to confirm the main transcription initiation site. Varying amounts of 5′-UTR were fused to luciferase reporter vectors pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Enhancer (Promega; lacking SV40 enhancer sequence (designated pLΔ) or containing SV40 enhancer sequence (designated pLSΔ), respectively). The amount of 5′-UTR immediately upstream of the +1transcription initiation site in each construct is listed immediately following the Δ sign. pLΔ−5498 was generated by ligating two human α1aAR fragments, a 4468-bpSacI/XhoI (−5498, −1030) fragment and 1991-bpXhoI/AvrII (−1030, +961) fragment from the final genomic construct (Fig. 1), into SacI/NheI sites in the pGL2-Basic vector; hence pLΔ−5498 contains the entire cloned 5498-bp untranscribed regulatory region, 696-bp untranslated mRNA sequences, and 264 bp of the first exon of the human α1aAR gene fused to the luciferase reporter vector, pG2L-Basic. pLΔ−2869 and pLSΔ−2869 (−2869, +961) were generated by ligating two human α1aAR fragments, a 1839-bpHindIII (blunt-ended by digestion with Mung Bean nuclease digestion)/XhoI (−2869, −1030) fragment and a 1991-bpXhoI/AvrII (−1030, +961) fragment, intoSmaI/NheI sites in pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Enhancer vectors, respectively. pLΔ−1927 and pLSΔ−1927 (−1927, +961) were generated by ligating a 2888-bp AvrII (−1927, +961) human α1aAR fragment into NheI sites in pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Enhancer vectors, respectively. pLΔ−1927 Reverse and pLSΔ−1927 Reverse vectors were generated by digesting pLΔ−1927 and pLSΔ−1927 constructs with AvrII and NcoI (−1927, +1), respectively, blunting 5′-overhanging ends with Klenow (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and religating the blunted fragment into the blunted original vector. pLΔ−125 and pLSΔ−125 were generated by ligating a human α1aAR 1086-bpSacI/AvrII (−125, +961) intoSacI/NheI sites in the pGL2-Basic and pGL2-Enhancer vector, respectively. pLSΔ−5 and pLSΔ+39 were derived from pLSΔ−125 using PCR deletion. In brief, two PCR fragments (−5 to +392; +39 to +392) were amplified from the pLSΔ−125 construct, digested with SalI (restriction site incorporated into the 5′-PCR primer) and EcoRI (endogenous restriction site just upstream from +392), and religated intoSalI/EcoRI pLSΔ−125 vector sites. All constructs were sequenced to verify orientation and integrity of final nucleotide sequence. Transient transfection into human SK-N-MC cells was used to measure reporter gene expression. Prior to transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization, followed by centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C, 640 × g). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in PBS at a density of 1 × 107/ml cell suspension. Cells (0.5 ml; 5 × 106 total cells) were incubated with 8 μg of human α1aAR 5′-UTR deletion construct and 8 μg of control pCAT-control vector (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene placed under the control of SV40 promoter and enhancer sequences; Promega) in electroporation cuvettes for 10 min at room temperature. Transfection was accomplished using electroporation (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad; optimal conditions were 250–290 V and 550–950 microfarad capacity, resulting in a time constant of 12–15 ms). After electroporation, SK-N-MC cells were incubated in 100-mm plates for 96 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, followed by a 5-min incubation in 0.8 ml of lysis buffer (0.25 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature, and scraped into tubes. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C, 640 × g); 100 μl of cell extract (supernatant) was used for luciferase assays, 50 μl for CAT assays, and 10 μl to determine protein concentration with BCA reagents (Pierce). CAT assays were performed by the phase-extraction method as described previously (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

The final xylene phase was placed in a scintillation vial and resultant tritium activity counted by a scintillation counter. Luciferase activity was measured as described previously using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) (26Titus D. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. 2nd Ed.

Luciferase reaction buffer (44 μl; 0.125 mMgSO4, 42 mm ATP, 4.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 156 μl of 50 mm glycine (pH 7.8) were added to 100 μl of cell extracts and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Luminescence resulting from luciferase gene expression was measured by a luminometer (Lumat LB 9501; Berthold Systems, Inc., Aliquippa, PA). The reaction was initiated upon the addition of 100 μl of a 200 μm luciferin solution; measured luminescence was stable within 20–30 s. Final luciferase activity was normalized to CAT activity to control for transfection efficiency, and results were reported as -fold over basal control (pGL2-Basic or pGL2-Enhancer; Promega). Gel mobility shift assays were performed using two double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to DNA sequence immediately upstream of the human α1aAR main transcription initiation site (−74 to −3 (probe 1), and −146 to −89 (probe 2)) in buffer consisting of 12 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 35 mm KCl, 0.07 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm MgCl2, with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (to inhibit nonspecific protein binding). Probes 1 and 2 were created with 4–8 bp of 5′-overhanging sequence at the terminal ends; each probe was radiolabeled by filling in the 5′-overhanging DNA sequence using Klenow in the presence of [α-32P]dGTP and other nonradiolabeled nucleotides. Radiolabeled probes 1 and 2 (0.2 ng each) were incubated with purified Sp1 (1 footprinting unit; Promega, Milwaukee, WI) in 20 μl of gel mobility shift assay buffer and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. We synthesized the oligonucleotide from the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene known to bind Sp1 (5′-AGTTGATCGGGGCGGGGCGATCTA-3′) (30Swick A. Blake M. Kahn J. Azizkhan J.

In mouse, the activity of the Pax-3 paired domain is modulated by an alternative splicing event in the paired domain linker region that generates isoforms (Q+ and Q−) with distinct C-terminal subdomain-mediated DNA-binding properties. In this study, we have used derivatives of a classical high affinity paired domain binding site (CD19-2/A) to derive an improved consensus recognition sequence for the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain. This new consensus differs at six out of eight positions from the C-terminal subdomain recognition motif present in the parent CD19-2/A sequence, and includes a 5′-TT-3′ dinucleotide at base pairs 15 and 16 that promotes high affinity binding by both Pax-3 isoforms. However, with a less favorable guanine at position 15, only the Q− isoform retains high affinity binding to this sequence, suggesting that this alternative splicing event might serve to stabilize binding to suboptimal recognition sequences. Finally, mutagenic analysis of the linker demonstrates that both the sequence and the spacing in this region contribute to the enhanced DNA-binding properties of the Pax-3/Q− isoform. Altogether, our studies establish a clear role for the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain in DNA recognition and, thus, provide insights into an important mechanism by which Pax proteins achieve distinct target specificities.

Pax-3 belongs to a family of transcription factors that regulate a variety of developmental processes in vertebrates and invertebrates (1Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Pax-3 is expressed in a subset of neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages (2Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and is required for proper neural tube closure and neural crest cell migration (3Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and for the development of particular skeletal muscle lineages (4Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H.-H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development. 1994; 120: 603-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To interact with target genes, Pax-3 contains a paired domain, a conserved 128-amino acid DNA-binding domain (6Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) composed of two structurally distinct HTH 1The abbreviations used are: HTH, helix-turn-helix; Prd, paired; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SELEX,in vitro selection of optimal binding sites; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: HTH, helix-turn-helix; Prd, paired; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SELEX,in vitro selection of optimal binding sites; bp, base pair(s).-based subdomains joined by a short linker region, as revealed by crystallographic studies with a related family member, Drosophila Prd (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition to the paired domain with its bipartite structure, Pax-3, like Prd, also contains a second conserved DNA-binding domain, a paired-type homeodomain, which folds into a classical HTH-based structure (9Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and which binds cooperatively as a dimer to specific palindromic DNA sequences (10Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T,. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To complement the distinct DNA binding activities of the isolated domains, the paired domain and homeodomain of Prd can also cooperate to recognize specific composite binding sites with high affinity (11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction of Pax-3 with DNA targets has the potential to be quite complex, with up to three distinct HTH-based modules contributing to target site selection.Within Pax proteins, the N-terminal subdomain of the paired domain is highly conserved (12Walther C. Guenet J.-L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and it interacts with a well defined 10–12-bp consensus sequence through a series of base-specific major groove and minor groove contacts (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal subdomain in these proteins is more variable (12Walther C. Guenet J.-L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and its precise involvement in DNA recognition has not been extensively characterized. In the case of Prd, the C-terminal subdomain does not contact the 15-bp recognition sequence used for crystallization (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and appears to be dispensable both for DNA binding by Prd in vitro (11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for Prd function in vivo (13Bertuccioli C. Fasano L. Jun S. Wang S. Sheng G. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2673-2685PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion studies have shown that this subdomain is required for the recognition of a class of naturally occurring target sequences by members of at least three Pax subfamilies (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and in the case of human PAX6 (15Azuma N. Nishina S. Yanagisawa H. Okuyama T. Yamada M. Nature Genet. 1996; 13: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Tang H.K. Chao L.-Y. Saunders G.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the Caenorhabditis elegans Pax-6 homologuemab-18 (17Chisholm A.D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), point mutations in this subdomain lead to specific developmental disorders, suggesting that the C-terminal subdomain plays an important role in DNA recognition by some Pax proteins in vivo.Thus far, selection experiments in vitro with the Pax-3 paired domain have yielded a consensus recognition sequence which, by analogy with Prd, does not include a C-terminal subdomain recognition motif (18Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y.P. Maas R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether the C-terminal subdomain in Pax-3 contributes at all to sequence-specific DNA binding. In a preliminary study addressing this question, we recently described the DNA-binding properties of two alternatively spliced isoforms of Pax-3 (called Q+ and Q−), which differ by the presence or absence of a single glutamine residue in the paired domain linker region (20Vogan K.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6677-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This alternative splicing event was found to have no noticeable effect on the DNA-binding properties of the N-terminal subdomain of Pax-3; however, the novel isoform lacking the glutamine was found to exhibit a higher affinity for representative paired domain recognition sequences bearing consensus elements for both subdomains (20Vogan K.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6677-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that, in at least one naturally occurring Pax-3 isoform, the C-terminal subdomain is competent to bind DNA. However, the inability of either isoform of Pax-3 to bind to the Pax6-5a consensus (20Vogan K.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6677-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), a C-terminal subdomain recognition sequence derived using an alternatively spliced isoform of Pax6 defective in N-terminal subdomain binding (21Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal L. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 17: 2022-2034Crossref Scopus (317) Google Scholar), suggested that the C-terminal subdomain of Pax-3 may exhibit sequence preferences distinct from other Pax family members, and moreover, that such differences might be important for the discrimination of genomic targets by Pax-3 and other Pax proteins in vivo.In this study, we have used derivatives of CD19-2/A, a classical paired domain recognition sequence bearing consensus elements for both subdomains (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), to define an improved consensus for the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain, and to evaluate the contribution of this subdomain to the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of the Pax-3 paired domain. In addition, we have used these derivatives to further define differences in the DNA binding activities of the two alternatively spliced Pax-3 isoforms, and have used site-directed mutagenesis to probe the structural basis for these differences. Altogether, these studies establish a clear role for the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain in DNA recognition, suggesting that this subdomain may exert an important influence on the selection of DNA targets by Pax-3 within the developing embryo.DISCUSSIONThe ability of tissue-specific transcription factors to recognize specific DNA sequences within the regulatory regions of target genes is an important means of controlling gene expression. Faced with the enormous complexity of the genetic material present in living cells, DNA-binding proteins rely on a number of distinct mechanisms to achieve target specificity in vivo (30Nelson H.C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these is the use of complex DNA-binding domains, such as POU domains and zinc fingers, that achieve specificity through the coordinate use of multiple, structurally independent DNA-binding subdomains (30Nelson H.C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bipartite paired domain, which is composed of two distinct HTH-based subdomains joined by a short linker (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), is a well conserved DNA-binding structure present in a family of transcription factors controlling diverse developmental processes in a wide variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species (1Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The two helical subdomains and the extended linker region allow a single paired domain to interact with up to 20 base pairs of DNA, and together provide a large number of base-specific major groove and minor groove contacts that contribute to the recognition of specific DNA sequences as potential targets for regulation (6Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). However, with nine distinct Pax genes in mammals and seven in Drosophila, understanding how individual paired domains achieve distinct target specificities is an important step toward identifying the downstream targets of these transcription factors during development.While the binding specificity of the N-terminal subdomain has been defined for several members of the Pax family (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y.P. Maas R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 25Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the role of the C-terminal subdomain in DNA recognition has not been characterized as extensively. Significantly, the selection of optimal binding sites with isolated paired domains in vitro, including the Pax-3 paired domain, has often failed to define a consensus that extends far enough to include a recognition motif for the C-terminal subdomain (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, many naturally occurring paired domain recognition sequences identified within candidate target promoters are longer than the consensus sequences defined in vitro, and require a contribution from both subdomains for recognition (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A clear example of this is seen with Pax-2, where selection from a pool of random oligonucleotides defined a 13-bp consensus lacking a C-terminal subdomain recognition motif (25Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Maas R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the purification of Pax-2-bound complexes from native chromatin defined a 23-bp consensus with recognition motifs for both subdomains (31Phelps D.E. Dressler G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7978-7985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, in some instances, the role of the C-terminal subdomain in DNA recognition by Pax proteins may have been masked by the tendency of the N-terminal subdomain to dominate over the C-terminal subdomain in standard in vitro selection protocols.The recent discovery of an alternatively spliced isoform of Pax-3 with a higher affinity for full-length paired domain recognition sequences provided the first evidence that the C-terminal subdomain might influence the DNA-binding properties of the Pax-3 paired domain (20Vogan K.J. Underhill D.A. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6677-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To follow up these observations, we have generated derivatives of CD19-2/A, a well studied paired domain recognition bearing consensus binding motifs for both subdomains (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), to further evaluate the role of the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain in sequence discrimination. Since structural studies with Drosophila Prd had shown that the N-terminal subdomain makes contacts with base pairs 4 through 14 of the recognition sequence (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and since the Pax-3 N-terminal subdomain had been shown to select a consensus very similar to Prd in vitro (18Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Cheng J. Lam P.Y.P. Maas R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we tested the importance of sequences 3′ to this 10–12-bp N-terminal subdomain recognition motif for DNA recognition by Pax-3. Significantly, we find that the affinity of Pax-3 for derivatives of CD19-2/A is sensitive to single base substitutions in the C-terminal subdomain recognition motif. Moreover, a comparison between CD19-2/A (16G), the lowest affinity site identified in these studies (Fig. 2), and P3-C-OPT (15T), a sequence optimized to interact with the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 3), reveals that the affinity of Pax-3 for these two sequences differs by nearly two orders of magnitude. Since the N-terminal subdomain recognition motif is identical between these two sequences, this result demonstrates that the C-terminal subdomain makes a significant contribution to the DNA binding activity of the Pax-3 paired domain.In addition to establishing a clear DNA-binding function for the Pax-3 C-terminal subdomain, these studies also provide some interesting insights into the role of the C-terminal subdomain in contributing to paired domain DNA-binding specificity. As has been noted previously (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the high degree of conservation in the N-terminal subdomain among paired domains leads to the recognition of a very similar core sequence by divergent family members, raising the question of how these proteins are able to achieve distinct DNA-binding specificities in vivo. Significantly, the C-terminal subdomain in these proteins shows a much higher degree of sequence diversity, raising the possibility that this more divergent DNA-binding structure might be important means of discriminating between DNA targets (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Indeed, using our panel of singly substituted CD19-2/A derivatives, we do observe clear differences in specificity between the C-terminal subdomains of Pax-3 and Pax6, lending support to this hypothesis. The panel of CD19-2/A derivatives described herein may therefore serve as a useful tool for defining the distinct sequence preferences conferred by the C-terminal subdomain in other Pax family members.A comparison of the behavior of the naturally occurring isoforms of Pax-3 on the CD19-2/A derivatives has also provided us with a better understanding of the effect of this alternative splicing event on Pax-3 DNA recognition. In particular, we find that the presence of a 5′-TT-3′ dinucleotide at base pairs 15 and 16 significantly enhances DNA recognition by both isoforms. While the structural basis for these distinct sequence preferences is not known, we have shown that the recognition of these two base pairs is not affected by the presence of an additional residue at position 75 of the paired domain linker, or by the nature of the amino acid side chain at this position. We note also that in the paired domain crystal structure, the N-terminal portion of the linker is inserted into the minor groove, allowing residues 69–71 to interact with base pairs 12–14 of the recognition sequence (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In the light of our observations, it is possible that residues 72–74 may extend these minor groove contacts and interact with base pairs 15 and 16, contributing to the specificity observed at these positions.In contrast to the similar affinity of the two alternatively spliced isoforms of Pax-3 for derivatives of CD19-2/A bearing a 5′-TT-3′ dinucleotide at base pairs 15 and 16, the Q− isoform of Pax-3 demonstrates a significantly higher affinity for sequences bearing a suboptimal guanine at position 15. In this respect, it is interesting to note that many natural targets of Pax proteins deviate significantly from the optimal recognition sequences defined for these proteins in vitro (14Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 32Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 33Holst B.D. Wang Y. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1465-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enhanced recognition of suboptimal binding sites by the Q− isoform may therefore be an important activity in vivo, enabling this isoform to regulate a broader range of target genes than its Q+counterpart, or making it a more potent activator or repressor of some target genes recognized by both isoforms. However, further studies will be needed to clarify the biological relevance of this alternative splicing event with respect to Pax-3 function in the developing embryo.Despite significant advances in our understanding of the factors governing Pax-3/DNA interactions in vitro, little progress has been made thus far in the identification of actual targets of Pax-3 regulation in vivo. However, the evidence for a significant role for the C-terminal subdomain in DNA recognition, together with the previously established DNA binding activities of the homeodomain and N-terminal subdomain, suggests that the recognition of some genomic targets by Pax-3 may involve the coordinate use of all three HTH-based DNA-binding modules. Indeed, functional interdependence between the paired domain and homeodomain has been demonstrated recently for both Pax-3 (34Underhill D.A. Vogan K.J. Gros P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3692-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Underhill D.A. Gros P. J. Biol.

Development. 1996; 122: 2697-2707PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that cooperative interactions with other homeodomain-containing proteins (10Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T,. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or with members of the Ets family (38Fitzsimmons D. Hodsdon W. Wheat W. Maira S.-M. Wasylyk B. Hagman J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2198-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) may also contribute to the recognition of some genomic targets by Pax proteins, suggesting an additional mechanism influencing target selection by Pax-3 in vivo. Ultimately, a deeper knowledge of these and other mechanisms by which Pax-3 achieves DNA-binding specificity will be an important step toward defining the genetic pathways functioning downstream of Pax-3, and more broadly, will help us to understand how different Pax proteins are able to achieve unique target specificities in the developing embryo. Pax-3 belongs to a family of transcription factors that regulate a variety of developmental processes in vertebrates and invertebrates (1Noll M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Pax-3 is expressed in a subset of neuroectodermal and mesodermal lineages (2Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), and is required for proper neural tube closure and neural crest cell migration (3Epstein D.J. Vekemans M. Gros P. Cell. 1991; 67: 767-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and for the development of particular skeletal muscle lineages (4Bober E. Franz T. Arnold H.-H. Gruss P. Tremblay P. Development. 1994; 120: 603-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,5Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). To interact with target genes, Pax-3 contains a paired domain, a conserved 128-amino acid DNA-binding domain (6Chalepakis G. Fritsch R. Fickenscher H. Deutsch U. Goulding M. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 873-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 7Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan C.

Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition to the paired domain with its bipartite structure, Pax-3, like Prd, also contains a second conserved DNA-binding domain, a paired-type homeodomain, which folds into a classical HTH-based structure (9Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and which binds cooperatively as a dimer to specific palindromic DNA sequences (10Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T,. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To complement the distinct DNA binding activities of the isolated domains, the paired domain and homeodomain of Prd can also cooperate to recognize specific composite binding sites with high affinity (11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction of Pax-3 with DNA targets has the potential to be quite complex, with up to three distinct HTH-based modules contributing to target site selection. Within Pax proteins, the N-terminal subdomain of the paired domain is highly conserved (12Walther C. Guenet J.-L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and it interacts with a well defined 10–12-bp consensus sequence through a series of base-specific major groove and minor groove contacts (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal subdomain in these proteins is more variable (12Walther C. Guenet J.-L. Simon D. Deutsch U. Jostes B. Goulding M.D. Plachov D. Balling R. Gruss P. Genomics. 1991; 11: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), and its precise involvement in DNA recognition has not been extensively characterized. In the case of Prd, the C-terminal subdomain does not contact the 15-bp recognition sequence used for crystallization (8Xu W. Rould M.A. Jun S. Desplan C. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1995; 80: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and appears to be dispensable both for DNA binding by Prd in vitro (11Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for Prd function in vivo (13Bertuccioli C. Fasano L. Jun S. Wang S. Sheng G. Desplan C.

Numerous individual countercurrent heat exchangers are found throughout the massive tongue. These converge at the base of the tongue to form a bilateral pair of retia. Temperature measurements from the oral cavity of a live gray whale indicate that more heat may be lost through the blubber layer over the body than through the tongue, despite the fact that the tongue is far more vascularized and has much less insulation. These heat exchangers substantially reduce heat loss when these whales feed in cold waters."

Upon coexpression with a saturating amount of Kvβ1.2 and increasing levels of a noninactivating deletion mutant of Kvβ1.2, we show that macroscopic Kvα1.2 currents have levels of fractional inactivation and inactivation time constants that are intermediate between those obtained with either the inactivating Kvβ1.2 or the noninactivating Kvβ1.2 mutant. We also find that coexpression of Kvα1.2 with saturating amounts of Kvβ1.2 and the deletion mutant produces a population of single channels with properties intermediate to either the inactivating or noninactivating parental phenotype. Our data can best be explained by the presence of an intermediate population of heterooligomeric channels consisting of Kvα1.2 with different combinations of both types of subunits.

Biochemical data suggests dendrotoxin-sensitive K+channels exist as αβ complexes (1Parcej D.N. Scott V.E.S. Dolly O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, both noninactivating (Kvβ2) and inactivating Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1) have been found in complexes with Kv1.2 α-subunits (2Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1637-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that various combinations of inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits may exist in complexes with Kv1 α-subunit tetramers. The functional consequences of Kvβ heterooligomerization on Kvα1 currents has not been fully described. A recent study showed that the inactivation of a Shaker mutant produced by Kvβ1.2 can be removed by Kvβ2 leading to currents that were either inactivating or noninactivating (4Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intermediate levels of inactivation, although anticipated, were not observed. A model was proposed in which the Kv α-subunits exist as complexes with either Kvβ1 or Kvβ2 subunits. Binding of Kvβ2 to Kvβ1 was also reported, and it was suggested that this interaction might reduce the effective concentration of inactivating Kvβ1 subunits available for binding to Kvα1 subunits. To further investigate whether intermediate levels of inactivation might exist in the presence of both inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits, we coexpressed Kvα1.2, Kvβ1.2 and a noninactivating Kvβ1.2 N-terminal deletion mutant in Xenopus oocytes (5Accili E.A.

We used the mutant rather than Kvβ2, because differences in β-α binding could be excluded. Kvβ1 and Kvβ2 are homologous, but not identical, in the C terminus, the Kvβ region shown to bind to Kvα1 N termini (6Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We observed macroscopic currents with inactivation kinetics intermediate to either parental phenotype. Single channel analysis revealed a population of channels with kinetics spanning inactivating to noninactivating phenotypes. We also found that Kvβ1.2 and its deletion mutant could interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Thus, the deletion mutant, by reducing the effective concentration of Kvβ1.2, may have contributed to the production of intermediate inactivation as suggested by Xu and Li (4Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because noninactivating (Kvβ2) and inactivating Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1) have been found in complexes with Kvα1.2 and all three subunits may coexist cells (2Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4846-4860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that our single channel results may be the functional counterparts of such complexes. Some of the data have been presented in abstract form (9Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. Biophys J. 1997; 72: A349Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The Kvα1.2 cDNA was a gift from O. Pongs (Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Institut für Neurale Signalarbeitung, Hamburg, Germany). Kvβ1.2 was cloned as described previously (10Majumder K. De Biasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions were tested using the yeast GAL-4 matchmaker two-hybrid system fromCLONTECH. In-frame EcoRI andSalI sites were incorporated into the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the coding sequences of Kvβ1.2 (amino acids 1–408) and Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 (amino acids 21–408) by polymerase chain reaction for cloning into the yeast shuttle vectors, pGBT9 and pGAD424. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame for the yeast fusions and check that no unwanted polymerase chain reaction mutations were introduced. Protein-protein interactions were tested in the yeast host strainY190 by cotransformation with pairs of pGBT9 and pGAD424 fusion constructs. Cotransformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan (trp−) and leucine (leu−) after growth for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Representative colonies from these transformations were replated on trp−/leu− media to allow direct comparison of individual colonies. Transcription of the reporter gene,lacZ, was tested by a β-galactosidase filter assay. In vitro transcription of Kvα1.2, Kvβ1.2, and Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 cRNAs and injection intoXenopus oocytes were as described previously (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 construct was prepared as described previously (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique was used for measurement of macroscopicXenopus oocyte currents three to 5 days postinjection. Two to four days after injection, single channel recordings were performed in the cell-attached configuration using pipettes pulled from hard borosilicate glass with resistances of 5–10 MΩ. Pipettes were coated with Sylgard and fire-polished immediately before use. The seal resistance was 50–500 GΩ. Xenopus oocytes were always patched on the dark hemisphere. Two microelectrode voltage clamp measurements of Xenopus oocytes were performed in a low K+ solution containing (in mmol/liter): 5 KCl, 100 NaCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3) or a high K+ solution containing 50 KOH, 72.5 NMDG, 122.5 MES, 1The abbreviation used is: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). Single channel measurements were performed as described previously (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,6Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pipette solution for the single channel recordings had the low K+ composition. The bath solution in all single channel measurements contained (in mmol/liter): 100 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.3). All measurements were done at room temperature (20 °C). Single channel experiments were carried out as described previously (6Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). I–V protocols were performed to ensure that the investigated channel had the expected activation threshold and reversal potential. Measurements with only one channel in the patch were used for further investigation. From a holding potential of −80 mV, we measured 1000 test pulses to a potential of 70 mV at a frequency of two per second. Leak subtraction was done by averaging 10 null records and subtracting it from each trace as described previously (11Kiehn J. Lacerda A.E. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1151-1155Crossref Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz (−3 db, 4-pole Bessel filter) before digitalization at 10 kHz. PClamp software (Axon Instruments) was used for generation of the voltage-pulse protocols and for data acquisition. All single channel measurements were leak subtracted in Fetchan and analyzed using TRANSIT software (12VanDongen A.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This produced histograms for the open time, ensemble current traces, and values of open probability. The maximum likelihood method is utilized by TRANSIT to determine time constants from open time histograms. The data for open time from TRANSIT are presented on a log scale as described previously (12VanDongen A.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1303-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We tested whether Kvβ1.2 and a noninactivating form of Kvβ1.2, in which the N-terminal 20 amino acids were deleted, could interact using the yeast two-hybrid assay. This deletion had no effect on the ability of Kvβ1.2 to bind to the Kvα1.2 N terminus (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We found that Kvβ1.2 was able to interact with itself as well as with the NΔ20 deletion (Fig. 1). These results parallel the findings of Xu and Li (4Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) who showed that Kvβ2 can interact with itself and with Kvβ1.1. The results suggest that Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.2NΔ20 may exist as heterooligomers in the absence of Kvα1.2. We coexpressed Kvα1.2 with a saturating amount of Kvβ1.2 and amounts of Kvβ1.2NΔ20 (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), ranging from 0 to 100 ng. The Kvβ1.2 deletion mutant was used instead of Kvβ2 to exclude differences in binding affinities between Kvβs. The Xenopus oocyte expression system also allowed the delivery of mixed cRNAs to be measured accurately. In the presence of Kvβ1.2 alone inactivating currents were measured. The maximal amount of inactivation, calculated as the ratio of peak to steady state current was approximately 0.60–0.65 and was similar to that found previously (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 6Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing amounts of the deletion mutant progressively removed inactivation and slowed the rate of inactivation (Fig.2 A). A 1:4 ratio of the deletion mutant:Kvβ1.2 cRNAs was sufficient to completely remove inactivation. Addition of the deletion mutant also slowed activation (Fig. 2 A) and increased the rate of deactivation (not shown). Fig. 2, B and C, show the averaged values for rate of inactivation and fractional inactivation in the presence of increasing amounts of the deletion mutant and saturating amounts of Kvβ1.2. We have found similar effects on both fractional inactivation and inactivation time constants by simply decreasing Kvβ1.2 in the absence of the deletion mutant. Previously, we reported that fractional inactivation of Kvα1.2 went from from 0.66 (400 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA), to 0.57 (100 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA), to 0.19 (25 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA) (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here, we found that by reducing Kvβ1.2 cRNA inactivation time constants increased from 3.81 ± 0.13 ms (400 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA,n = 10 oocytes) to 5.16 ± 0.40 ms (100 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA, n = 8 oocytes), to 14.45 ± 3.54 ms (25 ng of Kvβ1.2 cRNA, n = 9 oocytes). Since we also found that Kvβ1.2 and the deletion mutant interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the deletion mutant may have exerted part or all of its effect on Kvα1.2 by binding and reducing the effective concentration of Kvβ1.2 in coexpression experiments. These results show that intermediate forms of inactivation may result from a mixture of inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits. The data do not distinguish among three possibilities: 1) a fully occupied mixed channel having four Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1.2 + deletion mutant = 4); 2) a partially occupied mixed channel (Kvβ1.2 + deletion mutant < 4); or 3) two populations of fully occupied channels, one having four inactivating Kvβ subunits and another having four noninactivating Kvβ subunits. To distinguish among the three possibilities presented above, we characterized the single channel properties of Kvα1.2 in the presence of saturating amounts of an equal mixture of Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ1.2-NΔ20 and compared these to single channels measured in the presence of either Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.2-NΔ20. Fig.3 shows open times (A) and open probabilities (B) of single channels recorded from three groups of oocytes injected with different cRNA combinations. Out of 29 patches from eggs injected with Kvα1.2 cRNA along with both Kvβ1.2 and the deletion mutant, 12 patches contained single channels with open time and open probability values more than 2 S.D. from the mean values for channels recorded from oocytes injected with either Kvβ1.2 or the deletion mutant. Single channels from five patches had values within 2 S.D. of the mean values for channels injected with only Kvβ1.2 and another set of six channels had values within 2 S.D. of the mean values for channels injected with only the Kvβ1.2 deletion mutant. Thus, the single channels resulting from this mixture of cRNAs had kinetic parameters spanning a range from inactivating to noninactivating parental phenotypes. When we used used open time, open probability, burst duration, and closed time to distinguish between groups, 14 of 29 channels measured fell into three separate populations (Fig.4). Fifteen channels had individual parameters that could not be classified neatly into any of the three defined groups possibly, because they possessed a combination of Kvβ subunits that altered certain kinetic parameters more than others. Fig.5 shows three examples of channels where all four kinetic parameters lie within one of the three defined groups described above.Figure 5Representative kinetics of three separate groups of single channels formed by coexpression of Kvα1.2 with both Kvβ1.2 and the Kvβ1.2-NΔ20.

The line of fit was generated using a maximum likelihood method as described previously (3Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The line of fit follows the data very closely at these longer times.G–I, corresponding open probabilities. Oocytes were held at −80 mV, and 1000 traces were recorded in the cell-attached configuration with 5 mm K+ in the pipette, during pulses to +70 mV of 100-ms duration at a frequency of 2 Hz. These individual channels were also representative of three separate groups based on burst duration (channel A = 16.55 ms; channel B = 3.58 ms; channel C = 1.47 ms) and closed time (channel A = 0.67 ms; channel B = 3.58 ms; channel C = 7.50 ms).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purpose of the present experiments was to determine whether macroscopic currents with intermediate inactivation kinetics could be obtained by expression of Kvα1.2 with a mixture of inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits and, if so, what the mechanisms might be. We found macroscopic currents with values of fractional inactivation and inactivation kinetics intermediate to the two phenotypes that result upon coexpression of Kvα1.2 with equal amounts of either Kvβ1.2 or its deletion mutant. Reducing the amount of Kvβ1.2, in the absence of the deletion mutant, also produced currents with intermediate kinetics. Taken together with our finding that Kvβ1.2 and the noninactivating mutant interact in the yeast two-hybrid assay, and with evidence that Kvα and Kvβ subunits exist in a 1:1 stoichiometry (1Parcej D.N. Scott V.E.S. Dolly O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11084-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the data suggest that the intermediate kinetics were produced by one, or a combination, of the following three channel complexes: 1) a fully occupied mixed channel (Kvβ1.2 + deletion mutant = 4); 2) a partially occupied mixed channel (Kvβ1.2 + deletion mutant < 4); or 3) two fully occupied populations of channels with either Kvβ1.2 or Kvβ1.2-NΔ20. Single channel analysis showed that three groups of single channels with distinct inactivation kinetics could be distinguished when Kvα1.2 was coexpressed with equal amounts of Kvβ1.2 and the deletion mutant. Two groups had kinetics identical to those of single channels formed from the expression of Kvα1.2 with a saturating amount of either Kvβ1.2 or the deletion mutant. A third group had inactivation kinetics significantly different from those of either parental group. The presence of an intermediate group of channels rules out the possibility that the intermediate kinetics of macroscopic currents were produced solely by two populations of fully occupied nonmixed channels. The single channels with intermediate kinetics must have been produced by a fully or partially occupied mixed channel. This extends the scheme of Xu and Li (4Xu J. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11728-11735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to include channel complexes not only fully occupied by either inactivating or noninactivating Kvβ subunits (Fig. 6, C andD), but also complexes fully or partially occupied by mixed combinations of α and β subunits (Fig. 6, A andB). Because both noninactivating (Kvβ2) and inactivating Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1) have been found in complexes with Kvα1.2, and all three subunits are likely to exist in the same cell (2Rhodes K.J. Keilbaugh S.A. Barrezueta N.X. Lopez K.L. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5360-5371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Scott V.E. Rettig J. Parcej D.N. Keen J.N. Findlay J.B. Pongs O. Dolly J.O.

However, further experiments will be required to determine precisely the subunit stoichiometry responsible for the intermediate single channel kinetics observed here. In summary, our results clearly demonstrate the existence of a population of single channels with intermediate inactivation kinetics. This functional evidence suggests multiple combinations of inactivating and noninactivating Kvβ subunits exist in complexes with Kv1 α-subunits. Since Kvβ subunits are also able to variably modify expression levels of Kv1 channels (5Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol.

This was due to an apparent masking of Rap1 as heat denaturation of the whole cell detergent extracts (5 min at 100 °C) resulted in equal immunoprecipitation of Rap1 with this epitope-specific antibody. The time-dependent change in Rap1 immunoreactivity was paralleled with an insulin-stimulated dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex. Similarly, EGF treatment also resulted in a time-dependent dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex that occurred concomitant with the masking of the 121–136 Rap1 epitope. Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, decreased both the basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII that directly correlated with the amount of CrkII that was immunoprecipitated with C3G. Together, these data suggest that insulin and EGF stimulation result in the dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex, thereby inducing an apparent conformation change in Rap1.

Ras is a low molecular weight (M r 21,000) GTP-binding protein that plays an essential role in cell proliferation and differentiation (1Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F.

Mutations that result in constitutive activation of Ras are associated with several types of neoplastic tissue in mammals, and expression of these alleles into cultured fibroblasts results in cellular transformation (3Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). The best characterized proximal downstream Ras target is the Raf serine/threonine kinase, which following growth factor stimulation, becomes activated upon association with GTP-bound Ras (4Moodie S.A.

This kinase phosphorylates the ERK family of mitogen-activated protein kinases on both threonine and tyrosine residues in a characteristic TEY motif. The subsequent activation of ERK provides an important bifurcation point for the stimulation of numerous signaling pathways, including metabolic, transcriptional, and mitogenic events (14Avruch J.

Opposing the Ras activation pathway, the low molecular GTP-binding protein Rap was originally observed to revert or suppress the transformed phenotype in Ki-Ras-transformed fibroblasts (18Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 19Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent antagonism between Ras and Rap function may reflect the ability of Rap and Ras to interact with the same downstream effectors, since these proteins share identical sequences within their respective effector domains (18Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 19Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A.

For example, several studies have demonstrated that both Rap and Ras can bind the same regulator (p120RasGAP) and effectors (RalGDS, Raf1, and B-Raf) in a GTP-dependent manner (21Frech M. John J.

In particular, association of Raf1 with GTP-bound Ras results in the activation of Raf1 protein kinase activity, whereas the association with GTP-bound Rap results in an inhibition of Raf1 protein kinase activity (25Vossler M.R.

Although the precise molecular details remained to be established, there is also substantial similarity in the upstream signaling mechanisms that regulate both Ras and Rap activation. Ras GTP binding is stimulated upon the targeting of the Ras guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS to the plasma membrane location of Ras (26Quilliam L.A. Huff S.Y. Rabun K.M. Wei W. Park W. Broek D.

In analogy, the formation of active GTP-bound Rap results from the specific interaction with the Rap guanylnucleotide exchange factor C3G (34Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M.

Similarly, the proline-rich regions of C3G are responsible for the association with the central SH3 domain of the small adapter protein, CrkII (35Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S.

Since Rap can function as a suppresser of Ras downstream signaling, we hypothesized that in order for growth factors to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, there must be a mechanisms to rapidly inhibit Rap function. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that insulin and EGF stimulation result in a rapid dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex that correlates with an apparent conformational change and/or masking of Rap1 immunoreactivity. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human insulin and EGF receptors (CHO/IR/ER) were isolated and cultured as described previously (39Holt K.H. Waters S.B. Okada S. Yamauchi K. Decker S.J.

Cells were incubated for 6–8 h in serum-free medium and then incubated with and without 100 nm insulin or 20 nm EGF at 37 °C for various times as indicated. In general, cell extracts were prepared by solubilization in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1.0 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (40Waters S.

In the case of Rap1 immunoprecipitations, the cell extracts were prepared by solubilization in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mmGTP, 0.1 mm GDP, 1 mm ATP, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (41Waters S.

Immunoprecipitations were performed from whole cell lysates by incubation with 2.0 μg of Rap1121–136 or C3G polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and washed as described above. The pellets were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer (0.188 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 15% (w/v) SDS, 15% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30:0.4 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed with monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) directed against Rap1, CrkII, and phosphotyrosine (PY20) or with a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) directed against C3G. Insulin and EGF have been well documented to stimulate Ras activation through the regulated exchange of GDP for GTP by the guanylnucleotide exchange factor SOS (42Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 43Downward J. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 87-100PubMed Google Scholar). Since we have been unable to develop a GTP binding assay for the endogenous Rap1 protein, we examined the ability of antibodies to detect potential conformational changes in Rap1. Insulin stimulation had no significant effect on the total amount of Rap1 protein that was detergent-solubilized in the whole cell extracts as detected by immunoblotting with a Rap1-specific monoclonal antibody (Fig.1, lanes 1–5). In contrast, we observed that insulin stimulation resulted in a marked reduction in the amount of Rap1 that was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody prepared against amino acids 121–136 of Rap1 (Fig. 1,lanes 6–10). This apparent time-dependent masking of the Rap1 epitope was detected following 1 min of insulin stimulation and was maximal between 5 and 15 min. To further demonstrate that the Rap1121–136 antibody was detecting a masking of the Rap1 epitope, we compared the ability of this antibody to immunoprecipitate detergent-solubilized and heat-denatured Rap1 (Fig. 2 A). Insulin stimulation for 15 min had no effect on the total amount of detergent extracted Rap1 protein as detected by immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the ability of the Rap1121–136 antibody to immunoprecipitate Rap1 was markedly decreased following 15 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). However, heat denaturation of the same extracts restored the ability of the Rap1121–136 antibody to immunoprecipitate identical amounts of Rap1 protein from both the unstimulated and insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and6). Similar to insulin, EGF stimulation for 15 min had no effect on the total amount of detergent extracted Rap1 protein (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation of the detergent extracts with the Rap1121–136 antibody demonstrated a marked reduction in the amount of Rap1 protein following EGF stimulation (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4). The decreased immunoreactivity of Rap1 was completely reversed following heat denaturation of the detergent cell extracts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). Together, these data demonstrate that growth factor stimulation (insulin and EGF) induced the masking of the Rap1121–136 amino acid epitope. Although we have not yet been able to determine whether this reflects a direct conformational change in Rap1 or is due to the association of Rap1 with another molecule that blocks this epitope, it is likely to represent the conversion of active GTP-bound Rap1 to the inactive GDP-bound state. We and others have also recently observed that the inactivation of Ras back to the GDP-bound state occurs concomitant with the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (41Waters S. Holt K.H. Ross S.E.

Biol. 1996; 16: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that the apparent conformational change and/or masking of Rap1 immunoreactivity might have resulted from the inactivation of Rap1 due to an uncoupling of the CrkII-C3G complex. To examine the association state of the CrkII-C3G complex, we next determined the effect of insulin and EGF on the co-immunoprecipitation of these complexes (Fig. 3). As expected, in unstimulated cells immunoprecipitation of C3G resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of CrkII (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). However, following insulin stimulation, there was a time-dependent decrease in the amount of CrkII that could be co-immunoprecipitated with C3G (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–6). The dissociation of CrkII from C3G was detectable as early as 1 min and was maximal between 3 and 5 min (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). The insulin-stimulated decrease of C3G immunoprecipitated CrkII protein was not due to differences in C3G immunoprecipitation as assessed by C3G immunoblotting of the C3G immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7–12). Furthermore, the time dependence of CrkII-C3G dissociation was similar to or slightly preceded the insulin-stimulated decrease in Rap1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1). In comparison, EGF stimulation also resulted in a rapid dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6). The time-dependent uncoupling of CrkII from C3G was similar to insulin with detectable dissociation following 1 min of EGF treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). The maximal EGF-stimulated dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex occurred between 3 and 5 min and was persistent for up to 30 min (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–6). As a control for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting with the C3G antibody demonstrated equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated C3G protein under each condition (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–12). These data are consistent with the CrkII-C3G complex functioning to maintain Rap1 in the active GTP-bound state, which is recognized by the Rap1121–136 epitope-specific antibody. However, the dissociation of the CrkII from C3G complex terminates this activation signal, thus allowing Rap1 to convert to the inactive GDP-bound state. Recently it has been observed that CrkII becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated following growth factor stimulation (47Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based upon these previous findings and the rapid insulin- and EGF-stimulated dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex, we next examined the potential role for the tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII. This was assessed by use of the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (Fig. 4). Phosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell detergent extracts demonstrated the insulin stimulation of IRS1/2 and insulin receptor β subunit tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1 and2). Genistein pretreatment of the cells reduced both the basal level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as well as decreased the extent of insulin-stimulated IRS1/2 and insulin receptor β subunit tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3 and4). It should be noted that genistein only partially inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, probably due to the high levels of insulin receptors expressed in this cell line. As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and6). Interestingly, a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the 120–130-kDa range was also found to co-immunoprecipitate with CrkII, which decreased following insulin treatment (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 6). In any case, genistein pretreatment inhibited both the basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkII as well as the tyrosine dephosphorylation of the 120–130-kDa band (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and 8). The relative tyrosine phosphorylation state of CrkII also correlated with the extent of association between CrkII and C3G (Fig.4 B). As observed previously, immunoprecipitation of C3G resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of CrkII, which was decreased following insulin stimulation (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and2). In the unstimulated cells, although pretreatment with genistein decreased the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated CrkII, there was an increase in the relative extent of CrkII that was co-immunoprecipitated with C3G (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Furthermore, genistein pretreatment also prevented the insulin-stimulated increase CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation and concomitantly inhibited the insulin-stimulated dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). As controls for immunoprecipitation, the amount of C3G immunoprecipitated under these conditions remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–8). Thus, these data indicated that the extent of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation was inversely related to the association state of the CrkII-C3G complex. In summary, we have observed that growth factor stimulation results in a rapid dissociation of the CrkII-C3G complex, which parallels or slightly precedes an apparent conformational change and/or masking of the Rap1121–136 amino acid epitope. Since the association state of CrkII with C3G appears to correlate with the extent of CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation, we speculate that receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of CrkII regulates this interaction. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether CrkII is a direct substrate of receptor tyrosine kinases, the site(s) of CrkII phosphorylation, and the functional role of this tyrosine phosphorylation in modulating the interaction between CrkII and C3G. In any case, based upon the ability of Rap1 to suppress Ras signaling, the ability of growth factors to activate the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade requires a mechanism for the inactivation of Rap1 function. Our data suggest that the growth factor-stimulated uncoupling of the CrkII-C3G complex may be one such mechanism. We thank Diana Boeglin for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2074415016,"The propeptides of the vitamin K-dependent proteins contain a γ-carboxylation recognition site that is required for γ-glutamyl carboxylation. To determine whether the propeptide is sufficient to direct carboxylation, two mutant prothrombin species were expressed and characterized with regard to posttranslational γ-carboxylation. A double point mutant, in which serine substituted for cysteines 17 and 22 disrupted a conserved loop formed by a disulfide bond, was fully carboxylated when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. A propeptide/thrombin chimeric protein, constructed by deleting the Gla, aromatic amino acid stack, and kringle domains of prothrombin, has the signal peptide and propeptide juxtaposed to a glutamate-rich COOH-terminal region of prothrombin, residues 249–530. Of the 8 glutamic acid residues contained within the first 40 residues of the NH2terminus adjacent to the propeptide, at least seven were fully carboxylated as demonstrated by direct γ-carboxyglutamic acid analysis of the alkaline hydrolysate and by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. These results indicate that the γ-carboxylation recognition site within the prothrombin propeptide in a prothrombin propeptide-thrombin chimeric protein is sufficient to direct γ-carboxylase-catalyzed carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acid residues in a glutamate-rich region of thrombin that is not normally γ-carboxylated. Furthermore, the disulfide loop in the Gla domain of prothrombin is not required for complete carboxylation.

Of the 8 glutamic acid residues contained within the first 40 residues of the NH2terminus adjacent to the propeptide, at least seven were fully carboxylated as demonstrated by direct γ-carboxyglutamic acid analysis of the alkaline hydrolysate and by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. These results indicate that the γ-carboxylation recognition site within the prothrombin propeptide in a prothrombin propeptide-thrombin chimeric protein is sufficient to direct γ-carboxylase-catalyzed carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acid residues in a glutamate-rich region of thrombin that is not normally γ-carboxylated. Furthermore, the disulfide loop in the Gla domain of prothrombin is not required for complete carboxylation. The vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation and regulatory proteins belong to a class of calcium-binding proteins that play an essential role in the initiation and regulation of blood coagulation. These proteins, which include prothrombin, Factor VII, Factor IX, Factor X, protein C, and protein S, are synthesized in the liver in precursor forms (for review, see Ref. 1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). These precursors are comprised of a signal peptide and a propeptide NH2-terminal to the mature protein sequence (2Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The precursor proteins undergo extensive posttranslational modification, including γ-carboxylation of the 10–12 most NH2-terminal glutamic acid residues (3Stenflo J. Fernlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar,4Nelsestuen G.L. Zytkovicz T.H. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6347-6350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the polypeptide substrate, γ-carboxylation requires the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, molecular oxygen, CO2, and reduced vitamin K (5Suttie J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 459-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Although the carboxylase resides in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, carboxylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Carlisle T.L. Suttie J.W.

Cell. 1988; 53: 505-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In the presence of metal ions, these proteins undergo conformational changes essential to the expression of membrane-binding properties and coagulant activity (8Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol.

In addition a γ-carboxylation recognition site is found within the mature sequence of matrix Gla protein, a γ-carboxylated protein found in bone (18Price P.A. Fraser J.D. Metz-Virca G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The interaction of the carboxylase with the propeptide of a vitamin K-dependent protein has been used as a strategy for γ-carboxylase purification (19Hubbard R.R. Ulrich M.M.W. Jacobs M. Walsh C.

The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, comprised of 758 amino acids in a single polypeptide chain, contains the carboxylase active site (25Kuliopulos A. Nelson N.P. Yamada M. Walsh C.T. Furie B.

Furie B.C. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) within the NH2-terminal third of the protein. However, a recent report suggests that the propeptide-binding site on the carboxylase is located on the COOH-terminal two-thirds of the enzyme (27Wu S.-M. Mutucumarana V.P. Geromanos S. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11718-11722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), while a preliminary study based on the yeast two-hybrid system concludes, as does Yamada et al. (26Yamada M. Kuliopulos A. Nelson N.P. Roth D.A. Furie B. Furie B.C. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), that the propeptide binds to the NH2-terminal third of the enzyme (28Brown M.A. MacGillvary R.T.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 639AGoogle Scholar). Synthetic oligopeptides and polypeptides incorporating the propeptide sequences are low K m substrates for in vitrocarboxylation, in contrast with substrates lacking the propeptide (29Ulrich M.M.W.

Expression of mutants containing point mutations within the γ-carboxylation recognition site has shown this recognition element in prothrombin or Factor IX to be defined by residues −18, −17, −16, −15, and −10, with phenylalanine −16 playing a critical role (16Jorgensen M.J.

Sudmeir J.L. Furie B.C. Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9835-9841Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), stimulates carboxylation of FLEEL in the in vitro carboxylase assay (34Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Others have proposed that a second recognition site might reside within the mature sequence of the nascent vitamin K-dependent protein polypeptide. Castellino and colleagues proposed a Gla domain consensus sequence, E16 XXXE20 XC22, common to the vitamin K-dependent proteins (35Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Disruption of cysteine 22 by site-specific mutagenesis was associated with the expression of incompletely carboxylated recombinant protein C in a mammalian expression system (35Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In their expression system, Zhanget al. observed incomplete carboxylation of recombinant protein C in which glutamic acid residues in the Gla domain were systematically mutated (35Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10828-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 64Zhang L. Jhingan A. Castellino F.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 942-952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This necessitated purification of the fully carboxylated mutant protein C subpopulation prior to functional characterization. In contrast, we prepared ten mutants of prothrombin in which each of the glutamic acid residues in the Gla domain were modified to aspartic acid (37Ratcliffe J.V. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24339-24345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of these mutant prothrombins generated fully carboxylated protein. These results may relate to differences in the synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent proteins or differences in the heterologous mammalian expression systems employed. The γ-carboxylation recognition site and the Gla domain are encoded by a single exon within the genes of the vitamin K-dependent proteins (38Asakai R. Davie E.W. Chung D.W.

Although the propeptide and the Gla domain may be considered as separate albeit functionally related elements, it is not known whether the propeptide of a vitamin K-dependent protein appended to the mature amino terminus of an irrelevant polypeptide will direct γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in the adjacent sequence. To begin to address this question, we generated two mutant forms of prothrombin. In the double point mutant, a loop defined by a disulfide bond is disrupted. In a chimeric protein, the prothrombin propeptide and the first three amino-terminal residues of the prothrombin sequence are linked directly to a glutamate-rich region of thrombin, from residue 249 to 530 of the prothrombin sequence. In this construct, the Gla, aromatic amino acid stack, and kringle domains of prothrombin are deleted. Expression of these proteins in Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded fully carboxylated proteins. We conclude that the γ-carboxylation recognition site on the propeptide is sufficient to direct in vivo carboxylation of adjacent glutamic acid residues in the absence of the disulfide loop of the Gla domain and within the context of an amino acid sequence within thrombin that is not normally γ-carboxylated. The cDNA encoding a deletion mutant of prothrombin lacking residues 4–248 was constructed in pMT2-PT (47Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Furie B.C. Furie B. Shoemaker C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9622-9628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis (49Oostra B.A. Harvey R. Ely B.K. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1983; 304: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A heteroduplex form of pMT2-PT, containing a single-stranded deletion of the first 1316 base pairs in the 5′-coding sequence of prothrombin was created. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer and were gel-purified prior to use. The 27-base synthetic mutagenic primer, 5′-GGCGAGCCAACACCGAGGAGGCCGTGG, was composed of blocks of 14 and 13 bases complementary to the regions to be joined in the desired 735-base pair-deleted mutant. The oligonucleotide was 5′-phosphorylated, and 10 μl (50 pmol) of the oligonucleotide was mixed with 30 μl (0.1 pmol) of the heteroduplex mixture, and 3.3 μl of 0.5 m NaCl was added. The annealing reaction was carried out by heating to 68 °C for 10 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. The primer was extended and joined to the existing partial second strand during overnight incubation at room temperature. After inactivating the enzymes 2 μl of this DNA was used to transform the TG1 strain ofEscherichia coli and plasmids containing the desired mutation were identified by colony hybridization using32P-labeled mutagenic oligonucleotide. Successive transformations produced a single positive colony that was selected as the source of plasmid DNA. The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequence analysis (50Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA (20 μg) was used for CHO 1The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cell transfection. The cDNA encoding the prothrombin mutant containing the cysteine to serine substitutions at positions 17 and 22 was constructed using the same heteroduplex described for pMT2-PT/(Δ4,248). The mutagenesis was carried out as above using the 28-base synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGAGAGTCGGTCGAGGAGACCAGCAGC. The presence of the desired mutations was verified by DNA sequence analysis (50Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids containing the wild-type, chimeric or mutant cDNAs were linearized at the ClaI site in the plasmid. DNA (20 μg) was transfected by electroporation into 2.6 × 106 dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cells, CHODUKX-B11 (51Chasin G. Urlaub L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4216-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), previously shown to carboxylate recombinant wild-type prothrombin under the expression conditions employed (48Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visible colonies were isolated using cloning rings and reestablished in cell culture. Cell supernatants were analyzed for expression of the recombinant protein by dot blot analysis using polyclonal immunoaffinity-purified antiprothrombin antibodies (10Borowski M. Furie B.C. Bauminger S. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14969-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and positive clones expanded. Recombinant wild-type prothrombin, PT/(CS17,22), and PT/(Δ4,248) were isolated from 2 liters of cell supernatant. The cell supernatants were applied to an immunoaffinity column derivatized with rabbit antiprothrombin antibodies directed against the metal-independent conformer of prothrombin (10Borowski M. Furie B.C. Bauminger S. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14969-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each mutant was prepared on a dedicated column that was not used to isolate any other prothrombin species. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C. After loading the matrix and washing with borate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, the prothrombin species were eluted with 4 mguanidine HCl and dialyzed at 4 °C against Tris-buffered saline. The concentrations of purified recombinant prothrombin species were measured by radioimmunoassay (53Blanchard R.A. Furie B.C. Kruger S.F. Waneck G. Jorgensen M.J. Furie B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 242-255PubMed Google Scholar) and the purity of the preparations established by polyacrylamide electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions (54Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by the method of Barenholz et al. (55Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson E. Carlson F.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). The final concentration of phospholipid was determined by elemental phosphorus (56Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). The phospholipid vesicles were stored under nitrogen and used within a week. The binding of the prothrombin species to phospholipid vesicles was determined by gel filtration using a Pharmacia S-12 FPLC column (1 × 30 cm). The column was equilibrated in 0.5m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mmCaCl2, 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.025% NaN3. The prothrombin species were labeled, where indicated, with 125I using the lactoperoxidase method. The radiolabeled proteins and phospholipid vesicles were applied to the column and the column developed with the equilibration buffer. The effluent was monitored by phosphorus analysis and/or assay of125I. Prothrombin coagulant activity was measured using prothrombin-deficient plasma in a two-stage assay (53Blanchard R.A. Furie B.C. Kruger S.F. Waneck G. Jorgensen M.J. Furie B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1983; 101: 242-255PubMed Google Scholar). Purified plasma-derived prothrombin of known concentration was used as a standard. Recombinant proteins were desalted by high pressure liquid chromatography prior to analysis. Automated Edman degradation was performed on a Milligen model 6600 ProSequencer (Milligen/Biosearch) or an Applied Biosystems Procise HT protein sequencer. In sequencing experiments in which γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues were identified and quantitated, γ-carboxyglutamic acid was directly identified as the methyl ester by the method of Cairnset al. (57Cairns J.R. Williamson M.K. Price P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All peptide carboxyl groups were methyl-esterified using methanolic HCl. Phenylthiohydantoin-Gla(OMe)2 was identified by HPLC of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Mass spectral analysis was performed on a Voyager Linear matrix-assisted laser dissorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems) in positive ion mode. Under these conditions, γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing proteins are decarboxylated. Determination of the γ-carboxyglutamic acid content of proteins was performed by the method of Kotkow (58Kotkow K.J. Roth D.A. Porter T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as a modification of the method of Kuwada and Katayama (59Kuwada M. Katayama K. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The high pressure liquid chromatography system consisted of a Beckman model 126 pump and an Applied Biosystems Spectroflow 980 fluorescence detector equipped with a 418-nm band-pass filter. The excitation monochromator of the fluorescence detector was set at 240 nm. Separations were performed isocratically at room temperature. The mobile phase consisted of equal volumes of 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.28) and acetonitrile run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Protein samples were purified by HPLC using an Aquapore C4 300 A reversed phase cartridge (Brownlee Laboratories) prior to amino acid analysis. Lyopholized plasma-derived and recombinant protein samples were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis (58Kotkow K.J. Roth D.A. Porter T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Amino acid standards and samples were derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (58Kotkow K.J. Roth D.A. Porter T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 435-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test whether a consensus sequence required for the process of in vivoγ-carboxylation exists within the amino terminus of the Gla domain of the vitamin K-dependent proteins, point mutations in the wild-type prothrombin cDNA were made to mutate cysteine to serine at positions 17 and 22. The desired outcome of these mutations was a disruption in the six-membered disulfide loop that is highly conserved among proteins that undergo posttranslational γ-carboxylation and alteration of the consensus sequence, E16 XXXE20 XC22, hypothesized to play a role in directing γ-carboxylation (35Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the mutant protein, PT/(CS17,22), was ligated into the expression vector pMT2 and the plasmid used to transfect CHO cells. The mutant prothrombin, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). The migration of the band was consistent with a molecular weight identical to that of prothrombin at 72,000. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the first 25 residues verified that propeptide cleavage had occurred and that the cysteine to serine mutations at amino acid positions 17 and 22 were present. Direct γ-carboxyglutamic acid analysis of this protein revealed it to be completely carboxylated when compared with plasma-derived and wild-type recombinant prothrombin (TableI). This mutant protein, despite complete γ-carboxylation, did not bind to phospholipid vesicles using assay conditions under which plasma-derived and wild-type recombinant prothrombin bound completely (Table II). In contradistinction to recombinant wild-type prothrombin, PT/(CS17,22) had no coagulant activity. These results indicate that the disulfide loop and the conserved sequence E16 XXXE20 XC22are not components of the γ-carboxylation recognition site in prothrombin but are required for protein function.Table Iγ-Carboxyglutamic acid content of prothrombin mutantsγ-Carboxyglutamic acidTheoreticalObtainedmol/mol proteinRecombinant wild-type prothrombin1010.2 ± 1.5PT/(CS17,22)109.5 ± 0.5PT/(Δ4,248)87.5 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Table IIProperties of PT/(CS17,22)Clotting activity2-aPercent of activity compared with plasma-derived prothrombin.Phospholipid bindingBinding to conformationspecific antibodies2-b[(μg/ml antigen determined using antibodies specific for the metal-dependent conformer)/(μg/ml antigen determined using conformation-independent antibodies)] × 100.%%%Prothrombin2-cRecombinant wild-type prothrombin.9480100PT/(CS17,22)<180.022-a Percent of activity compared with plasma-derived prothrombin.2-b [(μg/ml antigen determined using antibodies specific for the metal-dependent conformer)/(μg/ml antigen determined using conformation-independent antibodies)] × 100.2-c Recombinant wild-type prothrombin. Open table in a new tab The propeptide, containing the γ-carboxylation recognition site, is required for posttranslational carboxylation. To determine whether this recognition element issufficient to direct carboxylation in a model system, we expressed a mutant form of prothrombin in which the Gla domain, aromatic amino acid stack domain, and the kringle domains (residues 4–248) were deleted, thus placing the prothrombin propeptide adjacent to a series of 8 glutamic acid residues within the first 40 residues of the serine protease domain (Fig. 2). These glutamic acids are not normally carboxylated and are distant from the propeptide and γ-carboxyglutamic acid-containing domain in prothrombin. The sequence context of these glutamic acids is unrelated to that of the Gla domain of prothrombin or other known vitamin K-dependent proteins. The cDNA encoding PT/(Δ4,248) was ligated into the expression vector pMT2, the plasmid transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells and the mutant protein expressed. The protein, purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography, was analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. A dominant band (>90%) with a molecular weight of about 44,000 and a minor band of about 39,000 were observed (Fig.3). The molecular mass of the protein, determined by matrix-assisted laser dissorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, is 40,169 ± 400 daltons. The protein is decarboxylated during analysis so that the molecular mass of the carboxylated protein (see below) is 40,477 or 40,521 ± 400 daltons. Western blot analysis of PT/(Δ4,248), using antiprothrombin antibodies, shows that both bands on the SDS-gel expressed antigenic determinants common to prothrombin, as expected. The major band of 44,000 and a second band of lower intensity and molecular weight were stained.Figure 3SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of the PT/(Δ4,248). Lanes A and B, SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Lanes C and D, Western blot developed with antiprothrombin:total antibodies which recognize prothrombin independent of its conformation. Proteins were electrophoresed in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Lanes A and C, PT/(Δ4,248); lanes B andD, plasma-derived prothrombin. All protein samples were reduced with β-mercaptoethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Direct γ-carboxyglutamic acid analysis of the alkaline hydrolysate of the purified protein revealed the presence of 7.5 ± 0.2 mol of γ-carboxyglutamic acid/mol of protein (Table I). Eight glutamic acid residues are located within the first 40 residues of the propeptide in this mutant protein. The amino-terminal sequence of the methyl-esterified protein was determined by automated Edman degradation and revealed the expected amino acid sequence (Table III). γ-Carboxyglutamic acid residues were observed at cycles 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 24, thus indicating the carboxylation of 7 glutamic acid residues. This carboxylation appears complete in that no glutamic acid was detected. Given the amount of material available and the repetitive yield of the Edman degradation, we were unable to directly analyze the protein sequence beyond cycle 24. Thus, we are unable to comment on the carboxylation status of the glutamic acids at residue 31 and residue 45 of the chimeric protein.Table IIINH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence analysis of PT/(Δ4,248)PT/(Δ4,248), residue predictedResidue observedPicomoles1AlaAla36.42AsnAsn29.83ThrThr24.64GlaGla13.05GlaGla15.16AlaAla25.47ValVal25.58GlaGla10.59GlaGla12.310GlaGla13.211ThrThr10.812GlyGly30.213AspAsp12.414Gly ?15Leu ?16Asp ?17GlaGla8.818AspAsp12.219SerSer12.820Asp ?21ArgArg16.522AlaAla12.523IleIle24GlaGla4.6The extinction coefficient for phenylthiohydantoin-Gla was assumed to be equivalent to phenylthiohydantoin-Glu. Open table in a new tab The extinction coefficient for phenylthiohydantoin-Gla was assumed to be equivalent to phenylthiohydantoin-Glu. The prothrombin propeptide/thrombin chimera PT/(Δ4,248), which contains a glutamate-rich region of thrombin directly adjacent to the γ-carboxylation recognition site of the prothrombin propeptide, allowed us to test the hypothesis that the propeptide could direct thein vivo carboxylation of a polypeptide chain containing glutamic acid residues within close proximity of the propeptide. Indeed, this mutant protein was well carboxylated, containing 7–8 γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues/protein molecule. The theoretical number of carboxylatable glutamic acid residues in PT/(Δ4,248) was uncertain since the distance from the γ-carboxylation recognition site to a substrate glutamate has not been defined for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. In the naturally occurring vitamin K-dependent blood clotting and regulatory proteins, glutamic acid residues included between residue 6 and residue 40 of the mature NH2 terminus are carboxylated. There are no glutamic acid residues between positions 1 and 5 or beyond 40 that are modified. In the precursor form of PT/(Δ4,248), the first two glutamic acids appear at positions 4 and 5, and there is a glutamic acid at position 45. There is no precedent for carboxylation of residues in these positions in the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting and regulatory proteins. In addition, residues 8, 9, and 10 are all glutamic acids. Since no naturally occurring vitamin K-dependent protein has three adjacent γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues, it is not known whether all three adjacent glutamic acid residues can be carboxylated. Therefore, the expected number of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in PT/(Δ4,248) was between five and nine. Thus, our demonstration that the mutant contains 7–8 γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues and that residues 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, and 24 are fully carboxylated, within experimental error, indicates that three adjacent glutamic acid residues can undergo full carboxylation in vivo and that a glutamic acid at residue 4 is also a substrate for the carboxylase. Given the presence of an uncarboxylated glutamic acid residue at residue 2 in conantokin G (60Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6025-6029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a partially carboxylated glutamic acid in matrix Gla protein that is NH2-terminal of the carboxylation recognition site (14Price P.A. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14971-14975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), additional work is necessary to understand the other details of the specificity of the carboxylase for substrate peptides containing glutamic acid. It has been previously established that the propeptides of vitamin K-dependent proteins are required for γ-carboxylation (16Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Brown C.L. Shoemaker C.B. Furie B. Cell. 1987; 48: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 17Foster D.C. Rudinski M.S. Schach B.G. Berkner K.L. Kumar A.A. Hagen F.S. Sprecher C.A. Insley M.Y. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7003-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The current studies were undertaken to determine whether the propeptide of these proteins was sufficient to direct carboxylation. It has been proposed that in addition to conserved structures in the propeptide a conserved sequence in the mature amino termini of these proteins, E16 XXXE20 XC22, may be necessary as a recognition element in designating the vitamin K-dependent proteins as substrates for γ-carboxylation. Zhang and Castellino (35Zhang L. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6696-6704Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that mutations in the consensus sequence, E16XXXE20XC22, glutamic acid 19 and 20 to aspartic acid or cysteine 22 to serine in protein C yielded mutant protein C species in which only about 20% of the former and about 15% of the latter molecules were well carboxylated when expressed in 293 cells, a human embryonal kidney cell line. They suggest that the E16 XXXE20 XC22may act as a second recognition element for the carboxylase in addition to the γ-carboxylation recognition site in the propeptide. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the propeptide alone is sufficient to direct complete carboxylation of two prothrombin mutants. The prothrombin mutant, PT/(Δ4,248), does not contain the consensus sequence E16 XXXE20 XC22proposed as a second recognition element for carboxylation and yet it is well carboxylated. In addition, PT/(CS17,22) was fully carboxylated when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. It lacks the disulfide loop proposed as a component of this second recognition element. Based on the above results, we conclude that the propeptide may be sufficient to direct carboxylation of adjacent glutamate residues regardless of the sequence context of these residues. The efficiency of carboxylation may vary with different proteins, but we do not currently understand the motifs necessary for the most efficient carboxylation. For example, we have observed efficient carboxylation of human prothrombin (48Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6729-6734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but less efficient carboxylation of human Factor IX (47Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Furie B.C. Furie B. Shoemaker C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9622-9628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have created chimeric vitamin K-dependent proteins in which domains remote from the Gla region of the proteins have been either deleted or exchanged. Replacement of the second epidermal growth factor domain and serine protease domains of Factor IX with those from Factor X leads to a chimera in which the Gla domain of Factor IX is well carboxylated (62Hertzberg M.S. Ben-Tal O. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Factor X in which the first epidermal growth factor domain has been replaced with the first epidermal growth factor domain of Factor IX is only about 15% carboxylated. 2T. Porter, B. Furie, and B. C. Furie, unpublished results. Prothrombin mutants in which either the first kringle domain or both kringle domains are deleted are only 40–50% carboxylated (63Kotkow K.J. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15633-15639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the phenomena observed in the protein C mutations is related to our observation of the relationship of structures in the mature proteins to the efficiency of carboxylation. While the efficiency with which substrates containing the propeptide are carboxylated may be dependent upon complex structural aspects of the substrate, the propeptide containing the γ-carboxylation recognition site may be sufficient to designate a protein as a substrate for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase and to direct the synthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid. Analysis of the propeptide-mediated in vivo carboxylation of protein substrates containing sequences irrelevant to the vitamin K-dependent proteins should further understanding of the γ-glutamyl carboxylase-substrate interaction. We are especially grateful to Dr. Johan Stenflo for performing the protein sequence analysis on the methyl-esterified chimeric protein. We also thank Glenn A. Merrill-Skoloff for technical assistance."

The locus was isolated by chromosome walking a physical distance of 65-kilobase pairs from the brlA gene and defines a single transcript that encodes, most likely, a difunctional protein with two catalytic domains, CNXA and CNXC. Mutations (cnxA) affecting the CNXA domain, mutants (cnxC) in the CNXC domain, and frameshift (cnxB) mutants disrupting both domains have greatly reduced levels of precursor Z compared with the wild type. The CNXA domain is similar at the amino acid level to the Escherichia coli moaA gene product, while CNXC is similar to the E. coli moaC product, with both E. coli products encoded by different cistrons. In the wild type, precursor Z levels are 3–4 times higher in nitrate-grown cells than in those grown on ammonium, and there is an approximately parallel increase in the 2.4-kilobase pair transcript following growth on nitrate, suggesting nitrate induction of this early section of the pathway. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of several mutants has identified residues critical for the function of the protein. In the CNXA section of the protein, insertion of three amino acid residues into a domain thought to bind an iron-sulfur cofactor leads to a null phenotype as judged by complete loss of activity of the molybdoenzyme, nitrate reductase. More specifically, a mutant has been characterized in which tyrosine replaces cysteine 345, one of several cysteine residues probably involved in binding the cofactor. This supports the proposition that these residues play an essential catalytic role. An insertion of seven amino acids between residues valine 139 and serine 140, leads to a temperature-sensitive phenotype, suggesting a conformational change affecting the catalytic activity of the CNXA region only. A single base pair deletion leading to an in frame stop codon in the CNXC region, which causes a null phenotype, effectively deletes the last 20 amino acid residues of the protein, indicating that these residues are necessary for catalytic function.

Cambridge Press, Cambridge, UK1989: 33-58Google Scholar) first isolated mutants defective in the synthesis of the molybdenum pterin cofactor. Using the lower eukaryotic model, the ascomycetous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, they isolated a class of chlorate-resistant mutants, which were unable to utilize either nitrate or purines such as adenine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine as sole sources of nitrogen. This inability to grow on nitrate and hypoxanthine was due to the pleiotropic loss of NADPH-nitrate reductase and NADH-xanthine dehydrogenase (purine hydroxylase I) activity, respectively. They speculated that such mutants were defective in the synthesis of a cofactor common to both nitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase and accordingly designated the mutants cnx (common component fornitrate reductase and xanthine dehydrogenase). Five cnx loci (namely cnxABC, cnxE,cnxF, cnxG, and cnxH) were originally observed by Pateman et al. (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) on the basis of complementation tests in heterokaryons grown with nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. Later, a sixth locus, cnxJ, was identified, albeit with a different growth phenotype by Arst et al.(7Arst Jr., H.N. Tollervey D.W. Sealy-Lewis H.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 1083-1093PubMed Google Scholar). The cnxABC locus showed a complex overlapping pattern of complementation, i.e. growth on nitrate in heterokaryon combinations of different pairwise (cnxA,cnxB, cnxC) mutant backgrounds (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Hartley M.J. Genet. Res. 1970; 16: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mutants in cnxA and cnxC phenotypically complement each other, vis à vis growth ofcnxA/cnxC heterokaryons on nitrate as a sole nitrogen source, while cnxB mutants fail to complement eithercnxA or cnxC mutants. Since cnxA,cnxB, and cnxC mutants were shown to be genetically tightly linked, it was unclear whether cnxABCconsisted of one gene in which cnxA and cnxCmutants exhibited intragenic complementation or two distinct genes,cnxA and cnxC, with cnxB mutants lacking both activities. Virtually nothing is known about the function of the A. nidulans cnx genes and their role in the synthesis of the molybdopterin cofactor. We describe here the molecular and biochemical characterization of cnxABC, the first cloned A. nidulans cnx locus reported thus far. The wild-type strain used was G051 (biA1). Strains α8 (biA1 cnxA9), G055 (biA1 cnxB11), α23 (yA2 wA3 cnxC2), and G832 (yA2 pyroA4 cnxC3) were mutants described originally by Pateman and Cove (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Strains GH140 (biA1 cnxA140ts), GH95 (yA2 pyroA4 cnxA95), GH1281 (biA1 cnxB1281) and GH2O4 (biA1 cnxB204) were selected in this study on the basis of resistance to 150 mm chlorate as described by Cove (9Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 1G. J. M. M. Kanan, unpublished observations. cnxA95and cnxB204 were selected on 10 mm glutamate,cnxA140 ts with 10 mm proline andcnxB1281 with 5 mm uric acid all as sole nitrogen sources. The cnxA95, cnx204, andcnxB1281 mutations were generated usingN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, while cnxA140 ts was synthesized after 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane chemical mutagenesis (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Assignment of mutations to cnx loci was carried out by the heterokaryotic complementation test, i.e. growth of pairwise heterokaryons on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source against the representativecnx mutants, cnxA9, cnxB11,cnxC3, cnxE3, cnxF7, cnxG4, and cnxH4, as described by Pateman et al. (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The temperature-sensitive mutant cnxA140 ts shows mutant phenotypes of resistance to chlorate and nongrowth on nitrate as the sole nitrogen source at 37 °C but near wild type phenotypes of sensitivity to chlorate and growth on nitrate at 25 °C with a mutant phenotype on hypoxanthine at both temperatures. Additionally, this mutant has a wild-type nitrate reductase temperature stability profile from cells grown at the permissive temperature of at 25 °C.1 Standard Aspergillus growth media, handling techniques (10Clutterbuck A.J. King R.C. Handbook of Genetics. 1. Plenum Publishing, New York1974: 447-510Google Scholar), and transformation (11Johnstone I.L. Hughes S.G. Clutterbuck A.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were as described previously. For expression analysis, cultures were grown at 30 °C for 16 h in liquid minimal medium (9Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the sole nitrogen sources stated in the figure legends. Standard procedures were used for propagation of cosmids and for subcloning and propagation of plasmids in Escherichia coli strain DH5α. Conditions employed here for A. nidulans Southern and Northern blot analysis were as described previously (12MacCabe A.P. Riach M.B.R. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the wild-typecnxABC gene was determined in both strands using a Sequenase version 2 DNA sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). For primer extension analysis, mRNA was prepared from mycelium grown in minimal medium containing 10 mm sodium nitrate as the sole nitrogen source at 25 °C for 18 h, using a Quickprep mRNA Purification Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Messenger RNA (2 μg) was hybridized with 5′32P-end-labeled primer PE-1 (5′-GAAGTCGCTTGAGCTGCG-3′, position +47) at 52 °C for 1 h and reverse transcribed using a primer extension system as recommended (Promega). The extension product was compared on a denaturing sequencing gel with a DNA sequence ladder prepared using the same end-labeled primer with pSTA502 as template. Genomic DNA was prepared from mycelia grown in liquid culture for 16–18 h at 25 °C using a Nucleon BACC2 Kit (Scotlab). DNA was cleaved with EcoRI, and around 100 ng was amplified using 2.5 units/μl Dynazyme (Flowgen) or 2.5 units/μl Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), a 1 μm concentration of each primer, and 100 μmdNTPs. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 50 s for one cycle, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 50 s. The entire cnxABC coding region was amplified in four overlapping sections using primers P1 and P2 (5′-CGTTGTCGAGCAGAATC-3′ and 5′-TATGCTCTTCATAACCGC-3′, positions −27 to +687), primers P3 and P4 (5′-GTAAATCTCAGTCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-CATGCCAATAACGTCAAG-3′, positions +601 to +1263), primers P5 and P6 (5′-TGAGGCAGCTCGAACAG-3′ and 5′-GACGTCGGTTGGAGAAG-3′, positions +1176 to +1876), and primers P7 and P8 (5′-ATATGACGCTGATTGATG-3′ and 5′-TGTCATACACATCCAGG-3′, positions +1796 to +2344). Following removal of PCR primers and unincorporated nucleotides by the Glassmax DNA Isolation Spin Cartridge System (Life Technologies), the amplified DNA was sequenced directly in a single strand only by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI 373 A automated fluorescent sequencing apparatus and the PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) with the PCR primers at a concentration of 10 μm. Additional primers used for sequencing were PE-2 (5′-CCGGTAGTGACATATCGC-3′, position +140), AR5 (5′-GATTACCTTAGGATCAG-3′, position +280), AR3 (5′-TGGATTCCAAGGCCGAG-3′, position +975), AR8 (5′-TTGTATACATGATTCAC-3′, position +1404), and CR9 (5′-ATGACGCTGAGATGAAG-3′, position +2051). Sequences were compared with the wild type using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.). Upon identification of a putative mutation, the relevant primer pair was used to reamplify the digested genomic DNA, and the product was sequenced again to confirm the mutational change. Conidial suspensions of around 106 viable cells were made in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and 1 μl of the strain under test was spotted on the surface of agar minimal medium containing 10 mmsodium nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. A second 1-μl aliquot of the standard strain was spotted on top of the test strain, and the medium was incubated at 37 °C. Form A dephospho and compound Z levels were analyzed, as a measure of precursor Z and molybdopterin, respectively, according to the method described by Johnson and Rajagopalan (13Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 117-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. A conidial suspension in 20 ml of 0.9% saline, 0.1% Tween 80 (approximately 5 × 106 conidia/ml) was used to inoculate 400 ml of minimal medium supplemented with the stated sole nitrogen sources after Cove (9Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 16 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm and harvested by filtration through sterile muslin cloth. After washing with 50 ml of sterile distilled water, the cells were pressed dry and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell material (1.5 g) was homogenized by sonication (5 × 15 s) in 3 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2), and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20 min at 14,000 rpm). Of the resulting supernatant, 1 ml was combined with 125 μl of I2/KI (1%/2%) in 1 m HCl and then left in darkness for 10 h at room temperature. 138 μl of 1% ascorbic acid and 0.5 ml of 1m Tris-HCl were added before centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature to remove any particulate matter. The supernatant was mixed with 13 μl of 1 m MgCl2and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase and incubated for a further 12 h in darkness at room temperature. The samples were subsequently applied to QAE-Sephadex A-25 (Sigma) columns (acetate form, 0.5-ml bed volume) and washed with 5 ml of distilled water. Form A dephospho was eluted with 5 ml of 10 mm acetic acid, adjusted to pH 7.0 with NH4OH, and stored frozen until HPLC analysis. Compound Z was eluted with 8 ml of 10 mm HCl. The HCl eluates were applied to Florisil (Sigma) columns (250 mg of Florisil mesh 100–200, washed with 12 ml of 10 mm HCl; bed volume, 0.6 ml). The columns were then washed with 1 ml of 10 mm HCl, and compound Z was eluted with 1.7 ml of 22.5% acetone. The acetone eluates were rotoevaporated until dry. The compound Z samples were dissolved in 300 μl of H2O, of which 100 μl was injected for HPLC analysis. Analysis of form A dephospho and compound Z by reversed phase HPLC was performed using a Hypersil ODS column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). Form A dephospho (500 μl of the acidic acid eluate) was eluted with 10% methanol, 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.7, 1 ml/min) and detected using a Shimadzu RF-551 fluorescence detector set to 370/450 nm (emission/excitation). Compound Z was eluted with 5% methanol, 50 mm triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0, 1 ml/min) and detected by fluorescence at 350/450 nm (emission/excitation). Total protein was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Previous classical genetics has shown that thecnxABC locus is approximately 3 recombination map units from the brlA locus on linkage group VIII. Using a 4.8-kbBamHI DNA fragment of pILJ421 (11Johnstone I.L. Hughes S.G. Clutterbuck A.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1307-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) containing thebrlA gene as a hybridization probe, two cosmids were isolated from the chromosome 8-specific cosmid library (15Brody H. Griffith J. Cuticchia A.J. Arnold J. Timberlake W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3105-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Since neither of these cosmids complemented phenotypically (i.e.growth on nitrate as sole nitrogen source) cnx mutant straincnxA9, cnxB11, or cnxC 3 in transformation experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”), the cosmids were used to generate end probes to walk to neighboring cosmids. Eight overlapping cosmids were identified, and one of these, W26G08, was found to complement all three mutant strains, i.e. cnxA9, cnxB11, and cnxC3, at transformation frequencies in excess of 100 transformants/μg of cosmid DNA. Phenotypic complementation of the mutants using EcoRI-,XbaI-, and BamHI-digested and isolated fragments of cosmid W26G08 indicated that the complementing region was located on a 6.5-kb EcoRI-XbaI fragment, estimated by restriction endonuclease mapping to be around 65 kb from thebrlA gene. This DNA fragment, the restriction map of which is shown in Fig. 1 A, was subcloned into vector pUC18, resulting in recombinant plasmid pSTA502.Figure 1Restriction endonuclease map of recombinant plasmid pSTA502 and DNA and deduced amino acid sequence of the A. nidulans cnxABC locus.

Subclones pSTA503, pSTA505, and pSTA507 did not complement cnxA9,cnxB11, or cnxC3 alleles. Subclones pSTA504 and pSTA506 complemented the cnxC3 mutation at high frequency, but only pSTA506 complemented cnxB11 and cnxA9, although at an efficiency much reduced compared with the original recombinant plasmid, pSTA502. Therefore, the minimum region necessary for complementation resides on the stretch of pSTA502 to the right of the PstI site (Fig. 1 A). The DNA sequence of a 3619-base pair stretch of pSTA502 encompassing the complementing region was determined in both strands (Fig. 1 B). A long open reading frame is interrupted by a single intron 198 base pairs long (shown in lowercase), the precise location of which was determined by sequencing a reverse transcriptase-PCR product generated by primers P5 and P6 straddling the proposed intron position. 3S. E. Unkles, unpublished observations. The intron is bounded by canonical 5′- and 3′-splice sequences and has an internal motif corresponding to that required for lariat formation in fungi (16Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. Gene Structure in Eukaryotic Microbes. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 93-139Google Scholar). A single transcriptional start point was determined to be at position −73 relative to the proposed translational start,3 which is the first ATG in frame following the transcriptional start point and is surrounded by a recognized translational initiation sequence context for A. nidulans(17Arst Jr., H.N. Sheerins A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Perusal of the noncoding region upstream of the ATG suggests potential TATA motifs at positions −241 and −315, and CCAAT motifs at positions −447 and −509. Additionally, a potential receptor site for NIRA (CCGCGG) (18Punt P.J. Strauss J. Smit R. Kinghorn J.R. van den Hondel C.A.M.J.J. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5688-5699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the product of the nirA gene, which mediates nitrate induction of systems required for nitrate assimilation including nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase (13Johnson M.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 110-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and nitrate uptake (19Unkles S.E. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Montague P. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), is present at position −146. Comparison of the cnxABC deduced amino acid sequence to the Swissprot data base indicated that the inferred A. nidulansprotein was homologous to two E. coli proteins (Fig.2), encoded by the moaA gene (similar to the first section of the A. nidulans sequence) and the moaC gene (similar to the second segment) (20Rivers S.L. McNairn E. Blasco F. Giordano G. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ThecnxABC intron lies between the two regions. The A. nidulans CNXA domain has an 80-residue N-terminal extension in comparison with the E. coli MOAA protein. This N-terminal extension has no similarity to other proteins in the data base. The start of the CNXC domain is not clear from comparison with the MOAC protein, since there is a stretch of around 120 amino acid residues following the MOAA-similar region without similarity to any other proteins,3 including E. coli MoCo biosynthetic proteins (21Gems D.H. Clutterbuck A.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Conserved cysteine residues of potential functional significance in CNXA are in boldface type (Fig.2) and are discussed below under “Determination of MutantcnxA Sequences.” Fragments PCR1, PCR2, PCR3, and PCR4 were amplified using pSTA502 as the template and used in genetic transformation experiments in attempts to repair phenotypically the growth defects of mutant strains cnxA9, cnxB11, andcnxC3 on nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen (Fig.3). Such transformation experiments were carried out using one of the above amplified DNA fragments with and without the presence of the vector pHELP, an autonomously replicatingA. nidulans plasmid that greatly enhances transformation frequencies of co-transformed plasmids (see Ref. 21Gems D.H. Clutterbuck A.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 520-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). It was observed, not unexpectedly perhaps, that the frequency of nitrate utilizing complementers was at least 100-fold greater when PCR fragments were co-transformed with the vector pHELP. Since the frequencies using PCR fragments alone tended to be low, the inclusion of pHELP sharpened the differences between positive and negative phenotypic complementation, although the overall trend with the different PCR fragments was similar. PCR1 complemented phenotypically each recipient mutant strain, i.e. cnxA9,cnxB11, or cnxC3, at high frequency using vector pHELP (1000–3000 nitrate utilizing transformants/μg of PCR fragment). PCR2 complemented only the cnxA9 mutation, while PCR3 complemented the cnxC3 mutation only. No complementing transformants were obtained for the cnxB11 mutation with either fragment PCR2 or PCR3. Fragment PCR4 did not complement thecnxC3 mutation. The results indicate, in conjunction with the homologies observed above, that the cnxA section of thecnxABC locus is equivalent to moaA and that thecnxC locus is equivalent to the E. coli moaCgene, but phenotypic complementation of the cnxB11 mutant requires the presence of both cnxA- andcnxC-encoding DNA fragments. Finally, the observation that transformation with pHELP permits complementation of thecnxC3 mutant by the apparently promoterless fragment PCR3 encoding CNXC domain suggests that the transcriptional activity may initiate from within pHELP itself. Complementation by PCR3 is less likely to be due to integration at the homologous locus by double cross-over, since fragment PCR4, which covers the region of thecnxC3 mutation but does not contain the entire CNXC domain, does not complement the cnxC3 mutant following transformation with pHELP. In an attempt to resolve conclusively the question of how three genetically complementing classes of mutants could be obtained in a single gene (i.e. the cnxABC gene), the DNA sequence of the original Pateman et al. mutants (2Pateman J.A. Cove D.J. Rever B.M. Roberts D.B. Nature. 1964; 201: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (i.e. cnxA9,cnxB11, cnxC2, and cnxC3) as well ascnx mutants isolated and characterized during this study (cnxA95, cnxA140 ts,cnxB204, and cnxB1281) were determined following PCR amplification. (The origin of the mutants is cited under “Experimental Procedures.”) The positions of the mutational changes and the DNA sequence of the wild type compared with the mutant are shown in Fig. 4. ThecnxA9, cnxA140 ts, andcnxA95 mutations are the result of either single base pair changes or duplication of short stretches of nucleotides in multiples of three in the cnxA-encoding domain. Therefore, neither type of event changes the reading frame, inter alia grossly affects the sequence of the protein. One of the original Pateman and Cove mutants, cnxA9, is an insertion of three amino acids (between residues 345 and 346) into a region highly similar betweenA. nidulans cnxA and E. coli moaA protein products and in which Rajagopalan and colleagues have recognized cysteine residues (highlighted in boldface type, Fig. 2), which are involved in the binding of an iron-sulfur prosthetic group in the E. coli MOAA protein (22Rajagopalan K.V. Solomonson L.P. Barber M.J. Cannons A.C. Nitrogen Assimilation: Fourth International Symposium. USF Printing Services, Tampa, FL1997Google Scholar). The mutant cnxA95is a single base pair alteration resulting in the change of one of these conserved cysteine residues, cysteine 345, to tyrosine, supporting the suggestion that this is an important functional site. The phenotypically temperature sensitive allele,cnxA140 ts, is a duplication resulting in the addition of seven amino acids between residues 139 and 140, just preceding a short homologous amino acid stretch at residue 147 (Fig.2). The DNA sequence changes in the cnxB11, cnxB1281, and cnxB204 mutants all occur within thecnxA-encoding domain of the gene and are either duplications (not in multiples of three) or single base pair deletions. The result of these duplications or deletions is a change in reading frame, positioning a stop codon in frame downstream of the change. Therefore, both cnxA and cnxC domains of the protein are markedly disrupted by the cnxB mutations. A further mutant,cnxB35, is possibly a translocation within thecnxA domain between primers P3 and P4.3 A PCR product was obtained from this mutant with primer combinations P1 and P2, P5 and P6, and P7 and P8, but not with P3 and P4 or P3 and P6. (See “Experimental Procedures” for primer details). The cnxC2 mutation results from the deletion of a single base pair near the end of the CNXC-encoding domain, while thecnxC3 mutation is the consequence of a four-base pair deletion eight codons after the position of the intron incnxABC. This mutation is the most proximal cnxCmutation and hence helps to delimit the start of the CNXC protein at least to before this point. Both cnxC mutations, therefore, disrupt only the CNXC domain. Interestingly, the cnxC2mutation indicates an essential role in protein function for the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues. The resu"
https://openalex.org/W1977698399,"In cells expressing Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is commonly associated with extracellular Ca2+ influx. Operation of these two Ca2+ signaling pathways mediates thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and angiotensin II (AII)-induced prolactin secretion from rat pituitary lactotrophs. After an initial hyperpolarization induced by Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), these agonists generated an increase in the steady-state firing of action potentials, further facilitating extracellular Ca2+ influx and prolactin release. Like TRH and AII, endothelin-1 (ET-1) also induced a rapid release of Ca2+ from the ER and a concomitant spike prolactin secretion during the first 3–5 min of stimulation. However, unlike TRH and AII actions, Ca2+ mobilization was not coupled to Ca2+ influx during sustained ET-1 stimulation, as ET-1 induced a long-lasting abolition of action potential firing. This lead to a depletion of the ER Ca2+ pool, a prolonged decrease in [Ca2+] i, and sustained inhibition of prolactin release. ET-1-induced inhibition and TRH/AII-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx and hormone secretion were reduced in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. Basal [Ca2+] i and prolactin release were also reduced in the presence of nifedipine. Furthermore, TRH-induced Ca2+ influx and secretion were abolished by ET-1, as TRH was unable to reactivate Ca2+ influx and prolactin release in ET-1-stimulated cells. Depolarization of the cells during sustained inhibitory action of ET-1, however, increased [Ca2+] i and prolactin release. These results indicate that L-type Ca2+ channel represents a common Ca2+ influx pathway that controls basal [Ca2+] i and secretion and is regulated by TRH/AII and ET-1 in an opposite manner. Thus, the receptor-mediated uncoupling of Ca2+ entry from Ca2+ mobilization provides an effective control mechanism in terminating the stimulatory action of ET-1. Moreover, it makes electrically active lactotrophs quiescent and unresponsive to other calcium-mobilizing agonists. In cells expressing Ca2+-mobilizing receptors, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is commonly associated with extracellular Ca2+ influx. Operation of these two Ca2+ signaling pathways mediates thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and angiotensin II (AII)-induced prolactin secretion from rat pituitary lactotrophs.

ET-1-induced inhibition and TRH/AII-induced stimulation of Ca2+ influx and hormone secretion were reduced in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. Basal [Ca2+] i and prolactin release were also reduced in the presence of nifedipine. Furthermore, TRH-induced Ca2+ influx and secretion were abolished by ET-1, as TRH was unable to reactivate Ca2+ influx and prolactin release in ET-1-stimulated cells.

Thus, the receptor-mediated uncoupling of Ca2+ entry from Ca2+ mobilization provides an effective control mechanism in terminating the stimulatory action of ET-1. Moreover, it makes electrically active lactotrophs quiescent and unresponsive to other calcium-mobilizing agonists. Typically, in anterior pituitary cells operated by calcium-mobilizing agonists, release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores is associated with extracellular Ca2+ influx. The coordinate actions of these two pathways provide long-lasting Ca2+ signals and secretion during sustained agonist stimulation (1Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Endothelins (ETs) 1The abbreviations used are: ET, endothelin; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; AII, angiotensin II; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SOCC, store-operated calcium channel(s); VGCC, voltage-gated calcium channel(s); AP, action potential. are common calcium-mobilizing agonists for secretory pituitary cells and operate through ETA receptors (2Kanyicska B.

Cell. 1995; 9: 1037-1047Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In lactotrophs, the ET-1-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular pools is associated with a rapid and transient increase in prolactin secretion (6Stojilkovic S.S. Iida T. Merelli F. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 762-770PubMed Google Scholar, 7Samson W.K. Skala K.D. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2964-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) followed by a prolonged inhibition to below basal levels (8Kanyicska B. Livingstone J.D. Freeman M.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This bidirectional effect of a calcium-mobilizing agonist on secretion is uncommon among cells expressing phospholipase C-coupled receptors and is unique for cells expressing ETA receptors. The mechanism underlying the paradoxical action of ETs on hormone secretion is still unknown. It is unlikely that a rapid desensitization of ETA receptors could explain the inhibition of secretion observed in lactotrophs. Therefore, as the sustained phase in hormone secretion is affected in ET-1-stimulated lactotrophs, we addressed the alternate hypothesis that Ca2+ influx is uncoupled from Ca2+ mobilization in ET-1-stimulated lactotrophs, leading to depletion of the ER calcium pool and inhibition of hormone secretion. To test this hypothesis, rat pituitary lactotrophs were employed. These cells exhibit spontaneous, extracellular Ca2+-dependent action potential (AP) activity (9Ozawa S. Sand O. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 887-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which is tightly coupled to basal prolactin secretion (10Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ETA receptors, lactotrophs express thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors (11Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the calcium-mobilizing actions of which have been well characterized (12Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II (AII) also stimulates prolactin release, presumably through activation of AT1B receptors (13Kakar S.S. Sellers J.C. Devor D.C. Musgrove L.C. Neill J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Two calcium entry pathways are proposed to operate in lactotrophs: voltage-gated (VGCC) and store-operated (SOCC) calcium channels (12Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Ca2+ influx through VGCC rather than through SOCC is essential for the sustained secretagogue actions of TRH and AII. In contrast to these agonists, ET-1 inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ influx, leading to a depletion of the ER calcium pool, a decrease in [Ca2+] i, and prolonged inhibition of prolactin release. GnRH, TRH, AII, and ET-1 were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Fura 2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Anterior pituitary glands from adult female Sprague-Dawley rats obtained from Charles River Inc. (Wilmington, MA) were dispersed into single cells by a trypsin/DNase treatment procedure (14Tomic M. Cesnjaj M. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1762-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in either mixed pituitary cell populations or purified lactotroph populations. Cell purification of dispersed pituitary cells was done by sedimentation on a ficol gradient as described previously (15Stojilkovic S.S Kukuljan M. Iida T. Rojas E. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4081-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For cell column perifusion, 2 × 107 cells were incubated with preswollen cytodex-1 beads in 60-mm culture dishes for 2 days. The cells were then loaded into temperature-controlled chambers and perifused at 37 °C with Hanks' M199 containing 20 mmHEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at a flow rate of 0.6 or 1.0 ml/min, after which a stable basal secretion rate was established. During the test period, 3-s or 1-min fractions were collected, and the perifusate was subsequently stored at −20 °C. Prolactin content in each fraction was determined by radioimmunoassay using the reagents and standards provided by the National Pituitary Agency (Baltimore). Cells were plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine and cultured in medium 199 containing Earle's salts, sodium bicarbonate, horse serum, and antibiotics for 24–48 h. For cytosolic Ca2+ measurements, the cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 2 μm fura 2-AM in phenol red-free medium 199 containing Hanks' salts, 20 mmsodium bicarbonate, and 20 mm HEPES. Coverslips with cells were washed with phenol red-free physiological buffer and mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to an Attofluor digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). Cells were examined under a 40× oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340- and 380-nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 505 nm was measured. [Ca2+] i is expressed as the ratio of 340 nm/380 nm (F(340)/F(380)). Membrane potential (V m ) was measured using the perforated patch-clamp recording technique (16Kukuljan M. Stojilkovic S.S. Rojas E. Catt K.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Before recording, the culture medium was replaced with a solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 glucose (pH adjusted to 7.36 using NaOH). Patch-clamp pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (type 7740; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a horizontal micropipette puller (model P-87; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and heat polished to a final tip resistance of 2–4 MΩ. The composition of the pipette solutions was (in mm) 70 KCl, 70 K+-aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH). Amphotericin B (Sigma) was added from a stock solution to obtain a final concentration of 240 μg/ml. The signals were recorded under the current-clamp mode using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). A 3 m KCl-agar bridge was placed between the bathing solution and the reference electrode. Records were filtered at 2 kHz using a low pass bessel filter and digitized using the software package AxoScope 1.0 in conjunction with a Digidata 1200A A/D converter (Axon Instruments). All reported membrane potentials were corrected for a liquid junction potential error of 10 mV calculated using the JPCalc program (17Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). For calcium imaging and electrophysiological experiments, all drugs were either applied directly to the bath or perifused at a rate of 2 ml/min, during which complete solution exchange around the cells occurred within 20–30 s. In cell column perifusion experiments, continuous stimulation with 100 nm ET-1 induced a rapid and transient increase in prolactin release (Fig. 1 A), the amplitude of which was determined by agonist concentration (data not shown). The spike phase was followed by a sustained inhibitory phase, during which prolactin secretion was significantly below that observed in controls (Fig. 1 A). Activation of TRH and AII receptors also induced a rapid spike-like pattern of prolactin release; however, unlike the ET-1 response, the spike was followed by a sustained plateau phase, in which prolactin secretion remained elevated above basal levels (Fig. 1 B). To determine if the pattern of [Ca2+] i signaling in response to ET-1, TRH, and AII mirrors that of secretion, we monitored changes in [Ca2+] i in single rat lactotrophs using the membrane-permeant Ca2+ indicator dye, fura 2-AM. Endothelin-1 induced a rapid rise in [Ca2+] i, followed by a decrease to below basal levels (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, in TRH- and AII-stimulated lactotrophs, the spike phase of the [Ca2+] i response was followed by sustained plateau phase (Fig. 1 D). During perifusion of dispersed pituitary cells at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min with the collection of 1-min fractions, the stimulatory action of ET-1 lasted for 3–5 min (Fig. 1 A). This is in contrast to the [Ca2+] i, which was elevated above basal levels for about 1–2 min. To better compare the hormone release response to ET-1 with that of changes in [Ca2+] i, the effects of ET-1 were further examined using a rapid perifusion system, in which the flow rate was adjusted to 1.0 ml/min, and 3-s fractions were collected. The secretory profile was then compared with an averaged [Ca2+] i response from lactotrophs stimulated with 100 nm ET-1. Under these conditions, the hormone release profile mirrored that of the changes in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 2). This further supports the view that the pattern of ET-1-induced changes in [Ca2+] i determines that of prolactin release. Another difference in TRH/AII- versus ET-1-stimulated cells was related to the pattern of recovery after the termination of stimuli. The removal of TRH and AII was followed by a return in the [Ca2+] i (Fig. 3 A) and secretory responses (data not shown) to basal levels within 1–2 min. In contrast, at least 30 min was required for the recovery of basal [Ca2+] i (Fig.3 B) and prolactin secretion (Fig. 3 C) following ET-1 treatment. These data indicate that TRH and AII operate in a manner typical for Ca2+-mobilizing agonists, inducingbiphasic effects, which consist of an early spike and sustained plateau responses. Additionally, the stimulatory actions are terminated immediately upon their removal. In contrast, ET-1 exertsbidirectional effects on [Ca2+] i and secretion. This includes an early stimulation followed by a sustained inhibition, the latter being present for a prolonged period upon removal of the agonist. Typical bidirectional effects of ET-1 on [Ca2+] i and secretion were regularly observed in single lactotrophs bathed in Ca2+-containing medium (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium, ET-1 induced a monophasic increase in prolactin secretion and [Ca2+] i (Fig.4, A and B). Thyrotropin-releasing hormone also induced a monophasic increase in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 4 C). Readdition of extracellular Ca2+ in TRH- but not ET-1-stimulated cells lead to an immediate increase in [Ca2+] i. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ consistently reduced [Ca2+] i and prolactin secretion, indicating that Ca2+ entry is coupled to basal [Ca2+] i and prolactin secretion in lactotrophs (Fig. 4, A–C). Thus, it is likely that a common Ca2+ influx pathway controls basal [Ca2+] i and secretion and is facilitated by TRH/AII and inhibited by ET-1. Previously, it has been suggested that VGCC and SOCC participate in TRH-induced Ca2+ mobilization in lactotrophs (reviewed in Ref. 12Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test for the involvement of VGCC in mediating the inhibitory action of ET-1 on secretion, the interaction between the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine and nimodipine, and ET-1 was examined. The inhibitory action of ET-1 on prolactin release was decreased, but not completely abolished, in the presence of nifedipine (Fig. 5) and nimodipine (data not shown). As the magnitude of ET-1-induced inhibition of prolactin release was reduced in the presence of dihydropyridines, it suggests that these VGCC blockers and ET-1 act at the same point to inhibit secretion. Nifedipine also reduced basal prolactin release in a manner comparable with that observed in cells depleted of extracellular Ca2+ (Figs. 4 and 5). The effects of nifedipine were concentration dependent (Fig. 5, A versus B). At a higher (100 nm) concentration of nifedipine, ET-1 was still able to inhibit prolactin release, but the level of inhibition was only 10–20% of that observed in control cells (Fig.5 B). In TRH-stimulated cells, the plateau phase of [Ca2+] i response was also reduced by 80–90% in the presence of 100 nm nifedipine. These observations are in accord with the hypothesis that L-type voltage-gated channels are common Ca2+ influx channels involved in the control of [Ca2+] i and secretion in unstimulated and agonist-stimulated lactotrophs. Thus, when the Ca2+ influx through these channels is inhibited by nifedipine, it cannot be further inhibited by ET-1. To further test this hypothesis, membrane potential was measured in single free-running lactotrophs. Under the conditions employed in this study, lactotrophs frequently exhibited spontaneous electrical activity, which was inhibited by addition of nifedipine (not shown). Spontaneous electrical activity was abolished in ET-1 as well as in TRH-stimulated cells (Fig. 6,A and B). However, the pattern of this inhibition differed between the two agonists. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone induced a transient hyperpolarization and cessation of AP firing followed by an increase in the spiking frequency. In contrast, ET-1 induced a long-lasting hyperpolarization with the cessation of AP activity, which returned 15–30 min following its removal. The level of hyperpolarization of lactotrophs by ET-1 was about −80 mV (Fig. 6), which is close to the equilibrium potential for potassium under our experimental conditions. This suggests that inhibition of spontaneous electrical activity is indirect due to activation of a potassium channel, which hyperpolarizes the cells. Depolarization of cells by high potassium (Fig. 7) or the addition of Bay K 8644, an L-type calcium channel agonist (data not shown), increased [Ca2+] i and prolactin secretion, further supporting that inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+entry is indirect.Figure 7Depolarization-induced activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in ET-1-stimulated lactotrophs.

In contrast, addition of ET-1 to cells continuously stimulated with TRH induced an inhibition of sustained extracellular Ca2+-dependent [Ca2+] i response and prolactin release (Fig. 8,A and B). This experiment demonstrates that activation of ET receptors is required for the inhibitory action on Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, the low amplitude of the spike [Ca2+] i and prolactin responses to ET-1 in TRH-stimulated cells (Fig. 8, A and B) as well as to ionomycin (data not shown) indicates that the ER calcium pool is almost depleted. The amplitudes of TRH-induced [Ca2+] i responses also decreased in cells continuously exposed to 100 nm ET-1 in Ca2+-deficient (Fig. 8 D) as well as Ca2+-containing medium (data not shown). The amplitudes of TRH- and ionomycin-induced Ca2+ responses were progressively reduced in cells stimulated with ET-1, indicating that the intracellular Ca2+ pool is depleted within 10–15 min of stimulation (data not shown). Accordingly, application of TRH 20 min after stimulation with ET-1 did not increase prolactin secretion (Fig.8 C). The coupling of Ca2+ influx to a Ca2+mobilization pathway is commonly observed in non-excitable and excitable cells operated by Ca2+-mobilizing receptors. This coupling is crucial to the regulation of intracellular Ca2+homeostasis and Ca2+-controlled cellular functions during sustained agonist stimulation (18Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Loessberg P.A. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10377-10384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In non-excitable cells, Ca2+ influx occurs through SOCC in response to agonist-induced and InsP3-mediated depletion of the ER calcium pool (22Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G. St J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 23Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In general, Ca2+ influx in these cells is activated independently from the mechanism of depletion of the ER calcium pool (24Bird S.J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In excitable cells, VGCC are involved in sustained agonist-induced Ca2+ entry. In these cells, the pattern of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (oscillatory versus non-oscillatory) determines the pattern of AP firing and associated voltage-gated Ca2+ entry (1Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A family of Ca2+-controlled potassium channels plays a critical role in the synchronization of Ca2+ mobilization with the Ca2+ entry process during agonist stimulation (9Ozawa S. Sand O. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 887-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The excitability of these cells, however, does not exclude the operation of SOCC; in several excitable cells, including lactotrophs, capacitative calcium entry has also been identified (26Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1995; 430: 923-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Pituitary lactotrophs and GH cell lines express several Ca2+-mobilizing receptors that operate in a manner typical for this class of receptors, i.e. Ca2+mobilization is coupled to Ca2+ entry. Within them, TRH receptors are the best characterized. They are coupled to a phospholipase C pathway through a Gq/G11protein (11Gershengorn M.C. Osman R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway leads to a non-oscillatory biphasic increase in [Ca2+] i and hormone secretion, the early phase being dependent on Ca2+mobilization and the sustained phase on Ca2+ entry (27Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5827-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M.

J. 1988; 255: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3 A and 4 C). Both voltage-gated and capacitative Ca2+ entry have been proposed to participate in TRH-induced Ca2+ influx in these cells. The role of VGCC and the pattern of TRH-induced electrical activity is well established (30Li P. Thaw C.N. Sempowski G.D. Gershengorn M.C. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1393-1402PubMed Google Scholar, 31Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the operation of SOCC requires more detailed investigations (12Hinkle P.M. Nelson E.J. Ashworth R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 370-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other agonist for these cells, AII, signals through AT1B receptors that are also coupled to a phospholipase C pathway (13Kakar S.S. Sellers J.C. Devor D.C. Musgrove L.C. Neill J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that this receptor operates in a manner comparable with that observed during TRH action. Furthermore, lactotrophs express V1b vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, the activation of which are also associated with a biphasic pattern of Ca2+ signaling and prolactin secretion (32Samson W.K. Schell D.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 395: 355-364PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sugimoto T. Saito M. Mochizuki S. Watanabe Y. Hashimoto S. Kawashima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27088-27092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ET receptor is an additional member of calcium-mobilizing receptors expressed in lactotrophs as well as in other pituitary cell types (34Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 385-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The coupling of this receptor to a phospholipase C pathway in pituitary cells (4Stojilkovic S.S. Balla T. Fukuda S. Cesnjaj M. Merelli F. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 465-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provides a transient increase in [Ca2+] i and hormone release (6Stojilkovic S.S. Iida T. Merelli F. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 762-770PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to TRH and AII action, however, the early stimulatory action of ET-1 is substituted with a prolonged inhibition of prolactin release. This was initially observed by Samson et al. (35Samson W.K. Skala K.D. Alexander B.D. Huang F.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and subsequently confirmed by several other groups (6Stojilkovic S.S. Iida T. Merelli F. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 762-770PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kanyicska B. Burris T.P. Freeman M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Dymshitz J. Laudon M. Ben-Jonathan N. Neuroendocrinology. 1992; 55: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In accord with the binding data (4Stojilkovic S.S. Balla T. Fukuda S. Cesnjaj M. Merelli F. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 465-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that inhibition was mediated by ETA receptors (2Kanyicska B. Freeman M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: E601-E608PubMed Google Scholar, 3Samson W.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Stojilkovic S.S. Balla T. Fukuda S. Cesnjaj M. Merelli F. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 465-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the pituitary cells, inhibition of prolactin release by ET-1 was also observed in human decidual cells (38Chao H.-S. Myers S.E. Handwerger S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which express ETA receptors as well (39Rutherford R.A. Wharton J. McCarthy A. Gordon L. Sullivan M.H. Elder M.G. Polak J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that uncoupling of Ca2+ influx from Ca2+ mobilization underlies the bidirectional action of ETs on prolactin release. Thus, ET-1 exhibits two opposite effects on Ca2+ signaling, stimulation via Ca2+mobilization and inhibition of Ca2+ influx pathways. The lack of effects of TRH and AII to promote Ca2+ influx in ET-1-stimulated cells and the ability of ET-1 to inhibit Ca2+ entry in TRH/AII-stimulated cells suggest that these receptors control the same Ca2+ influx pathway but show the opposite mode of regulation. Furthermore, the same Ca2+influx channels control basal [Ca2+] i and prolactin release. Several lines of evidence presented here and earlier indicate that Ca2+ influx through l-type calcium channels rather than SOCC is controlled by these three calcium-mobilizing receptors. (i) Basal prolactin release is inhibited by nifedipine and by depletion of extracellular Ca2+. Spontaneous electrical activity in lactotrophs and GH cells is also inhibited by nifedipine and requires extracellular Ca2+(40Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). (ii) TRH-induced electrical activity, Ca2+ influx, and prolactin secretion in these cells are nifedipine-sensitive (27Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5827-5832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,29Winiger B.P. Schlegel W. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Li P. Thaw C.N. Sempowski G.D. Gershengorn M.C. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1393-1402PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) ET-1 induces a prolonged inhibition of electrical activity and AP-driven Ca2+ influx through VGCC. The ability of the L-type Ca2+ channels blocker, nifedipine and nimodipine, to diminish the inhibitory action of ET-1 on secretion also suggests that ET-1 acts on VGCC to reduce Ca2+ entry. (iv) Capacitative Ca2+ entry should be activated automatically by depletion of the ER calcium pool in cells expressing SOCC. As shown here, there is a progressive depletion of the ER calcium pool in ET-1- and TRH-stimulated cells, but this action is accompanied with a reverse action on Ca2+ influx by these two receptors, inhibition by ET-1 and stimulation by TRH. The results also indicate that inhibition of Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels is indirect, possibly due to activation of potassium channels, leading to a hyperpolarization and abolition of pacemaker activity. Recently, the role of large-conductance K+ channels in ET-stimulated lactotrophs has been suggested (41Kanyicska B. Freeman M.E. Dryer S.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3141-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These channels are also activated by TRH and are responsible for a rapid inhibition of electrical activity in lactotrophs (9Ozawa S. Sand O. Physiol. Rev. 1986; 66: 887-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Since these channels are controlled by [Ca2+] i, however, the inhibition of AP firing is transient (42Ozawa S. Kimura N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6017-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and may explain the early phase in hyperpolarization of these cells. Thus, the sustained inhibition of electrical activity must be controlled by another yet unidentified potassium channel. Future experiments should be directed toward identification of this channel, as well as the mechanism of its activation by ETAreceptors, such as direct coupling with G proteins or indirect coupling through intracellular messenger pathways (43Hille B. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 44Wickman K. Clapham D.E. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 865-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the presence of nifedipine, ET-1 is still able to induce a minor inhibition of prolactin release. Also, about 10% of basal extracellular Ca2+-dependent hormone secretion is controlled by Ca2+ influx through nifedipine-insensitive calcium channels. This influx could be mediated by other VGCC subtypes, of which the T-type is the best characterized in these cells (45Dubinsky J.M. Oxford G.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 46Lewis D.L. Goodman M.B. St. John P.A. Barker J.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the residual, nifedipine-insensitive calcium flux is related to the other family of channels, such as a tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel identified recently in lactotrophs and GH3-immortalized cells (47Sankaranarayanan S. Simasko S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1927-C1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both T-type VGCC and the novel sodium channels are capable of providing the pacemaker activity and are functionally connected to the control of firing of APs. This may provide the explanation for the occurrence of a nifedipine-insensitive Ca2+ influx in unstimulated cells and its inhibition and facilitation by ET-1 and TRH, respectively. Our results also suggest that both ET-1- and TRH-induced Ca2+ mobilization leads to depletion of the ER Ca2+ pool but that the rate of depletion does not immediately mirror the [Ca2+] i profiles. In cells bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium, application of TRH or ionomycin during the early phase of decreased [Ca2+] i resulted in an additional release of Ca2+. Also, although Ca2+ influx is coupled to Ca2+ mobilization in TRH-stimulated cells, this pathway does not protect the cells from a decrease in the ER calcium pool, as documented by the subsequent application of ET-1 and ionomycin, but is sufficient to keep the steady-state plateau phase in [Ca2+] i response. This is consistent with a model in which the [Ca2+] i in TRH- and ET-1-stimulated lactotrophs represents the balance between Ca2+mobilization and Ca2+ influx. In ET-1-stimulated cells, Ca2+ mobilization is activated, and AP-driven Ca2+ influx is inhibited, leading to the bidirectional (spike and sustained inhibitory) change in [Ca2+] i and a complete depletion in the intracellular Ca2+ pool. In TRH-stimulated cells, both pathways are activated, leading to the biphasic (spike and plateau) change in [Ca2+] i but accompanied by a progressive decrease in the intracellular Ca2+ pool to a new steady-state level. However, additional experiments are needed to define the cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in lactotrophs. In summary, our results indicate that the signaling through ETA receptors is essential not only for stimulatory but also for inhibitory actions of ETs on [Ca2+] i and prolactin secretion. The latter function of these receptors is mediated by the uncoupling of Ca2+ mobilization and voltage-gated Ca2+ entry pathways. Such uncoupling leads to a unique physiological situation for a Ca2+-mobilizing agonist: unresponsive cells. The ER calcium pool is depleted due to Ca2+-mobilizing action of the ET-receptor complex, and, without a capacitative refilling, other calcium-mobilizing agonists are unable to initiate Ca2+ mobilization. Prolonged hyperpolarization of lactotrophs also protects these agonists to activate voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in these cells. Finally, basal pacemaker activity and hormone secretion are also inhibited. This makes lactotrophs unresponsive, leading to a sustained hypoprolactinemia. In this regard, a transient stimulatory action of ET-1 probably represents only a first step in the development of a quiescent status of these cells."

Both the TSHR and LH/CG receptor have large, heavily glycosylated ectodomains with leucine-rich repeats and are encoded by numerous exons (1Gross B. Misrahi M. Sar S. Milgrom E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 2Tsai-Morris C.H. Buczko E. Wang W. Xie X.-Z. Dufau M.L. J. Biol.

Despite their common evolutionary background, these receptors have several remarkable differences aside from the specificity of their ligands. For example, disease-causing autoantibodies to the TSHR are common, whereas autoantibodies to the LH/CG receptor are extremely rare. Thus, engagement of the TSHR by autoantibodies is the direct cause of thyrotoxicosis in Graves' disease, an organ-specific autoimmune disorder affecting only humans. Another striking difference exists at the structural level. As detected by TSH cross-linking to the surface of intact cells, the functional TSHR exists in two forms; a single chain receptor and a receptor with two subunits (4Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A.

Recent evidence raised the surprising possibility that cleavage of the TSHR into A and B subunits does not occur at a single site as previously suspected, but at two sites (18Chazenbalk G.D.

In the present study, we sought to identify more precisely the location of each putative cleavage site using a strategy involving mutagenesis of selected chimeric TSH-LH/CG receptors. To increase the level of receptor expression, we deleted the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of chimeric receptor TSH-LHR-5 (19Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B.

Plasmids were stably transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and standard antibiotics. Selection was with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Surviving clones (>100 per 100-mm diameter culture dish) were pooled and propagated for further study. For our initial series of mutations in domain E of chimeric receptor TSH-LHR-4, we used the E1, E2, and E3 mutations (see Fig.3 A) previously constructed in the wild-type TSHR (22Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 548-552PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations were transposed into the cDNA for TSH-LHR-4 (EcoRV-XbaI fragment). Subsequent finer mutations in the E domain of TSH-LHR-4 were made by PCR using overlapping primers, with replacement of the AflII-SpeI fragment. The nucleotide sequences of all PCR products were confirmed and stably transfected CHO cell lines were generated as described for the domain D mutations. Highly purified bovine TSH (5 μg, 30 units/mg of protein) was radiolabeled with125I to a specific activity of ∼80 μCi/μg of protein using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (4400 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Confluent 100-mm diameter dishes of TSHR-expressing cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 C with 5 μCi of 125I-TSH in 5 ml of modified Hanks' buffer (without NaCl), supplemented with 280 mm sucrose and 0.25% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer). Unbound 125I-TSH was removed by rinsing the cells three times with ice-cold binding buffer. Disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mm; Sigma) in 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin A (2 μg/ml) (all from Sigma) was then added for 20 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm ammonium acetate (final concentration). After cross-linking, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing the same protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C (500 × g). The supernatant was centrifuged (15 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After the addition of Laemmli buffer containing 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol (30 min at 42 °C), the samples were subjected to 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The basis for the present study was our previous observation that cleavage into A and B subunits did not occur in a chimeric receptor (TSH-LHR-6) (Fig. 1) in which the carboxyl-terminal portion of the TSHR ectodomain (amino acid residues 261–418; arbitrary domains “D and E”) was replaced with the corresponding region of the LH/CG receptor (19Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 23Russo D. Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, cleavage still occurred when either domain D or domain E (residues 261–362 and 363–418; chimeric receptors TSH-LHR-4 and TSH-LHR-5, respectively) were substituted on an individual basis. These data, together with other information (18Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggested that cleavage sites 1 and 2 were in TSHR domains D and E, respectively. Because elimination by mutagenesis of only one cleavage site would not be sufficient to abrogate receptor cleavage, we mutated regions in the vicinity of putative site 1 on a background of TSH-LHR-5. Conversely, we mutated regions in the vicinity of putative site 2 on a background of TSH-LHR-4. By this means, we were able to determine the structural significance of each mutation on receptor cleavage into subunits, as determined by 125I-TSH cross-linking to monolayers of intact, stably transfected cells. As a general principle for mutagenesis, we replaced TSHR residues with the homologous residues of the noncleaving LH/CG receptor. Residues common to both receptors were unaltered. In the case of a 50-amino acid region that is unique to the TSHR and lacking in the LH/CG receptor (14Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), homologous substitutions could not be performed, so we introduced alanine residues in most instances. It is noteworthy that this 50-amino acid segment (estimated to be between residues 317 and 366) is very hydrophilic and can be deleted from the wild-type TSHR without loss of ligand binding and function (24Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Russo D. Rapoport B. Science. 1990; 249: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and without preventing cleavage into A and B subunits (5Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The deglycosylated TSHR A subunit is ∼35 kDa in size (18Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which would place cleavage site 1 at approximately amino acid residue 335 (numbering includes a 21-residue signal peptide). On this basis, we initially targeted residues 330–338 for alanine scanning mutagenesis (Fig. 2 A). None of these individual substitutions prevented cleavage of chimeric receptor TSH-LHR-5, as determined by release of the TSH-linked A subunit on disulfide bond reduction (Fig. 2 B). Note that, consistent with previous TSH cross-linking studies to intact cells (4Furmaniak J. Hashim F.A. Buckland P.R. Petersen V.B. Beever K. Howells R.D. Rees Smith B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Chazenbalk G.D. Rapoport B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32209-32213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only a portion of the TSHR on the cell surface cleave into two subunits, with TSH also binding to single polypeptide chain TSHR. Because of the possibility that a single amino acid residue may be insufficient to disrupt a cleavage site, we next performed multiple substitutions over a wider area between residues 324 and 352, also without abolishing cleavage. Finally, we mutagenized TSH-LHR-5 even further afield (residues 317–323), well upstream of the calculated cleavage site and up to the carboxyl terminus of the D domain (residues 353–362), also without effect (Fig. 2 B). Mutagenesis of TSH-LHR-4 in the vicinity predicted to harbor putativecleavage site 2 (Fig.3 A) identified residues 367–375 (E1 subdomain) as being related to TSHR subunit formation (Fig. 3 B). Subdivision of the E1 region into two segments next identified residues 367–371 (E1a segment) to be associated with ectodomain cleavage. The subsequent substitution of individual alanines at residues 367, 368, 369, and 371 (residue 370 being conserved) did not prevent cleavage, suggesting that multiple amino acids contributed to this event. Therefore, to refine further the cleavage-related residues, we created two overlapping mutants within the E1a segment, E1a1(GQE367–369NET) and E1a2 (ELK369–371T-Y) (Fig. 3 A). Abrogation of cleavage in the former identified residues 367–369 to be involved in cleavage at putative site 2 (Fig.3 B). The inability of single amino acid substitutions to prevent cleavage at putative site 2, as well the involvement of multiple amino acids in this cleavage site, was instructive in view of our inability to localize putative cleavage site 1 despite the generation of 21 new receptors mutagenized in the anticipated region. Given the vast number of additional permutations that might be required to characterize site 1, further mutagenesis was daunting. Moreover, a number of possibilities existed. (i) Cleavage site 1 could be upstream of amino acid residue 317. However, in this case the deglycosylated A subunit would be 33 kDa or less, smaller than observed by multiple investigators (11Graves P.N. Vlase H. Bobovnikova Y. Davies T.F. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3915-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). (ii) The specificity of cleavage at site 1 was “relaxed.” (iii) Our hypothesis for two cleavage sites was wrong, despite the strong supporting evidence that we had obtained previously (18Chazenbalk G.D. Tanaka K. Nagayama Y. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2893-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of only a single cleavage site, we introduced the E1a1 mutation (GQE367–369NET), known to prevent cleavage of TSH-LHR-4, into the wild-type TSHR. Thus, if this segment was the sole site related to TSHR cleavage, its introduction into the wild-type TSHR should prevent cleavage. Conversely, if cleavage still occurred in the wild-type TSHR harboring the GQE367–369NET mutation, there must be two cleavage sites in the TSHR ectodomain. Cross-linking of 125I-TSH to this new construct clearly indicated cleavage (Fig.4), proving the existence of cleavage site 1. Remarkably, the mutation (GQE367–369NET) that abrogates cleavage at site 2 introduces a consensus sequence for anN-linked glycosylation site (N-X-(S/T)). A carbohydrate side chain in this vicinity could, therefore, prevent ectodomain cleavage, for example by steric hindrance of a cleavage enzyme. As mentioned above, the mutagenesis strategy used to investigate cleavage site 2 in the TSHR involved substitution into the TSHR of the corresponding segments of the non-cleaving LH/CG receptor. The GQE367–369NET substitution in the TSHR transposes NET291–293 from the LH/CG receptor, a motif that is glycosylated in the latter receptor (27Davis D.P. Rozell T.G. Liu X. Segaloff D.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine the functional significance of the GQE367–369NET substitution in TSH-LHR-4, we introduced into this chimeric receptor a motif (AAA) that would not be a potential glycosylation site (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the noncleaving receptor, TSH-LHR-4GQE367–369AAA did cleave (Fig.3 B). Attempts to determine directly by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation whether or not the GQE367–369NET substitution in TSH-LHR-4 was caused by the introduction of an N-linked glycan were noninformative. Thus, two antibodies to the B subunit that we obtained did not definitively identify the B subunit because of a weak signal and the presence of many other bands (presumably synthetic or degradation products) in cell homogenates. These observations reinforced the value of 125I-TSH cross-linking to intact cells which sees only mature receptor on the cell surface. We, therefore, introduced additional mutations at the GQE367–369 triplet to explore further the possibility role of N-linked glycosylation at this site upon substitution with NET. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutation GQE367–369NQE (not an N-linked glycosylation motif) in TSHR-LHR-4, unlike in the wild-type TSHR, did not prevent cleavage (Fig. 5, A andB). Further, a GQE367–369NQT substitution (an alternative N-linked glycan motif) largely (Fig.5 A) or completely (Fig. 5 B) eliminated receptor cleavage. Partial inhibition of receptor cleavage with the NQTversus the NET mutation may be explained by recent evidence that the middle residue (X) in the N-X-(S/T) motif has a major effect on the efficiency of N-linked glycosylation (28Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The evolutionary divergence of the TSHR into a receptor that cleaves into two subunits is unique and enigmatic. Unlike thrombin (29Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar), TSH does not cleave its receptor; two-subunit TSHRs are present in transfected cells cultured in the absence of TSH (5Russo D. Chazenbalk G.D. Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1607-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Misrahi M. Ghinea N. Sar S. Saunier B. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Cerutti M. Devauchelle G. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). TSH binds to both cleaved and uncleaved forms of the TSHR. Moreover, TSH action does not require a cleaved receptor (23Russo D. Nagayama Y. Chazenbalk G.D. Wadsworth H.L. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2135-2138PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chazenbalk G.D. McLachlan S.M. Nagayama Y. Rapoport B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One possibility is that TSHR cleavage, including the release of a small polypeptide between cleavage sites 1 and 2, may be related to the very common occurrence of disease-causing autoantibodies, a phenomenon rarely, if ever, encountered with other members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. In summary, data obtained from 33 new TSHR variants stably expressed in CHO cells (i) strongly support the concept of two cleavage sites in the TSHR; (ii) identify three amino acid residues in the TSHR that, when substituted with the homologous residues of the LH/CG receptor, prevent cleavage at the second, downstream cleavage site (site 2); and (iii) reveal that cleavage or noncleavage at this second site appears related to N-linked glycosylation. To our knowledge, the presence or absence of glycosylation represents a novel mechanism by which two closely related receptors have evolved into having a difference in subunit structure. Greater understanding of its structural features will also contribute to a better understanding of why the TSHR is a pivotal autoantigen in human autoimmune disease.
