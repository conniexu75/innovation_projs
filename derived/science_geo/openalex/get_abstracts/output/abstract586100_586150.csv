https://openalex.org/W2610903912,"Positives and negatives of methylated CpG When the DNA bases cytosine and guanine are next to each other, a methyl group is generally added to the pyrimidine, generating a mCpG dinucleotide. This modification alters DNA structure but can also affect function by inhibiting transcription factor (TF) binding. Yin et al. systematically analyzed the effect of CpG methylation on the binding of 542 human TFs (see the Perspective by Hughes and Lambert). In addition to inhibiting binding of some TFs, they found that mCpGs can promote binding of others, particularly TFs involved in development, such as homeodomain proteins.

Here we profile the epigenetic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis in mice and humans. Although some progenitor genes and cell cycle genes were epigenetically silenced during retinogenesis, the most dramatic change was derepression of cell-type-specific differentiation programs. We identified developmental-stage-specific super-enhancers and showed that most epigenetic changes are conserved in humans and mice. To determine how the epigenome changes during tumorigenesis and reprogramming, we performed integrated epigenetic analysis of murine and human retinoblastomas and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from murine rod photoreceptors. The retinoblastoma epigenome mapped to the developmental stage when retinal progenitors switch from neurogenic to terminal patterns of cell division. The epigenome of retinoblastomas was more similar to that of the normal retina than that of retina-derived iPSCs, and we identified retina-specific epigenetic memory.

Recent studies of neurogenesis of human and mouse cortices (Lister et al., 2013Lister R. Mukamel E.A. Nery J.R. Urich M. Puddifoot C.A. Johnson N.D. Lucero J. Huang Y. Dwork A.J.

The cell-type-specific epigenome of differentiated cells is thought to be relatively stable once established during development and is also thought to be a major barrier to reprogramming differentiated cells, such as neurons, into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H.

For some cell types, the resulting iPSCs retain an epigenetic memory of their cellular origins (Hiler et al., 2015Hiler D. Chen X. Hazen J. Kupriyanov S. Carroll P.A. Qu C. Xu B. Johnson D.

Developmental changes in the epigenome are also central to human disease. For example, childhood cancers are developmental tumors that arise during crucial periods of development. Neuroblastomas arise of the sympathoadrenal lineage (Cheung and Dyer, 2013Cheung N.K. Dyer M.A. Neuroblastoma: developmental biology, cancer genomics and immunotherapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 397-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), rhabdomyosarcomas emerge from the muscle lineage (Kashi et al., 2015Kashi V.P. Hatley M.E. Galindo R.L.

Thomas D.M. Translational biology of osteosarcoma.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2014; 14: 722-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Genomic characterization of more than 2,000 childhood cancers revealed that virtually every class of epigenetic regulator is mutated in developmental tumors (Huether et al., 2014Huether R. Dong L. Chen X. Wu G. Parker M. Wei L. Ma J. Edmonson M.N. Hedlund E.K. Rusch M.C. et al.The landscape of somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators across 1,000 paediatric cancer genomes.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the epigenomic and transcriptional changes that occur during retinogenesis and retinoblastoma in humans and mice and iPSCs derived from murine rod photoreceptors to elucidate their epigenetic memory. We found that epigenetic changes play a more important role in activating differentiation genes than in silencing progenitor or proliferation genes during retinal maturation. Several retinal progenitor genes were sequestered in the domain of facultative heterochromatin (f-heterochromatin) in rod nuclei, suggesting an alternative mechanism of silencing developmental genes in neurons. Changes in the epigenome were evolutionarily conserved from mice to humans, with retinoblastomas matching a narrow window of normal development consistent with their developmental origins. Finally, the genes most likely to be retained as epigenetic memory in iPSCs were not necessarily those that undergo the most dramatic epigenetic changes during differentiation. Together, these data show how a comprehensive profile of the changes in the epigenome during development can provide insight into the developmental-stage-specific and cellular origins of pediatric cancer and the relations among the epigenomes of progenitors, stem cells, and cancer cells. Previous studies have shown changes in DNA methylation that correlate with changes in gene expression in the developing CNS (Lister et al., 2013Lister R. Mukamel E.A. Nery J.R. Urich M.

Here we extend those studies to retina, an ideal tissue in which to study the dynamics of the epigenome during development. Retina growth has been extensively characterized (Figures 1A and 1B; Young, 1984Young R.W. Cell death during differentiation of the retina in the mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 1984; 229: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, Young, 1985aYoung R.W. Cell differentiation in the retina of the mouse.Anat.

Cell proliferation during postnatal development of the retina in the mouse.Brain Res. 1985; 353: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the birth order and birth dates of the seven classes of retinal cell types are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species (Figure 1C; Young, 1985aYoung R.W. Cell differentiation in the retina of the mouse.Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, Young, 1985bYoung R.W. Cell proliferation during postnatal development of the retina in the mouse.Brain Res. 1985; 353: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To characterize the epigenetic landscape during mouse and human retinogenesis, we analyzed eight developmental stages that span key developmental transitions (Figure 1C; Young, 1985aYoung R.W. Cell differentiation in the retina of the mouse.Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, Young, 1985bYoung R.W. Cell proliferation during postnatal development of the retina in the mouse.Brain Res. 1985; 353: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To profile DNA methylation changes, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses for each stage of mouse (embryonic day [E]14.5, E17.5, postnatal day [P]0, P3, P7, P10, P14, and P21) and human (developmental week [FW]10, 14, 17–21, and 23) retinal development and compared the changes in DNA methylation with those in gene expression. In the developing mouse retina, the DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b) have dynamic expression (Figure S1), but there was no global change in DNA methylation during retinal development in mice or humans (Figure S2; Singh et al., 2016Singh R.K. Mallela R.K. Hayes A. Dunham N.R. Hedden M.E. Enke R.A. Fariss R.N. Sternberg H. West M.D. Nasonkin I.O. Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b cooperate in photoreceptor and outer plexiform layer development in the mammalian retina.Exp. Eye Res. 2016; (Published online November 16, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2016.11.014Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We identified 12% (473/3,918) of genes with decreased expression and 26% (1,143/4,313) with increased expression during murine retinogenesis, with significantly (p < 0.05) inversely correlated changes in DNA methylation (Figures 1D and 1E; Data S1, Table S1). Similarly, 9% (208/2,407) of the genes had decreased expression and 13% (445/3,330) had increased expression during human retinogenesis with significant (p < 0.05) inversely correlated changes in DNA methylation (Figures 1F and 1G; Data S1, Table S1). As expected, most downregulated genes encoded proteins that regulate proliferation, and most upregulated genes encoded proteins that contribute to neuronal differentiation (Data S1, Table S2). To complement our unbiased analysis of the entire epigenome during retinogenesis, we performed a similar analysis of four validated retinal gene sets (Cherry et al., 2009Cherry T.J. Trimarchi J.M.

Individual retinal progenitor cells display extensive heterogeneity of gene expression.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); these included those important for the G2/M transition in the cell cycle of proliferating retinal progenitors, those expressed in retinal progenitors that are not cell cycle genes, those expressed in rods during differentiation, and ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes (Data S1, Table S3 and Figures 2A–2D). Early in development (E14.5), most cells are proliferating retinal progenitors (Young, 1985aYoung R.W. Cell differentiation in the retina of the mouse.Anat. Rec. 1985; 212: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, Young, 1985bYoung R.W. Cell proliferation during postnatal development of the retina in the mouse.Brain Res. 1985; 353: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), so their epigenetic profile should be apparent in embryonic retinae (Figures 1C, 2A, and 2B), while in late, postnatal retinae (P10, P14, and P21), the majority (80%) of cells are rods, so their epigenetic profile should be apparent (Figures 1C and 2C) in contrast to control housekeeping genes whose expression does not change (Figure 2D). DNA methylation and gene expression were inversely correlated over the course of murine retinal development in 3% (7/235) of the progenitor genes, 0% (0/43) of the G2/M genes, 38% (73/190) of the rod genes, and 4% (1/22) of the housekeeping genes (Data S1, Table S4). These trends were similar for other cell-type-specific differentiation programs in human retina (Data S1, Table S4); they show that changes in DNA methylation accompany critical changes in gene expression during retinogenesis, but only account for a small fraction (3%–38%) of the total number of developmentally regulated genes. To determine whether other epigenetic changes accompany the gene-expression changes during retinogenesis, we performed ChIP-seq of eight histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K27Ac, H3K36me3, H3K9/14Ac, and H3K9me3), as well as of CTCF, Brd4, and RNA PolII across all eight developmental stages in mice. Due to the limited availability of human retinal tissue, we analyzed four developmental stages in human retina (FW13/14, FW15/16, FW18/20, and FW23/24) corresponding to E17.5, P0, P3, and P7, respectively, in the mouse (Figure 1C; Workman et al., 2013Workman A.D. Charvet C.J. Clancy B. Darlington R.B. Finlay B.L. Modeling transformations of neurodevelopmental sequences across mammalian species.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7368-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Temporal change in the epigenetic landscape of the promoter’s proximal regions (± 2 kb from the transcription start site [TSS]) closely mirrored that of gene expression. For example, Uhrf1 is a progenitor gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates gene expression in proliferating cells via epigenetic mechanisms that involve interactions with Dnmt1 (Berkyurek et al., 2014Berkyurek A.C. Suetake I. Arita K. Takeshita K. Nakagawa A. Shirakawa M. Tajima S. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 directly interacts with the SET and RING finger-associated (SRA) domain of the multifunctional protein Uhrf1 to facilitate accession of the catalytic center to hemi-methylated DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). During embryonic stages of retinal development, when the proportion of proliferating progenitors is highest, Uhrf1 had H3K4me1/2/3, H3K27Ac, and H3K9/14Ac histone modifications spanning the promoter, H3K36me3 in the gene body, and RNA PolII and Brd4 at the promoter (Figure 2E), consistent with active transcription and the stages when Uhrf1 expression is highest (Figure 2E). As development progressed and Uhrf1 expression was extinguished, the H3K36me3 modification was lost from the gene body; PolII, Brd4, and H3 acetylation were lost at the promoter; and H3K4me1/2/3 modifications were reduced (Figure 2E). Repressive histone marks (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) and DNA methylation were absent from the TSS throughout development, suggesting that Uhrf1 is not actively silenced by H3K27me3, H3K9me3, or DNA methylation in mature retinal neurons (Figure 2E). In contrast to Uhrf1, some progenitor genes showed accumulation of the H3K27me3-repressive mark as they were silenced during retinal differentiation. Ascl1 is a proneural bHLH protein expressed in retinal progenitors during murine development (Brzezinski et al., 2011Brzezinski 4th, J.A. Kim E.J. Johnson J.E. Reh T.A. Ascl1 expression defines a subpopulation of lineage-restricted progenitors in the mammalian retina.Development. 2011; 138: 3519-3531Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The pattern of histone marks and PolII/Brd4 binding for the Ascl1 gene during early development (E17.5) is similar to that of Uhrf1 (Figure 2F). However, when retinal progenitors are depleted (∼P7), Ascl1 expression was silenced, and H3K27me3 accumulated at the promoter and throughout the gene body (Figure 2F). The promoter and gene body DNA remained hypomethylated in the differentiated retina. Rod-specific genes that are transcriptionally activated during later stages of development as the cells differentiate show the opposite pattern of epigenomic changes. For example, the Stx3 gene encodes a protein that is required for rod synaptic transmission (Mazelova et al., 2009Mazelova J. Ransom N. Astuto-Gribble L. Wilson M.C. Deretic D. Syntaxin 3 and SNAP-25 pairing, regulated by omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid, controls the delivery of rhodopsin for the biogenesis of cilia-derived sensory organelles, the rod outer segments.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 2003-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and it was marked by insulator protein CTCF ChIP-seq peaks from early in development (Figure 2G). There were H3K4me1/2/3 marks and H3 acetylation (H3K27Ac and H3K9/14Ac) marks at the promoter, but no Brd4 or PolII present between E14.5 and P0 (Figure 2G). The colocalization of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3/H3K27Ac at the Stx3 promoter during early development suggested that it is a bivalent or poised promoter (Figure 2G; Voigt et al., 2013Voigt P. Tee W.W. Reinberg D. A double take on bivalent promoters.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1318-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of expression and Brd4/PolII binding early during development, there was no H3K36me3 in the gene body. As rods differentiated and gene transcription increased, H3K27me3 was depleted at the promoter, PolII and Brd4 increased, H3K36me3 accumulated across the gene body, and the active histone marks (H3K4me1/2/3, H3K27Ac, and H3K9/14Ac) spread 3′ into the body of the gene, with a corresponding reduction in DNA methylation in this region downstream of the TSS (Figure 2G). To define the chromatin states and more efficiently analyze the transitions thereof across the genome, we performed chromatin hidden Markov modeling (chromHMM) using all 176 murine ChIP-seq datasets (Ernst and Kellis, 2012Ernst J. Kellis M. ChromHMM: automating chromatin-state discovery and characterization.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). ChromHMM enables systematic annotation of the epigenetic states across the human and mouse genomes during retinogenesis. Based on computational methods and manual review, we selected 11 chromHMM chromatin states for analysis (Figure 3A). State 1 had epigenetic marks consistent with actively transcribed genes, states 2 and 3 were predominantly enhancers, and state 4 identified bivalent promoters (Voigt et al., 2013Voigt P. Tee W.W. Reinberg D. A double take on bivalent promoters.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1318-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). State 5 was primarily defined by PolII binding, and states 6 and 7 were consistent with gene bodies (H3K36me3). State 8 represented polycomb-repressed chromatin (H3K27me3) outside of the promoter or enhancers, state 9 was empty chromatin, and state 10 was the H3K9me3-repressed chromatin. Finally, state 11 was marked by the insulator protein CTCF. The transitions in chromHMM state at progenitor, G2/M, rod, and housekeeping genes across development were consistent with changes in gene expression and individual ChIP-seq data (Figures 3B, S4A, and S4B). Overall, the active promoter/enhancer marks (states 1–3) were increased for rod genes and decreased for progenitor and G2/M genes during development; states 1–3 were unchanged for the housekeeping genes (Figures S4C–S4F) and were conserved across human and mouse retinal development (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4E–S4H; Data S1, Table S5). Analysis of the chromHMM-state transition for the 133 rod genes with the most robust changes in gene expression during retinal development (Data S1, Table S3, cluster 1) identified 26 (20%) genes that had H3K27me3 marks (states 4 and 8) early in development and then transitioned to active promoters (states 1–3) as the rods differentiated (Data S1, Table S6 and Figures S5A–S5C). We identified 19% (33/174) of the progenitor genes with the most robust changes (Data S1, Table S3, cluster 1) that had the opposite pattern (Data S1, Table S6; Figures S5D and S5E). Similar trends were observed for human retina (Data S1, Table S6; Figures S5F–S5I). Beyond those select rod and progenitor genes, an additional 584 genes had chromHMM-state transitions consistent with H3K27me3 derepression (loss of H3K27me3) and 486 had chromHMM-state transitions consistent with H3K27me3 repression (gain of H3K27me3) during murine retinogenesis, with corresponding changes in gene expression (Data S1, Table S6). Similar trends were observed in human retina (Data S1, Table S6), with fewer genes due to the limited retinal stages available for ChIP-seq. To extend our analysis, we performed hierarchical clustering of all the chromHMM data integrated with gene-expression data. We identified four groups of genes with developmental chromHMM and expression patterns similar to those of the rod gene set described above (Figure 3E). There were 314 genes that showed chromHMM-state transitions during development that were consistent with low or no expression early in development to very high expression in the mature retina, and there were an additional 206 genes that showed chromHMM-state transitions consistent with low or no expression early during development to intermediate expression during retinal differentiation (Figure 3E; Data S1, Table S7). We identified 756 genes that had developmental chromHMM and gene-expression patterns similar to those of the retinal progenitor and G2/M genes (Figure 3F; Data S1, Table S7). Of the 4,313 genes that increased expression during retinal development (Figure 1E; Data S1, Table S1), 1,143 had changes in DNA methylation, 582 had changes in H3K27me3, and 520 had changes in epigenetic state, as measured by chromHMM modeling. In total, 40% (1,734/4,313) of upregulated genes had at least one type of correlated epigenetic change (Figure 3G; Data S1, Table S7). Of the 3,918 genes that decreased expression during retinal development (Figure 1D; Data S1, Table S1), 472 had changes in DNA methylation, 484 had changes in H3K27me3, and 756 had changes in epigenetic state, as measured by chromHMM modeling. In total, 36% (1,402/3,918) of downregulated genes had at least one type of correlated epigenetic change (Figure 3H; Data S1, Table S7). To explore the relations among DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromHMM state during development, we calculated the proportion of each chromHMM state for the genes that are upregulated, that are hypomethylated, and that simultaneously increase expression and downregulate DNA methylation (Figure S6; Data S1, Table S8). We performed a similar analysis for the downregulated genes (Figure S6; Data S1, Table S8). Overall, the genes that change their expression and DNA methylation have more pronounced differences in their distribution of active and inactive chromHMM states (Figure S6; Data S1, Table S8). The adult retina is made up of 80% rods, and the other cell types account for 0.2%–7% of the tissue. Genes expressed in other cell types may be epigenetically repressed in rods. In our analysis, such genes would increase expression during development but be positively correlated with changes in H3K27me3 and/or chromHMM-repressive states, since RNA-seq analysis is more sensitive than ChIP-seq analysis. Therefore, the increase in gene expression that accompanies differentiation could be detected from the less abundant cell types (cones, amacrine, horizontal, bipolar, ganglion, and Müller glia), but the epigenetic profile would be dominated by the rods. To test this, we analyzed the chromHMM and gene-expression data for 136 cone genes, 154 bipolar genes, 65 Müller glial genes, 486 amacrine cell genes, and 131 ganglion cell genes (Data S1, Table S9; Blackshaw et al., 2001Blackshaw S.

However, it is unclear whether neurexins are fundamental building blocks of all synapses with similar overall functions or context-dependent specifiers of synapse properties. To address this question, we produced triple cKO (conditional knockout) mice that allow ablating all neurexin expression in mice. Using neuron-specific manipulations combined with immunocytochemistry, paired recordings, and two-photon Ca2+ imaging, we analyzed excitatory synapses formed by climbing fibers on Purkinje cells in cerebellum and inhibitory synapses formed by parvalbumin- or somatostatin-positive interneurons on pyramidal layer 5 neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. After pan-neurexin deletions, we observed in these synapses severe but dramatically different synaptic phenotypes that ranged from major impairments in their distribution and function (climbing-fiber synapses) to large decreases in synapse numbers (parvalbumin-positive synapses) and severe alterations in action potential-induced presynaptic Ca2+ transients (somatostatin-positive synapses). Thus, neurexins function primarily as context-dependent specifiers of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2611090267,"Terrestrial laser scanning is a powerful technology for capturing the three-dimensional structure of forests with a high level of detail and accuracy. Over the last decade, many algorithms have been developed to extract various tree parameters from terrestrial laser scanning data. Here we present 3D Forest, an open-source non-platform-specific software application with an easy-to-use graphical user interface with the compilation of algorithms focused on the forest environment and extraction of tree parameters. The current version (0.42) extracts important parameters of forest structure from the terrestrial laser scanning data, such as stem positions (X, Y, Z), tree heights, diameters at breast height (DBH), as well as more advanced parameters such as tree planar projections, stem profiles or detailed crown parameters including convex and concave crown surface and volume. Moreover, 3D Forest provides quantitative measures of between-crown interactions and their real arrangement in 3D space. 3D Forest also includes an original algorithm of automatic tree segmentation and crown segmentation. Comparison with field data measurements showed no significant difference in measuring DBH or tree height using 3D Forest, although for DBH only the Randomized Hough Transform algorithm proved to be sufficiently resistant to noise and provided results comparable to traditional field measurements."

Although the complexity of communication varies considerably between vocal learning and innate vocalizing species, there is broad conservation of the use of frequency and amplitude modulation, multisyllabic patterns, and variable syllable durations and rates to signal caller identity, sex, intentionality, and affective state (Bradbury and Vehrencamp, 2011Bradbury J.W.

Understanding the complex vocalization structure of mice will be key to advancing vocal and social communication research. There is a rich history of efforts to assess the social meaning of USVs, yet despite evidence that they serve important communicative functions in mice, it remains unclear which acoustic features and types relate to specific biological states or affect social outcomes. To address the social meaning of USVs, the field has used syllable classification schemes: among the most popular are manual or semi-automated classification of syllables into ∼9–12 broad categories based on spectral shapes (e.g., chevron, upward, frequency step) (Grimsley et al., 2011Grimsley J.M.

Yet there remains a lack of consensus on which classification schemes provide the best biological insights (Arriaga and Jarvis, 2013Arriaga G. Jarvis E.D.

In our initial attempts to examine genetic and environmental factors that influence USV production and syllable repertoires in a large genetic reference panel (GRP) of recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, we encountered theoretical and technical challenges using current categorical approaches in large datasets (>500,000 syllables). In particular, categorical (rule-based) syllable classification might not provide sufficient sensitivity to detect unique syllable types, which could have condition- or strain-specific meaning. In addition, no technique included important signal detection features (noise detection and removal, time stamp) needed to facilitate processing of large volumes of recordings across conditions or laboratories and, ultimately, to determine if differences in syllable timing and type meaningfully relate to ongoing behaviors and behavioral transitions—a long-standing question in the field. One strategy to address these issues is the application of signal processing methods used in human speech and language analysis (O’Grady and Pearlmutter, 2008O’Grady P. Pearlmutter B.

Here, we report a novel NeuroResouce, open-access Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction (MUPET) software. This MATLAB tool with graphical user interface (Figure S1) is inspired by human speech processing (Patterson et al., 1987Patterson, R., Nimmo-Smith, I., Holdsworth, J., and Rice, P. (1987).

Multimed. 2012; 14: 1684-1689Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and uses a gammatone filterbank to convert USVs into compact acoustic feature representations, or GF-USVs (see Results and STAR Methods). The latest version of MUPET, including a subset of the audio recordings described in this paper and an experimental tutorial, is available for download at http://sail.usc.edu/mupet. Using an automated and unsupervised algorithmic approach, MUPET has five core capabilities that enable it to detect, learn, and compare syllable types and repertoires: (1) syllable detection—the isolation and measurement of basic spectro-temporal syllable parameters; (2) acoustical dataset analysis—analysis of overall vocalization features, such as syllable number, rate and duration, spectral density, and fundamental frequency; (3) syllable repertoire building—the extraction of up to several hundred of the most highly represented syllable types (“repertoire units,” RUs) in individual datasets using machine learning; (4) measures of syllable repertoire similarity—rank order comparisons of the similarity of spectral types of individual RUs across datasets; and (5) RU cluster analysis—a centroid-based cluster analysis of RUs composing different dataset syllable repertoires in order to measure the frequency of use of different RUs (syllable types) across conditions. MUPET builds syllable repertoires—a collection of different syllable types used by a specific mouse or strain under various experimental conditions—and compares them both independently and as a function of how frequently each syllable type is used. Syllables occur in patterned sequences (syntax), and communicative information in USVs is likely encoded through both syntax and several features of individual syllables, including mean frequency, amplitude, duration, and shape (Chabout et al., 2015Chabout J.

A central feature of MUPET is to determine the specific syllable types that are present in mouse vocalization repertoires. The software accomplishes this by examining the entire frequency contour (slope, duration, and frequency modulation of each note), but not as a function of fundamental frequency or amplitude. This is supported by evidence in humans and mice that syllables (phonemes) are the basic communicative units and that variations in fundamental frequency (intonation, prosody) and amplitude convey additional information about social motivation, mood, or genetic background (Adolphs et al., 2002Adolphs R.

MUPET provides users with spectro-temporal measures for each syllable and dataset (Figure S1). MUPET is designed to build separate syllable repertoires for each strain or condition, which are used for subsequent repertoire comparisons. This strategy increases the precision of syllable repertoire builds, which facilitates the accuracy of subsequent comparisons of vocal production and repertoire use across strains and behavioral conditions (see below).

While recent work has suggested unique roles for CA2, including encoding position during immobility and generating ripple oscillations, an interventional examination of the integrative functions of these connections has yet to be reported. Here we demonstrate that CA2 recruits feedforward inhibition in CA3 and that chronic genetically engineered shutdown of CA2-pyramidal-cell synaptic transmission consequently results in increased excitability of the recurrent CA3 network. In behaving mice, this led to spatially triggered episodes of network-wide hyperexcitability during exploration accompanied by the emergence of high-frequency discharges during rest. These findings reveal CA2 as a regulator of network processing in hippocampus and suggest that CA2-mediated inhibition in CA3 plays a key role in establishing the dynamic excitatory and inhibitory balance required for proper network function."
https://openalex.org/W2610566370,"The concerted production of neurons and glia by neural stem cells (NSCs) is essential for neural circuit assembly. In the developing cerebral cortex, radial glia progenitors (RGPs) generate nearly all neocortical neurons and certain glia lineages. RGP proliferation behavior shows a high degree of non-stochasticity, thus a deterministic characteristic of neuron and glia production. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling RGP behavior and proliferation dynamics in neurogenesis and glia generation remain unknown. By using mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM)-based genetic paradigms enabling the sparse and global knockout with unprecedented single-cell resolution, we identified Lgl1 as a critical regulatory component. We uncover Lgl1-dependent tissue-wide community effects required for embryonic cortical neurogenesis and novel cell-autonomous Lgl1 functions controlling RGP-mediated glia genesis and postnatal NSC behavior. These results suggest that NSC-mediated neuron and glia production is tightly regulated through the concerted interplay of sequential Lgl1-dependent global and cell intrinsic mechanisms."

Understanding the patterns of utilization of AYUSH care has been important for various reasons including an increased focus on its mainstreaming and integration with biomedicine-based health care system. Based on a nationally representative health survey 2014, we present an analysis to understand utilization of AYUSH care across socioeconomic and demographic groups in India. Overall, 6.9% of all patients seeking outpatient care in the reference period of last two weeks have used AYUSH services without any significant differentials across rural and urban India. Importantly, public health facilities play a key role in provisioning of AYUSH care in rural areas with higher utilization in Chhattisgarh, Kerala and West Bengal. Use of AYUSH among middle-income households is lower when compared with poorer and richer households. We also find that low-income households display a greater tendency for AYUSH self-medication. AYUSH care utilization is higher among patients with chronic diseases and also for treating skin-related and musculo-skeletal ailments. Although the overall share of AYUSH prescription drugs in total medical expenditure is only about 6% but the average expenditure for drugs on AYUSH and allopathy did not differ hugely. The discussion compares our estimates and findings with other studies and also highlights major policy issues around mainstreaming of AYUSH care."
https://openalex.org/W2611420814,"As the sustainability of agricultural citizen science projects depends on volunteer farmers who contribute their time, energy and skills, understanding their motivation is important to attract and retain participants in citizen science projects. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) farmers’ motivations to participate as citizen scientists and 2) farmers’ mobile telephone usage. Building on motivational factors identified from previous citizen science studies, a questionnaire based methodology was developed which allowed the analysis of motivational factors and their relation to farmers’ characteristics. The questionnaire was applied in three communities of farmers, in countries from different continents, participating as citizen scientists. We used statistical tests to compare motivational factors within and among the three countries. In addition, the relations between motivational factors and farmers characteristics were assessed. Lastly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to group farmers based on their motivations. Although there was an overlap between the types of motivations, for Indian farmers a collectivistic type of motivation (i.e., contribute to scientific research) was more important than egoistic and altruistic motivations. For Ethiopian and Honduran farmers an egoistic intrinsic type of motivation (i.e., interest in sharing information) was most important. While fun has appeared to be an important egoistic intrinsic factor to participate in other citizen science projects, the smallholder farmers involved in this research valued ‘passing free time’ the lowest. Two major groups of farmers were distinguished: one motivated by sharing information (egoistic intrinsic), helping (altruism) and contribute to scientific research (collectivistic) and one motivated by egoistic extrinsic factors (expectation, expert interaction and community interaction). Country and education level were the two most important farmers’ characteristics that explain around 20% of the variation in farmers motivations. For educated farmers, contributing to scientific research was a more important motivation to participate as citizen scientists compared to less educated farmers. We conclude that motivations to participate in citizen science are different for smallholders in agriculture compared to other sectors. Citizen science does have high potential, but easy to use mechanisms are needed. Moreover, gamification may increase the egoistic intrinsic motivation of farmers."

Specific diagnostic markers for early MPM diagnosis are needed. Changes in miRNA expression have been implicated in several diseases and cancers, including MPM. We examined if a specific miRNA signature in plasmatic extracellular vesicles (EV) may help to discriminate between malignant pleural mesothelioma patients (MPM) and subjects with Past Asbestos Exposure (PAE).We investigated 23 MPM patients and 19 cancer-free subjects with past asbestos exposure (PAE). We screened 754 miRNAs in plasmatic EVs by OpenArray and found 55 differential miRNAs using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and smoking. Among the top-20 differential miRNAs chosen for validation by Real time PCR, 16 were confirmed. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the most discriminating miRNA combination was given by miR-103a-3p + miR-30e-3p, which generated an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI 0.87-1.00), with a sensitivity of 95.5% and a specificity of 80.0%. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis including gender, age, BMI and smoking we found a Hazard Ratio for miR-103a-3p above the median of 0.37 (95%CI 0.13-1.13) and of 0.51 (95%CI 0.17-1.52) for miR-30e-3p.This study suggests EV-associated miR-103a-3p and miR-30e-3p are able to discriminate MPM from PAE subjects. Larger and prospective studies are needed to confirm these two-miRNA signature alone or in combination with other biomarkers as diagnostic tools for MPM."
https://openalex.org/W2610528914,"During development, newborn interneurons migrate throughout the embryonic brain. Here, we provide evidence that these interneurons act in a paracrine fashion to regulate developmental oligodendrocyte formation. Specifically, we show that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) interneurons secrete factors that promote genesis of oligodendrocytes from glially biased cortical precursors in culture. Moreover, when MGE interneurons are genetically ablated in vivo prior to their migration, this causes a deficit in cortical oligodendrogenesis. Modeling of the interneuron-precursor paracrine interaction using transcriptome data identifies the cytokine fractalkine as responsible for the pro-oligodendrocyte effect in culture. This paracrine interaction is important in vivo, since knockdown of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 in embryonic cortical precursors, or constitutive knockout of CX3CR1, causes decreased numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes in the postnatal cortex. Thus, in addition to their role in regulating neuronal excitability, interneurons act in a paracrine fashion to promote the developmental genesis of oligodendrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2610824927,"Maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis is critical to glycemic function. Genetic variants mapping to chromosome 8p23.1 in genome-wide association studies have been linked to glycemic traits in humans. The gene of known function closest to the mapped region, PPP1R3B (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B), encodes a protein (GL) that regulates glycogen metabolism in the liver. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that hepatic PPP1R3B is associated with glycemic traits. We generated mice with either liver-specific deletion (Ppp1r3bΔhep) or liver-specific overexpression of Ppp1r3b. The Ppp1r3b deletion significantly reduced glycogen synthase protein abundance, and the remaining protein was predominantly phosphorylated and inactive. As a consequence, glucose incorporation into hepatic glycogen was significantly impaired, total hepatic glycogen content was substantially decreased, and mice lacking hepatic Ppp1r3b had lower fasting plasma glucose than controls. The concomitant loss of liver glycogen impaired whole-body glucose homeostasis and increased hepatic expression of glycolytic enzymes in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice relative to controls in the postprandial state. Eight hours of fasting significantly increased the expression of two critical gluconeogenic enzymes, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, above the levels in control livers. Conversely, the liver-specific overexpression of Ppp1r3b enhanced hepatic glycogen storage above that of controls and, as a result, delayed the onset of fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Moreover, mice overexpressing hepatic Ppp1r3b upon long-term fasting (12–36 h) were protected from blood ketone-body accumulation, unlike control and Ppp1r3bΔhep mice. These findings indicate a major role for Ppp1r3b in regulating hepatic glycogen stores and whole-body glucose/energy homeostasis. Maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis is critical to glycemic function.

These findings indicate a major role for Ppp1r3b in regulating hepatic glycogen stores and whole-body glucose/energy homeostasis. The Meta-Analysis of Glucose and Insulin related traits Consortium (MAGIC) study analyzed data sets from multiple cohorts that contained both genome-wide genotype data and quantitative clinical measurements of human plasma glycemic traits. Among the 12 loci identified in this study, one signal mapping to chromosome 8p23.1 was associated both with fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. The lead variant, rs4841132, most strongly associated with fasting plasma glucose mapped to an intergenic region 1 kb from the 5′ end of LOC157273 gene, a long non-coding RNA transcript of unknown function, and 174 kb from the protein-coding PPP1R3B gene. Despite the 174-kb separation from the PPP1R3B gene, rs9987289 has been identified as an expression quantitative trait locus for PPP1R3B: the minor allele is associated with higher levels of PPP1R3B mRNA in the liver (and is also associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin levels). This observation prompted us to investigate the possibility that the genetic association with glycemic traits identified by these non-coding variants was due to their effects on the expression of PPP1R3B. PPP1R3B (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B; also historically known as GL) is a regulator of liver glycogen metabolism. In the liver, sequestration of dietary glucose into glycogen is an important and tightly regulated component of whole-body glucose homeostasis, promoting maintenance of systemic homeostasis in blood glucose levels through glycogen storage during the postprandial period and its breakdown during fasting (1.Bollen M.

Glycogen-targeting subunits recruit the phosphatases and kinases that post-translationally regulate the activation of GS and inactivation of GP.

Ppp1r3c knock-out mice had reduced hepatic glycogen and were glucose-intolerant and insulin-resistant (10.Crosson S.M. Khan A. Printen J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. PTG gene deletion causes impaired glycogen synthesis and developmental insulin resistance.J. Clin.

Liver glycogen reduces food intake and attenuates obesity in a high-fat diet-fed mouse model.Diabetes. 2015; 64: 796-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although the glycogen phenotypes of the Ppp1r3c knock-out and transgenic overexpression mice were opposite in direction, both mouse models had reduced hepatic TG content compared with controls (11.López-Soldado I.

In the case of the transgenic Ppp1r3c mouse, hepatic fat remained lower than controls despite 12–24 weeks of high fat diet (45% kcal fat) feeding. However, mice genetically modified to lack or overexpress Ppp1r3b have not been reported to date. GL is unique among the glycogen-targeting subunits, in that in addition to promoting the activation of glycogen synthase by PP1 dephosphorylation, GL also targets PP1 to GP, where the dephosphorylation inactivates GP. Thus, under conditions of abundant cellular glucose (as glucose-6-phosphate), the PP1-GL complex simultaneously activates the glycogen synthetic pathway and inactivates glycogen catabolism. Mice in which this GP regulatory binding site has been mutated improved hepatic glycogen storage capacity and systemic glucose disposal (13.Kelsall I.R. Rosenzweig D. Cohen P.T. Disruption of the allosteric phosphorylase a regulation of the hepatic glycogen-targeted protein phosphatase 1 improves glucose tolerance in vivo.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Inspired by the human genetics suggesting that variation in hepatic expression of PPP1R3B is an important determinant of glycemic traits, we generated mice with liver-specific deletion of Ppp1r3b (Ppp1r3bΔhep) or with hepatic overexpression of Ppp1r3b using adeno-associated virus (AAV). Floxed Ppp1r3b was inactivated in liver either by a transgenic albumin promoter-driven Cre recombinase, or by injecting adeno-associated virus expressing Cre (AAV-Cre). Despite an almost complete lack of hepatic glycogen in the fed state as well as upon fasting, Ppp1r3bΔhep mice are viable but are prone to hypoglycemia upon fasting and utilize non-carbohydrate precursors to maintain fasted blood glucose levels. Conversely, liver-specific overexpression of Ppp1r3b enhanced hepatic glycogen storage, and as a consequence, AAV-Ppp1r3b mice had a delayed decrease in plasma glucose and exhibited significantly delayed accumulation of blood ketone bodies in response to long-term fasting. These observations are consistent with the fact that natural human genetic variants associated with higher liver expression of PPP1R3B have higher fasting plasma glucose. To investigate the role of Ppp1r3b in the liver, we generated mice lacking this gene exclusively in the liver (see “Experimental procedures” and supplemental Fig. S1A). Liver-specific Ppp1r3b knock-out mice (Ppp1r3bΔhep) were viable, born at the expected frequency for Mendelian inheritance, and showed normal fertility. In all subsequent experiments, mice without the Cre transgene (Ppp1r3bflox/flox) were used as controls. In Ppp1r3bΔhep mice, transcript levels were negligible in the liver, with 97% deletion efficiency observed, and there was no compensatory increase in gene expression of other glycogen-targeting subunits: GM (Ppp1r3a) and PTG (Ppp1r3c) (Fig. 1A). Ppp1r3bΔhep mice showed normal growth rates on chow diet, with no differences observed in body weights between genotypes up to 50 weeks of age (supplemental Fig. S1B). Hepatic glycogen content was significantly reduced in ad libitum fed state in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice, which was rapidly depleted upon short-term, 4-h fasting as measured biochemically (Fig. 1B). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining of liver sections showed positive staining for glycogen in control hepatocytes as indicated by the purple color under these two conditions (Fig. 1C). The weight of the liver of Ppp1r3bΔhep mice was also modestly decreased compared with controls (supplemental Fig. S1C), likely because of a lack of glycogen stores, which with their associated water content account for 5% of liver mass (3.Stalmans W. Bollen M. Mvumbi L. Control of glycogen synthesis in health and disease.Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 127-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We used AAV-Cre in Ppp1r3bflox/flox mice as a second approach to generate liver-specific knock-out of Ppp1r3b and found effects on hepatic glycogen and plasma glucose (supplemental Fig. S2) comparable to those in the Alb-Cre mice. Alb-Cre mice were used for the studies presented here, unless otherwise specified. Glycogen content in skeletal muscle presented no substantial differences among genotypes under ad libitum fed and 4-h fasted conditions (supplemental Fig. S1D). To investigate the glycogen synthesis rate in these mice, we performed 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose incorporation into glycogen in glucose-responsive tissues: liver, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius), and kidney, as a surrogate measurement of GS activity. Radioactivity in the glycogen pellet from tissue lysates was measured at 30 and 60 min and quantified as a percentage of glucose specific activity of total radioactivity in plasma and of total protein content. In this experiment, Ppp1r3bΔhep mice exhibited significantly reduced glycogen synthase activity in the liver, whereas its activity was not different in skeletal muscle or kidney (Fig. 1D). Thus, the loss of hepatic Ppp1r3b results in a smaller liver with reduced GS activity and glycogen content in ad libitum fed and 4-h fasted mice. Ppp1r3bΔhep mice have significant reduction in GS but not GP at the protein level, but no differences at the mRNA levels in both the liver and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2). The ratio of GS phosphorylated at serine position 641 to total GS, which determines the activity status of GS, is increased, suggesting that GS is phosphorylated and largely inactivated in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice (Fig. 2C). The nearly complete loss of dephosphorylated [activated] GS protein likely parallels the depletion of glycogen granules because overnight fasted control mice also reached a similar depletion of glycogen, and protein levels of active/dephosphorylated GS were similar in control and Ppp1r3bΔhep livers after an overnight fast (Fig. 2D). The molecular mechanism by which Ppp1r3bΔhep deletion leads to hyperphosphorylation of GS and marked reduction in total GS protein content even during the ad libitum fed state remains to be further explored. Thus, a loss of hepatic Ppp1r3b results in a reduced glycogen synthase protein and activity state in the liver, consistent with the observation of reduced glucose incorporation of into liver glycogen and overall glycogen depletion. Postprandial glucose levels in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice are modestly lower, and Ppp1r3bΔhep mice become mildly hypoglycemic after a 4-h fast (Fig. 3A). Within 4–8 h of fasting, blood glucose in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice dropped to a significantly lower value than control mice, which reached similarly low blood glucose only after longer-term fasting of up to 24 h. (Fig. 3B). We hypothesized that alternative metabolites compensate for the lack of hepatic glycogen stores to substitute for the maintenance of blood glucose as an energy source to peripheral tissues and the central nervous system. In the postprandial state, plasma lactate levels were increased in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice compared with controls (Fig. 3C). Upon prolonged fasting (12 h), total plasma ketone bodies were significantly increased and were progressively elevated by 24- and 36-h fasting periods in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice, compared with controls (Fig. 3D). Moreover, after an overnight fast, gluconeogenesis was increased in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice, as evidenced by a challenge with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pyruvate in which these mice were more efficiently able to synthesize glucose from an exogenous pyruvate load, compared with controls (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these data suggest that although the Ppp1r3bΔhep mice are more prone to enter into a quasifasted state following short-term food deprivation, they are nonetheless able to maintain stable long-term fasting plasma glucose levels by compensatory up-regulation of the gluconeogenic pathway from alternative precursors. In the Ppp1r3b-deficient livers, under ad lib fed conditions, genes that encode enzymes are critical in the glycolytic pathway up-regulated compared with control livers (Fig. 4A); these included aldolase (Aldob), triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk1), phosphoglycerate mutase (Pgam1), enolase (Eno1), and l-pyruvate kinase (Pklr). Upon an 8-h fasting period, there was an up-regulation of gluconeogenic genes (Pepck and G6pc) in Ppp1r3bΔhep mice (Fig. 4B), suggesting that de novo synthesis of glucose is initiated much earlier on in these mice compared with controls. Collectively, these data suggest that with Ppp1r3b deficiency, there is a significant perturbation in nutrient balance that favors shunting of glucose into the glycolysis pathway in the fed state and an early up-regulation of the gluconeogenic pathway in response to fasting. We generated a reciprocal mouse model to express Ppp1r3b at higher than wild-type levels, combining the tropism of AAV serotype 8 and the liver specificity of the TBG/Serpina7 promoter, which has been previously shown to promote efficient, specific, and persistent gene expression in the liver (14.Wang L. Wang H. Bell P. McCarter R.J. He J. Calcedo R. Vandenberghe L.H. Morizono H. Batshaw M.L. Wilson J.M. Systematic evaluation of AAV vectors for liver directed gene transfer in murine models.Mol. Ther. 2010; 18: 118-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), to overexpress Ppp1r3b in hepatocytes in vivo. Ppp1r3b was ∼4-fold higher compared with control mice receiving a null AAV vector (Fig. 5A). There were no compensatory changes in the mRNA expression of other glycogen-targeting subunits (Ppp1r3a and Ppp1r3c), as well as rate-limiting enzymes in glycogen metabolism: glycogen synthase (Gys2) or glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl), in mice overexpressing Ppp1r3b. Following a short-term 4-h fasting period, mice overexpressing Ppp1r3b had ∼4-fold higher levels of hepatic glycogen content than controls, and this was maintained at 8 h of fasting (Fig. 5, B and C). Levels of total GS protein were also higher in livers from mice overexpressing Ppp1r3b, and the ratio of phospho-GS to total GS protein was decreased, consistent with increased activation status after 4- and 8-h fasting periods (Fig. 5D). Additionally, total GP or PP1 protein content was not affected (Fig. 5D). Blood glucose levels were not different between the two groups with ad libitum and 12-h fasting conditions, indicating that despite the larger reservoir of available glycogen, glucose levels are maintained, without exceeding the normal physiological range (Fig. 5E). Between 24 and 48 h of fasting, AAV-Ppp1r3b mice maintained persistently higher (by ∼15 mg/dl) plasma glucose levels than the control group (Fig. 5E). Upon long-term fasting, AAV-Ppp1r3b were protected from the onset of ketogenesis (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the enhanced glycogen storage buffered the onset of the fasting-induced metabolic shift to β-oxidation. Taken together, these data suggest that enhancement of hepatic glycogen reservoir in mice overexpressing Ppp1r3b improves the capacity for maintenance of plasma glucose homeostasis and minimizes the dependence on other energy substrates under longer-term fasting conditions. Variants at chromosomal locus 8p23.1, in an intergenic region 174 kb from the PPP1R3B gene, have recently been associated with human glycemic traits including fasting plasma insulin and glucose in a large-scale meta-analysis of genome wide association studies (15.Manning A.K.

The centrality of the liver in the maintenance of whole-body glucose homeostasis in both fed and fasted states has been well established, and glycogen metabolism is in turn a critical mediator of this function, serving as an immediate source of glucose that can be rapidly mobilized to buffer falling plasma glucose levels, and conversely, as a reservoir to capture excess glucose. GS is a rate-limiting glycogen synthetic enzyme that is allosterically regulated by glucose-6-phosphate. Binding of glucose-6-phosphate induces a conformational shift that promotes recruitment of PP1 that dephosphorylates and activates GS (4.Villar-Palasí C. Guinovart J.J. The role of glucose 6-phosphate in the control of glycogen synthase.FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20.Ferrer J.C. Favre C. Gomis R.R. Fernández-Novell J.M. García-Rocha M. de la Iglesia N. Cid E. Guinovart J.J. Control of glycogen deposition.FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-641 inactivates GS. PP1 promotes dephosphorylation of GS at Ser-641 by juxtaposing PP1 to GS through glycogen-targeting subunits (21.Cohen P.T. Protein phosphatase 1: targeted in many directions.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moorhead et al. (22.Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. Purification of the hepatic glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 by microcystin-Sepharose affinity chromatography.FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that heterodimeric complexes consisting of PP1-catalytic subunit (α and β isoforms) and Ppp1r3b/GL (then termed PP1G) purified from rat liver bound both glycogen and glycogen phosphorylase-a (GP α) with high affinity. The GL-GPα interaction is thought to antagonize PP1G-mediated GS activation in an allosteric fashion. Later, Printen et al. (9.Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. PTG, a protein phosphatase 1-binding protein with a role in glycogen metabolism.Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) showed that FLAG-Ppp1r3c/PTG fusion protein simultaneously bound PP1-catalytic subunit and glycogen. Independent of insulin stimulation, PTG could form stable complexes with the PP1-catalytic subunit, GS, and phosphorylase kinase, an activator of glycogen phosphorylase, but not with other phosphatases or kinases. Ppp1r3a/GM/RGL is the most abundant glycogen-targeting subunit in rodent skeletal muscle, which upon phosphorylation dissociates from PP1 and regulates GS activation in a similar fashion to that of PTG (23.Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Regulation of protein phosphatase-1G from rabbit skeletal muscle. 1.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) characterized different glycogenic capacities of three major subunits (Ppp1r3b (GL), Ppp1r3a (GM), and Ppp1r3c (PTG) in rat primary hepatocytes with respect to their regulatory role in activation and deactivation of GS and GP. The study concluded that: 1) Ppp1r3b (GL) had the highest capacity to maintain increased GS activity ratio, independent of insulin stimulation; 2) Ppp1r3c (PTG) maintained the glycogen synthesis capacity induced by insulin in a dose-dependent manner; and 3) GL and GM are responsive to forkskolin-mediated glycogenolysis; however, PTG remains unresponsive because of a lack of inhibition by GP. In summary, it is well established that Ppp1r3a, Ppp1r3b, and Ppp1r3c directly control the phosphorylation of GS. Although mechanistic studies demonstrate that GL mediates the intracellular scaffolding of PP1 to glycogen in the liver, the in vivo physiology of GL has been largely unexplored prior to this study, in contrast to PTG, for which both whole body knock-out and liver-specific overexpression mouse models have been described (11.López-Soldado I.

https://openalex.org/W2611081944,"Objective Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) has considerable benefits for cardiovascular health and longevity, while occupational physical activity (OPA) is associated with an elevated cardiovascular risk. This “health paradox” may be explained by different effects on the autonomic nervous system from OPA and LTPA. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether objectively measured OPA and LTPA are differentially associated with autonomic regulation among workers. Methods The study comprised 514 blue-collar workers from the Danish cohort DPHACTO. Physical activity (i.e. walking, climbing stairs, running and cycling) was assessed objectively using accelerometers worn on the thigh, hip and trunk over multiple working days. During this period, a heart rate monitor was used to sample heart period intervals from the ECG signal. Heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) indices were analyzed during nocturnal sleep as markers of autonomic regulation. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the main effects of OPA and LTPA and their interaction on heart rate and HRV, adjusting for multiple confounders. Results Statistically significant interaction was found between OPA and LTPA on heart rate (adjusted p<0.0001) and HRV indices in time (rMSSD, adjusted p = 0.004) and frequency-domains (HF, adjusted p = 0.022; LF, adjusted p = 0.033). The beneficial effect of LTPA on nocturnal heart rate and HRV clearly diminished with higher levels of OPA, and high levels of both OPA and LTPA had a detrimental effect. Conclusion We found contrasting associations for objectively measured OPA and LTPA with heart rate and HRV during sleep. Differential effects of OPA and LTPA on autonomic regulation may contribute to the physical activity health paradox."

The developed 3D-printed spine QA phantom consisted of an acrylic body phantom and a 3D-printed spine shaped object. DLP and Polyjet 3D printers using a high-density acrylic polymer were employed to produce spine-shaped phantoms based on CT images. Image fusion was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of our phantom, and the Hounsfield units (HUs) were measured based on each CT image. Two different intensity-modulated radiotherapy plans based on both CT phantom image sets from the two printed spine-shaped phantoms with acrylic body phantoms were designed to deliver 16 Gy dose to the planning target volume (PTV) and were compared for target coverage and normal organ-sparing. Image fusion demonstrated good reproducibility of the developed phantom. The HU values of the DLP- and Polyjet-printed spine vertebrae differed by 54.3 on average. The PTV Dmax dose for the DLP-generated phantom was about 1.488 Gy higher than that for the Polyjet-generated phantom. The organs at risk received a lower dose for the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom image using the DLP technique than for the phantom image using the Polyjet technique. Despite using the same material for printing the spine-shaped phantom, these phantoms generated by different 3D printing techniques, DLP and Polyjet, showed different HU values and these differently appearing HU values according to the printing technique could be an extra consideration for developing the 3D printed spine-shaped phantom depending on the patient's age and the density of the spinal bone. Therefore, the 3D printing technique and materials should be carefully chosen by taking into account the condition of the patient in order to accurately produce 3D printed patient-specific QA phantom."
https://openalex.org/W2611870887,"Early postnatal mammals, including human babies, can perform only basic motor tasks. The acquisition of skilled behaviors occurs later, requiring anatomical changes in neural circuitry to support the development of coordinated activation or suppression of functionally related muscle groups. How this circuit reorganization occurs during postnatal development remains poorly understood. Here we explore the connectivity between corticospinal (CS) neurons in the motor cortex and muscles in mice. Using trans-synaptic viral and electrophysiological assays, we identify the early postnatal reorganization of CS circuitry for antagonistic muscle pairs. We further show that this synaptic rearrangement requires the activity-dependent, non-apoptotic Bax/Bak-caspase signaling cascade. Adult Bax/Bak mutant mice exhibit aberrant co-activation of antagonistic muscle pairs and skilled grasping deficits but normal reaching and retrieval behaviors. Our findings reveal key cellular and molecular mechanisms driving postnatal motor circuit reorganization and the resulting impacts on muscle activation patterns and the execution of skilled movements."
https://openalex.org/W2611727971,"From June 2004 to December 2007, samples were weekly collected at a fixed station located at the mouth of Ria de Aveiro (West Iberian Margin). We examined the seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in composition and community structure of the phytoplankton in relation to the main environmental drivers and assessed the influence of the oceanographic regime, namely changes in frequency and intensity of upwelling events, over the dynamics of the phytoplankton assemblage. The samples were consistently handled and a final subset of 136 OTUs (taxa with relative abundance > 0.01%) was subsequently submitted to various multivariate analyses. The phytoplankton assemblage showed significant changes at all temporal scales but with an overriding importance of seasonality over longer- (inter-annual) or shorter-term fluctuations (upwelling-related). Sea-surface temperature, salinity and maximum upwelling index were retrieved as the main driver of seasonal change. Seasonal signal was most evident in the fluctuations of chlorophyll a concentration and in the high turnover from the winter to spring phytoplankton assemblage. The seasonal cycle of production and succession was disturbed by upwelling events known to disrupt thermal stratification and induce changes in the phytoplankton assemblage. Our results indicate that both the frequency and intensity of physical forcing were important drivers of such variability, but the outcome in terms of species composition was highly dependent on the available local pool of species and the timing of those events in relation to the seasonal cycle. We conclude that duration, frequency and intensity of upwelling events, which vary seasonally and inter-annually, are paramount for maintaining long-term phytoplankton diversity likely by allowing unstable coexistence and incorporating species turnover at different scales. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex mechanisms of coastal phytoplankton dynamics in relation to changing physical forcing which is fundamental to improve predictability of future prospects under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2611022085,"Cardiomyocytes acquire their primary specialized function (contraction) before exiting the cell cycle. In this regard, proliferation and differentiation must be precisely coordinated for proper cardiac morphogenesis. Here, we have investigated the complex transcriptional mechanisms employed by cardiomyocytes to coordinate antagonistic cell-cycle and differentiation gene programs through the molecular dissection of the core cardiac transcription factor, MEF2. Knockdown of individual MEF2 proteins, MEF2A, -C, and -D, in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in radically distinct and opposite effects on cellular homeostasis and gene regulation. MEF2A and MEF2D were absolutely required for cardiomyocyte survival, whereas MEF2C, despite its major role in cardiac morphogenesis and direct reprogramming, was dispensable for this process. Inhibition of MEF2A or -D also resulted in the activation of cell-cycle genes and down-regulation of markers of terminal differentiation. In striking contrast, the regulation of cell-cycle and differentiation gene programs by MEF2C was antagonistic to that of MEF2A and -D. Computational analysis of regulatory regions from MEF2 isoform-dependent gene sets identified the Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways as key determinants in coordinating MEF2 isoform-specific control of antagonistic gene programs. These results reveal that mammalian MEF2 family members have distinct transcriptional functions in cardiomyocytes and suggest that these differences are critical for proper development and maturation of the heart. Analysis of MEF2 isoform-specific function in neonatal cardiomyocytes has yielded insight into an unexpected transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which these specialized cells utilize homologous members of a core cardiac transcription factor to coordinate cell-cycle and differentiation gene programs."
https://openalex.org/W2611168369,"The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and recently JAK/STAT inhibitors have shown promising results in psoriasis treatment. The present study aimed to characterize the role of STAT2 in psoriasis. We demonstrated an increased expression of STAT2 and an increased level of phosphorylated/activated STAT2 in lesional compared with nonlesional psoriatic skin. Gene silencing of STAT2 by siRNA in human keratinocytes revealed that upon IFNα stimulation CXCL11 and CCL5 were the only two cytokines, among 102 analyzed, found to be regulated through a STAT2-dependent mechanism. Moreover, the regulation of CXCL11 and CCL5 depended on IRF9, but not on STAT1 and STAT6. The CXCL11 and CCL5 expression was increased in lesional compared with nonlesional psoriatic skin, and analysis demonstrated positive correlation between the expression of CXCL11 and IFNγ and between the expression of CCL5 and IFNγ in lesional psoriatic skin. In contrast, no correlation between the expression of CXCL11 and IL-17A and the expression of CCL5 and IL-17A in lesional psoriatic skin was found. Our data suggest that STAT2 plays a role in the psoriasis pathogenesis by regulating the expression of CXCL11 and CCL5, and thereby attracting IFNγ-producing immune cells to the skin."

Five-year survival for these pediatric aggressive tumors is poor (15–35%) indicating the need to develop better treatments for pediatric high-grade gliomas. In this work we used SF188 and SJ-GBM2 cell lines to study the function of the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinase de-regulated in several cancers, in pediatric high-grade gliomas. UCHL1 depletion in SF188 and SJ-GBM2 glioma cells was associated with decreased cell proliferation and invasion, along with a reduced ability to grow in soft agar and to form spheres (i.e. self-renewal measure). A 70% reduction in Wnt signaling was also observed in the SF188 and SJ-GBM2 UCHL1 knockdowns (KDs) using a TCF-dependent TOPflash reporter assay. Transcriptome comparisons of UCHL1 KDs versus vector control identified a list of 306 differentially expressed genes (at least 2-fold change; p <0.05) which included genes known to be involved in cancer like ACTA2, POSTN, LIF, FBXL7, FBXW11, GDF15, HEY2, but also potential novel genes such us IGLL5, ABCA4, AQP3, AQP4, CALB1, and ALK. Bioinformatics gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 306 genes revealed significant enrichment in “signal peptides”, “extracellular matrix”and “secreted proteins” GO Terms. “Angiogenesis and blood vessel development”, “neuron differentiation/development”, cell adhesion”, and “cell migration” also showed significant enrichment in our GO analysis. Top canonical pathways identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) included “Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis Signaling” (p = 5.14x10-4), “Virus Entry via Endocytic Pathways” (p = 6.15x 10−4), and “High Mobility Group-Box 1 (HMGB1) Signaling” (p = 6.15x10-4). While FGF2, IL1B, TNF and PDGFB were predicted as top upstream regulators (p < 2x10-16) of the UCHL1 KD-associated transcriptome. Aberrant expression of UCHL1 in pediatric high-grade gliomas may promote cell invasion, transformation, and self-renewal properties, at least in part, by modulating Wnt/Beta catenin activity. UCHL1 might act as an oncogene in glioma within the gene network that imparts stem-like characteristics to these cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2610843473,"Single sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine can exacerbate the symptoms of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, yet similar ketamine treatments rapidly reduce depressive symptoms in major depression. Acute doses of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine have also been shown to counteract ketamine-induced psychotic effects. In the interest of understanding whether these drug effects could be modeled with alterations in neuroplasticity, we examined the impact of acutely-administered ketamine and clozapine on in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat's hippocampus-to-prefrontal cortex (H-PFC) pathway. We found that a low dose of ketamine depressed H-PFC LTP, whereas animals that were co-administrated the two drugs displayed LTP that was similar to a saline-treated control. To address which signaling molecules might mediate such effects, we also examined phosphorylation and total protein levels of GSK3β, GluA1, TrkB, ERK, and mTOR in prefrontal and hippocampal sub-regions. Among the statistically significant effects that were detected (a) both ketamine and clozapine increased the phosphorylation of Ser9-GSK3β throughout the prefrontal cortex and of Ser2481-mTOR in the dorsal hippocampus (DH), (b) clozapine increased the phosphorylation of Ser831-GluA1 throughout the prefrontal cortex and of Ser845-GluA1 in the ventral hippocampus, (c) ketamine treatment increased the phosphorylation of Thr202/Tyr204-ERK in the medial PFC (mPFC), and (d) clozapine treatment was associated with decreases in the phosphorylation of Tyr705-TrkB in the DH and of Try816-TrkB in the mPFC. Further analyses involving phosphorylation effect sizes also suggested Ser831-GluA1 in the PFC displayed the highest degree of clozapine-responsivity relative to ketamine. These results provide evidence for how ketamine and clozapine treatments affect neuroplasticity and signaling pathways in the stress-sensitive H-PFC network. They also demonstrate the potential relevance of H-PFC pathway neuroplasticity for modeling ketamine-clozapine interactions in regards to psychosis."
https://openalex.org/W2610947234,"Serum biochemical parameters can be utilized to evaluate the physiological status of an animal, and relate it to the animal’s health. In order to accurately interpret individual animal biochemical results, species-specific reference intervals (RI) must be established. Reference intervals for biochemical parameters differ between species, and physiological differences including reproductive status, nutritional resource availability, disease status, and age affect parameters within the same species. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish RI for biochemical parameters in managed African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), (2) assess the effects of age, sex, pregnancy, and season on serum biochemistry values, and (3) compare serum biochemistry values from a managed herd to a free-ranging buffalo herd and to values previously published for captive (zoo) buffalo. Season profoundly affected all biochemistry parameters, possibly due to changes in nutrition and disease exposure. Age also affected all biochemical parameters except gamma glutamyl transferase and magnesium, consistent with patterns seen in cattle. Sex and reproductive status had no detectable effects on the parameters that were measured. The biochemical profiles of managed buffalo were distinct from those observed in the free-ranging herd and captive buffalo. Biochemical differences between buffalo from captive, managed, and free-ranging populations may be related to nutritional restriction or lack of predation in the context of management or captivity. The reference intervals provided in this study, in addition to the seasonal and age-related patterns observed, provide a foundation for health investigations that may inform management strategies in this ecologically and economically important species."
https://openalex.org/W2952757558,"The development of video-based monitoring methods allows for rapid, dynamic and accurate monitoring of individuals or communities, compared to slower traditional methods, with far reaching ecological and evolutionary applications. Large amounts of data are generated using video-based methods, which can be effectively processed using machine learning (ML) algorithms into meaningful ecological information. ML uses user defined classes (e.g. species), derived from a subset (i.e. training data) of video-observed quantitative features (e.g. phenotypic variation), to infer classes in subsequent observations. However, phenotypic variation often changes due to environmental conditions, which may lead to poor classification, if environmentally induced variation in phenotypes is not accounted for. Here we describe a framework for classifying species under changing environmental conditions based on the random forest classification. A sliding window approach was developed that restricts temporal and environmentally conditions to improve the classification. We tested our approach by applying the classification framework to experimental data. The experiment used a set of six ciliate species to monitor changes in community structure and behavior over hundreds of generations, in dozens of species combinations and across a temperature gradient. Differences in biotic and abiotic conditions caused simplistic classification approaches to be unsuccessful. In contrast, the sliding window approach allowed classification to be highly successful, as phenotypic differences driven by environmental change, could be captured by the classifier. Importantly, classification using the random forest algorithm showed comparable success when validated against traditional, slower, manual identification. Our framework allows for reliable classification in dynamic environments, and may help to improve strategies for long-term monitoring of species in changing environments. Our classification pipeline can be applied in fields assessing species community dynamics, such as eco-toxicology, ecology and evolutionary ecology."
https://openalex.org/W2611063517,"The recommended treatment for Social Phobia is individual Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT-treatments emphasize social self-beliefs (schemas) as the core underlying factor for maladaptive self-processing and social anxiety symptoms. However, the need for such beliefs in models of psychopathology has recently been questioned. Specifically, the metacognitive model of psychological disorders asserts that particular beliefs about thinking (metacognitive beliefs) are involved in most disorders, including social anxiety, and are a more important factor underlying pathology. Comparing the relative importance of these disparate underlying belief systems has the potential to advance conceptualization and treatment for SAD. In the cognitive model, unhelpful self-regulatory processes (self-attention and safety behaviours) arise from (e.g. correlate with) cognitive beliefs (schemas) whilst the metacognitive model proposes that such processes arise from metacognitive beliefs. In the present study we therefore set out to evaluate the absolute and relative fit of the cognitive and metacognitive models in a longitudinal data-set, using structural equation modelling. Five-hundred and five (505) participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires at two time points approximately 8 weeks apart. We found that both models fitted the data, but that the metacognitive model was a better fit to the data than the cognitive model. Further, a specified metacognitive model, emphasising negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts and cognitive confidence improved the model fit further and was significantly better than the cognitive model. It would seem that advances in understanding and treating social anxiety could benefit from moving to a full metacognitive theory that includes negative metacognitive beliefs about the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts, and judgements of cognitive confidence. These findings challenge a core assumption of the cognitive model and treatment of social phobia and offer further support to the metacognitive model."
https://openalex.org/W2611779428,"RhoGC is a rhodopsin (Rho)-guanylyl cyclase (GC) gene fusion molecule that is central to zoospore phototaxis in the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii. It has generated considerable excitement because of its demonstrated potential as a tool for optogenetic manipulation of cell-signaling pathways involving cyclic nucleotides. However, a reliable method for expressing and purifying RhoGC is currently lacking. We present here an expression and purification system for isolation of the full-length RhoGC protein expressed in HEK293 cells in detergent solution. The protein exhibits robust light-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity, whereas a truncated form lacking the 17- to 20-kDa N-terminal domain is completely inactive under identical conditions. Moreover, we designed several RhoGC mutants to increase the utility of the protein for optogenetic studies. The first class we generated has altered absorption spectra designed for selective activation by different wavelengths of light. Two mutants were created with blue-shifted (E254D, λmax = 390 nm; D380N, λmax = 506 nm) and one with red-shifted (D380E, λmax = 533 nm) absorption maxima relative to the wild-type protein (λmax = 527 nm). We also engineered a double mutant, E497K/C566D, that changes the enzyme to a specific, light-stimulated adenylyl cyclase that catalyzes the formation of cAMP from ATP. We anticipate that this expression/purification system and these RhoGC mutants will facilitate mechanistic and structural exploration of this important enzyme."

Methods We analyzed data obtained from two population-based surveys of adults (n = 2026) conducted in the same individuals 5–9 years (y) after their baseline examination in three Latin-American cities. Post BronchoDilator (postBD) FEV1 decline in mL/y, as %predicted/y (%P/y) and % of baseline/y (%B/y) was calculated and the influence of age, gender, BMI, baseline lung function, BD response, exacerbations rate evaluated using multivariate models. Results Expressed in ml/y, the mean annual postBD FEV1 decline was 27 mL (0.22%P, 1.32%B) in patients with baseline COPD and 36 (0.14%P, 1.36%B) in those without. Faster decline (in mL/y) was associated with higher baseline lung function, with significant response to bronchodilators, older age and smoking at baseline, also in women with chronic cough and phlegm, or ≥2 respiratory exacerbations in the previous year, and in men with asthma. Conclusions Lung function decline in a population-based cohort did not differ in obstructed and non-obstructed individuals, it was proportional to baseline FEV1, and was higher in smokers, elderly, and women with respiratory symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2610222140,"Brown adipose tissue dissipates energy as heat, a process that relies on a high abundance of mitochondria and high levels of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes within these mitochondria. Two regulators of mitochondrial respiration and heat production in brown adipocytes are the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α and its splicing isoform NT-PGC-1α, which control mitochondrial gene expression in the nucleus. Surprisingly, we found that, in brown adipocytes, some NT-PGC-1α localizes to mitochondria, whereas PGC-1α resides in the nucleus. Here we sought to investigate the role of NT-PGC-1α in brown adipocyte mitochondria. Immunocytochemistry, immunotransmission electron microscopy, and biochemical analyses indicated that NT-PGC-1α was located in the mitochondrial matrix in brown adipocytes. NT-PGC-1α was specifically enriched at the D-loop region of the mtDNA, which contains the promoters for several essential ETC complex genes, and was associated with LRP130, an activator of mitochondrial transcription. Selective expression of NT-PGC-1α and PGC-1α in PGC-1α−/− brown adipocytes similarly induced expression of nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial ETC genes, including the key mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Despite having comparable levels of TFAM expression, PGC-1α−/− brown adipocytes expressing NT-PGC-1α had higher expression of mtDNA-encoded ETC genes than PGC-1α−/− brown adipocytes expressing PGC-1α, suggesting a direct effect of NT-PGC-1α on mtDNA transcription. Moreover, this increase in mtDNA-encoded ETC gene expression was associated with enhanced respiration in NT-PGC-1α-expressing PGC-1α−/− brown adipocytes. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated and isoform-specific role for NT-PGC-1α in the regulation of mitochondrial transcription in brown adipocytes and provide new insight into the transcriptional control of mitochondrial respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2611770952,"Range shifts and expansions resulting from global climate change have the potential to create novel communities with unique plant-animal interactions. Organisms expanding their range into novel biotic and abiotic environments may encounter selection pressures that alter traditional biogeographic patterns of life history traits. Here, we used field surveys to examine latitudinal patterns of life history traits in a broadly distributed ectotherm (mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii) that has recently experienced a climate change-induced range expansion into a novel habitat type. Additionally, we conducted laboratory and field experiments to investigate characteristics associated with these life history traits (e.g. fecundity, offspring quality, and potential selection pressures). We compared these characteristics in native mangrove habitats in which the species has historically dwelled and novel salt marsh habitats into which the species has recently expanded its range. Consistent with traditional biogeographic concepts (i.e. Bergmann’s clines), size at maturity and mean body size of reproductive females increased with latitude within the native habitat. However, they decreased significantly in novel habitats at the highest latitudes of the species’ range, which was consistent with habitat-specific differences in both biotic (predation) and abiotic (temperature) selection pressures. Although initial maternal investment (egg volume and weight) did not differ between habitats, fecundity was lower in novel habitats as a result of differences in size at reproduction. Offspring quality, as measured by larval starvation resistance, was likewise diminished in novel habitats relative to native habitats. These differences in offspring quality may have enduring consequences for species success and persistence in novel habitats. Life history characteristics such as those investigated here are fundamental organismal traits; consequently, understanding the potential impacts of climate change responses on latitudinal patterns of these traits is key to understanding climate change impacts on natural systems."
https://openalex.org/W2610172683,"Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted microbubbles (MBs) were developed using bioorthogonal chemistry. Streptavidin-labeled MBs were treated with a biotinylated tetrazine (MBTz) and targeted to PSMA expressing cells using trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-functionalized anti-PSMA antibodies (TCO-anti-PSMA). The extent of MB binding to PSMA positive cells for two different targeting strategies was determined using an in vitro flow chamber. The initial approach involved pretargeting, where TCO-anti-PSMA was first incubated with PSMA expressing cells and followed by MBTz, which subsequently showed a 2.8 fold increase in the number of bound MBs compared to experiments performed in the absence of TCO-anti-PSMA. Using direct targeting, where TCO-anti-PSMA was linked to MBTz prior to initiation of the assay, a 5-fold increase in binding compared to controls was observed. The direct targeting approach was subsequently evaluated in vivo using a human xenograft tumor model and two different PSMA-targeting antibodies. The US signal enhancements observed were 1.6- and 5.9-fold greater than that for non-targeted MBs. The lead construct was also evaluated in a head-to-head study using mice bearing both PSMA positive or negative tumors in separate limbs. The human PSMA expressing tumors exhibited a 2-fold higher US signal compared to those tumors deficient in human PSMA. The results demonstrate both the feasibility of preparing PSMA-targeted MBs and the benefits of using bioorthogonal chemistry to create targeted US probes."
https://openalex.org/W2611939979,"Thrips (Enneothrips flavens) is a pest that causes severe damage and yield losses to peanut crop if not properly controlled. The main control method currently used by farmers is bi-weekly application of insecticides during crop development, which, in addition to its toxicity, is very costly. Thus, new sources of resistance must be identified in order to reduce the use of insecticides and effectively manage the pest. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence and symptoms of E. flavens infestations in 12 accessions of 10 wild species of Arachis and nine amphidiploids, as well as to compare their morphoagronomic characteristics to those of commercial cultivars. To this end, we conducted experiments during two summer seasons, using a randomized block design with four replications. We conducted evaluations of the severity of infestation, noting visual symptoms of E. flavens and morphological and reproductive characteristics of the Arachis plants. Results indicated that wild accessions V 7635 (A. vallsii), V 13250 (A. kempff-mercadoi), K 9484 (A. batizocoi), Wi 1118 (A. williamsii), V 14167 (A. duranensis) and V 13751 (A. magna) are the most promising for obtaining useful new amphidiploids. Among the amphidiploids, An 12 (A. batizocoi x A. kempff-mercadoi)4x, An 9 (A. gregoryi x A. stenosperma) 4x, and An 8 (A. magna x A. cardenasii)4x showed high level of resistance to E. flavens. The identified thrips resistant wild and amphidiploid Arachis species may be used in future breeding program to produce thrips resistant peanut cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2610706642,"Purpose Tonometry is widely used as the main screening tool supporting glaucoma diagnosis. Still, its accuracy could be improved if full knowledge about the variation of the corneal biomechanical properties was available. In this study, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) speckle statistics are used to infer the organisation of the corneal micro-structure and hence, to analyse its influence on intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Methods Fifty-six subjects were recruited for this prospective study. Macro and micro-structural corneal parameters as well as subject age were considered. Macro-structural analysis included the parameters that are associated with the ocular anatomy, such as central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal radius, axial length, anterior chamber depth and white-to-white corneal diameter. Micro-structural parameters which included OCT speckle statistics were related to the internal organisation of the corneal tissue and its physiological changes during lifetime. The corneal speckle obtained from OCT was modelled with the Generalised Gamma (GG) distribution that is characterised with a scale parameter and two shape parameters. Results In macro-structure analysis, only CCT showed a statistically significant correlation with IOP (R2 = 0.25, p<0.001). The scale parameter and the ratio of the shape parameters of GG distribution showed statistically significant correlation with IOP (R2 = 0.19, p<0.001 and R2 = 0.17, p<0.001, respectively). For the studied group, a weak, although significant correlation was found between age and IOP (R2 = 0.053, p = 0.04). Forward stepwise regression showed that CCT and the scale parameter of the Generalised Gamma distribution can be combined in a regression model (R2 = 0.39, p<0.001) to study the role of the corneal structure on IOP. Conclusions We show, for the first time, that corneal micro-structure influences the IOP measurements obtained from noncontact tonometry. OCT speckle statistics can be employed to learn about the corneal micro-structure and hence, to further calibrate the IOP measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2611460304,"TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) is a 43 kD, predominately nuclear, protein involved in RNA metabolism. Of clinical significance is that the majority of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients display abnormal accumulation of misfolded TDP-43 in the cytoplasm, which is coincident with a loss of nuclear localization in the afflicted regions of the central nervous system. Little is known about defects that arise in loss-of-function models, in particular synaptic defects that arise at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this report, we examined abnormalities arising at the NMJ following depletion of tdp-43 using a previously characterized mutant tardbp (encoding tdp-43) zebrafish line containing a premature stop codon (Y220X) that results in an unstable and degraded protein. Homozygous tardbpY220X/Y220X zebrafish do not produce tdp-43 but develop normally due to expression of an alternative splice variant of tardbpl (tardbp paralog). Using an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to knockdown expression of the tardbpl in tardbpY220X/Y220X embryos, we examined locomotor defects, NMJ structural abnormalities and release of quantal synaptic vesicles at the NMJ. As in previous reports, larvae depleted of tdp-43 display reduced survival, gross morphological defects and severely impaired locomotor activity. These larvae also displayed an increased number of orphaned pre- and postsynaptic NMJ markers but surprisingly, we observed a significant increase (3.5 times) in the frequency of quantal acetylcholine release at the NMJ in larvae depleted of tdp-43. These results indicate that reduced TDP-43 levels alter quantal vesicle release at the NMJ during vertebrate development and may be relevant for understanding synaptic dysfunction in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2610677440,"Most microvessels have been shown to become stenosed or completely occluded during hypertrophic scar progression. Here, we examined the morphology of capillary endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts using immunofluorescence staining for CD31 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and electron microscopy. In addition, ECs and fibroblasts were isolated from scar tissues, and the levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), endothelin 1 (ET-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were assayed using ELISAs. Furthermore, we assessed cell viability, total collagen production, and cell apoptosis in hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts cultured with EC-conditioned medium. Then, anti-TGF-β1, anti-PDGF, anti-ET-1, anti-VEGF, and anti-bFGF neutralising antibodies were individually added to the EC medium to identify which growth factor plays a more important role in inhibiting fibroblasts biology. Our results showed microvessel lumen occlusion and EC atrophy during scar development, particularly in regressive scars (RSs). Additionally, EC growth factor secretion decreased and reached the lowest levels in RSs. Furthermore, based on the culture results, RS EC medium inhibited fibroblast viability and collagen production and induced apoptosis. Moreover, TGF-β1, PDGF, and bFGF played more important roles in these processes than VEGF and ET-1. The endothelial dysfunction occurring in hypertrophic scars contributes to fibroblast inhibition and scar regression, and reduced TGF-β1, PDGF, and bFGF levels play key roles during this process."
https://openalex.org/W2610271111,"Background Public health programs to prevent invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) with monovalent serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV-C) and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV-4) in infancy and adolescence vary across Canadian provinces. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various vaccination strategies against IMD using current and anticipated future pricing and recent epidemiology. Methods A cohort model was developed to estimate the clinical burden and costs (CAN$2014) of IMD in the Canadian population over a 100-year time horizon for three strategies: (1) MCV-C in infants and adolescents (MCV-C/C); (2) MCV-C in infants and MCV-4 in adolescents (MCV-C/4); and (3) MCV-4 in infants (2 doses) and adolescents (MCV-4/4). The source for IMD incidence was Canadian surveillance data. The effectiveness of MCV-C was based on published literature. The effectiveness of MCV-4 against all vaccination regimens was assumed to be the same as for MCV-C regimens against serogroup C. Herd effects were estimated by calibration to estimates reported in prior analyses. Costs were from published sources. Vaccines prices were projected to decline over time reflecting historical procurement trends. Results Over the modeling horizon there are a projected 11,438 IMD cases and 1,195 IMD deaths with MCV-C/C; expected total costs are $597.5 million. MCV-C/4 is projected to reduce cases of IMD by 1,826 (16%) and IMD deaths by 161 (13%). Vaccination costs are increased by $32 million but direct and indirect IMD costs are projected to be reduced by $46 million. MCV-C/4 is therefore dominant vs. MCV-C/C in the base case. Cost-effectiveness of MCV-4/4 was $111,286 per QALY gained versus MCV-C/4 (2575/206 IMD cases/deaths prevented; incremental costs $68 million). Conclusions If historical trends in Canadian vaccines prices continue, use of MCV-4 instead of MCV-C in adolescents may be cost-effective. From an economic perspective, switching to MCV-4 as the adolescent booster should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2611639353,"Fruit is essential for plant reproduction and is responsible for protection and dispersal of seeds. The development and maturation of fruit is tightly regulated by numerous genetic factors that respond to environmental and internal stimulation. In this study, we attempted to identify novel fruit-related genes in a model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, using a computational method. Based on validated fruit-related genes, the random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm was applied on a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using these genes as seeds. The identified genes with high probabilities were filtered by the permutation test and linkage tests. In the permutation test, the genes that were selected due to the structure of the PPI network were discarded. In the linkage tests, the importance of each candidate gene was measured from two aspects: (1) its functional associations with validated genes and (2) its similarity with validated genes on gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways. Finally, 255 inferred genes were obtained, subsequent extensive analysis of important genes revealed that they mainly contribute to ubiquitination (UBQ9, UBQ8, UBQ11, UBQ10), serine hydroxymethyl transfer (SHM7, SHM5, SHM6) or glycol-metabolism (HXKL2_ARATH, CSY5, GAPCP1), suggesting essential roles during the development and maturation of fruit in Arabidopsis thaliana."

They were injected subcutaneously into the flank of nude mice. Myeloma tumour growth was followed using bioluminescence-based imaging (BLI) and characterised by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The tumour specificity of [18F]fludarabine was evaluated and compared to [18F]FDG.The tumoural uptake of [18F]FDG was greater than that of [18F]fludarabine. However, the quantitative data extracted from IHC stainings were in better agreement with [18F]fludarabine, when compared to [18F]FDG. The relationship between the tumoural uptake of [18F]-labelled tracers and the BLI quantitative data was also in favour of [18F]fludarabine.Our results suggest that [18F]fludarabine-PET might represent an alternative and perhaps more specific modality for MM imaging when compared to [18F]FDG. Nevertheless, more investigations are required to extend this conclusion to humans."

The BRAINS Program’s continuous professional development model positively impacts participants’ careers by fostering a sense of community and creating a counterspace for critical conversations. In order to better prepare trainees and advance diversity in neuroscience, career development must move beyond scientific skills. The BRAINS Program’s continuous professional development model positively impacts participants’ careers by fostering a sense of community and creating a counterspace for critical conversations. Many have eloquently advocated for embracing diversity in biomedical science and broadening the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups (URGs) (e.g., the Fall 2016 special issue of CBE Life Sciences Education). Indeed, efforts to foster diversity in neuroscience have been ongoing for decades (Nishi et al., 2016Nishi R. Castañeda E. Davis G.W. Fenton A.A. Hofmann H.A. King J. Ryan T.A. Trujillo K.A. Neuron. 2016; 92: 632-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Even so, the percentage of neuroscience graduate students from racially and ethnically underrepresented minorities is low (≤12%) (Sved, 2013Sved, A.F. (2013). Report of Survey of Neuroscience Graduate, Postdoctoral, & Undergraduate Programs (Academic Year 2010-2011). http://www.sfn.org/∼/media/SfN/Documents/Professional%20Development/NDP/SurveyReportAY20102011.ashx.Google Scholar). According to the National Science Foundation’s Survey of Earned Doctorates (2001 through 2013), of 10,000 neuroscience PhDs earned by US citizens and permanent residents, only about 8.5% were awarded to persons from URGs (NCSES and NSF, 2015NCSES (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics) and NSF (National Science Foundation). (2015). Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2013 (NSF 15-304). https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2013/.Google Scholar). While there are no definitive data on the number of neuroscientists with disabilities and their career paths, of the 96,345 PhDs awarded from 2003 to 2012 in the biological sciences or psychology (common fields for neuroscientists), only 2% (2,102 degrees) were awarded to persons with disabilities (NSF and NCSES, 2014NSF (National Science Foundation) and NCSES (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics) (2014). Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2013 (NSF 13-304). https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd/2013/.Google Scholar). At the next career stage, less than 5 percent of the postdoctoral scholars and tenure-track faculty in neuroscience are members of URGs (Sved, 2013Sved, A.F. (2013). Report of Survey of Neuroscience Graduate, Postdoctoral, & Undergraduate Programs (Academic Year 2010-2011). http://www.sfn.org/∼/media/SfN/Documents/Professional%20Development/NDP/SurveyReportAY20102011.ashx.Google Scholar). Efforts to increase diversity in science must not only focus on exposure to science and acquisition of research and scientific skills; they must also address broader professional development topics. After all, successful scientists need much more than scientific skills and expertise to thrive in their careers. Communication, time management, strategic planning, networking—these professional and career development skills are part of the large suite of tools and experiences that individuals need to successfully navigate their scientific careers. Unfortunately, much of professional development in the scientific domain is offered ad hoc and often as an a la carte menu, resulting in periodic and isolated professional development experiences that are accessed by only a subset of researchers. In addition, there is currently little in the way of professional development training on how to navigate the social and cultural landscape that is embedded within the science community. This type of training is particularly relevant to individuals from URGs, who often lack access to the informal networks where scientific and career-cultural information is exchanged. We posit that the scientific enterprise, writ large, will benefit greatly from more strategic, integrative, intentional, and continuous professional development training at all career stages. To advance equity and diversity in the biomedical sciences, we must do better to prepare all scholars, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups, with a holistic suite of professional development skills that focus on retaining talented scientists in the field. We have taken this approach with a professional development program aimed at neuroscientists called BRAINS: Broadening the Representation of Academic Investigators in NeuroScience. BRAINS is an NIH-NINDS-funded national program that seeks to support the success of early-career, post-PhD neuroscientists from URGs, specifically racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities (www.BRAINS.washington.edu). Founded in 2011, BRAINS is a cohort-based program that offers ongoing, community-centric professional development and fosters conversations specific to the experiences of people from URGs in neuroscience. BRAINS participants are post-docs, researchers, and assistant professors. A total of 59 early-career neuroscientists have participated in two BRAINS cohorts to date, with over twice that many likely to participate over the next five years. So, what works when it comes to professional development interventions, particularly when targeting individuals from URGs? Social science research has identified a suite of factors related to career success for individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM (see Williams et al., 2016Williams S.N. Thakore B.K. McGee R. Acad. Med. 2016; 91: 1128-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar and Pfund et al., 2016Pfund C. Byars-Winston A. Branchaw J. Hurtado S. Eagan K. AIDS Behav. 2016; 20: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar for an overview). Programs that are intentionally designed to address these factors have the potential to increase the probability of success for individuals as they navigate their scientific careers. Here we highlight two of these factors: self-efficacy and sense of belonging. Self-efficacy (Bandura, 1977Bandura A. Psychol. Rev. 1977; 84: 191-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (29083) Google Scholar) refers to an individual’s belief in their ability to successfully perform particular tasks to produce a specific outcome. Increases in self-efficacy are related to increases in motivation and a range of performance measures, and self-efficacy is an important mediator of commitment to science by persons from URGs (Chemers et al., 2011Chemers M.M. Zurbriggen E.L. Syed M. Goza B.K. Bearman S. J. Soc. Issues. 2011; 67: 469-491Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For example, an individual with high self-efficacy has a higher probability of both trying and successfully performing a set of skills than does an individual with the same skills but lower self-efficacy. We focus on self-efficacy because individuals develop their sense of self-efficacy from personal performance, learning by example, social interactions, and how they feel in a situation. In addition to self-efficacy, sense of belonging (the subjective sense of affiliation with the scientific community) is an important mediator of an individual’s persistence in scientific careers for scholars from URGs (Chemers et al., 2011Chemers M.M. Zurbriggen E.L. Syed M. Goza B.K. Bearman S. J. Soc. Issues. 2011; 67: 469-491Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, Estrada-Hollenbeck et al., 2011Estrada-Hollenbeck M. Woodcock A. Hernandez P.R. Schultz P.W. J. Educ. Psychol. 2011; 103: 206-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Sense of belonging to a scientific domain, such as neuroscience, involves feeling accepted and valued by members of one’s academic community (Good et al., 2012Good C. Rattan A. Dweck C.S. J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 2012; 102: 700-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). For example, sense of belonging metrics might ask about the extent to which an individual feels like part of the family in the field or the extent to which an individual identifies with the field or profession (Goodenow, 1993Goodenow C. Psychol. Sch. 1993; 30: 79-90Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). We have applied our understanding of the relevant social science research to inform the BRAINS Program. Moreover, we have learned a lot from our BRAINS program participants about what works to support the careers of early-career investigators from groups that are underrepresented in neuroscience. Perhaps the biggest take-home finding to date is that professional development content best serves scientists from URGs when offered within a community, so that individuals both expand their career skills and feel empowered in their careers. This strategy directly builds on the social science research insights previously mentioned. We have documented some of the impacts and outcomes of the BRAINS program elsewhere (Margherio et al., 2016Margherio C. Horner-Devine M.C. Mizumori S.J.Y. Yen J.W. CBE Life Sci. Educ. 2016; 15: ar49Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we focus not on specific outcomes but rather on what we know about why BRAINS is working and how the neuroscience community might use this perspective to think about professional development more broadly. In particular, we share three specific insights that are important to transformative career development training (see Figure 1). First, professional development cultivated in a community context helps develop levels of trust that allow individuals to seek feedback about their new skills and increase their engagement with resources and relationships developed during a professional development program (Horner-Devine et al., 2016Horner-Devine M.C. Yen J. Mody-Pan P. Margherio C. Forde S. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. 2016; 4: 119Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, Nishi et al., 2016Nishi R. Castañeda E. Davis G.W. Fenton A.A. Hofmann H.A. King J. Ryan T.A. Trujillo K.A. Neuron. 2016; 92: 632-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For BRAINS, community is developed in several ways. Our 4-day symposium is held on an island outside of Seattle. The retreat-like atmosphere allows participants and senior panelists to get away from daily distractions and deeply connect with each other on a variety of topics through panels, small group work, individual reflection time, skills practice, and communal meals. The community ties are also strengthened by intentionally engaging in conversations that address both personal and professional topics and identities. These conversations offer opportunities to resonate with a wide variety of stories and experiences, such that everyone is able to see a bit of themselves in each other. Moreover, hearing the broader context in which advice, tips, and tools are given allows individuals to better determine what might work for them given their own particular context and emboldens them to actually implement their new skills and tools. Beyond what happens at the symposium, the BRAINS program explicitly nurtures the community connections through three primary mechanisms: 1) early-career peer mentoring groups that are established after the symposium, 2) a BRAINS community listserv that sees regular traffic long after a symposium has concluded, and 3) a reunion and booth at the Society for Neuroscience conference. Each of these community “touches” are an opportunity to renew connections, encourage accountability, solicit feedback and advice, and reduce doubts about the ability to embrace and implement the new skills. As noted by a participant in the program’s annual evaluation survey, “It was very encouraging to become a part of the BRAINS community because it is a far more supportive environment. I think having access to a supportive community like BRAINS makes it easier to branch out in the larger neuroscience community, as one has a ‘homebase’ that can help sort out difficulties in the more aggressive neuroscience arenas.” Second, community connection combined with confidentiality and a shared social identity among participants (i.e., career stage, race, ethnicity, ability status, gender, etc.) sets the stage for establishing “counterspaces” for meaningful conversations about topics that may feel taboo, but are incredibly relevant to professional development and career success. A counterspace is a space and opportunity that promotes positive self-concepts among individuals from URGs; it invites each person to combine their social identities with their professional science identity without question and to participate as their whole selves (Solorzano, 1998Solorzano D.G. Int. J. Qual. Stud. Educ. 1998; 11: 121-136Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar, Case and Hunter, 2012Case A.D. Hunter C.D. Am. J. Community Psychol. 2012; 50: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Johnson et al., 2011Johnson A. Brown J. Carlone H. Cuevas A.K. J. Res. Sci. Teach. 2011; 48: 339-366Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The BRAINS program’s counterspace supports explicit discussions about how one’s experience in science is influenced by one’s gender, racial or ethnic identity, ability status, and other historically and socially significant identities. These conversations are often “the elephant in the room.” When tips and tools are suggested without acknowledgment of how issues like identity impact individuals’ experiences, they can fall flat, go untapped, or even feel like an extra burden. Creating a space to have authentic conversations about careers, professional development, and life allows professional development tips and tools to be taken in context and then applied in real life. Indeed, BRAINS participants have said that BRAINS “[p]rovided a safe space in which to network and ask tough questions.” and offered “a safe environment to speak my mind without the fear of being judged.” The BRAINS models creates these spaces and raises these conversations through the use of storytelling and cross-career perspective sharing. Senior panelists are encouraged to be as open as possible in sharing their career and life stories. Their openness invites participants to be open and authentic about their concerns and questions. When one member of the community puts themselves out there, others soon follow. Indeed, we have seen both panelists and participants being more vulnerable and open as the symposium progresses, the trust level increases, and the community connection strengthens. Finally, professional development must be viewed as continuous rather than as a one-off topical workshop. When individuals are exposed to any new skill or are trying to improve an existing skill, they need time to process what they have learned and a chance to practice applying the new skill. This holds true for professional development skills such as time management and communication skills, since those skills must also be incorporated into an existing context of experiences and perspectives. The BRAINS Program is specifically designed to address professional development within the context of personal experiences and to provide continuous opportunities to engage in the material learned through the program. The continuous element is critical in allowing each participant to adapt new skills into their individual context in an ongoing manner, and it leverages the impact of the strong community connections as well as the conversations that stem from the counterspace created at BRAINS. The BRAINS peer mentoring circles, which launch after the multi-day symposium, are explicitly designed as mechanisms for participants to continue their connection to the BRAINS community, set personal goals, discuss professional concerns, and receive constructive feedback. This ongoing professional development space allows participants to revisit strategies, tips, and tools from their symposium experience as they face particular and often new challenges or decisions in their day to day life. Such continuous engagement increases the “stickiness” of the tips and tools introduced at the symposium and thus allows content to be woven throughout participants’ careers rather than remaining isolated to a workshop. Continuous engagement also provides opportunities for relationships and trust to deepen among community members. Participants re-engage with professional development as it becomes relevant to their own experience. In this way, they apply the tips and tools to new challenges with the support of a strong community. In summary, our experience has demonstrated that, when professional development is offered in a continuous fashion and grounded in community and relationships through a counterspace, participants’ self-efficacy and outcome expectations change, allowing them to better pursue their careers with confidence, clarity, and satisfaction. The experiences help individuals apply new tips, tools, and skills so that they work for them, in their context. Moreover, participants have a community on which to lean that offers support, encourages accountability, and celebrates their contributions and accomplishments. By creating counterspaces to address professional development while actively acknowledging the impact of the personal (whether it be race, gender, ability status, parental status, or something else) on the professional, we can increase the uptake of new and improved skills, build trust and community, and help scientists, particularly those from URGs, thrive in their careers. How can you put these three ideas into practice? Community, continuous engagement, and counterspaces for conversations about social identities require trust—trust among participants and also between participants and their facilitators, community members, and institutions. In June 2015, Professor Claude Steele spoke to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/cwsem/PGA_167298) and highlighted that “the first thing that has to happen is trust” in diverse settings and communities in order to lay the groundwork for people to believe in their abilities and their future in science. He posits that the scientific enterprise must make people from underrepresented backgrounds feel “like people are interested in them and pulling for them, and that people believe in their ability.” A 2016 New York Times article (Colón Ramos and Quiñones-Hinojosa, 2016Colón Ramos D.A. Quiñones-Hinojosa A. Racism in the Research Lab. The New York Times, 2016https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/racism-in-the-research-lab/?_r=0Google Scholar) calls for a similar effort, specifically with regard to the field of neuroscience. How do you create a culture in your scientific community where trust is central? This is a critical issue to resolve, for it opens up the possibility of developing the community, ongoing engagement, and conversations about social identities. In neuroscience research, one of the most effective strategies for solving complex problems is to take a multilevel and integrative systems approach. This approach has been fundamental to the success of BRAINS. With this in mind, to increase and retain diversity in the neuroscience workforce, we similarly suggest a multipronged approach that includes system-wide and individual laboratory components. At a broad systems level, a sense of community and trust can become institutionalized if leadership embraces the view that having a more diverse workforce is a very effective mechanism for growing excellence rather than a duty or mandate to meet some type of numerical goal. With this view, diversity and inclusiveness do not compete for resources at the expense of excellence; rather, they serve as facilitators of resources and excellence. Entire organizations can then develop policies, procedures, and practices that are geared toward enhancing community and trust among all, but especially URG personnel. An example of such a practice could be institutional support for the formation and continuation of groups that bring young scientists from URGs together with a smaller number of more senior scientists who have experience and/or interest in diversity-related issues. If needed, these groups can draw from different departments—for example, including other types of science departments—in order to generate a critical mass of graduate students, postdoctoral students, or early-career faculty. These early-career groups are noted here because they represent the career stage associated with the largest attrition of diverse scientists. A goal of such groups might be to share experiences, challenges, and solutions that have worked for others. Embedded in these counterspace discussions is professional development skills training that assists URG scientists in navigating science research and teaching careers. Table 1 offers several professional development topics and related resources that we address in the BRAINS program. These community groups should be encouraged to continue with regular meetings and/or the development of peer mentoring circles, since continuous engagement and “touches” with discussions of identity and career are essential to retain URG members in science.Table 1Sample Professional Development Topics to Explore at an Institutional or Individual Laboratory LevelSample TopicsDescriptionSample ResourcesMoving from time management to life managementMove from thinking about what is urgent and how to get more done to thinking about what is important and how to have the most positive impact with what you doSteven Covey’s First Things First and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective PeopleRobert Boice’s Advice for New Faculty MembersThriving when you are one of a fewExamine how to create community and relationships that encourage discussions and acknowledgement about social identities at workKerry Ann Rockquemore’s and Tracey Laszloffy’s The Black Academic’s Guide to Winning Tenure—Without Losing your SoulGetting the mentoring you need to succeedExplore the importance of developing a mentoring network with relationships beyond the traditional junior-senior relationshipEllen Daniell’s Every Other Thursday: Stories and Strategies from Successful Women ScientistsUnderstanding leadership and work stylesUnderstand our own leadership styles and the styles of those with whom we work and manage to improve communication, relationships, and productivityChristopher Loving’s Loving Leadership: Rekindling the Human Spirit in Business, Relationships, and Life Open table in a new tab What can be done on the scale of individual laboratories? This is a critical issue, as the laboratory environment is the immediate home for an individual. If you have never discussed personal challenges to science careers in your laboratory group meetings, the thought of doing so may seem daunting. However, as a good scientist, you might take the view that you have to experiment and consult with the relevant literature or experts in the field to learn what is known about potential questions of interest. Then you can start small by essentially running a pilot study within your own laboratory group to explore these questions or topics. What type of specific question might you pose for your pilot study? Some suggestions include the following: What is one thing you can do to build a sense of community in your laboratory? Or, how can you encourage and inform lab members to learn more about how our individual backgrounds affect experiences in science careers, particularly if one is a member of an URG? You can also solicit feedback from your trainees to learn more about the type of professional training they need and then follow up on those needs by paying particular attention to how professional training might be made more effective after considering an individual’s personal needs. Don’t stop at your first attempt to create community, build trust, and/or offer ongoing professional development. Figure out what did not work and why, then try something different at the next lab meeting. Don’t just rely on your own assessment of how things went. Ask your trainees. That exchange helps to build community, especially if you have trainees from diverse backgrounds. Each of these interactions is an opportunity to increase trust and conversation in your community. Eventually, you may even find yourself or others raising topics that previously seemed taboo. Sharing relevant research articles about particular career concerns is a good entry into a conversation. Being honest about what you do and do not know and being open to learning together also builds trust. Creating a space to catalyze conversations about careers and identities takes time, but it is a worthy investment. It will take time, but collectively we can create institutional and individual laboratory cultures that cultivate a sense of community, offer opportunities for continuous professional development, and engage trainees not only in terms of their scientific identities but also in terms of the other identities that contribute to their total experience in science. In doing so, we can shift the professional development culture toward one that more intentionally addresses the training gaps experienced by early-career scientists, particularly those from URGs. All scientists will be well served by this shift, as we will collectively create and retain a stronger and more diverse scientific workforce. Ultimately, diversity, inclusion, and equity can and should be internalized by the entire neuroscience community rather than simply endorsed.

https://openalex.org/W2610402627,"Aim Inhibition of sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), the key transport protein in renal glucose reabsorption, promotes glucose excretion and represents a new concept in the therapy of type-2 diabetes. In addition, SGLT2 inhibition elevates circulating glucagon concentrations and enhances hepatic glucose production. Since SGLT2 is expressed in human pancreatic α-cells and regulates glucagon release, we tested whether common variants of the SGLT2 gene SLC5A2 associate with altered plasma glucagon concentrations in the fasting state and upon glucose challenge. Methods A study population of 375 healthy subjects at increased risk for type-2 diabetes, phenotyped by a 5-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and genotyped for recently described SLC5A2 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was selected for plasma glucagon measurements. Results After adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, and insulin sensitivity, the four tagging SNPs (rs9924771, rs3116150, rs3813008, rs9934336), tested separately or as genetic score, were neither significantly nor nominally associated with plasma glucagon concentrations at any time during the OGTT, with the inverse AUC of glucagon or the glucagon fold-change during the OGTT (p ≥ 0.2, all). Testing for genotype-related differences in the time course of the glucagon response using MANOVA did also not reveal any significant or nominal associations (p ≥ 0.5, all). Conclusion We could not obtain statistically significant evidence for a role of common SLC5A2 variants in the regulation of glucagon release in the fasting state or upon glucose challenge. Moreover, the reported nominal effects of individual SLC5A2 variants on fasting and post-challenge glucose levels may probably not be mediated by altered glucagon release."
https://openalex.org/W2610719488,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) undergo phosphorylation at several intracellular residues by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. The resulting phosphorylation pattern triggers arrestin recruitment and receptor desensitization. The exact sites of phosphorylation and their function remained largely unknown for the human β1-adrenoceptor (ADRB1), a key GPCR in adrenergic signal transduction and the target of widely used drugs such as β-blockers. The present study aimed to identify the intracellular phosphorylation sites in the ADRB1 and to delineate their function. The human ADRB1 was expressed in HEK293 cells and its phosphorylation pattern was determined by mass spectrometric analysis before and after stimulation with a receptor agonist. We identified a total of eight phosphorylation sites in the receptor's third intracellular loop and C-terminus. Analyzing the functional relevance of individual sites using phosphosite-deficient receptor mutants we found phosphorylation of the ADRB1 at Ser461/Ser462 in the distal part of the C-terminus to determine β-arrestin2 recruitment and receptor internalization. Our data reveal the phosphorylation pattern of the human ADRB1 and the site that mediates recruitment of β-arrestin2."
https://openalex.org/W2610826428,"A prion-like mechanism has been developed to explain the observed promotion of amyloid aggregation caused by conversion of structurally intact SOD1 to a misfolded form. Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn], or SOD1, is a homo-dimeric protein that functions as an antioxidant by scavenging for superoxide. The misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 is linked to inherited, or familial, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. Aberrant SOD1 folding has also been strongly implicated in disease causation for sporadic ALS, or SALS, which accounts for ~90% of ALS cases. Studies have found that mutant, misfolded SOD1 can convert wtSOD1 in a prion-like fashion, and that misfolded wtSOD1 can be propagated by release and uptake of protein aggregates. Here it is demonstrated that enervating the SOD1 electrostatic loop can lead to an experimentally observed gain of interaction (GOI) responsible for the formation of SOD1 amyloid-like filaments. This enervation is caused in turn by the formation of transient, non-obligate oligomers between pathogenic SOD1 mutants and wt SOD1."
https://openalex.org/W2610868792,"Acyltransferases catalyze essential reactions in the buildup and remodeling of glycerophospholipids and contribute to the maintenance and diversity of cellular membranes. Transmembrane protein 68 (TMEM68) is an evolutionarily conserved protein of unknown function, that forms a distinct subgroup within the glycerophospholipid acyltransferase family. In the current study we expressed murine TMEM68 for the first time in mammalian cells to characterize its subcellular localization, topology, and possible biological function(s). We show that TMEM68 is an integral membrane protein and orients both, the N- and C-terminus towards the cytosol. Live cell imaging demonstrated that TMEM68 is localized mainly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not at cellular lipid droplets (LDs). The positioning of TMEM68 at the ER was dependent on its first transmembrane domain (TMD), which by itself was sufficient to target cytosolic green fluorescence protein (GFP) to the ER. In contrast, a second TMD was dispensable for ER localization of TMEM68. Finally, we found that among multiple murine tissues the expression level of TMEM68 transcripts was highest in brain. We conclude that TMEM68 is an integral ER membrane protein and a putative acyltransferase involved in brain glycerolipid metabolism."

The development of the retina into a highly organized and conserved structure, composed of six types of neurons as well as Mueller glia, is a process tightly regulated in time and space. These different cell types are born in a stereotypical order, evolutionarily conserved across species. To achieve such diversity, lineage analyses have shown that there are multipotent proliferative cells, termed retinal progenitor cells or RPCs, which change over time. These analyses have also shown that some of these RPCs are specified to make only a single type of neuron, or a specific pair of very different types of neurons, in terminal divisions (Cepko, 2014Cepko C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to lineage studies, much attention has been focused on the roles of transcription factors in the determination of the fate of retinal cell types, and in cataloguing gene expression, using all manner of RNA profiling methods, including single-cell RNA-seq. These previous studies have set the stage for analyses of the role of chromatin in regulating gene expression in retinal development and disease. To decipher developmental gene regulatory programs, extensive efforts have been made to map cis-regulatory elements, particularly enhancers, that control spatio-temporal gene expression. Advances in genome-wide methods that map DNA and histone modifications, transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, and genome organization, along with advances in computational methods, have allowed an appreciation of the features that characterize hundreds of thousands of enhancers. The dynamic nuclear organization of the genome has an important role in transcription regulation during development, with topologically associated domains (TADs) emerging as fundamental structural units confining interactions between dispersed enhancers and their target genes (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N. Xie W. et al.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, Spitz, 2016Spitz F. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 57: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since the chromatin landscape in which transcription factors operate is crucial to their ability to perform their regulatory roles, epigenetic modifications acquired during differentiation can lead to restrictions in the ability of transcription factors to affect cell fate, or other events. Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S.

DNA methylation was previously shown to be inversely correlated with transcriptional activity in the brain (Mo et al., 2015Mo A. Mukamel E.A. Davis F.P. Luo C. Henry G.L. Picard S.

While changes in DNA methylation significantly accompanied changes in expression during murine development, further analyses on validated retinal gene sets showed that only a small subset (3%–38%) of those developmentally regulated genes had an inverse correlation. As expected, genes associated with retinal differentiation were upregulated during development, while progenitor and cell-cycle genes were silenced, and DNA methylation was more often associated with the former. To characterize other epigenetic changes, Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S. Sablauer A. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 550-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar used ChIP-seq to map several histone marks, which have been associated with active or repressive chromatin. The temporal changes of epigenetic marks at the promoters and within gene bodies correlated with changes in gene expression. Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L.

To integrate these multiple epigenetic datasets, they used the algorithm chromHMM that models combinations of chromatin marks (Ernst and Kellis, 2012Ernst J. Kellis M. Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). They identified 11 chromatin states, such as actively transcribed, enhancer, bivalent promoter, polycomb-repressed, etc., and used them to annotate the genome, enabling the analyses and comparisons of the epigenetic changes during retinal development and across species. Interestingly, they identified genes that were upregulated, even though they showed a repressive state. By examining these genes in isolated rods, they found that they are epigenetically repressed in rods, while they are expressed in other, non-rod cell types. Using chromatin state modeling and changes in DNA methylation, they found that 40% of upregulated genes and 36% of downregulated genes had at least one type of correlated epigenetic change, more prevalent in differentiation genes than in progenitor genes. Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S.

Since long-range interactions between enhancers and their target promoters tend to occur within TADs that are generally stable across cell types, Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S. Sablauer A. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 550-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar used TAD boundaries from the mouse cortex to map putative enhancers to their target genes. They identified clusters of enhancers, or super-enhancers, transitioning between chromatin states during development and that were associated with rod genes, G2/M or retinal progenitor cell genes. Correlated changes in gene expression were more frequent for genes within 100 kb of a super-enhancer. Using the chromHMM data, they also classified the TADs as either active, polycomb repressed, null chromatin, or constitutive chromatin. TADs that had no marks, or were in constitutive heterochromatin at early stages, remained stable at later stages, but some TADs transitioned between active and polycomb or heterochromatin states (10% become active and 22% become repressed). Rod nuclei show areas of dense heterochromatin within the center of the nucleus, with two concentric rings of facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin surrounding the dense center. This unique inverted arrangement is seen among nocturnal species and is thought to allow light to channel more effectively through the layer of rod nuclei toward the light-sensing outer segments (Solovei et al., 2009Solovei I.

Interestingly, the cell-type specificity or chromatin state did not predict the nuclear location, e.g., genes expressed in the inner ear were localized to the euchromatin. Some progenitor genes with H3K27me3 repressive marks were found in the facultative heterochromatin and other retinal genes that are not expressed in rods and that are also H3K27me3 repressed were found in the euchromatin, along with rod genes previously shown to be localized there. Although the subnuclear localization could not be correlated to the epigenetic states, they did see that the localization was consistent across nuclei, suggesting that the 3D organization is precisely regulated. The data from Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S.

As a first application of these datasets, Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S. Sablauer A. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 550-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar analyzed the epigenetic signatures of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumors, as well as the signatures of iPS cells derived from the retina and a non-retinal cell type (Figure 1). Retinoblastomas are pediatric tumors of the retina that occur in individuals who inherit a loss of function allele in the Rb1 gene. The window of tumorigenesis is restricted to early childhood, suggesting an event that takes place early in retinal development, e.g., perhaps within the mitotic population. Several mouse models of this disease have been created using inactivation of Rb1 and related genes. The cell type(s) of origin for both human and mouse Rb tumors has been an area of interest. The approach to this question has been to analyze both morphology and gene expression in freshly explanted human and murine tumors, with the hope that a close resemblance of an Rb tumor and a particular retinal cell type will reveal the cell type of origin (Dyer, 2016Dyer M.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2016; 22: 863-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The gene expression profiles have revealed a mix of markers specific to different retinal cell types, including progenitor cells, photoreceptors, and interneurons, even within a single cell (McEvoy et al., 2011McEvoy J. Flores-Otero J. Zhang J. Nemeth K. Brennan R. Bradley C. Krafcik F. Rodriguez-Galindo C. Wilson M. Xiong S. et al.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 260-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such a mixture of gene expression patterns also occurs in normal development. Regarding morphology, one of the most striking observations was that some murine Rb tumors have extensive neural processes and synapses, which strongly resemble those of mature horizontal cells, a type of interneuron. Nonetheless, these cells divide. The current study sought to add to these previous characterizations by analyzing the epigenetic state of human and murine Rb tumors, while also performing additional RNA expression analyses. Both mouse and human Rb tumors again showed a mix of gene expression patterns, with the human tumors showing more photoreceptor markers and the murine tumors showing more markers of interneurons, in keeping with the previous studies. The epigenomes of the tumors were found to match the developmental stages likely corresponding to the presumed times of origin, namely the period of photoreceptor genesis for humans and that of inner retinal neuron genesis for mouse. One approach for the treatment of retinal degeneration is to replace lost photoreceptors by engrafting rod and/or cone cells derived from iPSCs. During reprogramming of somatic cells into iPSCs, the epigenetic memory acquired during development often persists and needs to be erased and remodelled to confer pluripotency (Nashun et al., 2015Nashun B. Hill P.W. Hajkova P. EMBO J. 2015; 34: 1296-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells reprogrammed from rod photoreceptors (r-iPSCs) are more efficient at producing differentiated retinal cells than are fibroblast iPSCs (f-iPSCs) or ESCs (Hiler et al., 2015), raising a question regarding differences in epigenetic marks in iPSCs originating from these two cell types. Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D. Griffiths L. Valentine M. Shirinifard A. Thiagarajan S. Sablauer A. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 550-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar found that repressive marks, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, were the most differential epigenetic marks between r-iPSCs and f-iPSCs, suggesting that histone modifications have a greater role than DNA methylation in epigenetic memory, perhaps as a barrier to reprogramming. They also show that, contrary to their expectation, few rod genes retained epigenetic memory in r-iPSCs. As mentioned above, rods from nocturnal species have a peculiar heterochromatin structure thought to be optimized for light penetration. Aldiri et al., 2017Aldiri I. Xu B. Wang L. Chen X. Hiler D.

Sablauer A. et al.Neuron. 2017; 94 (this issue): 550-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar suggest that the sequestration of developmental genes in the facultative chromatin could serve as a silencing mechanism. Two recent studies also addressed the chromatin structure of photoreceptors, focusing on the DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility of mature rods, as well as of cones, the photoreceptor type used in the brighter light conditions of the day (Hughes et al., 2017Hughes A.E.O.

They found that rods have a very closed chromatin architecture compared to cones and compared to other cell types, which might be related to the unique nuclear architecture of rods (Hughes et al., 2017Hughes A.E.O. Enright J.M. Myers C.A. Shen S.Q. Corbo J.C. Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 43184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another striking observation was the enrichment of hypomethylated DNA specifically in rods. These areas were in closed chromatin, where they may be protected from methyltransferases (Mo et al., 2016Mo A. Luo C. Davis F.P. Mukamel E.A. Henry G.L. Nery J.R. Urich M.A. Picard S. Lister R. Eddy S.R. et al.eLife. 2016; 5: e11613Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The hypomethylated regions have been proposed to mark vestigial enhancers active earlier in development (Mo et al., 2016Mo A. Luo C. Davis F.P. Mukamel E.A. Henry G.L. Nery J.R. Urich M.A. Picard S.

In contrast to nocturnal animals, diurnal mammals harbor a conventional chromatin architecture in rods (Solovei et al., 2009Solovei I. Kreysing M. Lanctôt C. Kösem S. Peichl L. Cremer T. Guck J.

Differences may reflect the differences between the epigenetics of human and murine rods. The genome is organized in a highly hierarchical structure and chromatin architecture undergoes extensive reorganization during development in association with gene expression (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R. Jung I. Selvaraj S. Shen Y. Antosiewicz-Bourget J.E. Lee A.Y. Ye Z. Kim A. Rajagopal N. Xie W. et al.Nature. 2015; 518: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). At birth, rod nuclei exhibit a conventional chromatin architecture in mice, with the inverted organization developing over the next several weeks or months (Solovei et al., 2009Solovei I. Kreysing M.

Further study of the changes in the three-dimensional organization of the rod genome during different stages of differentiation using FISH and comprehensive mapping of TADs, via chromosome conformation capture methodologies such as Hi-C (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

This would allow further investigation of the role of nuclear organization in transcriptional regulation, and potentially, vice versa. Previous studies have shown that the genome is organized into A and B compartments, which correspond to relatively active and inactive regions respectively, with TADs forming the basis of these higher-order chromatin structures (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009Lieberman-Aiden E. van Berkum N.L.

These data may improve our use of 3D retinal organoids and/or iPSCs for deriving cell-based therapies for retinal degenerations. In addition, their data provide a starting point for an analysis of chromatin changes in specific types of retinal progenitor cells and their progeny, as well as potentially provide a window into some of the higher-order changes in the genome that may drive the temporal progression of retinogenesis. The Dynamic Epigenetic Landscape of the Retina During Development, Reprogramming, and TumorigenesisAldiri et al.NeuronMay 03, 2017In BriefAldiri, Xu, and colleagues show in this article how the epigenome of the mouse and human retina changes during development in coordination with transcriptional programs. They also relate those developmental changes to retinoblastoma and epigenetic memory in retina-derived iPSCs. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"

Matrix protein (MA), in group-specific antigen genes (gag) of retroviruses, is associated with the virus envelope glycoproteins in most mammalian retroviruses and may be involved in virus particle assembly, transport and budding. However, the amount of annotated MAs in ERVs is still at a low level so far. No computational method to predict the exact start and end coordinates of MAs in gags has been proposed yet. In this paper, a computational method to identify MAs in ERVs is proposed. A divide and conquer technique was designed and applied to the conventional prediction model to acquire better results when dealing with gene sequences with various lengths. Initiation sites and termination sites were predicted separately and then combined according to their intervals. Three different algorithms were applied and compared: weighted support vector machine (WSVM), weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) and random forest (RF). G - mean (geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity) values of initiation sites and termination sites under 5-fold cross validation generated by random forest models are 0.9869 and 0.9755 respectively, highest among the algorithms applied. Our prediction models combine RF & WSVM algorithms to achieve the best prediction results. 98.4% of all the collected ERV sequences with complete MAs (125 in total) could be predicted exactly correct by the models. 94,671 HERV sequences from 118 families were scanned by the model, 104 new putative MAs were predicted in human chromosomes. Distributions of the putative MAs and optimizations of model parameters were also analyzed. The usage of our predicting method was also expanded to other retroviruses and satisfying results were acquired."

This week, lawmakers were expected to approve a spending plan for the 2017 fiscal year, which ends on 30 September. The deal they voted on contains a lot more good news than the two budget requests that President Donald Trump so far has sent to Congress. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NASA’s science programs are the biggest winners in a 1665-page document that closes a tumultuous budget year and staves off a government shutdown. NIH was in line for a 6.2% boost, to $34 billion, whereas NASA’s science missions received a hike of 3.1%, to $5.76 billion. The rest of the big four federal research programs—the Office of Science at the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation—trail those leaders but still grow modestly."

https://openalex.org/W2610173215,"The battle to end experiments on nonhuman primates has found its way to Mauritius, a tiny island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Last month, opposition members of the National Assembly challenged the government’s recent opening to macaque experimentation—and how it would police the welfare of animals used in such experiments. Mauritius is home to a large wild population of long-tailed macaques, which are valued in research in part because they are free of certain simian viruses. Five companies have established breeding colonies and export some 8000 animals annually to Western labs. In February, in an effort to boost the country’s profile as an incipient hub of biomedical research, the Mauritian government enacted regulations allowing companies and scientists to do macaque experiments on the island. Animal welfare groups led by London-based Cruelty Free International claim that the breeding companies are behind the move, and that they have reason to be: After a campaign by animal activists, Air France is now the only commercial airline that will deliver lab-bound macaques from Mauritius to Western countries."
https://openalex.org/W2610714629,"The Department of Energy (DOE) has stopped processing research awards worth tens of millions of dollars made by its Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). DOE officials aren’t saying why they took the unusual “no-contract action,” first reported by Politico Pro, last month. But more than a dozen projects across four new ARPA-E programs are now in limbo—and researchers fear the freeze could be a prelude to more drastic steps at an agency that President Donald Trump wants to eliminate. DOE has also imposed a gag order on ARPA-E program managers, leaving investigators in the dark about the status of their grants. And in a move that could affect hundreds of investigators, it has directed managers to ignore grantee requests for routine “no-cost” adjustments to current projects that allow researchers to adjust existing protocols to deal with logistical hurdles or to chase new ideas."
