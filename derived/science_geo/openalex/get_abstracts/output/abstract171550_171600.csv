https://openalex.org/W2042087600,"One view of the high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxide superconductors is that they are conventional superconductors where the pairing occurs between weakly interacting quasiparticles (corresponding to the electrons in ordinary metals), although the theory has to be pushed to its limit. An alternative view is that the electrons organize into collective textures (for example, charge and spin stripes) which cannot be 'mapped' onto the electrons in ordinary metals. Understanding the properties of the material would then need quantum field theories of objects such as textures and strings, rather than point-like electrons. In an external magnetic field, magnetic flux penetrates type II superconductors via vortices, each carrying one flux quantum. The vortices form lattices of resistive material embedded in the non-resistive superconductor, and can reveal the nature of the ground state-for example, a conventional metal or an ordered, striped phase-which would have appeared had superconductivity not intervened, and which provides the best starting point for a pairing theory. Here we report that for one high-Tc superconductor, the applied field that imposes the vortex lattice also induces 'striped' antiferromagnetic order. Ordinary quasiparticle models can account for neither the strength of the order nor the nearly field-independent antiferromagnetic transition temperature observed in our measurements."

Upon rapid mixing of m-CPBA with the ferric form of CYP119, an intermediate with spectral features characteristic of a ferryl-oxo-(π) porphyrin cation radical was clearly observed and identified by the absorption maxima at 370, 610, and 690 nm. The rate constant for the formation of Compound I was 3.20 (±0.3) × 105m−1 s−1 at pH 7.0, 4 °C, and this rate decreased with increasing pH. Compound I of CYP119 decomposed back to the ferric form with a first order rate constant of 29.4 ± 3.4 s−1, which increased with increasing pH. These findings form the first kinetic analysis of Compound I formation and decay in the reaction of m-CPBA with ferric P450.

Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Due to the important physiological functions of P450 enzymes, the reaction intermediates of P450 chemistry have been a subject of investigation for many years. Several discreet steps occur in the hydroxylation chemistry of the cytochrome P450s including: substrate binding, first electron transfer to the P450 from a physiological redox partner, oxygen binding (to form oxy-P450), a second electron transfer event (to form a reduced oxy or peroxo state), proton transfer to the distal oxygen (forming hydroperoxo), and an oxygen scission event producing a putative high valent iron-oxo species that subsequently generates hydroxylated product (2Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1404-1415Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The high valent iron-oxo has long been thought to be analogous to the activated iron species characterized in other oxidative enzymes (horseradish peroxidase (HRP),1 catalase, and chloroperoxidase (CPO)) and referred to as Compound I, a ferryl-oxo-(π) porphyrin cation radical (3Palaniappan V.

The intermediates in the complex P450 reaction cycle have been gradually divulged through the use of a wide range of spectroscopic techniques (6Lipscomb J.D.

Recently the peroxo and hydroperoxo intermediates have been observed through the use of cryo-enzymology techniques combined with radiolysis, generating these intermediates through gradual temperature annealing (2Davydov R.

Although there has been no identification of a Compound I intermediate by these techniques, it has been inferred by indirect measurements (2Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G.

Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). The Compound I state as well as the peroxo and hydroperoxo states of the enzyme have been proposed to be active in oxygenation events (13Raner G.M. Hatchell A.J. Morton P.E. Ballou D.P. Coon M.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Vaz A.D.N. Kessell K.J. Coon M.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13651-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To probe the nature of Compound I, meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) has been used as an oxidizing agent to produce this high valent iron-oxo through heterolytic cleavage of the organic peroxide in CPO and HRP. The Compound I species of CPO and HRP have sufficient half-lives for resonance Raman and EPR studies and have been well characterized (3Palaniappan V. Terner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16046-16053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hosten C.M. Sullivan A.M. Palaniappan V. Fitzgerald M.M. Terner J. J. Biol.

The same peroxy acid and its derivatives have been used with P450s in attempts to generate intermediates. Evidence for the existence of Compound I in P450s was demonstrated through substrate oxygenation or hydroxylation in the reaction of various organic peroxides with either liver microsomal P450 or CYP101, respectively (18Guengerich F.P. Vaz A.D.N. Raner G.N. Pernecky S.J. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Sligar S.G. Shastry B.S. Gunsalus I.C. Ullrich V. Roots I. Hildebrandt A.

Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Contrary to the evidence for Compound I formation in cytochrome P450 using m-CPBA, Blake and Coon (20Blake R.C.I. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3694-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the reactions of several peroxy acids with CYP2B4 generated other active species, which are neither Compound I nor its one-electron-reduced adduct (Compound II). However, in previous studies the generation of the Compound I intermediate in cytochrome P450 (CYP101) required a large excess of peroxyacid, leading to the rapid formation, then conversion of Compound I to other species. This inherent reactivity of CYP101 from Pseudomonas putida has made the identification of Compound I tenuous, and, despite numerous efforts, kinetic analysis could not be completed in the 10-ms time regime of the intermediate's existence (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Wagner G.C. Palcic M.M. Dunford H.B. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To provide a characterization of the spectral properties of Compound I in a thiolate-liganded heme protein, Harris et al.calculated the spectrum of methylmercaptooxyferryl protoporphyrin IX using density functional theory (DFT) (23Harris D. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The calculated spectrum had a split Soret blue shifted from the ferric Soret maximum by 60 nm with the Q bands appearing at 690 nm. Recently, Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopic studies of freeze-quenched samples from the reaction of m-CPBA with CYP101 demonstrated the existence of an organic radical and a ferryl species (24Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The techniques employed were not fast enough to capture the Compound I intermediate on the path to the observed ferryl-radical species. Again, the high concentration of m-CPBA used in these studies leads to degradation of protein, which further complicates data analysis. CYP119 is a thermostable P450 isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus with a melting temperature of 91 °C and remarkable stability to pressure denaturation (25Tschirret-Guth R.A. Koo L.S. Hui Bon Hoa G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3412-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thermostable enzymes are thought to have more rigid active site structures at room temperature than their mesophilic counterparts, which could lead to a slowing of individual steps in the catalytic cycle (27Michels P.C. Clark Douglas S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3985-3991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This alteration in relative reaction rates may enable the resolution of intermediates that occur too rapidly to be characterized in their mesophilic counterparts. CYP119 has proven to be an effective model system for the study of the intermediate states of the reaction cycle of this P450. For instance, we recently employed cryoenzymology to define the hydroperoxo state resulting from the one-electron reduction of the ferrous dioxygen state (28Denisov I.G. Hung S.C. Weiss K.E. McLean M.A. Shiro Y. Park S.Y. Champion P.M. Sligar S.G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 87: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this communication, we report the reaction kinetics of ferric CYP119 with m-CPBA using stopped-flow spectroscopy and document the formation of a spectral intermediate with the characteristic spectrum of Compound I. The relevant time scales of formation and breakdown of Compound I in this thermophilic P450 are such that a kinetic characterization of these processes under various conditions can be obtained for the first time. m-CPBA was purchased from Aldrich-Sigma and purified using the method described by Davies et al. (29Davies D.M. Jones P. Mantle D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, m-CPBA was re-crystallized in a 1:3 ether/petroleum ether solution and characterized by NMR. Solutions of m-CPBA for kinetic studies were prepared by addition of an acetone stock. Them-CPBA concentrations were determined by iodide oxidation to triiodide with the extinction coefficient of 25.5 mm−1 cm−1 at 353 nm (30Ramette R.W. Sandford R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 5001-5005Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cytochrome P450 CYP119 expression and purification fromEscherichia coli are as published previously (26McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Maves S.A. Sligar S.G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined based on the Soret maximum at 415 nm (ε = 104 mm−1 cm−1). All steady-state UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U3300 spectrophotometer. Single wavelength stopped-flow measurements were performed on a KinTek (Austin, TX) model SF-2001 stopped-flow system at 4 °C. For multiple-wavelength absorption studies, a stopped-flow apparatus (model SX-18MV) and the associated computer system fromApplied Photophysics (Surrey, UK) were used. Multiple-wavelength absorption studies were carried out using a photodiode array detector and X-SCAN software (Applied Photophysics, Ltd.). The dead-time of this instrument is about two milliseconds. In a typical experiment one syringe contained CYP119 (6 μm heme) buffered in 100 mm phosphate (at various pH), and the other contained various concentrations of m-CPBA. The reaction temperature was controlled by a water bath. Spectral deconvolution and kinetic analysis were performed by global analysis and numerical integration methods using PRO-K software (Applied Photophysics, Ltd.). Reaction kinetics of m-CPBA with ferric CYP119 were first obtained by following the decay of the ferric signal at 415 nm and a concurrent increase of absorption at 370 nm. Variousm-CPBA/CYP119 concentration ratios were investigated, as shown in Fig. 1. At m-CPBA concentrations less than half that of the ferric protein, the absorption kinetics clearly show the formation of an intermediate by a second order process. The spectral intermediate then decays in a first order manner, with the spectrum returning to that of a ferric enzyme. At 21 μm CYP119 and an m-CPBA concentration of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μm, the maximal observed absorbance change corresponds to 1, 2.1, and 3.4% of the total enzyme concentration, respectively. At higher m-CPBA concentrations, more complicated kinetic behavior was observed, with a broadband decrease in absorbance indicating protein decomposition (see “Discussion”). Fig. 2 shows intermediate formation by the increase of absorption at 370 nm in the reaction of ferric CYP119 with a substoichiometric concentration of m-CPBA. The data (○) are easily fit by a mechanism involving second order formation and first order decay (solid line, Reaction 1). Moreover, to assess the order of reactions (inset), the initial velocity of the intermediate formation was plotted against m-CPBA concentration, clearly showing the linear increase in velocity with increasing substrate concentration, indicative of a second order reaction. On the other hand, the decay rate constants obtained by the mechanism described above are within the range of 27–33 s−1 and independent of m-CPBA concentration for the reactions of 21 μm ferric CYP119 with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μm m-CPBA. It is evident that the decomposition of this intermediate goes through a first order process under substoichiometric amount of m-CPBA. Note that at highm-CPBA concentrations there appears to be a departure from first order decomposition process, indicating a combination of protein destruction and side oxidation processes. To better characterize the first intermediate formed in this reaction, multi-wavelength kinetic measurements were carried out at low m-CPBA concentrations. Rapid-scan stopped-flow spectrophotometry, together with singular value decomposition, was used to provide spectral identification of the observed intermediate. In this case, full spectra as a function of time were analyzed using the following model. CYP119 (ferric)+m­CPBA →k1 Intermediate I →k2 CYP119 (ferric) REACTION 1The spectra of the ferric protein and Intermediate I as well as the kinetic trace of each species involved were resolved (Fig.3). As indicated, rapid mixing ofm-CPBA with CYP119 produced a spectral intermediate (solid line, Fig. 3 A) with absorbance maxima at 370, 610, and 690 nm. This spectrum is indicative of a Compound I state of the enzyme, as shown by the DFT calculations from Harris et al. (23Harris D. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The formation of Compound I at a ratio of m-CPBA to protein of 1:2.5 (pH 7.0) had a second order rate (k 1) of 3.20 (± 0.3) × 105m−1s−1, and a first order decomposition rate (k 2) of 29.4 ± 3.4 s−1. Whenm-CPBA concentrations were higher than the concentration of CYP119, protein decay occurred in multiple complicated kinetic processes. To probe the role of proton concentration on Compound I formation, the reaction between CYP119 and m-CPBA was studied as a function of pH by means of multi-wavelength measurements. The rates of formation and decay for compound I in CYP119 at different pH are shown in TableI. Additionally, the rates of formation and decay for Compound I were increased with an increase in reaction temperature. The Arrhenius plot (data not shown) for the Compound I formation reaction (k 1) equates to anE a = 14.1 kcal/mole and the decay rate (k 2) E a = 18.1 kcal/mol.Table IThe observed second order formation (k1 ) and first order decomposition (k2 ) rate constants of CYP119 Compound I at various pH valuespHk 1 (M −1 s −1)k 2(s −1)6.24.28 (±1.5) × 10522.0 ± 3.16.63.69 (±0.4) × 10527.5 ± 5.27.03.20 (±0.3) × 10529.4 ± 3.47.42.49 (±0.3) × 10532.1 ± 3.67.81.86 (±0.3) × 10537.6 ± 3.1 Open table in a new tab The thermostable cytochrome P450 CYP119 has proven to be an excellent system for investigating the nature of intermediates with higher oxidation states of this important class of heme proteins. Previous attempts to form and isolate a Compound I intermediate in CYP101 and other P450s were hampered by the use of a large excess of peroxyacids, leading to rapid progression from Compound I to other intermediates and concomitant protein destruction (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The formation of Compound I in CYP119 was slowed both by the use of lower concentrations of m-CPBA and by the temperature at which the experiments were carried out (4 °C), which was well below the physiological temperature for this thermophilic enzyme (80 °C). This allowed the detection of an intermediate clearly defined as Compound I well within the time scale accessible by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Protein degradation, which can often complicate kinetic analysis, was largely avoided. These properties of Compound I formation in CYP119 have made the spectral and kinetic characterization of this previously elusive chemical species in P450s possible. CYP119 is capable of forming an intermediate with the spectral characteristics of a Compound I, ferryl-oxo-(π) porphyrin cation radical, when rapidly mixed with the peroxy acid m-CPBA. The spectral similarities of the CYP119 Compound I to the optical spectra of Compound I in other heme proteins are summarized in TableII. The Soret band of this Compound I was asymmetric and single-peaked at 370 nm (Fig. 3 A), while asymmetric Soret bands of both CYP101 and CPO are at 367 nm (21Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Hager L.P. Doubek D.L. Silverstein R.M. Hargis J.H. Martin J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This asymmetric feature has been deconvoluted using Gaussian-type transition bands and assigned as the splitting Soret band of thed-type hyper-porphyrin in the recent spectroscopic studies of CPO Compound I (16Egawa T. Proshlyakov D.A. Miki H. Makino R. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, the visible spectrum of CYP119 Compound I has almost identical absorption intensity at 610 and 690 nm, whereas the intensity at 610 nm of CPO Compound I is lower than its absorption at 688 nm. Overall, these findings indicate the similarity between the Compound I entity of these two thiolate-ligated heme proteins and the minor differences in the absorption spectra can be attributed to their electronic structure differences. Similar spectral characteristics of P450 Compound I have also been generated from DFT calculations by Harris et al. (23Harris D. Loew G. Waskell L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 83: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The calculated spectra of the methylmercaptooxyferryl protoporphyrin IX model structure are blue-shifted by 50–60 nm in both the ferric resting state and Compound I; however, the other features and the peak shapes are quite similar to the results presented here. The major peak in the split Soret band of the calculated Compound I spectrum is blue-shifted from the ferric Soret by 60 nm, similar to the 45 nm shift in the CYP119 Compound I. Additionally, the Q-bands of the calculated Compound I are shifted to 690 nm, with the equivalent bands in the same location for CYP119 Compound I.Table IIComparison of the absorption maxima (in nm) of Compounds I and II for various heme proteinsCompound ICompound IIRef.CYP119370, 610, 690This workCYP101367, 694(21Egawa T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) to form an intermediate with spectral characteristics similar to those of CYP119 Compound I. However, this intermediate was formed in the dead-time of the stopped-flow instrument used and decomposed rapidly into a series of unidentified intermediates. The high concentration of peracid used also caused breakdown of the protein. The experimental conditions necessary to generate the putative Compound I in CYP101 included the use of a 30-fold excess of m-CPBA, increasing the formation rate to the point that the intermediate was fleetingly formed and rapidly decayed. The Compound I, formed under the conditions presented here, in CYP119 has a half-life more than an order of magnitude longer than the apparent CYP101 half-life with high concentrations ofm-CPBA. This longer half-life has allowed the first kinetic characterization of the formation and decomposition processes for Compound I in a P450. To compare the reaction kinetics of CYP119 Compound I with other heme proteins, rate constants for Compound I formation and decay in various systems are summarized in TableIII. While the Compound I states of the other three proteins are stable enough to detect at room temperature, characterization of a P450 Compound I species necessitated the utilization of a thermophilic protein and low temperature (4 °C).Table IIIThe formation (k1 ) and decomposition (k2 ) rate constants of Compounds I of several heme proteinsk 1k 2M−1s−1CYP1193-apH 7.0, 4 °C, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, this work.3.20 × 10529.4 s−1CPO3-bpH 4.7, 25 °C, peroxyacetic acid (38).3.8 × 1060.5 s−13-eObtained by first order approximation, the decay of CPO Compound I goes to either the ferric form or CPO Compound II.Catalase3-cpH 7, 25 °C, peroxyacetic acid, ox liver catalase (33).1.44 × 1041.6 × 10−4s−1HRP3-dpH 7, 25 °C, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (39).3.5 × 1071.1 × 106 M −1 s−13-fThe HRP Compound I reacts with a second m-CPBA molecule so that the decay is a second order reaction.3-a pH 7.0, 4 °C, m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, this work.3-b pH 4.7, 25 °C, peroxyacetic acid (38Araiso T.

Open table in a new tab The kinetic competence in the conversion of the observed intermediate to an oxygenated product would be a valuable piece of information. Unfortunately, the physiological substrate for this enzyme is not known. However, the addition of laurate to the reaction mixture in a double mixing configuration after the addition of m-CPBA leads to complete quenching of the observed spectral intermediate within the dead-time of the instrument. The reaction of a Compound I intermediate with juxtaposed substrate has been suggested to be very fast, and hence we do not expect to directly observe the kinetic conversion to product. Analysis of the reaction mixture following addition of laurate in this double-mix experiment demonstrated the presence of hydroxylaurate as a product (data not shown), suggesting the coupling of intermediate decay to substrate oxygenation. The pH dependence for Compound I formation reflects the pK ofm-CPBA of 7.4. Previous data have shown that the protonated form of m-CPBA is the active species for Compound I formation, leading to increased rates of Compound I formation at lower pH (20Blake R.C.I. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3694-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the m-CPBA reaction with CYP119 is similar to the behavior of catalase reacting with peroxyacetic acid (33Jones P. Middlemiss D.N. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In both cases the results are most simply interpreted as a reaction between the enzyme and non-ionized peroxy acid molecules. This is substantiated by similar pH dependence for the reaction between peroxybenzoic acid and horseradish peroxidase (29Davies D.M. Jones P. Mantle D. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Additionally, the E a for Compound I formation (14.1 kcal/mol) in CYP119 is relatively high compared with the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with peroxidases (2.5–5 kcal/mol) that utilize hydrogen peroxide as a substrate (34Marklund S. Ohlsson P.I. Opara A. Paul K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 350: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the recent findings for the reaction of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase with hydrogen peroxide, which also has an elevatedE a (∼24 kcal/mol) of its Compound I formation and does not use hydrogen peroxide as a native substrate (35Bakovic M. Dunford H.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The disappearance of CYP119 Compound I is a first order process. This makes it unlikely that the degradation of Compound I involves O2 formation by nucleophilic attack of a secondm-CPBA molecule as observed in chloroperoxidase (32Hager L.P. Doubek D.L. Silverstein R.M. Hargis J.H. Martin J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarly, the possibility of the formation of Compound II from the reaction of Compound I with a second peroxy acid molecule as in HRP can be ruled out. One possibility is that the oxene oxygen is transferred to the protein. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the slow regeneration of the ferric state in catalase, from Compound I, is carried out by a reducing equivalent originating from the protein matrix (33Jones P. Middlemiss D.N. Biochem. J. 1972; 130: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Pfister T.D. Gengenbach A.J. Syn S. Lu Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14942-14951Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The CYP119 Compound I decays to the low-spin ferric form at a rate about 105 times faster than that of catalase Compound I. These active species can be reduced by any adventitious reducing equivalent from the protein matrix (4Benecky M.J. Frew J.E. Scowen N. Jones P. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11929-11933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the Compound I decomposition rate is similar to the decay of ferryl intermediate in cytochrome c oxidase, which was explained by an auto-reduction pathway (37Fabian M. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1867-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taken together, the mechanism of degradation of CYP119 Compound I and the regeneration of the ferric enzyme can only be determined with more experimental analysis. The kinetic characterization of Compound I formation in CYP119 has allowed for the optimization of conditions for the maximal production of this putative reaction intermediate in time regimes accessible to other spectroscopic methods. The information thus obtained will aid in the further determination of the nature of Compound I in P450 reactions.

(2000) Traffic 1, 852–870), raising the possibility of a novel trafficking pathway through the early secretory pathway. We now report that export of CFTR from the ER is regulated by the conventional coat protein complex II (COPII) in all cell types tested. Remarkably, in a cell type-specific manner, processing of CFTR from the core-glycosylated (band B) ER form to the complex-glycosylated (band C) isoform followed a non-conventional pathway that was insensitive to dominant negative Arf1, Rab1a/Rab2 GTPases, or the SNApREceptor (SNARE) component syntaxin 5, all of which block the conventional trafficking pathway from the ER to the Golgi. Moreover, CFTR transport through the non-conventional pathway was potently blocked by overexpression of the late endosomal target-SNARE syntaxin 13, suggesting that recycling through a late Golgi/endosomal system was a prerequisite for CFTR maturation. We conclude that CFTR transport in the early secretory pathway can involve a novel pathway between the ER and late Golgi/endosomal compartments that may influence developmental expression of CFTR on the cell surface in polarized epithelial cells.

Although nearly 1000 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene, ∼70% of CF chromosomes contain the ΔF508 mutation, which leads to severe forms of the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) (3.Mickle J.E.

Deletion of F508 prevents proper folding and trafficking of CFTR from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (6.Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A.

Both wild-type CFTR and CFTR-ΔF508 can be detected in ER and ER-Golgi transport intermediates, but only wild-type CFTR is readily expressed at the cell surface (2.Jilling T. Kirk K.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 172: 193-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Gilbert A. Jadot M. Leontieva E. Wattiaux-De Coninck S. Wattiaux R. Exp.

Both newly synthesized wild-type CFTR and CFTR-ΔF508 molecules that neither fold productively nor achieve an ER export-competent conformation are eliminated by covalent addition of ubiquitin followed by degradation via the proteosome (10.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 11.Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Whereas ∼20–40% of wild-type CFTR nascent chains become properly folded, are exported from the ER, and acquire complex carbohydrates characteristic of passage through the Golgi apparatus, negligible levels of CFTR-ΔF508 follow this pathway, and CFTR-Δ508 is quantitatively degraded (12.Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 13.Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To rationally develop therapeutic means to stimulate CFTR-ΔF508 trafficking from the ER to the cell surface, it is first necessary to understand the mechanisms and pathways directing wild-type CFTR trafficking. By using morphological analyses, we recently reported that although wild-type CFTR was readily detectable in ER membranes, ER-Golgi transport intermediates, endosomes, and the plasma membrane, it was largely absent from the Golgi stack in vivo and in situ (14.Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of CFTR export from the ER as well as the biochemical foundation for its absence from Golgi cisternae were not addressed. We have therefore examined the biosynthetic pathway of CFTR trafficking through the early secretory pathway at the molecular level. We report that not only is the trafficking pathway by which CFTR acquires complex carbohydrates cell type-specific but that CFTR maturation can utilize a non-conventional pathway whereby the protein is first likely to be transported to distal Golgi compartments and/or the endosomal system prior to retrieval to earlier Golgi compartments for oligosaccharide processing to the complex form. Pharmacological modulation of this non-conventional pathway may be useful to selectively stimulate CFTR-ΔF508 transport to the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following antibodies were used in this study: a monoclonal antibody (M3A7) against the second nucleotide-binding domain of CFTR (15.Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 629-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody (p5D4) against the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (16.Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and a polyclonal antibody against Rab6 (B. Goud, Institut Curie, Paris, France) (17.Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads were from Amersham Biosciences; BFA was from Calbiochem; Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent, Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, DMEM, and α-minimum Eagle's medium were from Invitrogen; and Easy Tag Express Protein Labeling 35S-Met Mix was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Vaccinia Virus Infection and TransfectionBHK, HeLa, and HEK- 293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. CHO and CHO-15B cells were maintained α-minimum Eagle's medium as above. Infection with T7 RNA polymerase-recombinant vaccinia virus and transfection were performed as described (18.Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, BHK cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in 60-mm cell culture dishes 1 day prior to experimentation. Before infection, cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I and then infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (19.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc.

Infection media were removed; cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I, and cells were co-transfected with 7 μg of pcDNA3.1 wild-type CFTR and 7 μg of pcDNA3.1/pET vector (21.Dascher C. Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) containing trafficking machinery using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent, following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection medium was aspirated after 3 h and replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for an additional 5–7 h. Expression of recombinant GTPases and SNARE components were verified using immunoblotting with specific antibodies (data not shown) to ensure typical expression levels of 5–10-fold over endogenous protein levels (21.Dascher C. Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Experiments comparing effects of trafficking machinery components on transport of VSV-G and CFTR were performed in parallel.Transport AnalysisTransport analysis of VSV-G was performed as described previously (18.Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For transport analysis of CFTR, medium was removed after 8–10 h of transfection, and cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (pre-warmed to 37 °C) and incubated for 30 min in methionine-deficient minimum Eagle's medium. Cells were radiolabeled for 20–30 min with 500 μCi of Trans35S-label and then chased in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mm cold methionine. For experiments utilizing BFA, cells were chased in the above medium containing 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) or equivalent levels of ethanol as control. After the indicated chase periods, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were spun at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and incubated with M3A7 monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitates were isolated with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed 4 times with ice-cold RIPA buffer and eluted with 1× Laemmli sample buffer (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and supernatants, containing CFTR protein, were separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were treated with enhancing solution (125 mm sodium salicylate, 35% methanol) for 1 h and dried. Signals were developed by autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Graphical results represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments for all conditions tested.RESULTSCFTR Maturation Is Blocked by Dominant Negative Sar1-GTPTo investigate the mechanism(s) of wild-type CFTR trafficking in the early secretory pathway, we used a recombinant T7-vaccinia virus expression system (19.Fuerst T.R.

This approach has been used previously (23.Ostedgaard L.S. Zeiher B. Welsh M.J. J.

To block COPII vesicle function in BHK cells, we co-expressed wild-type CFTR with Sar1-GTP(H79G), a constitutively active mutant locked in the GTP-bound form that inhibits vesicle uncoating leading to the accumulation of ER to Golgi transport intermediates (28.Rowe T.

Following labeling of cells with a pulse of [35S]methionine, delivery of CFTR to the Golgi was measured by the conversion of the ∼140–150-kDa core-glycosylated band B pre-Golgi form to ∼170–190-kDa complex glycosylated band C isoform diagnostic of processing by Golgi-associated mannosidases and glycosyltransferases leading to the addition of polylactosamine (31.O'Riordan C.R.

By contrast, no detectable levels of CFTR in the band C glycoisoform were observed following overexpression of Sar1-GTP(H79G) (Fig. 1B). As a control, under identical conditions we also tested the effect of Sar1-GTP(H79G) on the processing of the reporter cargo type 1 transmembrane protein vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) from the endoglycosidase H (endo H)-sensitive pre-Golgi form to the endo H-resistant, Golgi-processed glycoisoform as described previously (28.Rowe T.

Thus, export of CFTR from the ER, like VSV-G, is dependent on a COPII-mediated mechanism. Consistent with this interpretation, morphological analyses of cells expressing wild-type CFTR using high resolution deconvolution microscopy showed a significant co-localization of wild-type CFTR with the Sar1 GTPase (∼70% of Sar1 containing punctate structures) and the Sec23 component of the COPII coat complex (∼40% of punctate Sec23 containing structures) (Fig. 1E) that was significantly reduced in cells expressing the ΔF508 mutant that cannot exit the ER (∼15% of Sar1 containing punctate structures; <10% of Sec23 containing structures) (Fig. 1E) (35.Riordan J.R.

Genet. 1999; 64: 1499-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).To quantitatively express the efficiency of maturation of CFTR from band B to band C glycisoforms, we compared the ratio of CFTR band C to CFTR band B as a function of time. If the band C/band B (C/B) ratio remains unaltered relative to the control by co-expression with dominant negative mutants, CFTR processing to the mature glycoisoform is not affected. If the C/B ratio is reduced, CFTR processing to the mature glycoisoform is inhibited. By using this method, we found that although expression of CFTR alone exhibited a C/B ratio of ∼6 after a 3-h chase period, co-transfection with Sar1-GTP(H79G) yielded a C/B ratio of ∼0.1 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, not only was CFTR processing blocked by the Sar1-GTP(H79G) mutant but Sar1-GTP(H79G) stabilized immature CFTR band B and reduced its rate of degradation ∼3–6-fold (Fig. 1A).CFTR Maturation Is Not Blocked by Dominant Negative Arf1-GTPWhereas the above results are consistent with the generally accepted view that the COPII machinery is involved in the export of cargo proteins from the ER (26.Kuge O.

Science. 1998; 279: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). COPI components include the small molecular weight GTPase Arf1 and the coatomer coat complex. The function of the COPI coat complex remains controversial. COPI may function to regulate anterograde transport of VTCs from the ER to the Golgi stack, transport within the Golgi stack, and/or the retrograde transport of recycling components from pre-Golgi and Golgi membranes to the ER (27.Scales S.J.

Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated that the Arf1-GTP(Q71L) mutant was functional under these conditions as it stimulated coatomer (β-COP) recruitment to Golgi membranes (data not shown) and completely blocked the processing of VSV-G to the endo H-resistant form (Fig. 2D) as reported previously (24.Dascher C.

Remarkably, overexpression of Arf1-GTP(Q71L) in BHK cells had no effect on the rate of CFTR band B degradation, the rate of CFTR band C formation, or the CFTR C/B ratio (Fig. 2, A–C). Thus, CFTR maturation is Arf1-independent, suggesting that neither the potential role of Arf1 in anterograde transport nor retrograde recycling of transport components perturbs egress or degradation of wild-type CFTR from the ER in BHK cells.Figure 2CFTR processing is independent of Arf1 function in BHK cells.

In contrast to agonists such as insulin, this occurs independently of PKB activation. In this report, we investigate the mechanism by which TPA regulates 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Treatment of HEK293 cells with TPA was found to result in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser64, Thr69, and Thr36/45. The TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of all these sites is sensitive to inhibitors of MEK and to the inhibitor of mTOR, rapamycin, indicating that inputs from both mTOR and MEK are required for the regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by TPA. Indeed, evidence is presented that mTOR may initially be required for the phosphorylation of Thr45 in a priming step, which is necessary for the subsequent phosphorylation of Ser64 and Thr69 through an Erk-dependent pathway. Overexpression of constitutively active MEK in HEK293 cells resulted both in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser64 and Thr36/45 and its release from eIF4E. In this case, the phosphorylation of these sites was also blocked by inhibitors of MEK or by rapamycin. In conclusion, the Erk pathway, via mechanisms also requiring mTOR, regulates the phosphorylation of multiple sites in 4E-BP1 in vivo and this is sufficient for the release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E.

Of these, initiation is considered the rate-limiting step and therefore is considered the most important step in the acute regulation of translation. Essential for initiation of cap-dependent protein synthesis is the assembly of the initiation complex, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate4E-BP1eIF4E binding protein 1mTORmammalian target of rapamycinPI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePKBprotein kinase BMAP kinasemitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinaseErkextracellular signal-regulated kinasePKCprotein kinase CBIMbisindolylmaleimideCA-MEKconstitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 4F, containing the initiation factors eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein, eIF4E, the protein which binds to the 5′ cap structure and eIF4A, a bidirectional RNA helicase (for review, see Ref. 1.Gingras A.C.

The formation of the eIF4F complex is regulated by a variety of stimuli through the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways. eIF4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), also known as protein-heat and acid-stable I, is a translational repressor that regulates eIF4F assembly and therefore cap-dependent translation (for review, see Ref. 1.Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 binds to a site on eIF4E that overlaps the binding site for eIF4G and it therefore competes with eIF4G for binding to eIF4E, which results in the inhibition of eIF4F assembly (2.Haghighat A.

In this report we demonstrate that TPA, a potent activator of Erk, leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr36/45, Ser64, and Thr69, and that this leads to the dissociation of eIF4E from 4E-BP1. Phosphorylation at these sites is sensitive to inhibitors of MEK and rapamycin, indicating that inputs from both mTOR and MEK are required for TPA regulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Additionally, activation of the Erk pathway in HEK293 cells through the overexpression of constitutively active MEK resulted in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at positions Thr36/45 and Ser64, and its release from eIF4E. Microcystin LR, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), rapamycin, and PD098059 were purchased from Calbiochem. Materials for tissue culture were from Invitrogen. m7GTP-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. U0126 was obtained from Promega. All other chemicals (unless stated) were obtained from Sigma. PD184352 was provided by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy, Dundee University. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to treatment, cells were grown to 80% confluence before being serum starved for 18 h. Details of treatments are provided in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, antipain, and leupeptin). The lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were removed and used for further analysis. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (24.Price D.J. Gunsalus J.R. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7944-7948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Anti-human eIF4E antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 5–23 of the protein. The anti-4E-BP1 antibody was a generous gift from Adri Thomas (Utrecht). Anti-phospho 4E-BP1, PKB, and Erk antibodies were supplied by New England Biolabs. Anti-Erk5 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotech. Densitometry was performed using the program Image Quant (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). m7GTP-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added to 0.2–0.5 mg of cell lysate. The lysates were then mixed with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The m7GTP-Sepharose was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 2 min. The beads were then washed three times in extraction buffer. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were removed from the m7GTP matrix by boiling in SDS loading buffer and, after centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on to the gel. A PCR directed fragment-encoding rat 4E-BP1 was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pcDNA3.1myc/3his− (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3–4E-BP1 expressing Myc and His-tagged 4E-BP1. The codon for residue Thr45 of 4E-BP1 within pcDNA3–4E-BP1 was mutated to encode alanine using the QuikChangeTMmutagenesis kit (Stratagene) producing the vector pcDNA3–4E-BP1T45A. pCA-MEK expressing a constitutively active form of MEK1 (ΔN3-S218E/S222D MEK1), and pErk2-MEK-La expressing a constitutively active form of Erk (25.Robinson M.J.

Axel Knebel (University of Dundee) and Melanie Cobb (University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas), respectively. Transient transfections were performed as described by Alessi et al.

We have previously provided evidence that the phorbol ester, TPA elicits the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 though a mechanism that is dependent upon MEK but independent of PI 3-kinase and PKB (19.Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To characterize further the role of the MEK/Erk pathway in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, we first investigated which sites within 4E-BP1 were phosphorylated in response to TPA using previously described phospho-specific antibodies (12.Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1, Myc/His-tagged 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1myc/his) was expressed in HEK293 cells. The cells were then treated with TPA, insulin, and/or specific kinase inhibitors. As previously observed, TPA treatment led to the phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 1a) and a decrease in the mobility of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1b, i) on SDS-PAGE, which is indicative of its phosphorylation. TPA caused an increase in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his at Ser64 and Thr69 and a small increase in the phosphorylation of Thr36/45 as assessed using anti-phospho-Ser(P)64, Thr(P)69, and Thr(P)36/45 specific antibodies (Fig. 1b, ii-iv). Similar increases in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his were detected when cells were stimulated with insulin (Fig. 1b). A basal level of phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at both Thr69 and Thr36/45 was also detected in serum-starved untreated cells (Fig. 1b, iii and iv). Pretreatment of the cells with each of three structurally distinct inhibitors of MEK (the upstream activator of Erk), PD098059, U0126, and PD184352 (27.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J.

Barrett S.D. Bridges A. Przybranowski S. Leopold W.R. Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TPA-stimulated Erk phosphorylation as assessed using an anti-phospho-Erk antibody (Fig. 1a, i) (as a loading control the same samples were probed with anti-Erk 2 antibody (Fig. 1a, ii)). All three MEK inhibitors caused an inhibition of TPA-stimulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Ser64 and partially blocked the phosphorylation at Thr69 and Thr36/45. These inhibitors also decreased the basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr69 and Thr36/45 (Fig. 1b, iii and iv). It has been reported that each of the three MEK inhibitors used in this study can also inhibit MEK5, the upstream activator of Erk5 (30.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3962) Google Scholar, 31.Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that the effect of these inhibitors was through inhibition of Erk5. We therefore investigated whether TPA could cause phosphorylation of Erk5 in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were treated with TPA and extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an anti-Erk5 antibody (Fig. 2). As a positive control, HeLa cell lysates treated with EGF were run alongside (32.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). EGF treatment of HeLa cells leads to the phosphorylation of Erk5 as indicated by a shift in its mobility on SDS-PAGE. However, no phosphorylation of Erk5 was detected upon TPA stimulation of HEK293 cells (Fig. 2), thus excluding a role for this pathway in the effect of TPA on 4E-BP1. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells with rapamycin, inhibited the TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser64 and abolished or markedly inhibited both basal and its TPA-stimulated phosphorylation at Thr69 and Thr36/45, respectively (Fig. 1b). However, rapamycin had no effect on the phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 1a), suggesting that it exerts its effect independently of the MEK/Erk pathway. TPA activates both classical and novel PKC isoforms (33.Rasmussen H. Isales C.M. Calle R. Throckmorton D. Anderson M. Gasalla-Herraiz J. McCarthy R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 649-681PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, pretreatment of cells with the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor BIM inhibited the effect of TPA on the phosphorylation of both Erk and 4E-BP1myc/his (Fig. 1, a and b). These results provide strong evidence that the Erk pathway (specifically MEK) plays a role in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his at Ser64, Thr69, and Thr36/45induced by TPA. It has previously been reported that the extent of insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at one site can modulate the phosphorylation of another site, with Thr36 or Thr45 having the most dramatic influence on the phosphorylation at other sites (12.Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33836-33843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14.Gingras A.C.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). To investigate whether TPA-stimulated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation was regulated similarly, Thr45 of 4E-BP1 was mutated to an alanine creating the vector 4E-BP1T45A Myc/His. The phosphorylation of overexpressed 4E-BP1T45A Myc/His and 4E-BP1myc/his upon insulin or TPA stimulation was monitored using the phospho-specific antibodies. As previously shown (see Fig. 1), stimulation of cells with either TPA or insulin resulted in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his at Thr36/45, Ser64, and Thr69 (Fig. 3). In contrast, neither TPA nor insulin led to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1T45A Myc/His at Thr36or Ser64 and there was a severe reduction in the phosphorylation at Thr69 (Fig. 3). This suggests that phosphorylation of these residues in 4E-BP1 in response to TPA depends upon (prior) phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr45, as suggested earlier for the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to insulin or serum (34.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 35.Mothe-Satney I. Yang D. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To demonstrate directly that MEK plays a role in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the vector pCA-MEK encoding constitutively active MEK (CA-MEK) together with pcDNA3–4E-BP1 encoding 4E-BP1myc/his. As a control, cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3–4E-BP1 and an empty vector. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his was investigated using phospho-specific antibodies for Thr36/45, Ser64, and Thr69. Overexpression of CA-MEK led to the phosphorylation of Erk and a decrease in the mobility of 4E-BP1myc/his on SDS-PAGE, indicative of increased phosphorylation (Fig. 4, a and b, i). Overexpression of CA-MEK resulted in the phosphorylation of Ser64 (Fig. 4b, ii) and increased phosphorylation at Thr36/45 as assessed using phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 4b, iii). In contrast to the situation for cells treated with TPA, no significant change in the phosphorylation of Thr69 was detected. However, some variation between experiments in the basal/control levels of phosphorylation at Thr36/45 and Thr69 was observed. Treatment of cells overexpressing CA-MEK and 4E-BP1myc/his with U0126, PD098059, or PD184352, inhibitors of MEK (27.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 28.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

In general, U0126 was more effective than PD098059 at inhibiting the phosphorylation of both Erk and 4E-BP1myc/his. This most likely reflects differences in the mechanisms by which these two inhibitors work. U0126 is thought to block the activity of MEK whereas PD098059 is thought to inhibit MEK activation (27.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 28.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Incubation of cells expressing CA-MEK with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, also inhibited CA-MEK-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser64 and abolished or markedly inhibited both basal and MEK-stimulated phosphorylation at Thr36/45 and Thr69, respectively, without affecting the phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 4, a and b). The activation of MEK may lead to the activation of various PKC isoforms including PKCδ, which itself has been implicated in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (37.Kumar V. Pandey P. Sabatini D. Kumar M. Majumder P.K. Bharti A. Carmichael G. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MEK was acting through PKC, cells expressing CA-MEK were treated with the PKC inhibitor BIM. In contrast to the effect of BIM on TPA stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1), BIM had only a small effect on the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at the sites investigated (Fig. 4, a and b), indicating that PKC was probably not mediating the effect of CA-MEK. To rule out the possibility that MEK activation could lead to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through activation of PKB, the phosphorylation status of PKB in cells expressing constitutively active MEK was monitored using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser473. Phosphorylation of this site is required for activation of PKB (26.Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). As a positive control, cells were treated with insulin. Insulin treatment resulted in a large increase in the phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473. In contrast, expression of constitutively active MEK did not (Fig. 4c). Thus, CA-MEK does not activate PKB. These results provide evidence that MEK activation leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his in vivo at Ser64 and Thr36/45 through an mTOR-dependent mechanism, which does not involve activation of PKB. As an adjunct to the above and to define the role of Erk (as opposed to MEK) in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3–4E-BP1 expressing 4E-BP1myc/his and pERK2-MEK1-LA expressing a MEK/ERK fusion protein which has constitutive Erk activity (25.Robinson M.J.

As a control, cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3–4E-BP1 and an empty vector. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was investigated using the phospho-specific antibodies for Ser64 and Thr69. Expression of constitutively active MEK/Erk led to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his at Ser64 and a shift in its mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5). In contrast to cells stimulated with TPA, a small increase in the phosphorylation of Ser69 was detected upon expression of MEK-Erk. However, some variation in the basal/control levels of Thr69 phosphorylation was observed between experiments. Pretreatment of the cells with PD098059, an inhibitor of MEK (27.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 28.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar), resulted in the inhibition the phosphorylation of Ser65 and a partial inhibition in the basal phosphorylation of Ser69in MEK-Erk expressing cells. This was in parallel with the inhibition of Erk phosphorylation as assessed using a phospho-specific antibody to Erk. As a loading control, identical samples were probed with anti-Erk 2 antibody. Incubation of these cells with rapamycin also inhibited Erk-stimulated and basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1myc/his at Ser64 and Thr69, respectively. These results provide further, more direct, evidence that Erk activation, rather than any possible consequences of MEK activation, leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in vivo. We have previously demonstrated that stimulation of HEK293 cells with TPA leads to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from eIF4E and that these effects were blocked by inhibitors of MEK (19.Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the Erk pathway in the binding of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E, serum-starved HEK293 cells expressing 4E-BP1myc/his were treated with TPA, insulin, or transfected with CA-MEK and the association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 was studied using m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography. TPA, insulin, or the overexpression of CA-MEK led to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 6a) and to the dissociation of both endogenous and 4E-BP1myc/his from eIF4E (Fig. 6b). This indicates that the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through the activation of the Erk pathway is sufficient for release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. We have previously demonstrated that in HEK293 cells, TPA causes the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and its dissociation from eIF4E via a mechanism which is independent of PI 3-kinase and PKB, but dependent on MEK (19.Herbert T.P. Kilhams G.R. Batty I.H. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11249-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this report we further investigate the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by TPA by determining the sites at which 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated under these conditions and identifying the signaling pathways which lead to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Treatment of HEK293 cells with TPA, a potent activator of Erk, results in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr69, Ser64, and Thr36/45 (Figs. 1, 3, and 6). Phosphorylation at these sites is blocked by three structurally distinct inhibitors of MEK, PD098059, U0126, and PD154352 (Fig. 1). Additionally, expression of constitutively active MEK results in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Ser64 and Thr36/45 (Fig. 4). TPA and the expression of an activated form of MEK each led to the dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E (Fig. 6). Taken together, this provides strong evidence that the Erk pathway regulates the phosphorylation and function of 4E-BP1 in vivo. In contrast to cells stimulated with TPA, expression of an activated form of MEK did not lead to a significant increase in the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr69. However, TPA stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr69 was sensitive to inhibitors of MEK. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that the phosphorylation of Thr69 requires both the activation of Erk and an additional input provided by TPA, which may activate multiple downstream pathways. The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to TPA, constitutively active MEK or Erk is blocked by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR (Figs.1, 4, and 5). Interestingly, rapamycin also inhibited the basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr36/45 (Figs. 1, 4, and 5). It has previously been demonstrated that serum-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr36 or Thr45 is necessary for the subsequent phosphorylation at Ser64 and Thr69 (34.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B.

Lawrence Jr., J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3558-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that a Thr45 to Ala 4E-BP1 mutant does not undergo TPA-induced phosphorylation at Ser64 or Thr69 (Fig. 3). This indicates that the phosphorylation of Thr45 may be required for the subsequent phosphorylation of Ser64 and Thr69. It is likely that mTOR, or an mTOR-dependent kinase, phosphorylates 4E-BP1 at Thr36/45, as these sites are sensitive to rapamycin in vivo. Additionally, mTOR has been shown to phosphorylate these sites in vitro (12.Mothe-Satney I. Brunn G.J. McMahon L.P. Capaldo C.T. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol.

As Thr45 is required for the phosphorylation of Ser64 and Thr69 it would appear that phosphorylation by TPA may occur by a similar two-step mechanism as it has been proposed for serum-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (14.Gingras A.C.

However, Erk is unlikely to directly phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vivo as Erk cannot phosphorylate 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E (18.Lin T.-A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence J.C. J. Biol.

However, PKCδ or the conventional PKC isoforms probably do not play a role in MEK-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at the sites investigated, as BIM had a small effect on the MEK-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation induced by TPA or activated forms of MEK or Erk is likely to be through the activation of an as yet unidentified kinase or kinases that are regulated through MEK/Erk signaling. The regulation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4F via MEK/Erk signaling may be important for the control of translation by mitogenic signals which do not activate PI 3-kinase/PKB. eIF4E is a proto-oncogene (39.Lazaris-Karatzas A.

https://openalex.org/W2135036601,"Ganglioside GM3 inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent cell proliferation in a variety of cell lines. Both in vitro and in vivo, this glycosphingolipid inhibits the kinase activity of the EGF receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, membrane preparations containing EGFR can bind to GM3-coated surfaces. These data suggest that GM3 may interact directly with the EGFR. In this study, the interaction of gangliosides with the extracellular domain (ECD) of the EGFR was investigated. The purified human recombinant ECD from insect cells bound directly to ganglioside GM3. The ganglioside interaction site appears to be distinct from the EGF-binding site. In agreement with previous reports on the effects of specific gangliosides on EGFR kinase activity, the ECD preferentially interacted with GM3. The order of relative binding of other gangliosides investigated was as follows: GM3 ≫ GM2, GD3, GM4 > GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, GD2, GQ1b > lactosylceramide. These data suggest that NeuAc-lactose is essential for binding and that any sugar substitution reduces binding. In agreement with the specificity of soluble ECD binding to gangliosides, GM3 specifically inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation. Identification of a ganglioside interaction site on the ECD of the EGFR is consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous GM3 may function as a direct modulator of EGFR activity."

Prostate cancer is a slowly evolutive cancer which, in the first stages, is dependent on androgens. Treatments designed to kill the tumors, based on androgen depletion, become eventually ineffective, this being probably due to the selection of resistant cells. One hypothesis is that androgen-insensitive cells resistant to anti-androgen therapies would be neuroendocrine cells lacking the androgen receptor (1.Bonkhoff H. Prostate Suppl. 1998; 8: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).

This focal neuroendocrine differentiation is characterized by the presence of dispersed clusters of neuroendocrine cells in a neighboring of non-neuroendocrine dividing cells (1.Bonkhoff H.

Prostate Suppl. 1998; 8: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) but could be involved in prostate cancer relapse by secreting mitogenic autocrine/paracrine factors like bombesin, calcitonin, and parathyroid hormone-related peptides in their vicinity (3.di Sant'Agnese P.A. Cancer. 1992; 70: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This could in turn promote either the proliferation of adjacent epithelial cells or their differentiation toward a neuroendocrine phenotype (2.Abrahamsson P.A.

Calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels is reported to be involved in differentiation and neurite outgrowth in other cells (12.Garber S.S. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3976-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Solem M. McMahon T. Messing R.O. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5966-5975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sherwood N.T. Lesser S.S. Lo D.C.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been shown, for example, in the pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12 cells) that neuroendocrine differentiation is accompanied by an increased expression of voltage-dependent channels like low-voltage activated (LVA) (12.Garber S.S. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3976-3987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and high-voltage activated (HVA) calcium channels (14.Sherwood N.T. Lesser S.S. Lo D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

To our knowledge no functional voltage-dependent calcium channels have been clearly demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. We have investigated in this study the possible expression of voltage-gated calcium channels in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and their modulation during neuroendocrine differentiation induced by increasing cytosolic cAMP or by reducing steroids in the culture medium. We show that a small proportion of LNCaP cells displays an inward calcium current of weak amplitude and that this proportion and the calcium current density are increased during neuroendocrine differentiation. Biophysical and pharmacological properties of this calcium current show that it is carried by a LVA T-type calcium channel. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that only an α1H voltage-dependent calcium channel mRNA is expressed in LNCaP cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR reveals that α1H mRNA is overexpressed during neuroendocrine differentiation induced by various stimuli increasing cytosolic cAMP. Finally, our results suggest that although they are not involved in triggering neurite elongation, T-type calcium channels participate to a “window” calcium current active at resting membrane potential and may be implicated in facilitating the extension of neuritic processes. In addition, we propose that this voltage-dependent calcium channel could participate to the stimulation of mitogenic factors secretion by neuroendocrine prostate cells and could therefore be a target for future therapeutic strategies. LNCaP cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown as recommended in RPMI 1640 (Biowhittaker, Fontenay sous Bois, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Seromed, Poly-Labo, Strasbourg, France) and 5 mml-glutamine (Sigma, L'Isle d'Abeau, France). Cells were routinely grown in 50-ml flasks (Nunc, Poly-Labo) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C (95% air, 5% CO2). To study the role of steroids in the expression of voltage-dependent calcium channels, cells were grown in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (culture medium thereafter referred to as steroid-reduced medium). For electrophysiological studies, cells were subcultured in Petri dishes (Nunc) using trypsin. The culture medium was then changed every 3 days. Five days after trypsinization, the treatment was initiated and the culture medium containing the treatments (Bt2cAMP, IBMX) was changed every day. Cells were then tested within 8 days. Following treatments, LNCaP cells were lyzed in an ice-cold homogenizing buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The homogenates were cleared by a centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min and the protein content in the supernatants was determined using a Bradford assay. 50 μg of total proteins of each sample were analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer, the blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (15 mm Tris buffer (pH 8), 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) before the mouse anti-NSE monoclonal antibody (1/100, M0873 DAKO) was added in TBST-3% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, blots were incubated for 1 h with an horseradish peroxydase-linked secondary antibody (1/5000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and processed for chemiluminescent detection using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then exposed to X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Total RNA isolation from 5 million cells in culture was performed using the RNeasyTM Total RNA isolation System kit (Quiagen AG, Basel, Switzerland), as indicated in the manufacturer's instructions. Dry RNA pellets were dissolved in nuclease-free water and stored frozen at a concentration of 500 ng/μl. Conventional RT-PCR was performed using the “GeneAmpTM Gold RNA PCR Reagent Kit” from PE-Biosystems following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, first strand cDNA was generated by loading 300 ng of extracted RNA in the master mixture (50 μl) containing 500 nm specific primers for calcium channels (see Table I) and other reagents, as specified by the manufacturer. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) transcripts were reverse transcribed and analyzed in parallel to evaluate RNA integrity. Reverse transcription was achieved by incubation at 42 °C for 12 min. A 10-min denaturation step at 95 °C then preceded 32 PCR cycles according to the following protocol: denaturation at 94 °C (20 s), annealing/elongation at 62 °C (1 min), and a final elongation step at 72 °C (7 min). Amplified fragments were then resolved on a 2% agarose gel.Table ISequence of selected oligonucleotides used as RT-PCR primersTargetForwardReverseProduct sizebpα1G5′-GAGCCCGATTTCTTCTCACC5′-CGGTGACTTCATCTCGTGG256α1H5′-TCGAGGAGGACTTCCACAAG5′-TGCATCCAGGAATGGTGAG177α1I5′-AGGATGAGCTATGACCAGCG5′-CAGAGAGCAGGGACTCATGC151α1C5′-CAAGAGTTGGTGGAGAAGCC5′-TGAAGCTCAGAGAGTGGTCG236α1D5′-AGCCAACAGTGACAACAAGG5′-TTCAACTCCGAGATCCTTCG169α1S5′-GATGACGAGGAAGATGAGCC5′-AAGATGAAGAAGGAGCTGGC117α1F5′-GAGCAGACATGGAGGAGGAG5′-TGGCTGAGGCAGAAGAAGG154GAPDH5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC228 Open table in a new tab A one-step conventional RT-PCR protocol has been adapted for the LightCycler (Roche Molecular Diagnostics AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Individual glass capillaries were filled with a solution containing 18 μl of RT-PCR mixture and 2 μl of total RNA template (250 ng). The reaction mixture was composed of primer oligonucleotides (250 nm), Mn(OAc)2 (3.5 mm), and LightCycler RNA Master SYBR Green I, itself containing reaction buffer, dNTP, Tth DNA polymerase, and SYBR Green I dye at concentrations optimized by the manufacturer. The reverse transcription of the RNA template lasted 20 min at 61 °C and was followed by a 2-min denaturation of cDNA at 95 °C. The amplification of target cDNA was then performed for 45 cycles according to the following steps: denaturation, 95 °C (5 s); annealing, 54 °C (5 s); and elongation, 72 °C (8 s). The SYBR Green fluorescence was measured after each elongation step. At the end of the PCR, a melting curve analysis was performed by gradually increasing temperature from 60 to 95 °C (0.1 °C/s). Moreover, at the end of experiments, RT-PCR products were removed from capillaries and analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence and assess the purity of the amplicons of interest. After PCR was completed, the SYBR Green fluorescent signal was analyzed and converted into a relative number of copies of target molecules. For this purpose, the results of a series of standards prepared by successive dilutions and plotted against the logarithm of the concentration were used to estimate the relative amount of specific mRNA initially present in the various samples. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Bath medium used for calcium imaging or current-clamp experiments consisted in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 142 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose. For measuring calcium currents in patch-clamp experiments, the external buffer contained 142 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm TEA-Cl (tetra-ethyl ammonium chloride), and 10 mm CaCl2 or BaCl2. All the data shown in this study were obtained with a bath medium containing 10 mm BaCl2. The osmolarity and pH of external buffers were adjusted to 310 mOsm liter−1 and 7.4, respectively. For current-clamp experiments, the pipette solution contained 140 mm K-glutamate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES. For voltage-dependent calcium current studies, recording pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mmn-methylglucamine, 110 mml-glutamic acid, 30 mm HCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA. Osmolarity and pH were adjusted to 290 mOsm liter−1 and 7.2, respectively. Patch-clamp recordings were performed in the whole cell configuration (17.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar) using a RK-300 patch-clamp amplifier (Biologic, Grenoble, France). The patch-clamp amplifier was driven by Pulse 8.30 software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Membrane currents were digitized at 20 kHz using a ITC16 computer interface (Instrutech Corp., Long Island, NY, low-pass filtered at 3 kHz and stored on-line on the hard-drive of the computer. Electrodes were pulled on a PIP5 puller (HEKA, Germany) in two stages from borosilicate glass capillaries (PG52151, World Precision Instruments, Aston, UK) to a tip diameter giving a pipette resistance of 5 MΩ. For each cell, the membrane potential was clamped initially at −80 mV and the passive membrane components (membrane resistance and capacitance) were determined immediately after the establishment of the whole cell configuration. A protocol to assess the current/voltage (I/V) relationship was then initiated. For such experiments, a p/n protocol (8 negative prepulses a 1/10th of the pulse magnitude) was used to correct for the background leak and capacitive membrane currents. LNCaP cells were grown on glass coverslips to carry out calcium imaging experiments. Cytosolic calcium concentration was measured using Fura-2-loaded cells (18.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were loaded for 45 min at room temperature with 2 μm Fura-2/AM prepared in Hank's balanced salt solution and subsequently washed three times with the same dye-free solution. The coverslip was then transferred onto a perfusion chamber on a Olympus IX70 microscope equipped for fluorescence. Fluorescence was alternatively excited at 340 and 380 nm with a monochromator (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics GmBh, Planegg, Germany) and was captured after filtration through a long-pass filter (510 nm) by a MicroMax 5MHz CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Evry, France). Acquisition and analysis was performed with the Metafluor 4.5 software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). The intracellular calcium concentration was derived from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities for each of the excitation wavelengths (F340/F380) and from the equation of Grynkiewicz et al. (18.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All recordings were carried out at room temperature. The cells were continuously perfused with the Hank's balanced salt solution and chemicals were added via the perfusion system. The flow rate of the whole chamber perfusion system was set to 1 ml/min and the chamber volume was 500 μl. Pictures of cultured LNCaP cells were recorded with a MicroMax 5 MHz CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Evry, France). For each condition, at least 10 fields of cells were analyzed from two different batches of culture (total number of cells between 345 and 826). Images (1380 × 1030 pixels) were then analyzed and neurite processes were measured using an imaging software. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma except for Fura-2 which was bought from Calbiochem (France Biochem, Meudon, France). Plots were produced using Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis were performed using unpaired ttests or ANOVA tests followed by either Dunnett (for multiple control versus test comparisons) or Student-Newman-Keuls post-tests (for multiple comparisons). We first assessed by morphometric assays and Western blotting that culturing LNCaP cells for 3–5 days with cAMP permeant analogs (dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP), 1 mm) or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (isobutylmethylxanthine, IBMX, 100 μm) induced neuroendocrine differentiation. Treatment with Bt2cAMP or IBMX (Fig. 1, A–C) or 8-Br-cAMP (not shown) led to neurite extension. In addition, treatments with Bt2cAMP or IBMX enhanced the expression of a neuroendocrine marker, neuron-specific enolase (Fig. 1D). Morphological differentiation assessed by the presence of neurite extension was initiated as soon as 2 h after the onset of the treatment with Bt2cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, or IBMX. Voltage-dependent calcium currents were then investigated in non-treated (control) and treated LNCaP cells in conditions where voltage-dependent potassium channels were eliminated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2A represents a typical experiment performed on a control cell. No significant voltage-dependent inward current was observed on this control cell. On the opposite, a cell treated with Bt2cAMP for 3 days displayed an inward current activating at membrane potentials positive to −40 mV and peaking around −10 mV (Fig. 2B). The inward current reached its peak value 15 ms after the beginning of the voltage step to −10 mV and then exponentially decayed with a time constant of 20.3 ms (Fig. 2C). On average, the transient inward current activated and inactivated with exponential time constants of 11.6 ± 0.9 and 23.9 ± 1.5 ms, respectively. After normalization of the peak inward current to the membrane capacitance (indicative of the cell surface area) for each cell, we observed that after 3–5 days of treatment, the average current density was significantly increased in cells treated with Bt2cAMP at all membrane potentials between −40 and +20 mV (Fig. 2D, control cells: n = 96; 9 batches of cells, Bt2cAMP-treated cells: n = 119; 11 batches of cells). The maximum current density was −0.81 ± 0.07 pA/pF at −10 mV for Bt2cAMP-treated cells versus−0.35 ± 0.05 pA/pF for control cells, this corresponding to a 2.3-fold increase. The voltage-dependent transient current was only occasionally present in control cells (22 ± 6%), this proportion being enhanced (Fig. 2E) after treatment with Bt2cAMP (62 ± 8%). Fig. 2F shows that the distribution of the current amplitude (at −10 mV) in control cells follows a normal curve but that there is a multipeak distribution following treatment with Bt2cAMP during 3–5 days with the emergence of a cell population with larger current densities (19% of treated cells with a current density larger than 1.5 pA/pF versus 3% for control cells). The enhancement of this voltage-dependent transient inward current followed a slow kinetics. A 5-min application of Bt2cAMP (1 mm) did not induce or increase such a current on control LNCaP cells (Fig. 2G, n = 9). Whereas a 1-day Bt2cAMP treatment was ineffective, a 3-day treatment led to a significant and almost maximal increase in the transient current density (Fig. 2H). A 3-day treatment with another cAMP permeant analog, 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm), also raised the transient current density (−0.7 ± 0.08 pA/pF, n = 26, Fig. 2I). In addition, Bt2cAMP action was potentiated by about 35% (Fig. 2I) by inhibiting the degradation of cAMP using IBMX (transient current density after Bt2cAMP + IBMX (100 μm) = −1.09 ± 0.11 (n = 29)). We then investigated the ionic nature of this transient current observed in Bt2cAMP-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, changing the external Na-containing solution to a Na-deprived solution (sodium being replaced by choline) did not significantly affect, whereas eliminating external calcium (calcium free solution and 0.1 mm EGTA) completely abrogated the transient inward current (n = 8). This shows that the ion channel evidenced in our studies belongs to the family of voltage-gated calcium channels which can be further distinguished by their kinetics and voltage dependence of activation, inactivation and deactivation in LVA and HVA calcium channels (19.Randall A.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown above (Fig. 2), the inward current inactivated rapidly after the beginning of the depolarization. Since kinetics and voltage dependence may be indicative of the calcium channel nature, we have investigated its voltage-dependent inactivation (Fig. 3, C and D). This showed that the current during the test pulse followed a voltage-dependent inactivation. The inactivation began to occur for a membrane potential of −60 mV during the prepulse and was complete at −10 mV. Fig. 3D(inset) shows that the transient inward current was not completely abolished at −40 mV. To determine precisely the nature of the channel involved in the transient calcium current, we measured the deactivation kinetics of the calcium current. A characteristic feature of the T-type calcium channel is its slow deactivation: these channels deactivate with an exponential time constant of about 2 ms at −80 mV when compared with other voltage-dependent calcium channels (19.Randall A.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20.Matteson D.R. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) which deactivate more than 10 times faster. The kinetics of deactivation during the tail current measured after a test pulse (Fig. 3E) was fitted to a single exponential and a time constant τ was computed and plotted as a function of the membrane potential during repolarization (Fig. 3F). As illustrated by the Fig. 3F, the time constant τ varied with the repolarization potential and was comprised between 2 ± 0.16 and 10.8 ± 1 ms for −120 and −40 mV, respectively. The overall biophysical characteristics of the calcium current expressed in differentiated LNCaP cells suggest that this current belongs to the LVA-T type family of calcium currents. This was confirmed by an absence of action of HVA calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine (0.5 μm) for L-type, ω-conotoxine GVIA (50 nm) for N-type, ω-agatoxine (20 nm) for P/Q type calcium channels (not shown). We then assessed the sensitivities of the inward current to both nickel and cadmium since they vary according to the nature of the calcium channel, T-type calcium channels being more sensitive to nickel than to cadmium, on the contrary to HVA calcium channels (19.Randall A.D. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21.Lee J.H. Gomora J.C. Cribbs L.L. Perez-Reyes E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3034-3042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that NiCl2 dose dependently inhibited the transient calcium current with an IC50 of 2.4 ± 0.4 μm and a maximal inhibition of 90.8 ± 3.4%, whereas CdCl2 dose dependently abolished the calcium current with an IC50 of 58.8 ± 8.9 μm. We then used mibefradil (Ro 40-5967), the most selective antagonist to voltage-dependent T-type calcium channels (22.Rossier M.F. Ertel E.A. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 824-831PubMed Google Scholar, 23.McDonough S.I. Bean B.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 4, mibefradil (20 μm) induced a reversible and dose-dependent reduction of the transient calcium current at all membrane potentials. At −10 mV, mibefradil reduced the transient calcium current by 74 ± 4% (n = 8). The IC50 was found to be around 5 μm. Our experiments demonstrate that 5 μm flunarizin (a piperazine derivative previously shown to inhibit T-type calcium channels (24.Dzhura I. Kostyuk P. Lyubanova O. Naidenov V. Shuba Y. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1960-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) reversibly decreased by 62 ± 3% the transient calcium current (n = 3). The above results suggest that treatments with cAMP analogs increase the number of calcium channels in the plasma membrane. To study whether the T-type calcium current could be regulated in another way than an overexpression, we checked whether cAMP analogs induced a change in the characteristics of the T-type calcium current. Membrane currents obtained after a 3–5-day treatment with Bt2cAMP, or Bt2cAMP + IBMX, in addition to membrane currents recorded in control cells, were normalized to the maximum current. The treatments induced no shift in the voltage sensitivity of the calcium current as evidenced by the similarity of all the normalized I/V curves (Fig. 5A). A similar I/V curve was obtained for 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells (not shown). Activation and inactivation curves (Fig. 5, B and C) were computed for control cells (n = 5), Bt2cAMP (n = 6, not shown), and Bt2cAMP + IBMX-treated cells (n = 10). Data from each condition were fitted to a Boltzmann equation. These curves showed no significant differences in the mid-point of voltage dependence (V0.5) nor in the slope factor (k). In both untreated and treated cells, the V0.5were close to −17 mV and −39 mV and the slope factors were close to 7 mV and −7 mV, for activation and inactivation, respectively. In addition, the kinetics of time-dependent activation and i"

To understand the mechanism by which 5-LO is specifically targeted to the nuclear envelope, we studied the membrane binding properties of the amino-terminal domain of 5-LO, which has been proposed to have a C2 domain-like structure. The model building, electrostatic potential calculation, and in vitro membrane binding studies of the isolated C2-like domain of 5-LO and selected mutants show that this Ca2+-dependent domain selectively binds zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, which is conferred by tryptophan residues (Trp13, Trp75, and Trp102) located in the putative Ca2+-binding loops. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged C2-like domain of 5-LO and mutants in living cells also show that the phosphatidylcholine selectivity of the C2-like domain accounts for the specific targeting of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope. Together, these results show that the C2-like domain of 5-LO is a genuine Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting domain and that the subcellular localization of the domain is governed in large part by its membrane binding properties.

Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar). 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO)1 catalyzes the two-step transformation of arachidonic acid into leukotriene A4, which then leads to the synthesis of all leukotrienes (2.Ford-Hutchinson A.W.

Because of its critical role in controlling leukotriene production and the potential to block the production of all leukotrienes by specific inhibitors, 5-LO has been the subject of intense investigation. The cellular regulation of 5-LO activity is regulated by a complex mechanism involving calcium, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphorylation as well as gene transcription (2.Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 383-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 3.Peters-Golden M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: S227-S231Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of 5-LO in resting cells varies with the type of cell: it is present primarily in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, monocytes, and peritoneal macrophages, whereas it is predominantly located in the nuclei of rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and alveolar macrophages (4.Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, cell activation leads to the translocation of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope, where 5-LO-activating protein is located (4.Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 487: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), which is critically involved in the production of arachidonic acid, also translocates to the perinuclear region upon activation by calcium (5.Glover S. de Carvalho M.S.

C2 domains share a common fold consisting of an eight-strand antiparallel β-sandwich connected by variable loops, which at one end of the domain form the binding sites for multiple Ca2+ ions (7.Nalefski E.A.

A prototype C2 domain binds Ca2+ and mediates Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of proteins. A recent study using the detergent-solubilized inclusion body of the glutathione S-transferase-tagged 5-LO C2-like domain and its mutants indicated that the 5-LO C2-like domain binds calcium ions via several ligands located in the putative calcium-binding loops (6.Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Also, a cell study using the green fluorescence protein-tagged 5-LO C2-like domain showed that the 5-LO C2-like domain drives the translocation of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope (11.Chen X.-S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although these recent reports suggest that the 5-LO C2-like domain might function as a Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting domain, Ca2+-dependent membrane binding properties of the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain have not been demonstrated. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the 5-LO C2-like domain specifically targets 5-LO to the nuclear envelope is unknown. This study was undertaken to fully characterize the membrane binding properties of the 5-LO C2-like domain and to identify the structural determinants of its specific nuclear envelope targeting. The model building, electrostatic potential calculation, and in vitromembrane binding studies of the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain and selected mutants establish that the 5-LO C2-like domain is a genuine Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting domain with unique selectivity for zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is conferred by tryptophan residues located in the putative Ca2+-binding loops. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged 5-LO C2-like domain and mutants in living cells also indicate that the PC selectivity of the domain accounts for the specific targeting of 5-LO to the nuclear envelope. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and N-5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis. The Liposofast microextruder and 100-nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin, Inc. (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Bayer Inc. (Kankakee, IL). 35S-Labeled adenosine triphosphate and45CaCl2 were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Triton X-100 was from Pierce. Restriction endonucleases and enzymes for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), and Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from BIAcore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Ionomycin was from Calbiochem. ZeocinTM and pronasterone A were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The C2 domain of cPLA2 was prepared as described previously (12.Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, the cDNA of the 5-LO C2-like domain (residues 1–115) was cloned into the modified pET22d vector with an amino-terminal His6 tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the overlap extension PCR method. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the host for protein expression. One liter of Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 5 ml of overnight culture grown at 37 °C. Cells were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.6, and then protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). After overnight incubation at room temperature, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was treated with 10 cycles of 15 s of sonication, followed by 45 s of incubation on ice. After the suspension was sonicated, the inclusion body pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, recentrifuged, and resuspended with stirring (∼2 h) in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 murea at room temperature. The solubilized protein was purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed first against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2 m urea, followed by the same buffer containing 0.5 m urea and no urea, respectively, and finally against deionized water. The refolded protein was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The lyophilized protein was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for analysis. The protein concentration was measured using the enhanced BCA protocol (Pierce). The purity of all protein samples was >90% electrophoretically. Equilibrium dialysis was performed using a two-chamber Micro-Equilibrium Dialyzer (Harvard Bioscience, Holliston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 μl of 25 μm 5-LO C2-like domain (final concentration) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl in one chamber was equilibrated with 25 μl of the same buffer solution containing varying concentrations of 45Ca2+ in the other chamber. Dialysis was performed in the presence and absence of POPC vesicles (1 μm). Free ([Ca2+]free) and bound ([Ca2+]bound) calcium concentrations were determined by scintillation counting of individual chambers, and the binding isotherms were analyzed by a nonlinear least-squares fit using a Langmuir-type equation, [Ca2+]bound/[5-LO C2] = n/(1 +KCa/[Ca2+]free), assuming the presence of n non-interacting calcium-binding sites with apparent dissociation constant KCa. Preparation of the vesicle-coated Pioneer L1 sensor chip has been described in detail elsewhere (13.Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sensor surface was coated with POPC, POPC/POPG (1:1), or POPC/POPS (1:1) vesicles. In control experiments, the fluorescence intensity of the flow buffer after rinsing the sensor chip coated with vesicles incorporating 10 mm5-carboxyfluorescein (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was monitored to confirm that the vesicles remained intact on the chip. All experiments were performed with the uncoated sensor chip in the control cell because the 5-LO C2-like domain showed negligible binding to the sensor chip. The drift in signal for both sample and control flow cells was allowed to stabilize below 0.3 resonance unit/min before any kinetic experiments were performed. All kinetic experiments were performed at 24 °C and at a flow rate of 60 μl/min in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 m NaCl and varying concentrations of Ca2+. A high flow rate was used to circumvent mass transport effects. Association was monitored for 90 s, and dissociation for 4 min. The immobilized vesicle surface was then regenerated for subsequent measurements using 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH. The regeneration solution was passed over the immobilized vesicle surface until the SPR signal reached the initial background value before protein injection. For data acquisition, five or more different concentrations (typically within a 10-fold range above or below the Kd) of each protein were used. After each set of measurements, the entire immobilized vesicles were removed by injection of 25 μl of 40 mm CHAPS, followed by 25 μl of octyl glucoside at 5 μl/min, and the sensor chip was re-coated with a fresh vesicle solution for the next set of measurements. All data were evaluated using BIAevaluation Version 3.0 software (BIAcore). For each trial, the signal was corrected against the control surface response to eliminate any refractive index changes due to buffer change. Furthermore, the derivative plot was used to monitor potential mass transport effects. Once these factors were checked for each set of data, the association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: [protein·vesicle] ↔ protein + vesicle. The association phase was analyzed using the following equation: R = (kaC/(kaC +kd))Rmax(1 −e−(kaC+kd))(t−t0)) + RI, where RI is the refractive index change,Rmax is the theoretical binding capacity,C is analyte concentration, ka is the association rate constant, and t0 is the initial time. The dissociation phase was analyzed using the equation R =R0e−kd(t−t0), where kd is the dissociation rate constant and R0 is the initial response. The curve fitting efficiency was checked by residual plots and χ2. The dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated from the equation Kd =kd/ka. The surface pressure (π) of solution in a circular Teflon trough (4 cm diameter × 1 cm deep) was measured using a Wilhelmy plate attached to a computer-controlled Cahn electrobalance (Model C-32) as described previously (14.Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,15.Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Five to ten microliters of phospholipid solution in ethanol/hexane (1:9 (v/v)) or chloroform was spread onto 10 ml of the subphase (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 m KCl and 0.1 mm Ca2+) to form a monolayer with a given initial surface pressure (π0). The subphase was continuously stirred at 60 rpm with a magnetic stir bar. Once the surface pressure reading of the monolayer had been stabilized (after ∼5 min), the protein solution (typically 30 μl) was injected into the subphase, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was measured as a function of time. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 35 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value when [5-LO C2-like domain] ≥ 1 μg/ml. Protein concentrations in the subphase were therefore maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The Δπ versusπ0 plots were constructed from these measurements. A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments. Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells were passaged into eight wells of a Lab-TechTM chambered cover glass for later transfection and visualization. Only cells between passages 5 and 20 were used. EGFP in the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH) was modified by PCR to remove the first methionine and to add two amino-terminal glycines and an EcoRI site. The modified EGFP gene was inserted into a modified pIND vector (Invitrogen) between the EcoRI and XhoI sites to yield plasmid pIND/EGFP. The 5-LO C2-like domain was cloned by PCR to remove the stop codon and to add two carboxyl-terminal glycines and an EcoRI site. The PCR product was digested with NotI and EcoRI and ligated into pIND/EGFP to generate a carboxyl-terminal EGFP-fused 5-LO C2-like domain with spacer sequence GGNSGG. Cells (80–90% confluent) in Lab-TechTM chambered cover glass wells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) for 7–8 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and overlaid with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ZeocinTM and 140 μg/ml pronasterone A to induce protein production. Cell imaging was performed using a four-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. To trigger the membrane translocation of EGFP-tagged 5-LO C2-like domains, the cell medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 150 μl of 2 mm EGTA and overlaid with 300 μl of HEK buffer (1 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.67 mmd-glucose, and 6.4 mm sucrose) containing 10 μm ionomycin and 2 mmCaCl2. Control experiments were done with dimethyl sulfoxide in place of ionomycin. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. All experiments were carried out at the same laser power, which was found to induce minimal photobleaching over 30 scans, and at the same gain and offset settings on the photomultiplier tube. A line-pass 505-nm filter was used for all experiments. A 63× 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Cells for imaging were selected based on their initial intensity, which needed to fall in the upper third of the photomultiplier tube's range. The LSM 510 imaging software provides an option for time series imaging and was used to control the time intervals for imaging. Using a variety of search methods against the Protein Data Bank (16.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27935) Google Scholar), including protein threading (123D+), Smith-Waterman sequence alignment, and sequence-to-profile alignment (3D-PSSM) (17.Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as high significance sequence and structural matches for the 5-LO C2-like domain. Homology models for the 5-LO C2-like domain were constructed with the program Modeler (21.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar), and the model based on the α-toxin (code 1qmd) as structural template was used in the subsequent electrostatic potential calculations. In the modeling alignment, the 5-LO and α-toxin C2-like domain sequences shared 27% sequence identity and 53% sequence similarity as judged by favorable substitutions in the BLOSUM62 matrix (22.Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). The structural template and homology model were evaluated using the program Verify 3D (23.Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), which scores structures according to how well each residue fits into its structural environment based on criteria derived from statistical analyses of the Protein Data Bank. The homology model produced Verify 3D scores that were good relative to the structural template, an indication that the model is reliable for the type of qualitative analysis performed here. A model constructed using 15-lipoxygenase (code 1lox) as a template gave similar results. The calcium ions were modeled into the homology model using structure superposition of the model and the α-toxin C2-like domain structure with three calcium ions bound (code 1qmd). The electrostatic properties of the 5-LO C2-like domain homology model were calculated and visualized in the program GRASP (24.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). In Fig. 7 (A and B), the red and blue meshes represent the −25 and +25 mV electrostatic equipotential contours, respectively, in 0.1 m KCl. Among various C2 and C2-like domains with known tertiary structures, we found two good potential structural templates for the 5-LO C2-like domain: 15-lipoxygenase (Protein Data Bank code 1lox) (18.Gillmor S.A.

Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The second template is especially appealing because this domain binds three calcium ions, and a sequence alignment between the C2-like domains of code 1qmd and 5-LO shows that 5-LO has most of the calcium-ligating residues conserved. The best alignment, as judged by sequence similarity, was achieved by making a ClustalW (25.Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 8: 189-191Google Scholar) multiple alignment of all three C2-like domains and then extracting the pairwise alignment for the C2-like domain of C. perfringens α-toxin and the 5-LO C2-like domain (Fig. 1). Fig. 2shows the homology model for the 5-LO C2-like domain using the C2-like domain of C. perfringens α-toxin as a structural template. Although this model structure has three potential calcium-binding sites, two calcium ions are included in the model because one site should have greatly decreased calcium affinity due to the presence of a Lys residue in place of Asn294 in the C2-like domain of C. perfringens α-toxin (see Fig. 1). This notion is consistent with the finding that 5-LO binds two Ca2+ ions (26.Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The results of the electrostatic calculations (see below) are independent of which two sites are assumed to be occupied.Figure 2Homology model of the 5-LO C2-like domain. The homology modeling for the 5-LO C2-like domain was performed using an α-toxin from C. perfringens(Protein Data Bank code 1qmd) as a structural template. The model is shown as a ribbon diagram, with the three mutated Trp residues and other putative membrane-binding residues shown as green and red stick models, respectively. Magentaspace-filling models illustrate calcium ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been reported that 5-LO independently binds two Ca2+ions with an apparent dissociation constant of ∼6 μmboth in the presence and absence of PC (26.Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the calcium binding of the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain has been only qualitatively estimated using a detergent-solubilized inclusion body of the glutathione S-transferase-tagged 5-LO C2-like domain (6.Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the calcium affinity of the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain by equilibrium dialysis. The His6-tagged 5-LO C2-like domain was expressed in E. coli as an inclusion body, which was solubilized, refolded, and purified to homogeneity. As shown in Fig. 3, the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain bound about two Ca2+ ions both in the presence and absence of POPC vesicles under our experimental conditions. Although it has been shown that calcium ions bind to some C2 domains in a cooperative manner (27.Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28.Nalefski E.A. Wisner M.A. Chen J.Z. Sprang S.R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the calcium binding curves shown in Fig. 3 were nicely fit to a Langmuir-type equation to yield KCa values (7–9 μm) that are comparable to that of full-length 5-LO (26.Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This confirms that the calcium sensitivity of 5-LO originates from the 5-LO C2-like domain. To establish that the 5-LO C2-like domain is a genuine calcium-dependent membrane-targeting domain, we measured the membrane binding properties of the isolated 5-LO C2-like domain by SPR analysis. SPR analysis allows direct determination of membrane association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants for peripheral proteins (13.Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,15.Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We first measured the binding of the 5-LO C2-like domain to immobilized vesicles with different compositions at 0.1 mmCa2+. As shown in Table I, the 5-LO C2-like domain had higher affinity (in terms of Kd) for zwitterionic PC vesicles than for anionic PS and phosphatidylglycerol vesicles. In this regard, the 5-LO C2-like domain is similar to the cPLA2 C2 domain, which also has unique PC selectivity (10.Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29.Nalefski E.A. McDonagh T. Somers W. Seehra J. Falke J.J. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1365-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the previous finding that 5-LO binds PC vesicles and shows higher activity in the presence of PC vesicles than in the presence of anionic vesicles (30.Noguchi M. Miyano M. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We then measured the binding of the 5-LO C2-like domain to immobilized PC vesicles as a function of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+ (i.e. 0.1 mm EGTA), no appreciable binding was detected with protein concentration up to 1 μm, indicating that the 5-LO C2-like domain has greater than μm affinity for POPC under this condition. The increase in calcium concentration from 1 μm to 0.1 mm resulted in a 500-fold increase in affinity (Kd), demonstrating its Ca2+-dependent membrane binding property. As summarized in Table I, the rise in Ca2+ increased ka (∼34-fold) and decreased kd(∼16-fold) to a comparable degree.Table IMembrane binding parameters of the 5-LO C2-like domain and mutants5-LO C2-like domainLipid[Ca2+]kakdKdmmm−1s−1s−1mWild-typePC0.001(5.0 ± 0.7) × 103(1.3 ± 0.2) × 10−2(2.5 ± 0.4) × 10−6Wild-typePC0."

Recently available data suggest, however, that tyrosine kinases can regulate the ability of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to stimulate Rho, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we found that the activation of thrombin receptors endogenously expressed in HEK-293T cells leads to a remarkable increase in the levels of GTP-bound Rho within 1 min (11-fold) and a more limited but sustained activation (4-fold) thereafter, which lasts even for several hours. Interestingly, tyrosine kinase inhibitors did not affect the early phase of Rho activation, immediately after thrombin addition, but diminished the levels of GTP-bound Rho during the delayed phase. As thrombin receptors stimulate focal adhesion kinase (FAK) potently, we explored whether this non-receptor tyrosine kinase participates in the activation of Rho by GPCRs. We obtained evidence that FAK can be activated by thrombin, Gα12, Gα13, and Gαq through both Rho-dependent and Rho-independent mechanisms and that PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG can in turn be tyrosine-phosphorylated through FAK in response to thrombin, thereby enhancing the activation of Rho in vivo. These data indicate that FAK may act as a component of a positive feedback loop that results in the sustained activation of Rho by GPCRs, thus providing evidence of the existence of a novel biochemical route by which tyrosine kinases may regulate the activity of Rho through the tyrosine phosphorylation of RGL-containing RhoGEFs.

The Rho family of GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, comprises a large branch within the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins. Among them, Rho plays an important role in controlling the organization and dynamic remodeling of the actin-based cytoskeleton as well as in gene expression regulation. For example, when microinjected into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, activated Rho rapidly induces the formation of actin stress fibers and focal contacts (1.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar), and activated alleles of Rho induce expression from the serum response element (SRE) 1The abbreviations used are: SREserum response elementRGSregulators of G protein signalingRGLRGS-likeGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGAPGTPase-activating proteinDHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyGPCRG protein-coupled receptorLPAlysophosphatidic acidPYK2proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2FAKfocal adhesion kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseRBDRho-binding domainHEK-293Thuman embryonic kidney 293T cellFRNKFAK-related non-tyrosine kinase 1The abbreviations used are: SREserum response elementRGSregulators of G protein signalingRGLRGS-likeGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorGAPGTPase-activating proteinDHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyGPCRG protein-coupled receptorLPAlysophosphatidic acidPYK2proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2FAKfocal adhesion kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseRBDRho-binding domainHEK-293Thuman embryonic kidney 293T cellFRNKFAK-related non-tyrosine kinase through the activation of the serum response factor (2.Hill C.S.

Furthermore, the involvement of Rho proteins in intracellular membrane trafficking such as phagocytosis, endocytosis, and secretory vesicle transport has been also reported (3.Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). serum response element regulators of G protein signaling RGS-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein Dbl homology pleckstrin homology G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 focal adhesion kinase green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glutathione S-transferase Rho-binding domain human embryonic kidney 293T cell FAK-related non-tyrosine kinase serum response element regulators of G protein signaling RGS-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein Dbl homology pleckstrin homology G protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidic acid proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 focal adhesion kinase green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase glutathione S-transferase Rho-binding domain human embryonic kidney 293T cell FAK-related non-tyrosine kinase The functional activity of Rho, like other small G proteins, is tightly regulated in vivo by proteins that control its GDP/GTP bound state. Whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) promote the exchange of GDP for GTP bound to Rho and activate its function, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) increase the low intrinsic rate of GTP-hydrolysis of this small GTPase, thereby negatively regulating its function (4.Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). GEFs for Rho family G proteins, such as Dbl, Ost, Lfc, Lbc, Vav, Ect2, Tim, and Net, have been identified because of their ability to transform murine fibroblasts in standard focus-formation assays. These proteins share a common structural motif consisting of a 250-amino acid stretch of sequence similarity with Dbl, known as the DH domain, adjacent to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (5.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 6.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The DH domain is responsible for nucleotide exchange activity toward GTPases of the Rho family (7.Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 8.Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this sequence similarity, the GEF families for Rho-related GTPases are often referred to as members of the Dbl superfamily (6.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is interesting that it has been known for quite some time that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as those for LPA, can stimulate Rho-dependent pathways (1.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 9.Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), but the nature of the heterotrimeric G proteins mediating this effect remained elusive. In this regard two lines of research suggest that the Gα12family of heterotrimeric G proteins controls Rho function and leads to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell growth. For example, Buhl et al. (10.Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) demonstrated that activated Gα12 and Gα13, but not Gαi2 and Gαq or different combinations of β-and γ-subunits, mimicked the effect of activated RhoA on stress fibers and focal adhesion assembly; and Fromm et al. (11.Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) provided evidence that heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gα12/13 family can promote the transcriptional activation of the serum response factor and cellular transformation through Rho. How Gα12 and Gα13 can, in turn, regulate Rho was not known. Recently available evidence indicates that a novel family of DH domain-containing proteins that includes p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG transduces signals from Gα12/13 proteins to Rho (12.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 13.Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These three GEFs contain an area of limited similarity to a conserved region of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) in their NH2 termini. RGS proteins function as GAPs for Gα proteins and enhance the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Indeed, the RGS-like (RGL) domain of p115RhoGEF can accelerate (by 5–10-fold) the GTPase activity of Gα12/13 (15.Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In addition to this regulatory activity, the RGL domain of these RhoGEFs provides a structural motif by which Gα12 proteins can form molecular complexes with these RhoGEFs, thereby enhancing their activity (12.Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 16.Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, this newly discovered family of RGL domain-containing RhoGEFs, p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG, may provide a direct functional link from Gα12, Gα13, and their coupled cell surface receptors to Rho (17.Fukuhara S. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1661-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the available information suggests that an additional mechanism may exist for regulating the ability of Gα12proteins to stimulate the Rho signaling pathway. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that tyrosine kinases may regulate this pathway. For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to prevent Gα13-induced neurite retraction and cell rounding in PC12 cells (18.Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as well as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly induced by LPA and by Gα13 in murine fibroblasts (19.Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Even more directly, Kranenburg et al. (20.Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) reported that Rho activation by LPA was blocked by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Moreover, a recent study reported that the active form of Gα13 enhances the enzymatic activity of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) and that this non-receptor tyrosine kinase may be involved in the Rho-dependent activation of SRE induced by Gα12/13 (21.Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it can be hypothesized that tyrosine kinase may play an important regulatory role in the biochemical route linking GPCR to Rho. However, the precise mechanism by which tyrosine kinases regulate Rho activation or its downstream effectors is still unknown. Thrombin, which stimulates proteinase-activated G protein-coupled receptors (22.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar), can provoke the rapid activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src family kinases (23.Ferrell Jr., J.E. Martin G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3603-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24.Golden A. Brugge J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and regulates Rho through Gα12/13 (25.Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In this study, we took advantage of these observations and a recently developed pull-down method to measure Rho activation (26.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) to explore the mechanism by which tyrosine kinases regulate the coupling of GPCRs to Rho. We present evidence that two RGL domain-containing RhoGEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, can be phosphorylated in tyrosine residues by FAK in response to thrombin, and that FAK may be a component of a novel biochemical route regulating Rho activation by GPCRs.

Briefly, HEK-293T cells plated in a 6- or 24-well plate were transfected with the indicated plasmids together with 100 or 60 ng of pcDNA3-β-galactosidase, a plasmid expressing the enzyme β-galactosidase, and 100 or 60 ng of pSREmutL, the reporter plasmid expressing a CAT gene under the control of the mutant SRE lacking a ternary complex factor binding site, respectively. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were then stimulated with the indicated ligands for an additional 6 h and lysed using reporter lysis buffer (Promega). CAT activity was assayed in the cell extracts by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (100 mCi/mmol, ICN) and 200 μg/ml butyryl-CoA (Sigma) in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Labeled butyrylated products were extracted using a mixture of xylenes and 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl-pentadecane (ratio 1:2), and radioactivity was counted. β-Galactosidase activity present in each sample was assayed by a colorimetric method and was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For co-immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the specific antibody against AU1 or FAK as indicated. Immunocomplexes were recovered with the aid of Gamma-bind Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Lysates containing ∼50 mg of total cellular protein or immunoprecipitates with the indicated antibodies were analyzed by Western blotting after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) using goat anti-mouse (Cappel), goat anti-rabbit (Cappel), or donkey anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody. Antibodies against FAK (C20), PYK2 (N19), and RhoA (26C4) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Monoclonal antibody against AU-1 epitope was purchased from BABCO. In vivoRho activity was assessed by a modified method described elsewhere (26.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were lysed at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated with GST fusion protein including the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads followed by four washes with lysis buffer. GTP-bound forms of Rho associated with GST-rhotekin-RBD were released from beads by an addition of protein loading buffer and quantified by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (26C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To begin exploring the nature of pathway linking GPCRs to Rho, we first asked whether thrombin was able to stimulate Rho activity using a recently developed in vivo Rho guanine nucleotide exchange assay (26.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar) that reveals the levels of GTP-bound form of endogenous Rho directly. For these in vivo Rho activation assays, HEK-293T cells were stimulated by thrombin, and lysates from stimulated cells were incubated with GST fusion protein including the RBD of rhotekin previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The levels of the GTP-bound form of Rho associated with GST-rhotekin-RBD were quantified by Western blot analysis using an anti-Rho antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, a detailed time course analysis of Rho stimulation by thrombin in HEK-293T cells revealed the rapid and potent activation of Rho by thrombin, which was demonstrable as early as 1 min after agonist addition, and was attenuated within 10 min but remained above basal levels for several hours (not shown). To explore the correlation between Rho activation by thrombin and tyrosine phosphorylation, we studied whether this activation was impaired by pretreatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. For these experiments, we used both genistein and tyrphostins. Genistein is a soy-derived isoflavone known to bind to the ATP binding site of tyrosine kinases and inhibit the activity of these ATP-utilizing enzymes with high specificity (34.Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Tyrphostins are a series of compounds known to bind to the substrate-binding site of tyrosine kinases and have distinct inhibitory activities in various tyrosine kinase systems (35.Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Initially, we found that genistein had no effect on activation of Rho after 1 min stimulation by thrombin (Fig. 1B) but clearly diminished the levels of active Rho after 10 min of thrombin stimulation (Fig. 1C). Next, we tested the effect of tyrphostin A25, a broad tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been reported to block Gα13-induced neurite retraction in PC12 cells (18.Katoh H. Aoki J. Yamaguchi Y. Kitano Y. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28700-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and stress fiber formation stimulated by LPA in Swiss 3T3 cells (36.Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that tyrphostin A25 had no effect on activation of Rho after 1 min of stimulation by thrombin but clearly diminished the activated Rho after 10 min of thrombin stimulation (Fig. 1D). In contrast, tyrphostin A1, an inactive, related compound that can serve as a negative control for tyrphostins, had no effect on the activation of Rho by thrombin at both early and late time points (Fig. 1E). These data suggested that tyrosine kinases contribute to Rho activation by thrombin not during the early phase immediately after thrombin addition but during the more sustained and prolonged delayed phase. As the thrombin receptor PAR-1 (proteinase-activated G protein-coupled receptor-1) is reported to couple to the Gαq, Gα12/13, and Gαi families of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits (25.Offermanns S.

Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we next investigated the contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation to the ability of Gα12/13 to stimulate Rho. Indeed, expression of activated Gα12 and Gα13 potently elevated the steady state level of endogenous GTP-bound Rho (Fig. 2A and data not shown), and treatment with genistein diminished the Rho activity induced by the activated form of Gα13 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In contrast, we did not detect any effect of genistein on Rho activation when induced by the DH/PH domain of PDZ-RhoGEF, which served as a control (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggested a regulatory role for tyrosine kinases in the pathway linking GPCRs and Gα12/13 to Rho. Because these data suggested that tyrosine kinases are involved in the activation of Rho by thrombin in HEK-293T cells, we next explored which tyrosine kinase was involved in this pathway. As the tyrosine kinase PYK2 was reported to participate in SRE activation by Gα13 in HeLa cells (21.Shi C.S. Sinnarajah S. Cho H. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24470-24476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we viewed PYK2 and its closely related tyrosine kinase, FAK, as good candidates to mediate this response. Initially, we examined the expression of FAK and PYK2 in HEK-293T cells. FAK was endogenously expressed in HEK-293T cells, but PYK2 was not detectable in these cells, although transfected PYK2 was readily demonstrable when used as a control (Fig. 3A). Based on these results, we asked whether thrombin could stimulate FAK activity in these cells. For these experiments, endogenous FAK was immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody, and phosphorylated FAK was detected by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. When stimulated with thrombin, tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was evident as early as 5 min after addition of thrombin and peaked at ∼10 min after stimulation (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that in HEK-293T cells endogenous FAK is activated in response to thrombin and that FAK may represent a good candidate for regulation of the molecular pathways initiated by thrombin receptors. We next investigated which G protei"

The importance of the NADPH oxidase in host defense is exemplified by the inherited disorder chronic granulomatous disease in which patients suffer from recurring infections due to a defect in oxidase activity. The NADPH oxidase consists of six subunits. Four of these, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox,1 and the small GTPase Rac are cytosolic in unstimulated cells, whereas p22phox and gp91phox form a heterodimeric, membrane-bound flavocytochrome, also known as cytochromeb 558. In resting cells, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox exist as a tight cytosolic complex of undefined stoichiometry that can be purified by gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular mass of 250–300 kDa (5Park J.W.

These events culminate in translocation of this complex to the membrane and association with both Rac-GTP and cytochromeb 558 to form the active enzyme. p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox are multidomain proteins that contain SH3 protein-protein interaction domains (see Fig.1). Additionally, p40phox and p47phox each contain a PX domain, which has recently been shown to bind to phosphatidylinositols and seems to act as a membrane-targeting module (15Ellson C.D.

Most PX domains identified so far also contain a Pro-X-X-Pro motif, which is the consensus target sequence for SH3 domain binding modules (19Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This suggests that PX domains are bifunctional with the potential to coordinate membrane localization as well as protein assembly during signal transduction events. In support of this idea, it has been shown that the isolated PX domain of p47phox binds to the second SH3 domain of p47phox with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) of ∼50 μm (20Hiroaki H. Ago T. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). p47phox plays a central role in the activation process due to its ability to bind to the cytoplasmic region of p22phox, an interaction that is necessary for oxidase activity (21de Mendez I.

Studies by various groups suggest that p47phox exists in an autoinhibited conformation in the resting state. In this model, the tandem SH3 domains are masked due to an intramolecular interaction with a C-terminal segment whereas the PXXP motif present in the PX domain simultaneously interacts with the second SH3 domain (24Sumimoto H.

Extensive efforts have been made to identify domains involved in the multiple protein-protein interactions and conformational changes that take place during NADPH oxidase activation.

In particular the C-terminal proline-rich region in p47phox has been variously suggested to bind to SH3 domains present in p67phox and p40phox, as well as to the tandem SH3 domains present within p47phox itself (21de Mendez I.

Furthermore, there are conflicting reports concerning the architecture of the p40-p47-p67phox complex in resting cells. In one scenario, p40phox acts as an adaptor that holds p47phox and p67phox together whereas an alternative model assumes that p67phox acts as a bridging molecule between p40phox and p47phox (1Babior B.M.

A likely explanation for the detection of multiple binding partners for a particular region is that many previous studies have made use of isolated domains. It is possible that such an approach may exclude additional regions that contribute to specificity and/or affinity. In addition, many of the techniques used do not allow a precise quantitative assessment of the affinity of any particular interaction. For these reasons, the relative significance of one interaction with respect to another becomes difficult to assess. Nevertheless, it is possible that all interactions detected so far do take place at various stages of the activation process but occur in a sequential not a simultaneous manner. Here we describe the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic characterization of protein-protein complexes of the cytosolic components of the NADPH oxidase. Using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration chromatography we demonstrate that p40phox, p47phox, and p67phoxform a trimeric protein complex with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. Furthermore, we show unequivocally that p67phox is the adaptor that links p40phox and p47phox in the resting complex, providing a solid framework upon which the activation process can be further investigated. The DNA sequences encoding full-length p67phox (1–526), p67phox (234–526), and p67phox (450–526) “p67-SH3B ” were cloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and fusion proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 4 mm benzamidine, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The GST-tag was removed using human thrombin (Calbiochem). Further purification was carried out on a Source Q anion-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were eluted with a 50 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to around 20 mg/ml. DNA sequences encoding full-length p47phox (1–390), p47phox (1–295), p47phox (1–354), and p47phox(155–390) were cloned into pGEX-6P1, and fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and the GST-tag was removed by incubation with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Further purification was carried out on a Source S column equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol, and proteins were eluted with a 50 mm to 500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to around 50 mg/ml. p40phox cloned into pET-23d (Novagen) was a kind gift of Frans Wientjes, University College, London. The protein was overexpressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) and purified on Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm imidazole. p40phox was eluted with a 20 mm to 1 m imidazole gradient. Fractions containing pure protein were pooled, dialyzed against 2 liters of 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT, and concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼10 mg/ml. All sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry of the purified proteins. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using calculated absorption coefficients. Complexes of p67-p40phox, p67-p47phox, and p67-p47-p40phox were obtained by mixing the proteins in 1:1 stoichiometries and purification by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT for p47-p67phox and p40-p47-p67phoxand pH 8.0 for p40-p67phox. Fractions containing the complexes were concentrated by ultrafiltration to ∼10 mg/ml. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a DynaPro-801 dynamic light-scattering instrument (Protein Solution). Samples were filtered through 0.02-μm filters, and experiments were performed at sample concentrations of 0.5 to 2 mg/ml in the same buffer used for analytical ultracentrifugation measurements. Data were analyzed by autocorrelation, and the resulting autocorrelation function was then evaluated using single-exponential cumulant analysis. From this the translational diffusion coefficient was determined, which can subsequently be used to derive the hydrodynamic radius and thereby the molecular weight using an empirically derived relationship between the radius and molecular weights for globular proteins. All calculations were carried out using the software package supplied with the machine. The protein partial-specific volume, solvent density, and viscosity were calculated using the SEDNTERP program (John Philo). Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies were carried out using a Beckman Optima XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Prior to centrifugation protein samples were dialyzed exhaustively against a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol adjusted to the pH used for purification. Equilibrium experiments were carried out on 110-μl samples in an An-60ti rotor using six-channel centerpieces with protein absorbances of 0.8 OD, 0.5 OD, and 0.3 OD at λ = 280 nm and three different rotor speeds (p67phox at 12,000, 15,000, and 18,000 rpm; p40phox and p47phox at 10,000, 13,000, and 18,000 rpm; p40-p47phox, p40-p67phox, and p47-p67phox at 7000, 8500, and 12,500 rpm; p40-p47-p67phox at 6000, 8000, and 11,000 rpm). Radial scans of the absorbance at 280 nm (path length 1.2 cm) were measured at 0.001-cm intervals, at 15 °C and 20-fold averaged. Scans indicating that equilibrium had been reached were used for analysis (typically around 20 h). Multiple data sets were analyzed by non-linear least-squares procedures provided in the Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-1 data analysis software, version 4.1. Sedimentation velocity studies were carried out at protein concentrations between 0.2 and 1 mg/ml and sedimentation boundaries were monitored at λ = 280 nm. The data were analyzed using the program SVEDBERG, which directly fits sedimentation velocity profiles to give the sedimentation (s) and diffusion coefficient (D) (48Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Values obtained in this way were then extrapolated to zero concentration and corrected to standard conditions to yields 20,w andD 20,w. Hydrodynamic shape parameters, including frictional (f/f 0) and axial ratios (a/b) were calculated with the program SEDNTERP using the v-bar method. Isothermal calorimetric titrations were performed with a Microcal omega VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). All proteins were dialyzed against ITC buffer (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm DTT; at the same pH used for purification), and experiments were performed at 15 °C. Typically solutions of 10–20 μm of proteins or complexes in the cell were titrated by injection of a total of 290 μl of 100–200 μm of ligands (49Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2437) Google Scholar). Heats of dilution of ligand into buffer were determined in control experiments and subtracted from the raw data of the binding experiment prior to data analysis. Data were fitted by least-squares procedures using the evaluation software, Microcal Origin version 5.0 provided by the manufacturer. The data were averaged over two to five ITC experiments. Titrations that followed a two-site binding isotherm were additionally carried out in the presence of 2 mmtris-(2-carboxyl)phosphine to ensure that the second binding site detected was not an artifact caused by the use of DTT. Analytical gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The proteins used in this study have been overexpressed inE. coli in a soluble form. They are monodisperse, as judged by dynamic light scattering, and can be highly concentrated apart from p40phox, which shows a tendency to aggregate at higher concentrations. Similar constructs have been shown in previous studies to retain their biological activity as judged by cell-free NADPH oxidase reconstitution assays, indicating that the proteins are correctly folded upon expression in E. coli (9Shiose A.

Prior to studying complex formation between the cytosolicphox components, we investigated potential self-association of the individual proteins in sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Analysis of these data can be used to derive the true molecular weight, without making any assumptions about the form and shape of the molecule(s) under investigation. Nine data sets at three different speeds and three concentrations were collected for each protein. Global fitting of these data sets to a single species resulted in a random distribution of residuals indicating that all three proteins exist as monomers in solution (Fig.2 A). The molecular masses determined for p40phox, p47phox, and p67phoxare 41,036, 43,892, and 61,621 Da, respectively, in good agreement with the formula molecular masses and those determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (39,966, 44,963, and 60,015 Da) (TableI). p67phox has previously been described as forming dimers based on gel filtration chromatography and small angle neutron scattering studies (45Grizot S. Grandvaux N. Fieschi F. Faure J. Massenet C. Andrieu J.P. Fuchs A. Vignais P.V. Timmins P.A. Dagher M.C. Pebay-Peyroula E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To investigate if this discrepancy with our data might be due to a non-globular shape of the protein, we carried out sedimentation velocity studies to derive an estimate for the asymmetry of p67phox (TableII). The velocity data yielded a sedimentation coefficient (s 20,w = 3.2 × 10−13 s) and diffusion coefficient (D 20,w = 4.7 × 10−7cm2 s−1), which are lower than would be expected for a globular protein of 60 kDa (Table II). The frictional ratio (f/f 0), which is an indication of the asymmetry of a protein, can be calculated from these data and has been found to be near 1.2 for globular proteins. The value calculated for p67phox, however, is fairly high (f/f 0 = 1.65), indicating that the shape of p67phox significantly deviates from that of a globular protein. Modeling these results as a prolate ellipsoid yields an axial ration a/b of 12.1, suggesting that p67phox adopts an elongated shape in solution (Table II). This conclusion is further corroborated by dynamic light scattering studies that showed p67phox to be monodisperse (polydispersity indices 0.1–0.2) and yielded a translational diffusion coefficient of 4.39 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, which was independent of the salt concentration from 50 to 500 mmNaCl. This value would be consistent with a molecular mass of 120 kDa in the case of a protein that holds a standard globular shape and hydration, close to that of a p67phox dimer. Taken together, these hydrodynamic studies suggest that p67phox adopts an extended and potentially flexible structure thus explaining its apparent dimeric behavior on gel filtration.Table IMolecular masses determined from sedimentation equilibrium experimentsProteinMolecular massTheoretical molecular massDap67phox61,621 ± 2,80060,015p47phox43,892 ± 2,60044,963p40phox41,036 ± 3,70039,966p67phox-p47phox105,160 ± 3,700104,978p67phox-p40phox107,550 ± 10,00099,981p67phox-p47phox-p40phox144,546 ± 3,500144,944p47phox-p40phox70,842 ± 2,50084,929All measurements were carried out at three different loading concentrations and three different speeds as described under “Experimental Procedures” and fitted simultaneously.

https://openalex.org/W2027810447,"Abstract Perfringolysin O (PFO), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, forms large oligomeric pore complexes comprised of up to 50 PFO molecules. In the present studies a mutant of PFO (PFOY181A) has been identified that traps PFO in a multimeric prepore complex that cannot insert its transmembrane β-hairpins and therefore cannot form a pore. Remarkably, PFOY181A can be induced to insert its transmembrane β-hairpins if functional PFO is incorporated into the PFOY181A oligomeric prepore complex. Furthermore, the transition from prepore to pore appears to be an “all or none” process; partial insertion of the transmembrane β-barrel does not occur. Therefore, cooperative interactions between the monomers of the prepore drive the prepore to pore conversion that results in the formation of the transmembrane β-barrel."
https://openalex.org/W2089973146,"The propeptide of furin has multiple roles in guiding the activation of the endoprotease <i>in vivo.</i> The 83-residue N-terminal propeptide is autoproteolytically excised in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at the consensus furin site, -Arg<sup>104</sup>-Thr-Lys-Arg<sup>107</sup>↓-, but remains bound to furin as a potent autoinhibitor. Furin lacking the propeptide is ER-retained and proteolytically inactive. Co-expression with the propeptide, however, restores trans-Golgi network (TGN) localization and enzyme activity, indicating that the furin propeptide is an intramolecular chaperone. Blocking this step results in localization to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/cis-Golgi network (CGN), suggesting the ER and ERGIC/CGN recognize distinct furin folding intermediates. Following transport to the acidified TGN/endosomal compartments, furin cleaves the bound propeptide at a second, internal P1/P6 Arg site (-Arg-Gly-Val<sup>72</sup>-Thr-Lys-Arg<sup>75</sup>↓-) resulting in propeptide dissociation and enzyme activation. Cleavage at Arg<sup>75</sup>, however, is not required for proper furin trafficking. Kinetic analyses of peptide substrates indicate that the sequential pH-modulated propeptide cleavages result from the differential recognition of these sites by furin. Altering this preference by converting the internal site to a canonical P1/P4 Arg motif (Val<sup>72</sup> → Arg) caused ER retention and blocked activation of furin, demonstrating that the structure of the furin propeptide mediates folding of the enzyme and directs its pH-regulated, compartment-specific activation <i>in vivo</i>."

https://openalex.org/W2007192646,"PTEN is a lipid phosphatase responsible for down-regulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate is involved in the activation of the anti-apoptotic effector target, Akt. Although the Akt pathway has been implicated in regulating NF-κB activity, it is controversial as to whether Akt activates NF-κB predominantly through mechanisms that regulate nuclear translocation or transactivation potential. In this report, we utilized PTEN as a natural biological inhibitor of Akt activity to study the effects on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of NF-κB. We found that the reintroduction of PTEN into prostate cells inhibited TNF-stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity. PTEN failed to block TNF-induced IKK activation, IκBα degradation, p105 processing, p65 (RelA) nuclear translocation, and DNA binding of NF-κB. However, PTEN inhibited NF-κB-dependent transcription by blocking the ability of TNF to stimulate the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit. PTEN also inhibited the transactivation potential of the cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein, but this was not observed for c-Jun. The transactivation potential of p65 following TNF stimulation could be rescued from PTEN-dependent repression by re-introducing expression constructs encoding activated forms of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, or Akt and IKK. The ability of PTEN to inhibit the TNF-induced transactivation function of p65 is important, because expression of PTEN blocked TNF-stimulated NF-κB-dependent gene expression, thus sensitizing cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Maintenance of the PTEN tumor suppressor protein is therefore required to modulate Akt activity and to concomitantly control the transcriptional activity of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB.

NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex bound by an inhibitor known as IκB (18.Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). Following cellular stimulation, IκB proteins become phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK), which subsequently targets IκB for ubiquitination and degradation through the 26 S proteasome (20.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB proteins liberates NF-κB, allowing this transcription factor to translocate to the nucleus. In addition to regulation by IκB, NF-κB is also regulated by phosphorylation events that positively up-regulate the transactivation potential of NF-κB subunits (22.May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The transactivation domains of NF-κB have been shown to be regulated by the catalytic domain of protein kinase A, casein kinase II, and by IKK itself (23.Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Recently, two reports (38.Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung A.W.K. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39.Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

Both reports concluded that PTEN expression blocked IL-1β or TNF-induced NF-κB activation; however, major discrepancies exist between these two studies. Koul et al. (38.Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung A.W.K. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that PTEN-dependent inhibition of Akt failed to block IL-1β-induced IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of p65 but rather inhibited NF-κB-DNA binding. In this study, it was proposed that PTEN functioned to inhibit phosphorylation of the p50 subunit of NF-κB, thus inhibiting the DNA binding potential of NF-κB (38.Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung A.W.K. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11402-11408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, Gustin et al. (39.Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27740-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that PTEN inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity by impairing TNF-induced activation of Akt and the IKK complex, suggesting that the PTEN-mediated inhibition of IKK activity blocked the TNF-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding potential of NF-κB. Although both of these studies (38.Koul D. Yao Y. Abbruzzese J.L. Yung A.W.K. Reddy S.A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27740-27744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrate that PTEN is capable of inhibiting cytokine-induced activation of NF-κB, it remains ambiguous as to whether PTEN-dependent inhibition of Akt inhibits NF-κB by down-regulating signals that control nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and/or transactivation potential of NF-κB.To address the involvement of PI3K and Akt in TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, we utilized PTEN-deficient prostate cell lines that constitutively express activated Akt because of a loss of PTEN lipid phosphatase activity (40.Vlietstra R.J. van Alewijk D.C. Hermans K.G. van Steenbrugge G.J. Trapman J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2720-2723PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that re-introduction of PTEN into prostate cells results in a down-regulation of Akt activity and a loss of TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent transcription without blocking IKK-induced IκB degradation, p105 processing, p65 nuclear translocation, or NF-κB DNA binding activity. However, we find that neither Akt nor IKK is dispensable for TNF to stimulate the transactivation potential of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in prostate epithelial cells. We demonstrate that PTEN elicits selective inhibition by blocking signal transduction pathways that are responsible for targeting the transactivation potential of NF-κB and CREB but not for c-Jun. The ability of PTEN to inhibit Akt activity and subsequently block TNF-induced transcriptional activity of NF-κB led to abrogation of the anti-apoptotic function of NF-κB. This work demonstrates that reintroduction of PTEN sensitizes prostate epithelial cells to TNF-induced apoptosis, in part by down-regulating the transactivation potential of NF-κB. Thus, NF-κB is a relevant target of the tumor suppressor function of PTEN.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Reagents, and Plasmid ConstructsHuman prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, were grown in T-media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The 3×-κB luciferase (3×-κB-Luc) reporter construct contains four NF-κB DNA-binding consensus sites originally identified in the MHC class I promoter, fused upstream to firefly luciferase (42.Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Gal-4 luciferase construct (Gal4-Luc) contains four Gal-4 DNA-binding consensus sites, derived from the yeast GAL-4 gene promoter, cloned upstream of luciferase cDNA (42.Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding the Gal4-p65 fusion protein have the yeast Gal-4 DNA binding domain fused to the transactivation domain 1 (TA1) of NF-κB (43.Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Gal4-cJun-(1–223) and Gal4-CREB-(1–283) were commercially purchased (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). His-tagged β-galactosidase encoding plasmid pCMV-LacZ was obtained from Invitrogen. Expression plasmids encoding constitutively activated Ha-Ras(V12), PI3K*, myristoylated Akt (M-Akt), and wild-type IKKβ (wtIKKβ) and plasmids encoding dominant negative PI3K (p85), Akt(K-M), and IKKβ(SS ≫ AA) proteins have been described previously (15.Madrid L.

The PTEN G129E mutant was constructed using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequence analysis. Recombinant human TNF was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). PTEN (N19), His epitope tag (G-18), IκBα (C-21), p50 (N19), and Gal-4 (N19) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pan-Ras antibody (Ab-4) was purchased from Calbiochem. Phospho-Akt-specific (Ser-473), pan-Akt, and IKKγ antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). p65-specific antibody was obtained through Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA), and M2 FLAG epitope tag and α-tubulin (T9026) were obtained from Sigma. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 (C2211) was obtained from Sigma.Transfection and Luciferase Reporter AssaysLNCaP cells at 60–80% confluency were transiently transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmid constructs (1 μg of DNA total) were diluted in serum-free media and mixed with the Superfect reagent. Complexes were allowed to form for 10 min before serum-containing media were added to the mixture. The cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and Superfect-DNA complexes were added to the cells and placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Three hours following the start of transfection, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and replenished with fresh serum-containing media. Twenty four hours post-transfection, cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) following three freeze-thaws in a dry-ice/ETOH bath. Extracts were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. Luciferase assays were performed on equal amounts of protein (100 μg/sample).d-Luciferin was used as a substrate, and relative light units were measured using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments). For control purposes, all cell groups that received PTEN were also co-transfected with pCMV-LacZ and assayed for transfection efficiency by counting β-galactosidase-positive cells as described previously (45.Mayo M.W.

Recombinant PTEN adenovirus was constructed as described previously (46.Gomez-Foix A.M. Coats W.S. Baque S. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25129-25134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant virus was plaque-purified three times, and the structure was verified by restriction mapping of Hirt supernatant DNA. Ad-GFP, similarly constructed, expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein and was provided by Dr. Lily Wu (UCLA). Adenovirus was amplified in 293 cells and purified by banding in a cesium chloride density gradient.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Western Blot AnalysisPreparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (42.Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared at the indicated times and incubated with [32P]dCTP-labeled, double-stranded probe containing an NF-κB consensus site from the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) promoter. Labeled probe-nuclear complexes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Western blot analysis was performed by either analyzing 0.25 m Tris-HCl-lysed cell extracts or cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Total protein (50 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The indicated primary antibodies were incubated for 30 min, washed, and visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences).IKK Immunokinase AssaySubconfluent LNCaP cells infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-PTEN for 48 h were either left untreated or were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF for 15 min. Whole cells extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against IKKγ (New England Biolabs), and the immunoprecipitates were subject to an IKK assay (26.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar) using GST-IκBα-(1–54) (4 μg) as a substrate. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were also analyzed by Western blot analysis to confirm that equal amounts of IKKγ had been analyzed during the IKK assay. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis for PTEN expression.Northern Blot AnalysisLogarithmically growing LNCaP cells were infected with either Ad-GFP or Ad-PTEN virus. Twenty four hours later, cells were either left untreated (t0) or stimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml). Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNAs (15 μg/lane) were resolved on a denaturing 1.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and crossed-linked. Gene expressions were determined by analyzing Northern blots with 32P-labeled random probes generated from NF-κB1, bcl-3, or GAPDHcDNAs, and blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes in Quickhyb (Stratagene). After a 2-h hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 60 °C. Northern blots were analyzed by autoradiography.Apoptosis AssayLNCaP cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate on day 0 and infected with adenovirus at 10 pfu/cell on day 1. TNF was added to the media on day 2. After 24 h of incubation with TNF, cells were harvested, and the extent of apoptosis was determined by quantitation of nucleosomes released into the cytoplasm using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's directions.RESULTSThe Transcriptional Activity of NF-κB Is Inhibited by PTENOur laboratory has demonstrated previously (15.Madrid L.

In the present paper we show that under aerobic conditions the nitroxyl anion (NO−), released from Angeli's salt (disodium diazen-1-ium-1,2,2-triolate,−ON=NO2−), generated peroxynitrite with a yield of about 65%. Simultaneously, hydroxyl radicals are formed from the nitroxyl anion with a yield of about 3% via a minor, peroxynitrite-independent pathway. Further experiments clearly underline that the chemistry of NO− in the presence of oxygen is mainly characterized by peroxynitrite and not by HO⋅ radicals. Quantum-chemical calculations predict that peroxynitrite formation should proceed via intermediary formation of⋅NO and O2⨪, probably by an electron-transfer mechanism. This prediction is supported by the fact that H2O2 is formed during the decay of NO− in the presence of superoxide dismutase (Cu(II),Zn-SOD). Since the nitroxyl anion may be released endogenously by a variety of biomolecules, substantial amounts of peroxynitrite might be formed in vivo via NO− in addition to the “classical” ⋅NO + O2⨪pathway.

Thus, formation of both mutagenic diazopeptides (22.Challis B.C. Cancer Surv. 1989; 8: 363-384PubMed Google Scholar) and carcinogenicN-nitrosoamines (23.Challis, B. C., and Kyrtopoulos, S. A.

I 299–304Google Scholar) are additionally expected to be produced by peroxynitrite. oxoperoxonitrate(1-) hydrogen oxoperoxonitrate(1-) ONOO−/ONOOH 3-morpholinosydnonimineN-ethylcarbamide disodium diazen-1-ium-1,2,2-triolate dihydrorhodamine 123 rhodamine 123 trioxocarbonate(1-) benzoic acid 2,3-diaminonaphthalene 2,3-naphthotriazole sodium 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide superoxide A further source of endogenous peroxynitrite may be the nitroxyl anion (NO−). This anion has been reported to be generatedin vivo from reduction of ⋅NO by Cu(I),Zn-SOD (24.Murphy M.E. Sies H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10860-10864Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), hemoglobin (25.Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c2+ (26.Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), respectively. There are also reports that the NOS-catalyzed oxidation of l-arginine leads to initial formation of NO− and not ⋅NO radical (27.Schmidt H.H.H.W. Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), however, this finding is subject to controversial discussion (28.Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nitroxyl anion might be further formed from reaction of S-nitrosothiols with thiols (29.Wong P.S.-Y.

Chem. 1986; 25: 2676-2677Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have proven that the photochemical decomposition of Angeli's salt, a chemical NO− donor compound (33.Angeli A. Angelico F. Gazz. Chim. Ital. 1903; 33: 245-252Google Scholar), in fact yields peroxynitrite under aerobic conditions (Reaction 1). This photochemical process is probably the reason why NO− has often been referred to as a peroxynitrite-yielding compound, even in textbooks of inorganic chemistry (34.Wiberg N. Holleman-Wiberg Lehrbuch der anorganischen Chemie. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1995Google Scholar).NO−+O2→ONOO−REACTION 1Only very low yields of nitrated products have been observed from NO−-induced reactions (35.Ohshima H. Celan I. Chazotte L. Pignatelli B. Mower H.F. Nitric Oxide-Biol. Chem. 1999; 3: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36.vanUffelen B.E. van der Zee J. de Koster B.M. vanSteveninck J. Elferink J.G.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). From these facts it was concluded that during thermal decomposition of Angeli's salt only a small amount of peroxynitrite is generated (36.vanUffelen B.E. van der Zee J. de Koster B.M. vanSteveninck J. Elferink J.G.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, two research groups (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 38.Reif A. Zecca L. Riederer P. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) apparently disproved the capability of NO−to generate peroxynitrite under more physiological conditions. They reported, for example, that typical peroxynitrite-mediated reactions,e.g. nitrosation reactions, could not be observed (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that NADPH could be oxidized by NO− under hypoxic conditions (38.Reif A. Zecca L. Riederer P. Feelisch M. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these experiments were performed in the presence of organic buffer compounds (Good's buffer) which are known to effectively react with peroxynitrite (39.Lomonosova L.L. Kirsch M. Rauen U. de Groot H. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 40.Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of peroxynitrite by NO− very easily may have been masked. In the present study, we demonstrate that in the presence of molecular oxygen NO− indeed mainly yields peroxynitrite and that NO− additionally produces HO⋅ radicals via a minor, peroxynitrite-independent pathway. Furthermore, we present a key experiment which suggests the intermediacy of O2⨪during the NO−-mediated formation of peroxynitrite. Catalase from beef liver (EC 1.11.1.6), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (EC1.15.1.1), and NADH were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Manganese dioxide, benzoic acid, and hydrogen peroxide were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Angeli's salt came from Alexis-Deutschland (Grünberg, Germany). DHR and DAN were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 (20.5% O2, 79.5% N2, “synthetic air”) and commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0, nitrogen 5.0, and carbon dioxide 4.6 (20.5% O2, 74.5% N2, 5% CO2) were purchased from Messer-Griessheim (Oberhausen, Germany; 5.0 and 4.6 mean purities of 99.999 and 99.996%, respectively). SIN-1 and its decomposition product SIN-1C were generously provided by Drs. K. Schönafinger and J. Pünter (Aventis, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). NAT was synthesized as described by Wheeler et al. (41.Wheeler G.L. Andrejack J. Wiersma J.H. Lott P.F. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1969; 46: 239-245Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite (oxoperoxonitrate(1-)) (0.73 m) was prepared by isoamylnitrite-induced nitrosation of hydrogen peroxide (0.12 mol of isoamylnitrite, 100 ml of H2O2 (1m) plus diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (2 mm)) and purified (e.g. solvent extraction, removal of excess H2O2, N2-purging) as described by Uppu and Pryor (42.Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 242-249Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and stored at −79 °C. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Care was taken to exclude possible contamination by both bicarbonate/carbon dioxide and transition metals. Doubly distilled water was bubbled (2 liters/min) with synthetic air at room temperature for 20 min. This water was used for synthesis of oxoperoxonitrate(1-), NaOH (0.01–0.5 n) and for all other solutions. Phosphate buffer solutions (50 mm) were treated with the heavy metal scavenger resin Chelex 100 (0.3/0.5 g in 10 ml) by gently shaking for 18 h in the dark. After low-speed centrifugation for 5 min, the solutions were carefully decanted from the resin. The resin treatment resulted in an increase in pH by about 0.25 units. Various additives (DHR, NADH, and benzoic acid) were then added. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 at 37 °C and the solutions were again bubbled (2 liters/min) with synthetic air or with the CO2 mixture for 20 min. In the case of CO2bubbling, the pH had to be readjusted to 7.5. SIN-1 and Angeli's salt solutions were prepared as ×100 stock solutions at 4 °C in 50 mm KH2PO4 and in 10 mm NaOH, respectively, and used within 15 min. SIN-1 was added to 1 ml of phosphate buffer and incubated in 12-well cell culture plates (volume of each well 7 ml, Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, these plates were placed in an air-tight vessel (10 liters). During the first 15 min of each experiment, these vessels were flushed (5 liters/min) with synthetic air in a warming incubator (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany). In the presence of HCO3−/CO2 the plates were placed in an incubator for cell culture (37 °C, humidified atmosphere of 95% authentic air and 5% CO2, Labotect, Göttingen, Germany). The experiments with authentic peroxynitrite (2 μl of 25–125 mm ONOO− in 0.5n NaOH was added to 1 ml of reaction solution) and with Angeli's salt (1 ml of reaction solution) were performed in reaction tubes (2.0 ml, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) by using the drop-tube Vortex mixer technique as described previously (40.Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Under HCO3−/CO2-free conditions, the experiments with authentic peroxynitrite and Angeli's salt were performed in a glove-bag (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) under synthetic air. Peroxynitrite, SIN-1, and Angeli's salt (each 50–600 μm)-dependent hydroxylation of BA (5 mm) were employed. After vortexing, the samples were kept for 2 min (in the case of peroxynitrite), 4 h (in the case of SIN-1), and 30 min (in the case of Angeli's salt) at 37 °C, respectively. The product formed was measured by reading its fluorescence with excitation at 290 nm and emission at 410 nm (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Formation of RH was quantified spectrophotometrically at 500 nm (εM = 78,000m−1 cm−1) (43.Haddad I.Y. Crow J.P. Hu P. Ye Y. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L242-L249PubMed Google Scholar). Angeli's salt (50–600 μm)-dependent nitrosation of DAN (200 μm) was employed. After vortexing, the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. NaOH (0.5 m) was added (5:1, v/v, final pH 11–11.5). The product formed, i.e. NAT, was quantified by reading its fluorescence with excitation at 375 nm and emission at 415 nm (44.Miles A.M. Wink D.A. Cook J.C. Grisham M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 105-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard calibration curves were prepared from known amounts of NAT. NADH was quantified by reading its fluorescence with excitation at 339 nm and emission at 460 nm (45.Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VII. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Standard calibration curves were prepared from known amounts of NAD(P)H. Additionally, the oxidation of NAD(P)H was followed photometrically at 340 nm using Δε340 = 6200m−1 cm−1 (45.Klingenberg M. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. VII. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim1985: 251-271Google Scholar). Both methods gave identical results, therefore, only one parameter, the decrease of fluorescence, will be shown here. Hydrogen peroxide was quantified by two techniques. In peroxidase assays, horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed formation of a colored product was measured. 4-Aminoantipyrine and 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid were used as peroxidase substrates. The quinoneimine dye formed from these substrates was measured spectrophotometrically at 546 nm (46.Ioannidis I. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (peroxidase assay). Alternatively, H2O2 was quantified by the amount of O2 released upon addition of catalase (1,000 units/ml) (catalase assay). O2 was determined polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Saur, Reutlingen, Germany). Both methods gave identical results, therefore, only one parameter, the peroxidase assay, will be shown here. The nitrate yields from decomposition of Angeli's salt (100 and 200 μm) were quantified by the use of nitrate reductase in conjunction with the Griess assay. The Griess assay was carried out as described elsewhere (46.Ioannidis I. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Density functional theory andab initio calculations were performed with the Gaussian 98W (Revision A.9) suite of programs (47.Frisch, M. J., Trucks, G. W., Schlegel, H. B., Gill, P. M. W., Johnson, B. G., Robb, M. A., Cheeseman, J. R., Keith, T., Petersson, G. A., Montgomery, J. A., Raghavachari, K., Al-Laham, M. A., Zakrzewski, V. G., Ortiz, J. V., Foresman, J. B., Cioslowski, J., Stefanov, B. B., Nanayakkara, A., Challacombe, M., Peng, C. Y., Ayala, P. Y., Chen, W., Wong, M. W., Andres, J. L., Replogle, E. S., Gomperts, R., Martin, R. L., Fox, D. J., Binkley, J. S., Defrees, D. J., Baker, J., Stewart, J. P., Head-Gordon, M., Gonzalez, C., and Pople, J. A. (2000)Gaussian 98W Revision, A9 Ed., Gaussian Inc., Pittsburgh, PAGoogle Scholar). Geometries were fully optimized to stationary points, using the CBS-QB3 methodology in the density functional theory calculations and single-excitation CI calculations and second-order M⊘ller-Plesset (48.Møller C. Plesset M.S. Physiol. Rev. 1934; 46: 618-622Crossref Scopus (13521) Google Scholar) (MP2) calculations with the 6–311+G(d) basis set on the ab initio level. Calculation of UV-VIS absorption spectra was performed by single point energy calculations on the CBS-QB3-optimized structure using the protocol of the time-dependent density functional theory method (49.Bauernschmitt R. Ahlrichs R. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1996; 256: 454-464Crossref Scopus (5081) Google Scholar). Aqueous solvent interactions were evaluated with the PCM (50.Miertus S. Scrocco E. Tomasi J. Chem. Phys. 1981; 55: 117-123Crossref Scopus (8186) Google Scholar) procedure incorporated in Gaussian 98W. To verify whether an electron transfer between NO− and O2 would be thermodynamically feasible, geometry optimizations and frequency calculations were done using the MP2 approximation. Molecular interactions were then evaluated with the IPCM (51.Foresman J.B. Keith T.A. Wiberg K.B. Snoonian J. Frisch M.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 16098-16104Crossref Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) procedure. To prove whether ONOO− is formed during the decay of NO− in the presence of oxygen, we attempted to identify peroxynitrite by UV-visible spectroscopy. As the half-life of ONOO− is short at physiological pH values and since UV light induces the decomposition of Angeli's salt to peroxynitrite (32.Donald C.E. Hughes M.N. Thompson J.M. Bonner F.T. Inorg. Chem. 1986; 25: 2676-2677Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), 8 samples of 5 mm Angeli's salt from the same stock solution were incubated in parallel runs in the dark at 37 °C at pH 12.25 (Fig. 1A). The decay of Angeli's salt is slow at these experimental conditions (t1/2 ∼12 h), thus, reaction times of several hours were necessary to monitor the significant changes of the optical density. The initial absorbance at the beginning of the experiment was 0.35 ± 0.05 at 302 nm. With increasing reaction time, the optical density at 302 nm increased continuously to reach a maximum value of 0.88 ± 0.08 after 6 h, followed by a further decrease of the absorption at longer reaction periods. After 24 h the extinction value had dropped to 0.4 ± 0.05, clearly showing that a relatively long-lived intermediate has been formed during the decay of Angeli's salt. The absorption at 302 nm had decayed completely when the reaction solution was briefly (20–30 s) bubbled with CO2 after 5 h of incubation (data not shown). These observations strongly indicated the intermediary formation of ONOO−. In fact, when the initial UV spectrum was subtracted from the one observed after 4 h of incubation, the resulting difference spectrum exhibited an absorption spectrum with a maximum at 302 nm (Fig. 1, B and C), similar to what has been reported for peroxynitrite (52.Kortüm G. Finckh B. Z. Physikal. Chem. 1940; 48: 32-49Google Scholar). This was verified by comparison with the UV spectrum of authentic ONOO− (Fig. 1C). The scatter of the difference spectrum at shorter wavelengths (λ< 295 nm) derives from the strong absorption of Angeli's salt in this wavelength region. The absorbance at 302 nm has been attributed to the cis-conformer of peroxynitrite (53.Tsai, J.-H. M., Hamilton, T. P., Harrison, J. G., Jablowski, M., v. d. Woerd, M., Martin, J. C., and Beckman, J. S. (1994) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116, 4115–4116Google Scholar,54.Hughes, M. N., and Nicklin, H. G. (1968) J. Chem. Soc. A 450–452Google Scholar). This is excellently supported by time-dependent density functional theory calculations (Table I), which show that thetrans-conformer of ONOO− should absorb at longer wavelengths (λmax = 374 nm). Thus,cis-ONOO− is produced from the NO−-donating compound Angeli's salt during its decay in aerobic solution.Table IQuantum chemically calculated UV-visable absorption of ONOO−isomersCompoundUV-visible absorptionAbsorption coefficient, ɛOscillator strength, fExperimentCalculationnmcis-ONOO−3023031670 ± 501-aRef. 54.0.0928trans-ONOO−4510.00053740.08963200.00052,4-cyclo-ONOO−3520.00033100.00032590.00261-a Ref. 54.Hughes, M.

Open table in a new tab The above observations qualitatively prove the formation of peroxynitrite from NO−; the yield of this reaction remained to be established. To this end, the potential of Angeli's salt to oxidize both DHR and NADH were compared with those of the⋅NO/O2⨪releasing compound SIN-1. Increasing concentrations (0–25 μm) of SIN-1 as well as of Angeli's salt stimulated the oxidation of both DHR and NADH (each 50 μm) in a linear fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). While SIN-1 oxidized DHR and NADH with yields of ∼100 and 85%, respectively, Angeli's salt was found to be significantly less effective, oxidizing DHR and NADH with yields of ∼60 and 65%, respectively. Thus, the production of peroxynitrite from Angeli's salt is only 65 ± 5% of that from SIN-1. This fact implied that in the absence of suitable targets (i.e. HEPES, DHR, and NADH) the formation of nitrate from Angeli's salt should be in the same range. In fact, about 65 μm nitrate was formed during the decay of 100 μm Angeli's salt at pH 7.5 irrespective of the presence of CO2 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, Angeli's salt-derived formation of nitrate was maximal at physiological pH values. Control experiments revealed that nitrate was not a contaminant of the applied Angeli's salt because nitrate could not be detected after decomposition of Angeli's salt (100 μm) at pH 12.25 in the presence of 20 μmCu2+(data not shown). Consequently, Angeli's salt had consumed oxygen with an efficiency of about 65%. To verify this, the oxygen uptake induced by Angeli's salt (50–200 μm) was determined polarographically (Table II). As expected, the amount of O2 consumed by NO−was found to be around 65% of the employed amount of Angeli's salt. Thus, the nitroxyl anion yields peroxynitrite with a yield of about 65%. Our oxygen uptake experiments are in disagreement with data of Miranda et al. (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), who observed a 1:1 stoichiometry between NO− (or rather Angeli's salt) and O2. However, it should be remembered that the experiments of Mirandaet al. (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Since only ∼65% of the generated NO− was converted into peroxynitrite, the question arose whether other (reactive) intermediates were formed from the remaining 35% of NO−. Recently, two research groups (55.Stoyanovsky D.A. Clancy R. Cederbaum A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5093-5094Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 56.Ohshima H. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported that NO− released from Angeli's salt should generate hydroxyl radicals. As peroxynitrite is known to produce HO⋅ radicals (57.Richeson C.E. Mulder P. Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7211-7219Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 58.Beckman J.S.

Chem. 1999; 38: 4317-4321Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the HO⋅ radicals detected by these groups may have derived exclusively from peroxynitrite. To check on this important point, the Angeli's salt (0–500 μm)-induced hydroxylation of benzoic acid (5 mm) was studied and compared with that of authentic peroxynitrite (0–500 μm) (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of CO2 peroxynitrite-dependent hydroxylation of BA increased in a linear manner with increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite. In the presence of CO2, however, peroxynitrite-mediated hydroxylation of BA was inhibited by about 99%. The effect of CO2 to strongly suppress peroxynitrite-derived formation of hydroxyl radicals is in full agreement with recent reports (57.Richeson C.E. Mulder P. Bowry V.W. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7211-7219Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 60.Lemercier J.N. Padmaja S. Cueto R. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem.

Moreover, this effect of CO2 offers the possibility to distinguish between HO⋅ released from peroxynitrite and HO⋅ radicals released from other sources. Similar to peroxynitrite, Angeli's salt-mediated hydroxylation of BA increased with increasing concentration of Angeli's salt in the absence of CO2 although not in a strictly linear fashion (Fig. 3B). The efficacy of Angeli's salt to hydroxylate BA decreased with increasing concentration compared with authentic peroxynitrite. This result again is in disagreement with observations by Miranda et al. (37.Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Ludwick N. Kim S.M. Jourd′heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol.

Recently, we have found that ACK2 directly interacts with clathrin heavy chain through a clathrin-binding motif that is conserved in all endocytic adaptor proteins and regulates clathrin assembly, suggesting that ACK2 plays a role in clathrin-coated vesicle endocytosis (Yang, W., Lo, C. G., Dispenza, T., and Cerione, R. A. (2001)<i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 276, 17468–17473). Here we report the identification of another binding partner for ACK2 that has previously been implicated in endocytosis, namely the sorting nexin protein SH3PX1 (sorting nexin 9). The interaction occurs between a proline-rich domain of ACK2 and the Src homology 3 domain (SH3) of SH3PX1. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that ACK2, clathrin, and SH3PX1 form a complex in cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1, whereas co-transfection of ACK2 with SH3PX1 resulted in the constitutive phosphorylation of SH3PX1. However, co-transfection of the kinase-dead mutant ACK2(K158R) with SH3PX1 blocked EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SH3PX1, indicating that the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of SH3PX1 is mediated by ACK2. EGF receptor levels were significantly decreased following EGF stimulation of cells co-expressing ACK2 and SH3PX1, thus highlighting a novel role for ACK2, working together with SH3PX1 to promote the degradation of the EGF receptor."

In contrast, Drosophila, and possibly insects in general, lacks glutathione reductase and must rely solely on the TrxR system. The mammalian TrxRs described so far are selenoproteins that utilize NADPH to reduce protein as well as nonprotein substrates in mitochondria and cytoplasm of cells. We show that a single Drosophila gene, Trxr-1, encodes non-selenocysteine-containing cytoplasmic and mitochondrial TrxR isoforms that differ with respect to their N termini.

Glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are key enzymes that use NADPH to recycle glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and Trx(S2) to GSH and Trx(SH)2, respectively (3.Mustacich D. Powis G.

Like other members of the disulfide oxidoreductase family, TrxRs show a number of sequence motifs that are essential for the catalytic activity in addition to the conserved selenocysteine in the C-terminal region of the proteins. These additional motifs include an N-terminal disulfide active center, NADPH- and FAD-binding domains, and a dimer interface sequence necessary for homodimerization of the enzymes (4.Williams C.H.

For TrxR3, alternative first exons were observed, and they result in the formation of mitochondrial and cytosolic protein isoforms, respectively.

Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Here we report that a single gene, Trxr-1, codes for two forms of the enzyme, a cytoplasmic (TrxR-1cyto) and mitochondrial (TrxR-1mito), respectively, as has been described for mammals (18.Sun Q.A. Zappacosta F. Factor V.M. Wirth P.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3106-3114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The two Drosophila Trxr-1 variants differ in their N-terminal sequences. Both isoforms lack the selenocysteine residue in the C terminus, which is replaced by a cysteine residue. We provide a biochemical characterization of TrxR-1mito, showing that it has properties similar to the previously characterized TrxR-1cyto (7.Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We generated and examined null mutations of Trxr-1 as well as mutations affecting either the mitochondrial or the cytoplasmic enzyme variants. The results show that each type of the mutants is lethal. In addition, transgene-dependent rescue experiments indicated that the two forms of TrxR-1 are functionally distinct in vivo. Mitochondrial TrxR-1mito can compensate for the lack of mitochondrial TrxR activity and partially substitutes for the cytoplasmic TrxR, whereas cytoplasmic TrxR-1cyto is unable to compensate for the loss of the mitochondrial enzyme activity. The results show that ROS defense is compartmentalized and that the capacity to adequately protect cells from cytotoxic damage depends on evolutionarily conserved variants that can be encoded by a single gene.

Reversion tests and generation of null mutants for Trxr-1involved remobilization of the P{lacW} element of the line l (1) G0477. l(1) G0477/FM7c virgin females were crossed with FM6/Y; TM2, ry P{ry+ Δ2–3}(99B)/MKRS, Sb P{ry+ Δ2–3}(99B) (24.Robertson H.M. Preston C.R. Phillis R.W. Johnson-Schlitz D.M. Benz W.K. Engels W.R. Genetics. 1988; 118: 461-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Female offspring with mosaic eyes were crossed with FM6 balancer males; progeny that had lost the P{lacW} element were examined whether the excision event had restored wild type function or generated a deletion corresponding to a Trxr-1-null allele (see below and text). Two deletions, Trxr-1Δ1 and Trxr-1Δ2, were used for the experiments described. Genomic DNA was isolated from flies using the QIAamp Tissue Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). P{lacW} excisions caused a reversion of the mutant phenotype into wild type or generated the deletion mutants. Trxr-1Δ1 and Trxr-1Δ2 (see above) were examined by PCR amplification followed by sequencing as described earlier (8.Missirlis F. Phillips J.P. Jäckle H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1272-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The insertion site DNA fragment of a randomly picked wild type reversion line was amplified with the primer pair trxr5′/trxr3′b. Sequence analysis revealed that a precise excision of the P{lacW} had taken place. PCR amplification of various DNA fragments of the deletion mutants Trxr-1Δ1 and Trxr-1Δ2 involved the following primers: P, 5′-CGACGGGACCACCTTATGTTATTTCATGATG-3′; P-inverse, 5′-CATGATGAAATAACATAAGGTGGTCCCGTCG-3′; trxr5′, 5′-TTTACGTGGAGCACCTACCAACAAGC-3′; trxr3′b, 5′-GATGGCGCAAATCATGTACTTCAGC-3′; trxr3′c, 5′-TCTTCGGCGGTAGTGGGATGGATGC-3′; and trxr3′d, 5′-CAGCGACTTATCAATGGGTTGG-3′.

Sequence analysis revealed a 534-bp deletion that specifically removes sequences corresponding to the TrxR-1mito transcript with breakpoints located within P{lacW} DNA and at position 131290 of the AE03443 clone (20.Adams M.D. Celniker S.E.

PCR with Trxr-1Δ1 DNA was performed with the primer pairs P-inverse/trxr3′b, P-inverse/trxr3′c, and P-inverse/trxr3′d. Of the three combinations tried, only the P-inverse/trxr3′d combination worked and allowed us to amplify a 4.5-kb DNA fragment.

Developmental Northern blot analysis was done with total RNA extracted from Drosophila embryos, larvae, pupae, and adults (see Fig. 1B) using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR analysis (26.Sambrook J. Russel W.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) was carried out with RNA of the corresponding stages. For reverse transcription reactions, 5 μg of total RNA was first treated with the DNA-free kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Ambion, Huntingdon, United Kingdom). cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen). First strand synthesis was carried out at 42 °C for 60 min with an oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). Double-stranded cDNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitated, and resuspended in H2O. The developmental expression profile of the two Trxr-1 splicing variants was also examined by PCR amplification of the cDNA using the following primers: TrxR-1 Ex1, 5′-CTCCGCTTATTCGTTTCGTG-3′; TrxR-1 Ex2, 5′-TCTCCTTCGGCTGGCATTAT-3′; and TrxR-1 Ex3, 5′-TCAGCTTCTTGGGAATGCAG-3′. For the position of the primers see Fig. 1A. PCR with the primer pair TrxR-1 Ex1 and TrxR-1 Ex3 amplifies a 370-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the Trxr-1cyto transcript, whereas PCR with the primer combination TrxR-1 Ex2 and TrxR-1 Ex3 results in a 454-bp DNA fragment specific for the Trxr-1mito transcript (see Fig. 1C). Construction of UAS-Trxr-1cyto was described in Missirlis et al. (8.Missirlis F. Phillips J.P. Jäckle H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1272-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For UAS-Trxr-1mitoconstruction, the expressed sequence tag clone LD06006 (27.Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI and XhoI, and the DNA fragment was subcloned in pSL1180 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The resulting pSLTrxr-1mito DNA was digested BglII-XhoI, and the DNA fragment containing the Trxr-1mito open reading frame was cloned into the pUAST vector. pUAS-Trxr-1mito DNA was used for transformation of flies as described previously (28.Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). For each experiment outlined in the text, results were confirmed by use of two independent transgenic lines. TrxR-1cyto and TrxR-1mito were fused to EGFP in front of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). The respective DNA was PCR-amplified with primers that introduced a 5′ HindIII site, a 3′ XhoI site, and LD21729, LD06006 as the template DNA, respectively. The primers used were XhoIcytogfp5′ GCCCTCGAGATGGCGCCCGTGCAAGGATCCTACGAC, XhoImitogfp5′ GCCCTCGAGATGAACTTGTGCAATTCGAGATTCTCCG, and HindIIIcmgfp3′ TTCAAGCTTAAGCTGCAGCAGCTGGCCGGCGTGGG. The stop codon was mutated into a leucine. The corresponding plasmids were transfected into mouse NIH/3T3 cells using the method of Chen and Okayama (29.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and mounted in Vectashield containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole purchased from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, California). The fusion proteins were detected after 24 h using fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, A–C). For localization of mitochondria, transfected cells were incubated for 1 h with 250 nmof Mitotracker® Orange CM-H2TMRos (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and inspected by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, D–F). Rescue experiments were performed with the Trxr-1 mutants (see text) using the Gal4/UAS system (30.Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to drive ubiquitous expression of UAS-Trxr-1cyto or UAS-Trxr-1mito under the control of an act5C-Gal4 driver as described recently (8.Missirlis F. Phillips J.P. Jäckle H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1272-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transgene-derived Trxr-1 expression was monitored by in situ hybridization (31.Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Perrimon N. Taubert H. Jäckle H. Nature. 1995; 376: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The frequency of pupal eclosion and lifespan measurements of hemizygous mutant males bearing the Gal4/UAS combination of transgenes were monitored and compared with hemizygous mutant males that contain only the act5C-Gal4transgene and siblings that carried the balancer chromosome FM6 in place of the mutant X chromosome, respectively. For other controls see Fig. 3 and Missirlis et al. (8.Missirlis F. Phillips J.P. Jäckle H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1272-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Up to 10 eclosed males (0–24 h old) of the genotype described in the text were kept in small food vials and transferred into new vials every 2nd day. Survival of flies was monitored in 48-h intervals. For each experiment described in Fig. 4 at least 150 males were monitored, and experiments were repeated with different batches of food and at different seasons during the year. TrxR-1cyto and TrxR-1mito were recombinantly produced in E. coli as hexahistidyl-tagged proteins. The two proteins were then purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (7.Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Müller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). DrosophilaTrx-1 was kindly placed at our disposal by Holger Bauer and Heiner Schirmer (Heidelberg University). The open reading frame of TrxR-1mito (Fig. 1A) was PCR-amplified from LD06006 (27.Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) using primers XhoI5′alt GCCCTCGAGATGAACTTGTGCAATTCG and HindIII3′alt TTCAAGCTTTAGCTGCAGCAGCTGGC introducing 5′ XhoI and 3′ HindIII restriction sites, respectively. The open reading frame was subsequently subcloned in-frame into the pRSETA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The resulting fusion protein contains an N-terminal hexahistidyl tag, which allowed purification (see below). All chemicals used were of the highest available purity and were obtained from Roth or Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrices for purification of His-tagged protein were purchased from Qiagen. The E. coli strain BL-21 was used for expression of the Drosophila melanogaster Trxr-1mito gene. Competent cells were transformed with the respective pRSETATrxr-1mito plasmid. Starter cultures from single colonies were grown overnight, and 12 ml were used for inoculation of 600 ml of LB medium containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5; subsequently the expression was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were grown overnight, harvested, and directly used for protein purification or were frozen at −20 °C. For purification, the cells were disintegrated by sonication in the presence of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with 50 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. After washing the column with increasing imidazole concentrations, the respective protein was eluted with 75 mm imidazole; collected fractions were tested for enzymatic activity and for purity by 10% SDS gel electrophoresis. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated via ultrafiltration. TrxR activity was determined spectrophotometrically in 100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at 25 °C in two different assay systems: (a) at 412 nm in the presence"
https://openalex.org/W2136494048,"Chronic treatment of cultured cells with very low levels of azide (I50<10 μm) leads to slow (t½ = 6 h), irreversible loss of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. Azide-mediated COX losses were not accompanied by inhibition of other mitochondrial enzymes and were not dependent upon electron flux through oxidative phosphorylation. Although azide treatment also reduced activity (but not content) of both CuZn superoxide dismutase and catalase, a spectrum of pro-oxidants (and anti-oxidants) failed to mimic (or prevent) azide effects, arguing that losses in COX activity were not due to resultant compromises in free radical scavenging. Loss of COX activity was not attributable to reduced rates of mitochondrial protein synthesis or declines in either COX subunit mRNA or protein levels (COX I, II, IV). Co-incubation experiments using copper (CuCl2, Cu-His) and copper chelators (neocuproine, bathocuproine) indicated that azide effects were not mediated by interactions with either CuAor CuB. In contrast, difference spectroscopy and high performance liquid chromatography analyses demonstrated azide-induced losses in cytochrome aa3 content although not to the same extent as catalytic activity. Differential azide effects on COX content relative to COX activity were confirmed using a refined inhibition time course in combination with blue native electrophoresis, and established that holoenzyme dissociation occurs subsequent to losses in catalytic activity. Collectively, these data suggest that COX deficiency can arise through enhanced holoenzyme dissociation, possibly through interactions with the structure or coordination of its heme moieties.

However, the pathophysiological consequences of complex deficiencies have also been studied using specific inhibitors to chronically impair catalytic activity (2.Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8.Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat.

Sodium azide is commonly used in vitro as a rapid and reversible inhibitor of COX, the terminal enzyme of the ETC that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen (9.Yoshikawa S. Caughey W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9757-9766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-18436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11.Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T. Science. 1998; 280: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). The ability of azide to rapidly bind to the binuclear center, thereby inhibiting COX activity, has led to its frequent use in acute studies, including those designed to address the role of mitochondrial oxygen sensing in signal transduction (12.Budinger G.R.S. Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13.Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 11715-11720Crossref Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). We previously reported that chronic treatment of cultured myocytes with micromolar levels of azide results in the irreversible inhibition of COX activity (14.Leary S.C. Battersby B.J. Hansford R.G. Moyes C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This mode of inhibition clearly differs from the classic mechanism of azide-mediated COX inhibition in that it is of higher affinity (0.01–0.1versus 1–10 mm) and irreversible in nature. The mechanism(s) by which azide mediates these effects is unknown. Moreover, its potential relevance to COX deficiency observed in a more physiologically relevant context has not been evaluated despite previous reports of selective COX losses leading to Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms in rats that had been chronically infused with sodium azide (15.Bennett M.C. Mlady G.W. Kwon Y.-H. Rose G.M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16.Berndt J.D. Callaway N.L. Gonzalez-Lima F. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 2001; 63: 67-77Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several plausible mechanisms exist that could account for the azide-mediated, irreversible inhibition of COX activity. First, the capacity of azide to act as a chelator of first order transition series metals could affect COX activity by either terminal binding to or stripping of one or both copper centers from highly conserved domains within mitochondrially encoded subunits I and II (CuA on COX II, CuB on COX I; Refs. 11.Yoshikawa S. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yamashita E. Inoue N. Yao M. Fei M.J. Libeu C.P. Mizushima T. Yamaguchi H. Tomizaki T. Tsukihara T.

Second, because copper metabolism is critical to the maturation and assembly of individual COX subunits into a functional holoenzyme complex (18.Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14504-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 19.Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), azide may impair either its delivery or insertion into the complex. Third, azide may act as a suicide metabolite to inhibit COX activity during enzyme turnover in a manner analogous to azide-mediated loss of catalase activity (21.Lardinois O.M. Rouxhet P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has recently been shown that the COX-mediated conversion of azide to the azidyl radical leads to its irreversible inactivation in vitro, although this mechanism requires very high concentrations of both azide and H2O2 (22.Chen Y.-R. Sturgeon B.E. Gunther M.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24611-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fourth, chronic azide effects on COX activity may arise indirectly from elevated bulk phase production of ROS since azide is also a potent inhibitor of SOD (23.Misra H.P. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and catalase (21.Lardinois O.M. Rouxhet P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24.Ghadermarzi M. Moosavi-Movahedi A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) activities. In the present study, we systematically addressed these possibilities to clarify the mechanism(s) by which azide irreversibly inhibits COX activity. Collectively, our studies suggest that azide treatment results in a loss of catalytic activity by accelerating the rate of holoenzyme dissociation, possibly through interactions with the structure or coordination of heme moieties. All culture media, sera, and antibiotics were purchased from Invitrogen. C2C12 cells were grown in proliferation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. At 70% confluency, myoblasts were switched to differentiation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% HS. Sol8, HEK293, and ASMC were cultured in proliferation medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, whereas PC12 cells were maintained in proliferation medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Penicillin, streptomycin, and neomycin were included in all media. The medium was changed every 2–3 days in proliferating and serum-starved cells. Assays for all enzymes were optimized to ensure that neither substrates nor co-factors were limiting. The activities of NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.3), COX (EC 1.9.3.1), CS (EC4.1.3.7) (25.Moyes C.D. Mathieu-Costello O.A. Tsuchiya N. Filburn C. Hansford R.G. Am. J.

Academic Press, New York1974: 673-678Crossref Google Scholar) were measured from whole cell extracts as previously described. The activities of individual ETC enzymes were also assayed using isolated mitochondria (28.Bindoff L.A. Birch-Machin M.A. Cartlidge N.E. Parker Jr., W.D. Turnbull D.M. J. Neurol. Sci. 1991; 104: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The complex V (EC 3.6.1.34) assay contained 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mm ATP, 0.15 mm NADH, and 1 unit each lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of saturating amounts of oligomycin (0.24–0.72 μg). No NADH oxidation was observed in the absence of mitochondria. Total cellular SOD (EC 1.15.1.1) was assayed at 550 nm using the aerobic xanthine/xanthine oxidase system (23.Misra H.P. Fridovich I.

Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). MnSOD activity was measured from mitochondrial extracts in the presence of 5 mm KCN to inhibit any contaminating CuZn SOD. Protocols for measuring cellular protein content, lactate concentration in the culture media, and whole cell respiration were as previously described (16.Berndt J.D. Callaway N.L. Gonzalez-Lima F. J.

Coverslips were fitted to a 260-μl perfusion chamber thermostatted to 37 °C (Warner Instruments) on a Zeiss fluorescent microscope stage, superfused for 35 min with PBS supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 4 mm glutamine, 1 mmpyruvate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin containing 5 μm 2,7-dichlorofluorescin (DCF) diacetate (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was measured (20× magnification, 100-ms exposure, 4 × 4 binning) using a CCD camera (Cooke Sensicam) and optical filters appropriate for DCF fluorescence (excitation peak, 490 nm; emission peak, 526 nm). The same cells were subsequently perfused for 5 min with 5 mmH2O2 to obtain maximal fluorescence (30.Narayan P. Mentzer Jr., R.M. Lasley R.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 121-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mean pixel intensities of cells and background were determined using Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Because of potential excitation-dependent oxidation of DCFH, only one field of view was analyzed on each coverslip. Plates were rinsed and harvested in ice-cold PBS. Pelleted cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for at least 24 h. Thawed cells pellets were resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and homogenized with 10 passes through a pre-chilled, zero clearance homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co.). Cell debris and nuclei were pelleted with 2 10-min spins at 650 × g. The resultant supernatant (S1) was spun for 15 min at 14,000 × g to collect the mitochondrial fraction. Denatured mitochondrial and S1 fractions (10 μg) were resolved using a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), and electroblotted (Bio-Rad, Mini-protean system) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Zymotech Inc.). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Cu/Zn and MnSOD (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.) and cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and mouse monoclonal antibodies for anti-COX I, COX IV, and ND1 (Molecular Probes) were diluted to 1:1,000. Polyclonal anti-COX II (Dr. T. L. Mason, University of Massachusetts), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-catalase (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.) antibodies were diluted to 1:40, 1:5,000, and 1:25,000, respectively. Mouse anti-39-kDa (Molecular Probes) and human anti-porin (Calbiochem) monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 1:2,000. COX I and IV antibodies were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. All other antibodies were reconstituted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 supplemented with 2% low fat skim milk powder. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline/Tween supplemented with 5% low fat skim milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody of interest. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature with either secondary anti-mouse (Pierce, 1:10,000) or anti-rabbit (Promega, 1:2,500) horseradish peroxidase antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were detected by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Blue native PAGE (32.Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar, 33.Schägger H. Bentlage H. Ruitenbeck W. Pfeiffer K. Rother C.

Nijtmans L.G.J. Van den Bogert C. Houstek J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the relative distribution of complex I activity between the pellet and the extract was measured as an index of solubilization of inner membrane proteins (extract typically contained 80–90% of the total activity). Loading dye was added to each sample at a 1:4 ratio of Coomassie:laurylmaltoside, and equal units of complex I were loaded in each lane of a 6–15% continuous gradient gel. Protocols used for in-gel assays (35.Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), immunoblotting of first-dimension gels and second dimension electrophoresis (36.Dekker P.J.T. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bömer U. Müller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) were as previously described. NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase and COX holoenzyme levels from first-dimension immunoblots were quantified using an enhanced chemifluorescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturers' specifications. Mitochondria (2.5 mg/ml) were solubilized on ice for 1 h in 750 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bistris (pH 7.0) containing 1% w/v Triton X-100. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to remove debris. UV-visible spectra were recorded on an OLIS-refurbished Aminco DW-2 UV/VIS spectrophotometer at room temperature and are presented as reduced-oxidized differences. The oxidized state is taken as the form of the sample in air and is unchanged upon the addition of ferricyanide. The reduced state is generated by addition of a few grains of solid sodium dithionite to the air-oxidized sample. Total heme A content from 3 mg of mitochondrial protein was extracted and measured by reverse phase HPLC as previously described (37.Barros M.H. Carlson C.G. Glerum D.M. Tzagoloff A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Total RNA was purified from guanidinium thiocyanate extracts using a standard acid phenol protocol (38.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar). Denatured RNA (10 μg) was fractionated using a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel system. A cDNA for the muscle-specific isoform of COX VIa was amplified from rat soleus reverse-transcriptase template at 60 °C with 5′-ctgacctttgtgctggctct-3′ and 5′-gattgacgtggggattgtg-3′ using standard PCR conditions, cloned into pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen), and sequenced. All other probes for mtDNA- and nuclear-encoded mRNA species were obtained as previously described (16.Berndt J.D. Callaway N.L. Gonzalez-Lima F. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 2001; 63: 67-77Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25.Moyes C.D. Mathieu-Costello O.A. Tsuchiya N. Filburn C. Hansford R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1345-C1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prehybridized (3 h) and hybridized (12–18 h) at 65 °C in modified Church's buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 7% SDS, and 10 mm EDTA). Membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 15 min with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS and twice at 50 °C for 15 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Blots were visualized by phosphorimaging, and relative signal strength was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Differences in loading across lanes were normalized using a probe for α-tubulin mRNA. To pulse label mitochondrial translation products (39.Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), myotubes grown in 60-mm plates were washed twice with sterile PBS and incubated for 30 min in pre-warmed, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed HS. After an additional 5-min incubation in the presence of 100 μg/ml emetine, cells were incubated with 400 μCi of Expre35S35S (Mandel) for 1 h. Excess label was chased by the addition of regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% HS for 10 min. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Samples (10 μg) were sonicated on ice and fractionated on a 12–20% gradient gel at 7 mA for 14–16 h. The gel was then fixed for 1 h and dried for autoradiography. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between control and treated groups for all measured parameters were detected using one-way analysis of variance and identified post hoc using the Tukey-Kramer honestly signficantly different. Chronic treatment of C2C12 myotubes with micromolar amounts of azide caused a time-dependent loss of COX activity (data not shown; Ref. 14.Leary S.C. Battersby B.J. Hansford R.G. Moyes C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a resultant decline in whole cell respiration, and a concomitant increase in the rate of intracellular lactate accumulation (Fig. 1A). The azide effect on COX activity was also observed in three other cell backgrounds (HEK293, PC12, and ASMC), with a 24-h treatment with 100 μm azide, resulting in the inhibition of 65–90% of total activity (Fig. 1B). Loss of catalytic activity was irreversible, both in situ and in vitro. C2C12 myotubes pulsed for 6 h with 100 μm azide continued to lose COX activity 24 h after the removal of azide from the culture media (6 versus24 h, 49 versus 33% of control). Azide-treated C2C12 cell extracts dialyzed for 24 h (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 4 °C) in the presence or absence of reductant (β-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol) also failed to recover catalytic activity (data not shown). To determine whether azide required access to the binuclear center to irreversibly inhibit COX activity in situ, C2C12 myotubes were co-incubated with equimolar amounts of azide and cyanide (10 μm each). Despite a much higher relative affinity of cyanide (Ki 1 versus 64 μm; Refs. 10.Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-18436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and 41.Tsubaki M. Yoshikawa S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and its ability to competitively displace bound azide from the binuclear center in vitro (42.Partridge R.S. Monroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it neither attenuated nor abrogated azide-mediated COX inhibition (expressed as % of control: azide, 51.1; KCN, 102.5; azide + KCN, 47.1). Collectively, these data argue against azide exerting its in situ effects on COX activity via classically described ligand interactions with the binuclear center (see Refs. 9.Yoshikawa S. Caughey W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9757-9766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 10.Li W. Palmer G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1833-18436Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The irreversible loss of catalytic activity could not be mimicked by dialyzing extracts of untreated C2C12 myotubes, rat skeletal muscle, or purified bovine COX against 0–100 μm azide (24 h in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 4 °C; data not shown). Given that azide-induced losses in catalytic activity only occurred in situ, we investigated the potential requirement of an intact ETC to the observed azide effects (see Ref. 42.Partridge R.S. Monroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous reports that azide is a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity of complex V (43.Kobayashi H. Maeda M. Anraku Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,44.Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) also prompted us to evaluate its effects on the activity of a spectrum of other mitochondrial enzymes. Although azide treatment resulted in a significant loss of COX activity, it had no effect on a Krebs cycle enzyme (CS), individual complexes of the ETC, and the ATPase component of complex V (Fig. 1C). Incubation of C2C12 cells for 24 h with specific inhibitors of complexes I (2–200 nm rotenone) and III (2 μg/ml antimycin A, 0.1–10 μm myxothiazol) in the presence or absence of azide neither caused a specific COX loss nor abrogated azide-mediated COX losses (data not shown). Although 24-h incubations with oligomycin (2.4 μg/ml), a complex V inhibitor, enhanced the specific loss of COX activity mediated by azide (Table I), marked inhibition of 35S incorporation into mitochondrial translation products (36.2% of control; data not shown) suggested that the oligomycin effect was attributable to reduced availability of mitochondrially encoded COX subunits required for holoenzyme assembly.Table IAzide and oligomycin effects on enzyme activityTreatmentEnzyme activityCOXNDHCatalaseTotal SOD% control10 μm azide53.2 ± 4.6aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.112.3 ± 6.974.4 ± 4.8aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.63.5 ± 4.8aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.2.4 μg/ml oligomycin91.5 ± 1.8128.7 ± 4.2aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.123.7 ± 4.9aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.91.5 ± 8.210 μm azide + 2.4 μg/ml oligomycin26.9 ± 5.1aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.bDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between cells treated with azide alone versus azide plus oligomycin.147.9 ± 20.4aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.bDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between cells treated with azide alone versus azide plus oligomycin.107.8 ± 7.3bDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between cells treated with azide alone versus azide plus oligomycin.38.2 ± 3.8aDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and treated cells.bDenotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between cells treated with azide alone versus azide plus oligomycin.C2C12 cells were differentiated for 6 days under serum-starved conditions and treated for 24 h with either 10 μmazide or 2.4 μg/ml oligomycin alone or in combination.

https://openalex.org/W2087025822,"OmpR and EnvZ comprise a two-component system that regulates the porin genes ompF and ompC in response to changes in osmolarity. EnvZ is autophosphorylated by intracellular ATP on a histidine residue, and it transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartic acid residue of OmpR. EnvZ can also dephosphorylate phospho-OmpR (OmpR-P) to control the cellular level of OmpR-P. At low osmolarity, OmpR-P levels are low because of either low EnvZ kinase or high EnvZ phosphatase activities. At high osmolarity, OmpR-P is elevated. It has been proposed that EnvZ phosphatase is the activity that is regulated by osmolarity. OmpR is a two-domain response regulator; phosphorylation of OmpR increases its affinity for DNA, and DNA binding stimulates phosphorylation. The step that is affected by DNA depends upon the phosphodonor employed. In the present work, we have used fluorescence anisotropy and phosphotransfer assays to examine OmpR interactions with EnvZ. Our results indicate that phosphorylation greatly reduces the affinity of OmpR for the kinase, whereas DNA does not affect their interaction. The results presented cast serious doubts on the role of the EnvZ phosphatase in response to signaling in vivo.

Our results indicate that phosphorylation greatly reduces the affinity of OmpR for the kinase, whereas DNA does not affect their interaction. The results presented cast serious doubts on the role of the EnvZ phosphatase in response to signaling in vivo. The predominant paradigm for signal transduction in prokaryotes is the two-component regulatory system (see Ref. 1.Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995Crossref Google Scholar, 2.Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar for reviews and references). The first component is a sensor kinase, often a membrane protein, which senses the appropriate environmental signal and is phosphorylated from intracellular ATP on a histidine residue. The sensor phosphokinase then transfers the phosphoryl group to an aspartic acid residue of the second component, the response regulator. Phosphorylation of the response regulator generally leads to its activation, often by increasing its affinity for DNA with a subsequent effect on transcription. In a postulated second level of regulation, it has been suggested that the sensor kinase can also stimulate dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated response regulator via a phosphatase activity, thus limiting the level of the activated regulator and resetting the system.The two-component regulatory system that governs expression of the outer membrane porins OmpF and OmpC consists of the sensor kinase EnvZ and the response regulator OmpR. Activation of EnvZ by an unknown signal, related to the osmolarity of the growth medium, leads to phosphorylation of OmpR at aspartate 55 (2–4). Phosphorylation of OmpR results in an increased affinity for the regulatory regions upstream from the ompF and ompC genes (4.Delgado J. Forst S. Harlocker S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5.Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12559-12566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that the corollary is also true, i.e. the presence of DNA increases the level of OmpR phosphorylation (9.Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of these studies, we proposed that OmpR exists as an equilibrium mixture of four distinct states (see Fig. 1): unphosphorylated OmpR (A), phosphorylated OmpR (B), unphosphorylated OmpR bound to DNA with low affinity (C), and phosphorylated OmpR bound to DNA with high affinity (D). A similar model has been proposed for the single-domain response regulator CheY, where the switch protein FliM substitutes for DNA (11.Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 16-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12.Schuster M. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6003-6008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the reaction step that is most affected by the presence of DNA depends upon the phosphodonor employed. When phosphorylating with the small molecule phosphodonor, acetyl phosphate, DNA binding dramatically stimulates the rate of phosphorylation with little effect on the dephosphorylation rate of OmpR-P. 1The abbreviations used are: OmpR-Pphosphorylated OmpREnvZ-Pphosphorylated EnvZEnvZccytoplasmic domain of EnvZHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography 1The abbreviations used are: OmpR-Pphosphorylated OmpREnvZ-Pphosphorylated EnvZEnvZccytoplasmic domain of EnvZHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography Estimates of initial rates indicate that phosphorylation by acetyl phosphate is at least 25-fold faster in the presence of DNA than in its absence (i.e. C → D is much faster than A → B, Fig. 1 and Ref. 9.Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNA binding slows dephosphorylation about 2-fold (D →C is slightly slower than B → A, Fig. 1 and Ref. 9.Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, when phosphorylating with the phosphokinase (EnvZ-P), the step most affected by DNA binding is the rate of EnvZ-stimulated OmpR-P dephosphorylation (i.e. D → C is much slower than B →A, Fig. 1 and Ref. 10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). In either case, the overall effect of DNA is to increase the net rate of OmpR-P formation on the order of 50-fold.The EnvZ kinase has the following enzymatic activities: (a) EnvZ + ATP → EnvZ-P + ADP (autophosphorylation); (b) EnvZ-P + OmpR → EnvZ + OmpR-P (phosphotransfer); and (c) EnvZ + OmpR-P → EnvZ + OmpR + Pi(phosphatase). As a result, by controlling either the phosphotransfer activity or the phosphatase activity, EnvZ can modulate the level of OmpR-P in vivo. A current model for osmoregulation proposes that at high osmolarity, the level of OmpR-P increases because of a reduction in the dephosphorylation rate catalyzed by the kinase EnvZ (13.Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated OmpR does not play a role in porin gene expression, because envZ deletion strains are effectively OmpF− OmpC− (14.Slauch J.M. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Results from the EnvZ/OmpR system have been extended to other two-component regulatory systems, leading to the conclusion that phosphatase activity of the sensor kinase is the step regulated or altered by signal input (15.Nakano M.M. Zhu Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16.Montagne M. Martel A. Le Moual H. J.

C.1996: 1359-1381Google Scholar).Along these lines, a central role for the regulation of phosphatase activity has been proposed by Jin and Inouye (13.Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Qin et al. (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that when OmpR-P binds to DNA, it is effectively made inaccessible to EnvZ, and thus DNA binding inhibits EnvZ stimulation of OmpR-P breakdown. If this explanation were correct, it would be difficult to reconcile with the proposed role of the EnvZ phosphatase activity in breaking down OmpR-P and resetting its levels in vivo (20.Russo F.D. Silhavy T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In other words, how does EnvZ dephosphorylate OmpR-P bound to DNA if the OmpR-P·DNA complex is inaccessible? In the present work, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation of OmpR dramatically reduces its interaction with EnvZ. Furthermore, the ability of EnvZ to interact with OmpR or OmpR-P is not affected by the presence of specific DNA. Our data suggest that the direct stimulation of OmpR-P breakdown by EnvZ probably does not play a role in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein PurificationOmpR was expressed and purified as previously described (6.Head C.G.

The labeled protein was purified using a series of three 5-ml desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The labeling kit is optimized for amino-terminal labeling but does not exclude the possibility of labeling at surface lysines. However, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated labeled proteins had elution profiles on C4 reverse phase HPLC that were identical to wild type OmpR. For some experiments, fluorescein-labeled OmpR was phosphorylated using 25 mmphosphoramidate in a buffer of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2. The amount of phosphorylated protein was determined to be greater than 95% by C4 reversed phase HPLC analysis as previously described (6.Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol.

For these experiments, OmpR was labeled with fluorescein at the amino terminus, and the labeled protein was separated from the free label. EnvZc was then added incrementally. Representative binding curves are shown in Fig. 2. For the curves shown in Fig. 2A, fluorescein-labeled OmpR was phosphorylated with phosphoramidate. In this particular experiment, the affinity for EnvZc binding to OmpR is 589 nm (triangles). The average Kd for EnvZc binding to OmpR from 10 independent experiments is 425 ± 127 nm. EnvZc binds to OmpR-P with such low affinity that its Kd is beyond the detection limit of the assay (circles). We were consistently unable to detect saturable binding of EnvZc to OmpR-P. Thus, phosphorylation has a dramatic effect on OmpR/EnvZ interactions, decreasing the affinity of OmpR for EnvZ by at least 10-fold.Figure 2EnvZc binding to OmpR by fluorescence anisotropy. The binding reactions contained 40 nmfluorescein-labeled OmpR. A, triangles show OmpR binding to EnvZc with a Kd of 589 nm. The average Kd for EnvZc binding to OmpR from 10 independent experiments is 425 ± 127 nm. Closed circles indicate that OmpR-P binds EnvZc with only very low affinity. This binding is unchanged in the presence of C1-C2-C3 DNA (open circles). A saturable binding curve for EnvZc binding to OmpR-P was never obtained using this approach (n = 4). B, OmpR binds to EnvZc with a Kd of 519 nm (closed triangles). In the presence of specific DNA, EnvZc still binds OmpR, with a Kd of 568 nm (open triangles). The average Kd for EnvZc binding to OmpR + C1-C2-C3 from six separate curves is 385 ± 162 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has recently been suggested that OmpR-P·DNA and OmpR-P·EnvZ interactions are mutually exclusive (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). We set out to examine this proposal directly, i.e. to determine whether DNA binding by OmpR or OmpR-P altered its affinity for the EnvZ kinase. In Fig. 2B, the dissociation constant (Kd) for EnvZc binding to OmpR is 519 nm (filled triangles); for EnvZc binding to OmpR in the presence of ompC DNA (C1-C2-C3) the Kd is 568 nm (open triangles). The average Kd for EnvZc binding to OmpR in the presence of ompC DNA from six separate curves is 385 ± 162 nm. The dissociation constants are the same, within the error margin of the assay. The presence of ompC DNA did not alter the binding of EnvZc to OmpR (Fig. 2B) or to OmpR-P (Fig. 2A, compare closed circles with open circles). Thus, although phosphorylation has a dramatic effect on the affinity of OmpR for EnvZc (Fig. 2A), the presence of specific DNA does not affect the ability of EnvZc to bind to OmpR (Fig. 2B). This result is in conflict with the recently proposed role for DNA in the OmpR/OmpR-P equilibrium mediated by EnvZ (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar).The Role of DNA in PhosphorylationWe have been studying the native linker in OmpR and its role in OmpR/DNA and OmpR/EnvZ interactions. We engineered and expressed a mutant in which the native Q linker (25.Wootton J.C. Drummond M.H. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) is replaced with a linker of equal length but substituted with glycine and lysine residues (hereafter referred to as GGK). The GGK mutant is able to activate expression of ompF but not ompC (OmpF+ OmpC−). GGK is also able to protect the ompF and ompC regulatory regions in a DNase I footprinting assay; a complete characterization of the mutant is described elsewhere. 2K. Mattison and L. J. Kenney, manuscript in preparation. In the present work, we first examined the steady-state phosphorylation of GGK by the small molecule phosphodonor, acetyl phosphate (Fig. 3). Unphosphorylated OmpR runs as a single peak on C4 reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 3A). Acetyl phosphate phosphorylates OmpR at aspartate 55, and an additional peak that corresponds to OmpR-P appears (Fig. 3B and Refs. 6.Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 9.Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As reported previously, when a 2-fold molar excess of specific DNA is included in the reaction, OmpR-P levels increase nearly 2-fold (Fig. 3C and Ref. 9.Ames S.K. Frankema N. Kenney L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The GGK mutant also elutes as a single peak on C4 reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 3D), and acetyl phosphate is similarly able to phosphorylate GGK (Fig. 3E). The addition of DNA also increases the steady-state level of phosphorylated GGK (Fig. 3F). Thus, when acetyl phosphate is used as a phosphodonor, GGK phosphorylates and responds to DNA similarly to wild type OmpR.Figure 3Phosphorylation of OmpR and GGK by acetyl phosphate. C4 reversed phase HPLC elution profiles for OmpR (A), OmpR + acetyl phosphate (B), OmpR + acetyl phosphate + C1-C2-C3 (C), GGK (D), GGK + acetyl phosphate (E), and GGK + acetyl phosphate + C1-C2-C3 (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Effect of DNA on GGK Phosphorylation by EnvZWe next determined the effect of DNA on the phosphorylation of GGK by the EnvZ kinase. EnvZ is autophosphorylated upon incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 1). When OmpR is added to the reaction, the phosphoryl group is transferred from EnvZ-P to OmpR, and OmpR-P is formed. OmpR-P breaks down, and a residual OmpR-P decays slowly between 20 and 120 min (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4). Similarly, incubation of GGK with EnvZ-P results in the formation of GGK-P (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-4). When OmpR is added to EnvZ-P in the presence of either ompF DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-7) or ompC DNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 8-10), the level of residual OmpR-P is increased compared with no addition of DNA. However, when GGK is added to the reaction in the presence of ompF or ompC DNA, a decrease in the amount of GGK-P is observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 5-10). This behavior is in striking contrast to that observed with wild type OmpR (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-10). Even though the interaction of GGK with DNA appears to be similar to wild type OmpR in stimulating phosphorylation from acetyl phosphate (Fig. 3), the interaction of GGK-P with the kinase EnvZ is dramatically altered in the presence of DNA. The decrease in the amount of GGK-P upon incubation with EnvZ-P and DNA (Fig. 4) indicates either that the kinase is less able to phosphorylate DNA-bound GGK (C →D is slow, Fig. 1) or that EnvZ rapidly dephosphorylates DNA-bound GGK-P (D → C is fast, Fig. 1).Figure 4EnvZ115 phosphorylation of OmpR and GGK. A, lane 1 shows EnvZ after autophosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP. Lanes 2–4 show OmpR-P produced 5, 20, and 60 min after the addition of OmpR to the reaction. Lanes 5–7 are identical to lanes 2–4, but the reaction contains F1-F2-F3 DNA. Lanes 8-10 are identical to lanes 2–4, but the reaction contains C1-C2-C3 DNA. B, as for A, except the assay was performed with GGK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The GGK Mutant Displays Increased Turnover in the Presence of EnvZ and DNATo distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured Pi release from GGK-P in the presence and absence of DNA and compared it to wild type OmpR (Fig. 5). If the kinase is less able to phosphorylate GGK in the presence of DNA, then Piproduction should be low. If the kinase rapidly dephosphorylates DNA-bound GGK and re-phosphorylation occurs, then a high level of Pi should be released. In the presence of EnvZ and ATP, wild type OmpR is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, and the net result is Pi release at a rate of 7.1 nmol/ml/min (closed triangles). The presence of specific DNA decreases the Pi produced by wild type OmpR to a rate of 0.4 nmol/ml/min (open triangles). In contrast, the mutant GGK phosphoprotein turns over very slowly, and Pi production is low (closed circles). Because GGK is being phosphorylated (Fig. 4) under these conditions, dephosphorylation of GGK-P must be inhibited. Surprisingly, the addition of DNA greatly enhances Pi production by the mutant protein (open circles). This stimulated rate in turnover of GGK-P in the presence of DNA approaches that observed with wild type OmpR in the absence of DNA (compare closed triangles with open circles). The rate of Pi production by GGK increases from 0.3 nmol/ml/min to 4.7 nmol/ml/min upon addition of DNA. DNA binding has the opposite effect from wild type OmpR on GGK-P dephosphorylation by EnvZ. For GGK, the D → Ctransition is faster than the B → A transition, whereas for OmpR the D → C transition is much slower than the B → A transition (Fig. 1). Furthermore, GGK-P and EnvZ must interact when GGK-P is bound to DNA because this mutant shows an increase in the rate of EnvZ-stimulated dephosphorylation upon DNA binding (Fig. 5, open circles). Our interpretation is that the presence of the altered linker sequence prevents the B → A transition (Fig. 1) required for spontaneous dephosphorylation. When the mutant protein is bound to DNA, GGK-P can transition to an EnvZ-bound form if EnvZ is present, stimulating dephosphorylation of the protein. While this result is obtained with an OmpR mutant, it emphasizes the point that OmpR binding to DNA does not remove it from solution and prevent interaction with EnvZ, as previously proposed (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5ATPase assay with OmpR and GGK. Closed triangles show the Pi released after incubation of OmpR with EnvZ and ATP. Open trianglesindicate that Pi release is slowed when DNA is included in the reaction. Closed circles indicate that GGK does not stimulate the ATPase activity of EnvZ, and open circles show that upon addition of DNA, GGK greatly stimulates Piproduction. Reactions were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. The symbol represents the mean, and error bars indicate the standard deviation of three data points obtained at each time point. The data shown are a representative experiment.

The average apparent dissociation constant for EnvZc binding to OmpR is 425 nm. When OmpR was phosphorylated using phosphoramidate (generating nearly 100% OmpR-P), we were unable to measure a Kd for EnvZc binding because the interaction was of such low affinity. This has important consequences for the hypothesis that the phosphatase activity of EnvZ plays a regulatory role and controls OmpR-P levels in vivo (see below).A previous study used native gel electrophoresis to examine the effect of DNA on the interaction of OmpR/OmpR-P and EnvZ (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). The authors concluded that OmpR-P bound to DNA was prevented from interacting with EnvZ, and this inability to interact prevents EnvZ from dephosphorylating OmpR-P. We can now interpret these results in light of our present findings. In a solution containing a mixture of OmpR and OmpR-P, OmpR has a higher affinity for EnvZ, and OmpR-P has a higher affinity for DNA. The Kd for OmpR binding to an ompC binding site, C1, is 101 nm, and the Kd for OmpR-P is 8 nm (6.Head C.G. Tardy A. Kenney L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 857-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, in the mixed population of OmpR and OmpR-P present in the previous study, OmpR interacts predominantly with EnvZ, and OmpR-P interacts predominantly with DNA (10.Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 908-913PubMed Google Scholar). Significant EnvZ/OmpR-P interactions would not be expected to occur. The dramatic decrease in affinity of OmpR-P for the EnvZ kinase demonstrated in the present work makes it unlikely that reverse phosphotransfer from OmpR-P to EnvZ is the mechanism of dephosphorylation of OmpR-P (26.Dutta R. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or that EnvZ plays a major role in dephosphorylating OmpR-P in vivo (13.Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, when the ratio of EnvZ to OmpR is adjusted to high EnvZ concentrations relative to OmpR (i.e. in vitro), EnvZ can dephosphorylate OmpR-P. It is important to note that this reaction is slow compared with the duration of the EnvZ binding assay presented here (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5).In the bacterial chemotaxis system, the phosphatase CheZ also does not appear to be important for signaling in vivo (38.Blat Y. Gillespie B. Bren A. Dahlquist F.W. Eisenbach M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deletion of cheZ, which accelerates dephosphorylation of the response regulator, CheY-P, did not alter the cellular response to the excitatory stimulus aspartate (27.Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CheY has a reduced affinity for its cognate kinase CheA upon phosphorylation. Measurements using isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrated that the affinity of CheA for CheY was 2 μm, and it was reduced 6-fold upon phosphorylation in the presence of magnesium (28.Li J. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14626-14636Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that dephosphorylation acts similarly in the chemotaxis and osmoregulatory systems. In both cases, phosphorylation of the response regulators dramatically decreases their affinity for the sensor kinases (Fig. 2A, as shown in this work and Ref. 28.Li J. Swanson R.V. Simon M.I. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14626-14636Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and dephosphorylation does not appear to be the regulated step in signaling (27.Kim C. Jackson M. Lux R. Khan S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). With an intracellular concentration of OmpR of 1 μm and EnvZ concentration on the order of 10 nm, an apparent Kd of >5 μm for EnvZ binding to OmpR-P indicat"

NAT was first identified as the enzyme responsible for the inactivation of the anti-tubercular drug isoniazid in humans. The three-dimensional structure of NAT from Salmonella typhimurium has been resolved and shown to have three distinct domains and an active site catalytic triad composed of “Cys69-His107-Asp122,” which is typical of hydrolytic enzymes such as the cysteine proteases. The crystal unit cell consists of a dimer of tetramers, with the C terminus of individual monomers juxtaposed. To investigate the function of the first two domains of full-length NAT from S. typhimurium and to investigate the role of the C terminus of NAT, truncation mutants were made with either the C-terminal undecapeptide or the entire third domain (85 amino acids) missing. Unlike the full-length NAT protein (281 amino acids), the truncation mutants of NAT from S. typhimurium are toxic when overexpressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. Full-length NAT hydrolyses Ac-CoA but only in the presence of an arylamine substrate.

Nohmi T. Ishidate Jr., M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and it was also subsequently shown to be involved in the activation of hydroxyarylamine carcinogens by O- acetylation (2.Hein, D.

Previously, kinetic studies on NAT from pigeon livers showed the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for activity (17.Riddle B. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3250-3258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Jencks W.P. Gresser M. Valenzuela M.S. Huneeus F.C. J. Biol.

It was also these studies that led to the first suggestion of a “ping-pong” mechanism involving a thio-acetyl intermediate. Recently, the structure of NAT from S. typhimurium (ST-281), which consists of 281 amino acid residues, was determined (20.Sinclair J. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The structure revealed a unique fold, which has three distinct domains (Fig. 1). The first two domains (Fig. 1a) showed similarity to the structure of proteins in the “papain” family of cysteine proteases such as staphopain (21.Graf L. Hegyi G. Liko I. Hepp J. Medzihradszky K. Craik C.S. Rutter W.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 32: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The structure of NAT illustrated the presence of a “Cys69-His107-Asp122” catalytic triad, also found in the cysteine proteases (22.Turk D. Guncar G. Podobnik M. Turk B. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The three amino acid residues of the catalytic triad are found in the first two domains of NAT from S. typhimurium (Fig. 1a) and are conserved in all members of the NAT family (20.Sinclair J. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This structural similarity of NAT to the cysteine proteases suggested that NATs and the cysteine proteases might have evolved from a common ancestor. The structure of the unit cell of crystalline NAT from S. typhimurium is a pair of tetramers with each tetramer consisting of a pair of dimers. The C termini (∼residues 270 and beyond) of the monomers in the individual dimers (Fig. 1a) are not visible in the solved structure of NAT but must be in very close proximity from the juxtaposition of the monomers in the unit cell (Fig. 1b) (23.Sandy, J., Mushtaq, A., Kawanamura, A., Sim, E., and Noble, M. (2002) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). We have investigated the function of the first two domains of full-length NAT from S. typhimurium, which corresponds to 196 amino acid residues, and the role of the C terminus of NAT, by making truncation mutants with either the C-terminal undecapeptide (AAFDTHPEAGK) or the entire third domain missing (Fig. 1). Here we report that these truncation mutants of NAT from S. typhimurium are toxic when overexpressed intracellularly in Escherichia coli. We also demonstrate that only the truncation mutants hydrolyze Ac-CoA in the absence of substrate and illustrate that the C-terminal undecapeptide is essential in modulating hydrolysis of Ac-CoA by NAT from S. typhimurium. Fragments of the gene encoding full-length S. typhimurium NAT were cloned following amplification of the regions from the open reading frame of NAT in genomic DNA from S. typhimurium (Strain L2, from Jay Hinton, IMM, Oxford). The forward primer 5′-AGTCACTCATATGACCTCTTTTTTACAT-3′ and reverse primers 5′-ATTTTGTAAGCGGCCGCTCACATTACCGCGGCCAGCTC-3′ and 5′-ATTTTGTAAGCGGCCGCTCATTGCGGCCAGTGAGCCGA-3′ were used to amplify 589- and 811-bp fragments, respectively, which encode for the first 196 amino acids (st-196) and 270 amino acids (st-270) of full-length S. typhimurium NAT (st-281). The 589- and 811-bp fragments were ligated into the vector pGEMT (Promega) and transformed into E. coli strain JM109 (Promega). The inserts were then subcloned into the expression vector pET 28b(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), immediately after the region encoding the hexa-histidine tag, using the NotI and NdeI restriction sites (shown in bold) at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The plasmids, now with open reading frames corresponding to nst-196 and nst-270, were then transfected into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Promega). The nst-196,nst-270 fragments and the open reading frame of S. typhimurium NAT, inclusive of a N-terminal hexa-histidine tag (nst-281) were further subcloned from pET28b(+), into the vector pBAD/gIII (24.Zinder, N. D., Model, P., and Boeke, J. D. (1986) U. S. Patent 416922Google Scholar) (Invitrogen Inc., Groningen, Holland) using the NcoI and XhoI sites, followed by transformation of the pBAD/gIII vectors into E. coli strain TOP 10 (Invitrogen), for propagation and expression. The sequences of the open reading frames of the final constructs were confirmed. Cultures (1 liter of LB containing chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml)) of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells containing one of the pET28b(+) constructs (encoding NST-281, NST-270, or NST-196) were grown (A600 of 0.6) at 27 °C (with 1m sorbitol (10 h)) or at 37 °C (2.5 h) and then induced with either 0.1 or 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with 2.5 mm betaine added for cultures at 27 °C. Cultures (A600 of 1 −1.2) were harvested (7,000 ×g, 4 °C, 10 min) and the pellets were each resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA at pH 8.0 containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, and 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Pentapharm Ltd., Herts, UK)) and kept on ice for 30 min followed by 3 freeze-thaw cycles between liquid nitrogen and 42 °C. After incubation (37 °C, 30 min) and centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 4 °C, 15 min), the soluble fraction was collected and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer containing Tween 20 (1% (v/v)). Cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells containing each of the pET28b(+) constructs (encoding nst-281, nst-270, or nst-196) were grown (A600 of 1) in LB (chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml)) followed by dilution between 105 and 2 × 106-fold before plating 1 ml on LB agar plates, containing 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol with or without kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and/or IPTG (1 or 0.1 mm) (25.Mierendorf R.C. Morris B.B. Hammer B. Novy R.E. Methods Mol. Med. 1998; 13: 257-292PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Pan S.-h. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1238): 1234-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After 12 h at 37 °C the number of growing colonies was counted. Cultures (1 liter of LB containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin) of the E. coli strain TOP 10 containing one of the pBAD/gIII constructs (nst-281, nst-270 or nst-196) were grown at 37 °C, with shaking, to an A600 of ∼0.5 (2–3 h) and then induced (4 h) with either 0.002% (w/v) l-arabinose (NST-281) or 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose (NST-270 and NST-196). Soluble fractions were collected as described above. Where indicated, cells were osmotically shocked with a 20% sucrose solution (24.Zinder, N. D., Model, P., and Boeke, J. D. (1986) U. S. Patent 416922Google Scholar), and the periplasmic fraction was removed by 3 cycles of centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min) and washing (10 mmTris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The remaining spheroplasts were then lysed, with lysis buffer as for the whole cells, and the soluble fraction, corresponding to the cytoplasm, was collected following centrifugation (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min). Recombinant proteins and a mock expression control (empty pBAD/gIII vector) were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (20.Sinclair J. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 27.Sinclair J. Delgoda R. Noble M. Jarmin S. Goh N. Sim E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of soluble fractions were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm or by using the Bradford assay (28.Thorne C.J.R. Tech. Life Sci. Biochem. Sect. B. 1978; 104: 1-18Google Scholar). NAT protein in insoluble fractions was quantitated following Western blotting by comparison with known amounts of soluble pure NST-281. Protein samples were denatured, reduced, and alkylated for 12% SDS-PAGE (29.Sim R.B. Sim E. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (30.Pagano M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1999; 383: 119-125Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or probed for NAT by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against pure ST-281 (11.Payton M. Mushtaq A. Yu T.W. Wu L.J. Sinclair J. Sim E. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Enzymic activities were determined (17.Riddle B. Jencks W.P. J. Biol.

All Michaelis constants, Km, and maximum rates, Vmax, were calculated using nonlinear optimization (max iterations = 200) (31.Lawson C.L. Hanson R.T. Solving Least Squares Problems.

Oguni T. in Numerical Calculation Software, Trans. Japanese. Maruzen, Tokyo1989Google Scholar) from activities measured in duplicate at a minimum of five substrate concentrations. Three different enzymic activities were determined. (A) Arylamine N-acetyl transfer activity was measured using acetyl-CoA and 4-aminoveratrole (4AV), p- anisidine (ANS), or isoniazid (INH). Reactions, containing up to 2 mm acetyl donor or acceptor, were carried out in a total volume of 200 μl (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5) at 37 °C and stopped by addition of an equal volume of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (4 °C). The loss of arylamine substrate was determined spectrophotometrically (27.Sinclair J. Delgoda R. Noble M. Jarmin S. Goh N. Sim E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34.Ward A. Summers M. Sim E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or by high performance liquid chromatography (35.Hutchings A. Monie R.D. Spragg B. Routledge P.A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 277: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (B) The enzymatic hydrolysis of Ac-CoA to CoA was determined using dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Reactions were carried out as in A except without dithiothreitol. The quantity of CoA generated was determined by measuring the absorbance, at 410 nm, of the CoA-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) conjugate as previously described (17.Riddle B. Jencks W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3250-3258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (C) Hydrolysis of p- nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) was determined by the rate of formation of p- nitrophenol at 410 nm. The enzyme solution (final volume 1 ml) contained between 50 pg and 1 μg of pure protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA at pH 7.5 with the addition of 2 mm INH as required. PNPA (final concentration up to 4 mm) was then added to the enzyme solution (pre-heated to 37 °C) to start the reaction. The final concentration of acetonitrile (used to dissolve PNPA) stock was less than 0.1% (v/v) and had no effect on enzymic activity as determined using methods A and B. All non-polar hydrogen and terminal oxygen atoms were attached and Gasteiger charges were assigned to the three-dimensional protein structure of NAT from S. typhimurium (PDB accession number1E2T) using the program SYBYL 6.5 (36.www.tripos.com. (2000) TRIPOS (SYBYL), Version 6.5Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of substrates, in MOL2 format, were created using SYBYL 6.5 and rotatable bonds and fixed rings were assigned using the program AUTOTORS (37.Morris D. Goodsell D. Huey R. Olson A. J. Comput.-aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The substrate structures were then annealed to the protein structure in silico using the AUTODOCK suite of programs (38.Morris G. Goodsell D. Halliday R. Huey R. Hart W. Belew R. Olson A. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (8853) Google Scholar). The lowest energy docking solutions were then viewed and analyzed using SPDBV (39.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). NST-270 and NST-196, which correspond to NAT from S. typhimurium containing an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag with either the C-terminal 11 amino acids or entire third domain missing, respectively (Fig. 1), were produced as recombinant proteins in E. coli. NST-270 and NST-196 were found in inclusion bodies although the level of recombinant protein was very low (<100 μg/l of culture). In contrast, NST-281, which corresponds to the full-length NAT from S. typhimurium containing an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag, is soluble and recovered in high yield (∼2 mg/liter of culture). When higher concentrations of IPTG (up to 1 mm) were used the level of expression of NST-270 and NST-196 was greater, but still the amount of soluble protein produced, was too low to be detected by Western blotting. No improvement in solubility of NST-270 and NST-196 was obtained when cultures were grown slowly (27 °C), a procedure which had previously proved successful in generating soluble recombinant proteins (10.Payton M. Auty R. Delgoda R. Everett M. Sim E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1343-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the low level of expression of the truncated proteins was due to toxicity, plasmid stability tests were carried out (25.Mierendorf R.C. Morris B.B. Hammer B. Novy R.E. Methods Mol. Med. 1998; 13: 257-292PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies of BL21(DE3)pLysS, containing the pET28b(+) vector with inserts encoding NST-270 or NST-196 were grown on LB agar plates with or without kanamycin/IPTG combinations to determine the number of colonies retaining the pET28b(+) plasmid with the different inserts (26.Pan S.-h. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1238): 1234-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40.Hutchins B. Bothones N. Peterson W. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 141: 521-528Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 41.Walker, J., and Miroux, B. (1998) United Kingdom PCT Patent W09802559Google Scholar). The ratio of the number of colonies growing on plates containing IPTG to plates containing both IPTG and kanamycin was used to determine the percentage of colonies that had lost their plasmid. Of the colonies that contained plasmids with the inserts encoding for NST-270 and NST-196, 36 and 43%, respectively, lost their plasmid in the presence of either 1 or 0.1 mm IPTG. For comparison, the same experiment with NST-281 showed that in the presence of 1 or 0.1 mm IPTG, only 10 or 4% of colonies, respectively, had lost the plasmid with the nst-281 insert. Expression in the pBAD/gIII system leads to transport of recombinant protein, prior to folding, from the cytoplasm to the periplasm by means of the gIII signal peptide, which is cleaved once the protein reaches the periplasm (24.Zinder, N. D., Model, P., and Boeke, J. D. (1986) U. S. Patent 416922Google Scholar, 42.Davis N.G. Boeke J.D. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, for NST-270, ∼50% of recombinant protein was found in the cytoplasm with the gIII signal still attached, as determined on the basis of molecular weight using Western blotting (Fig. 2b). Minor contamination from protein in the pellet could not be avoided when separating cytoplasmic and periplasmic fractions. Expression of nst-270 and nst-196, using this system, resulted in much higher levels of expression than using the pET system (Fig. 2a). The quantity of soluble truncated proteins recovered was, however, much less than for NST-281 (1 mg/liter culture) when expressed using the pBAD/gIII system under similar conditions (Fig. 2b). All three recombinant proteins could nevertheless be affinity purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates. Typically the N-terminal hexa-histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with 50 mm imidazole yielding pure protein. Unlike NST-281, the NST-196 and NST-270 proteins lost a large proportion of enzymic activity during purification and were observed to precipitate rapidly in high salt (300 mm), which is required for purification. The enzymic activity of NST-270 and NST-196 in lysates was unstable and could not be detected after 3 days at 4 °C. Therefore lysates were used for activity assays within hours of preparation. These observations were in contrast to those for NST-281, which was stable, both when stored as lysate and during purification following expression using the pBAD/gIII system. During the purification of NST-270, the higher molecular weight protein corresponding to NST-270 with the uncleaved gIII signal peptide (∼32,000) (Fig. 2b) eluted at a different concentration of imidazole (250 mm) to NST-270. This protein (NST-270 with the gIII signal sequence attached) was enzymatically inactive. All proteins were assessed for N-acetyltransferase, Ac-CoA hydrolysis, and PNPA hydrolysis activities as shown in Tables I and II. PNPA resembles an acetylated arylamine (Fig. 3).Table IKinetic parameters for acetylation of arylaminesANS4AVAc-CoA (2 mm 4AV as substrate)NST-281 Km(μm)568 ± 0.51064 ± 0.4<20 Vmax(pmol/min/mg)0.67 ± 0.012.78 ± 0.012.83 ± 0.03NST-270 Km (μm)228 ± 2.0220 ± 2.2371 ± 2.2 Vmax(pmol/min/mg)0.32 ± 0.031.64 ± 0.021.63 ± 0.04Kinetic parameters for the transfer of the acetyl group of Ac-CoA to arylamine substrates are given.

Maximum velocity values are given in picomoles per minute per mg of total soluble protein except with PNPA where picomoles per minute per mg of pure protein is used. Arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity was observed only for the NST-281 and NST-270 proteins. However, the Kmvalues for both proteins, with Ac-CoA, were too low (less than 20 μm) to be determined accurately, using the high performance liquid chromatography method employed (35.Hutchings A. Monie R.D. Spragg B. Routledge P.A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 277: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Enzymatic cleavage of Ac-CoA was observed with all three recombinant proteins in the presence of 2 mm INH. When INH was not present, only NST-270 and NST-196 hydrolyzed Ac-CoA as shown in Table II. The hydrolysis of the acetyl donor PNPA, also only occurs with NST-281 in the presence of INH. However, there are distinct differences in the pattern of hydrolysis of both Ac-CoA and PNPA (Table II), by the full-length and truncated NATs. The Michaelis constant obtained for NST-281 expressed using the pBAD/gIII system was similar to that obtained for NST-281 using the pET system in previous studies (27.Sinclair J. Delgoda R. Noble M. Jarmin S. Goh N. Sim E. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), indicating that expression in the pBAD/gIII system has not adversely affected the kinetic values. The structures of 4AV, ANS, INH, PNPA, and the acetylated forms of INH (Ac-INH) and ANS (Ac-ANS) (Fig. 3a) were docked into the structure of NAT from S. typhimurium and the lowest energy binding sites were determined in each case. The sites described are an order of magnitude lower in energy than the next best solutions. The docking, of PNPA, revealed a preferential binding pocket (site α) for the benzene ring. The aromatic ring of PNPA appeared to interact with Phe125, which is conserved in all prokaryotic NATs, by a “π-π ring stacking” interaction with a docking energy of −21.1 kJ/mol (−5.05 kcal/mol). The binding site α was almost identical in position to that for 4-bromoacetanilide (an irreversible inhibitor covalently bound to the Cys69 residue) as determined from the crystal structure of NAT from S. typhimurium with the inhibitor bound (20.Sinclair J. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b). The second series of docking studies were with substrates 4AV, ANS, and INH. These compounds bind similarly to PNPA in site α. Additionally, these substrates, but not PNPA, were also bound at a second site (β) (Fig. 3b). The interaction of the substrates at the second site appeared to be with residues Ile36, Pro37, and Phe38. These residues have previously been suggested to contribute to Ac-CoA binding (11.Payton M. Mushtaq A. Yu T.W. Wu L.J. Sinclair J. Sim E. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The docking energy for 4AV, ANS, and INH was lower at site β than at site α (Fig. 3), indicating that 4AV, ANS, and INH bind at site β in preference to site α. It would be highly unlikely for acetyl transfer to occur at site β because of the 9.1-Å distance between the terminal nitrogen of a substrate bound at site β and the sulfydryl of Cys69 (Fig. 3b). However, any substrate subsequently bound in the higher energy site α, would have its terminal nitrogen (or oxygen for PNPA) close enough to the active site Cys69 (3.0 Å) to allow transfer of an acetyl group to and from the sulfhydryl group. No significant binding sites were identified for the acetylated substrates, Ac-INH and Ac-4AV. When the truncated versions of NST-281 (NST-270 and NST-196) are generated as recombinant proteins using the pET28b(+) system there is very little protein produced compared with the production of NST-281. The pET28b(+) plasmids encoding for nst-270 and nst-196 are approximately four times more unstable, in E. coli, than the plasmid encoding for nst-281, suggesting that the NST-270 and NST-196 proteins are much more toxic than NST-281. This serves to explain why so little recombinant NST-270 and NST-196 is produced (26.Pan S.-h. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (1238): 1234-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The minimal toxicity of the NST-281 protein can be attributed to the large quantity of soluble recombinant protein being produced disrupting usual cell function (41.Walker, J., and Miroux, B. (1998) United Kingdom PCT Patent W09802559Google Scholar). The toxicity of the truncation mutants is likely to be due to an enzymic activity, rather than to accumulation of protein, as very little NST-270 or NST-196 protein was produced. An analogous situation has been observed with zymogens (such as trypsinogen), which are only toxic when expressed in bacteria, if the inactivating peptide at the N terminus is missing (43.Vasquez J.R. Evnin L.B. Higaki J.N. Craik C.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the nst-196, nst-270, and nst-281 proteins were expressed under conditions in which the recombinant proteins were excreted into the periplasmic space (24.Zinder, N. D., Model, P., and Boeke, J. D. (1986) U. S. Patent 416922Google Scholar, 42.Davis N.G. Boeke J.D. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 44.Dalbey R.E. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15925-15931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), much higher levels of expression for soluble NST-270 and NST-196 proteins (Fig. 2) were observed relative to expression using the pET system. The quantity of soluble NST-270 and NST-196 proteins produced in the periplasmic space was low relative to the production of soluble NST-281 (Fig. 2, c and d). It thus appears that the folded structure of NST-281 is more stable than the structures of NST-270 and NST-196 and suggests that the C-terminal region is essential for the stability of the complete NST-281 fold. However, the enzymic activity of the NST-270 and NST-196 proteins indicated clearly that low levels of correctly folded proteins were present. Soluble, but inactive, NST-270 (with the gIII signal still attached) was found in the cytosol and is unlikely to be folded correctly since one of the features of the gIII transport system is that folding of recombinant proteins is only completed after transport to the periplasm (24.Zinder, N. D., Model, P., and Boeke, J. D. (1986) U. S. Patent 416922Google Scholar, 42.Davis N.G. Boeke J.D. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The acetyltransferase and hydrolytic activities of the truncated versions of S. typhimurium NAT were different from those of the full-length protein. The NST-281 and NST-270 proteins catalyzed the acetyl transfer from Ac-CoA to 4AV, ANS, or INH whereas NST-196, which completely lacks the third domain, showed no such activity. The lack of acetyltransferase activity for NST-196 confirms that the third domain of NST-281 is essential for the acetylation step (19.Watanabe M. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8429-8436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has been shown previously for human NAT1 (45.Sinclair J. Sim E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and suggests a common domain structure for both NST-281 and human NAT1. The similarity of the Km values of NST-270, for the acetylation of the arylamines 4AV and ANS (200 μm), indicates that the relative affinity for these two arylamine substrates has been abolished in the shorter form of the protein. The Km values, with NST-270, for both substrates (4AV and ANS) were lower than those for NST-281 suggesting that the apparent affinity of NST-270 for the arylamine substrates is greater than the apparent affinity of NST-281 for the same substrates. In contrast, the Km value of NST-270 for Ac-CoA is over 8-fold greater than that of NST-281 (Tables I and II). The apparent affinity for Ac-CoA is much reduced on removal of the C terminus of NST-281. This suggests that the C-terminal undecapeptide plays an important role in substrate and Ac-CoA binding, possibly by occluding access to the active site of the opposing NST-281 monomer if a dimer exists in solution (Fig. 1). The dependence of the Km values, for the hydrolysis of Ac-CoA by NST-270 and NST-196, on the presence of INH (Table I) indicates that binding of Ac-CoA also requires the presence of INH. Only NST-270 and NST-196 hydrolyze Ac-CoA when there is no INH present, which serves to explain the higher toxicity of these recombinant proteins in the cytosol of E. coli. Intracellular concentrations of Ac-CoA have been measured to be of the order of 1 mm in E. coli (46.Takamura Y. Nomura G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2249-2253PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Pruess B.M. Wolfe A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 973-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and at this concentration of Ac-CoA it would be expected that the truncated proteins, NST-270 and NST-196, would compete effectively with other endogenous Ac-CoA-dependent enzymes, which are present in the cytosol of E. coli. The recombinant NST-281 protein, in contrast, would not compete in the absence of arylamine substrate. The control of hydrolysis of Ac-CoA is therefore likely to be an important function of the C terminus of NST-281, although it is still unknown how the hydrolysis of Ac-CoA, in the absence of arylamine substrate, is prevented in NST-281. The simulated docking of 4AV, ANS, and INH to NAT from S. typhimurium revealed two binding sites (α and β) for the aromatic substrates (Fig. 3b). In contrast, docking of PNPA showed it was bound only at one site corresponding to the substrate-binding site α. The lack of good binding of the acetylated substrates (AC-INH, Ac-4AV) also suggests that, once acetylated, the substrates do not remain bound to the protein. Site β is in close proximity (∼5 Å) to the putative “P-loop” which has been considered as a possible binding region for the phosphate groups of Ac-CoA in NAT from S. typhimurium (20.Sinclair J. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) suggesting that site β, rather than site α, may be involved in Ac-CoA binding. The mode of interaction between NST-281 and Ac-CoA is unclear, although a very strong “ring stacking” interaction between an aromatic moiety and the adenosine ring of Ac-CoA has previously been demonstrated in solution (48.Ueyama M. Tori K. Ikehara M. Kaneko M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 49.Mieyal J.J. Webster Jr., L.T. Siddiqui U.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2633-2640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the arylamine substrate initially binds in site β to form a new Ac-CoA-binding site in which the aromatic ring of the substrate can “ring stack” with the adenosine ring in Ac-CoA. This would serve to explain the lack of hydrolysis in the absence of INH for NST-281 and would also explain the lower Km values for the hydrolysis of Ac-CoA by NST-270 and NST-196 in the presence of INH, although it is clear that the C-terminal undecapeptide must also play a role in regulation of the binding of Ac-CoA. It is therefore proposed that the NAT protein must initially bind arylamine substrate (at site β) to initiate a conformational change, which allows the subsequent binding of Ac-CoA and the acetylation of the active site cysteine. Subsequent acetyl transfer can then occur from the acetylated-protein intermediate to the substrate (now bound at site α). In conclusion, the C terminus of NAT from S. typhimurium regulates the binding of Ac-CoA in the absence of substrate such that there is control over hydrolysis of Ac-CoA. It is also possible that the first two domains of NAT from S. typhimurium and the corresponding domains of the cysteine proteases have evolved from a common ancestor with the third domain of NAT from S. typhimurium acting to regulate the hydrolytic function of the NAT protein.

Enzyme-bound receptors are subsequently transported to acidified, prelysosomal compartments where the low pH (<6) environment induces release of the enzymes from the receptors. Following enzyme release, the MPRs recycle back to the Golgi to repeat this process or move to the cell surface where the IGF-II/MPR, but not the CD-MPR, binds and internalizes extracellular ligands (1.Kornfeld S.

The ability of the IGF-II/MPR to recognize with high affinity the Man-6-P signal found on many functionally distinct ligands underscores the importance of the IGF-II/MPR and its involvement in a myriad of essential physiological pathways. The IGF-II/MPR is an ∼300-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of an N-terminal signal sequence, a large extracytoplasmic region composed of 15 homologous repeating domains, a single transmembrane region, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1) (24.Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ∼46-kDa CD-MPR is a much smaller type I transmembrane glycoprotein that in some species requires divalent cations for optimal ligand binding (25.Dahms N.M. Lobel P. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M.

Significantly, each of the 15 IGF-II/MPR extracytoplasmic domains displays amino acid sequence identity (14–38%), similar size (∼147 residues), and cysteine distribution to each other and to the single, extracytoplasmic domain of the CD-MPR, giving rise to the prediction that they exhibit similar disulfide bonding and tertiary structures (24.Lobel P.

The IGF-II/MPR, unlike the CD-MPR, also binds with high affinity to the nonglycosylated peptide hormone, IGF-II, at a binding site localized to extracytoplasmic domain 11 (Fig. 1) (31.Morgan D.O.

In contrast to the CD-MPR, little is known about the amino acid residues involved in carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR. Previous biochemical studies (30.Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D.

However, the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the extracytoplasmic region of the bovine CD-MPR complexed with Man-6-P (34.Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J. P.

Consequently, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate single amino acid substitutions in soluble, truncated forms of the IGFII/MPR in order to test the hypothesis that residues of IGF-II/MPR extracytoplasmic domains 3 and 9 predicted by a structure-based sequence alignment with the CD-MPR to be in the N- and C-terminal Man-6-P-binding pockets of the IGF-II/MPR, respectively, are essential for high affinity Man-6-P binding. By using pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography, four amino acid residues (Gln-392, Ser-431, Glu-460, and Tyr-465) in domain 3 and four residues (Gln-1292, His-1329, Glu-1354, and Tyr-1360) in domain 9 were identified as essential for carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR in addition to the previously determined Arg-435 (domain 3) and Arg-1334 (domain 9) residues. To assess quantitatively the relative contribution of each of the residues essential to the Man-6-P binding ability of the IGF-II/MPR, binding affinity studies of the mutant constructs for the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, were performed. Together these results provide strong evidence that the two IGF-II/MPR Man-6-P-binding sites utilize a mechanism similar to that of the CD-MPR for high affinity Man-6-P binding and that the N- and C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domains of the IGF-II/MPR are structurally similar to each other and to the CD-MPR.

Single amino acid substitutions of residues predicted to form the N- or C-terminal IGF-II/MPR Man-6-P-binding sites were generated according to the method of Kunkel et al. (36.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar).

A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to generate the Dom7–11His construct by the addition of 6 histidine residues (CAC) and a stop codon (TGA) following the C-terminal residue, Glu-1656, of the wild-type Dom7–11 cDNA construct. The oligonucleotide primer used was the reverse complement of the following: 5′-TGGCACACACCCCTGGCCTGCGAGCACCACCACCACCACCACTGAATTCTAGACCGG-3′. Each of the predicted sequences was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using an Amersham Biosciences ALF DNA sequencer. COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described previously (37.Olson L.J. Hancock M.K. Dix D. Kim J.-J. P. Dahms N.M. J. Biol.

At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine for an additional 24 h. The medium was harvested and dialyzed, and the COS-1 cells were solubilized as detailed previously (37.Olson L.J. Hancock M.K. Dix D. Kim J.-J. P. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36905-36911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To assay the constructs for ligand binding ability, dialyzed medium containing the secreted wild-type or mutant receptors was subjected to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (37.Olson L.J.

Subsequently, the affinity chromatography samples were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antisera specific for the bovine IGF-II/MPR plus protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 16–24 h as described (37.Olson L.J.

To determine the percentage of each construct that was secreted into the medium, equal aliquots of cell lysates and dialyzed media were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 860) and ImageQuant (version 4.1) software. To prepare Dom1–3His and Dom7–9His receptors for binding affinity studies, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran technique (30.Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with pcDNA3 vectors containing the wild-type or mutant Dom1–3His or Dom7–9His cDNAs. Forty eight hours after transfection the cells were rinsed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) and incubated for 24 h in Waymouth's MB 752/1 serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The medium was harvested and dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 8 mm imidazole (binding buffer). Batch binding of the His6-tagged receptors was performed by adding glycerol (10% final concentration), Nonidet P-40 (0.1% final concentration), and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA, Qiagen) agarose (∼200 μl resin/50 ml of medium) to the dialyzed medium and incubating at 4 °C for 16–24 h. The Ni-NTA-agarose was transferred to a column and washed extensively with binding buffer and then eluted with binding buffer containing 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Aliquots of each Ni-NTA eluate were subjected to the Bio-Rad (Bradford) protein assay using bovine serum albumin standards to determine the approximate amount of each Dom1–3His or Dom7–9His protein obtained. An average yield of 11 μg of protein was purified from the medium of each transfected 150-cm2 cell culture flask. The relative amounts of Dom1–3His or Dom7–9His proteins obtained was confirmed by performing Western blot analysis as detailed previously (33.Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using bovine IGF-II/MPR-specific antiserum and protein A/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) or ImmunoPure goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) followed by detection using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). 125I-Labeled (1–2 μCi/μg) human β-glucuronidase was prepared and used to perform binding affinity analyses as described previously (38.Marron-Terada P.G. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Dahms N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22358-22366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of iodinated β-glucuronidase were incubated with purified wild-type or mutant Dom1–3His or Dom7–9His, and the receptors and bound ligand were immunoprecipitated with bovine IGF-II/MPR-specific antiserum prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed, and bound β-glucuronidase was specifically eluted from the receptors by incubation with 10 mm Man-6-P. The results were analyzed by nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot version 5.05, SPSS Science). A structure-based sequence alignment of the extracytoplasmic region of the CD-MPR with domains 3 and 9 of the IGF-II/MPR and molecular modeling identified several residues in domain 3 (Tyr-368, Gln-392, Ser-430, Ser-431, Arg-435, Thr-458, Glu-460, and Tyr-465) and domain 9 (Tyr-1264, Gln-1292, His-1329, Arg-1334, Leu-1352, Glu-1354, and Tyr-1360) that are located at positions equivalent to CD-MPR residues that serve as potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors with Man-6-P (Fig. 2A) (34.Roberts D.L. Weix D.J. Dahms N.M. Kim J.-J. P. Cell. 1998; 93: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We predicted that these residues are important for Man-6-P recognition by the IGF-II/MPR. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate single amino acid substitutions in cDNA constructs encoding either the N- (Dom1–3His) or the C-terminal (Dom7–9His or Dom7–11) Man-6-P-binding site of the IGF-II/MPR (Figs. 1 and 2B). The wild-type Dom1–3His, Dom7–9His, and Dom7–11 constructs were demonstrated previously (33.Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to bind the lysosomal enzyme, β-glucuronidase, with affinities similar to that of the full-length wild-type receptor. In addition, the wild-type Dom7–11 construct was shown to contain a functional IGF-II-binding site (domain 11, Fig. 1), providing additional evidence that this recombinant protein is folded into its native state (33.Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two criteria were used to select the single amino acid substitutions that were generated. First, substitutions were selected that would eliminate or significantly perturb hydrogen bonding potential. Second, only amino acid substitutions considered “safe” according to the exchange matrices of Bordo and Argos (39.Bordo D. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) were selected to reduce the possibility of disrupting the structural integrity of the IGF-II/MPR constructs. In summary, 20 different point mutations were generated to identify and characterize the role of residues predicted to be important for carbohydrate recognition by the two distinct Man-6-P-binding sites of the IGF-II/MPR (Fig. 2B). The use of truncated IGF-II/MPR constructs allows us to study separately the two IGF-II/MPR Man-6-P-binding sites. In addition, since Dom1–3His, Dom7–9His, and Dom7–11 receptors lack the transmembrane region of the IGF-II/MPR, these soluble recombinant proteins are secreted into the medium, facilitating their efficient separation from endogenous MPRs when expressed in mammalian cells. Furthermore, previous studies in our laboratory (30.Dahms N.M. Rose P.A. Molkentin J.D. Zhang Y. Brzycki M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5457-5463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that secreted MPRs are folded into a conformation conducive to ligand binding, whereas misfolded MPRs are retained in the cells. Thus, the efficiency of secretion of each IGF-II/MPR construct provides an indirect assessment of correct folding. Consequently, the wild-type and mutant Dom1–3His, Dom7–9His, and Dom7–11 constructs were expressed in transiently transfected COS-1 cells, and the efficiency of secretion of each construct was assayed (data not shown). With the exception of the Q1292N Dom7–9His mutant (no detectable secretion) and the Q1292N (secretion efficiency ∼29%) and L1352A (secretion efficiency ∼14%) Dom7–11 mutants, all of the IGF-II/MPR mutants were efficiently secreted (i.e. >50% of the total receptor secreted at steady state). To identify residues important for carbohydrate recognition by the IGF-II/MPR COS-1 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant Dom1–3His or Dom7–11 constructs. Subsequently, the cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine, and the medium containing the secreted receptors was harvested and subjected to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity chromatography. Wild-type Dom1–3His (∼70% Man-6-P binding) and wild-type Dom7–11 (∼66% Man-6-P binding) exhibited similar specific binding to pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity columns (Fig. 3). In contrast, specific binding to the affinity columns was eliminated when single amino acid substitutions were made of Gln-392, Ser-431, Glu-460, or Tyr-465 in domain 3 or of Gln-1292, His-1329, Glu-1354, or Tyr-1360 in domain 9. Although substitution of Leu-1352 with alanine also eliminated the Man-6-P binding ability of Doms7–11, this mutant construct was poorly secreted (secretion efficiency ∼14%) from COS-1 cells, suggesting that this mutation disrupts folding instead of having a specific effect on binding. This prediction is supported by the results obtained with the L1352V mutant, which is efficiently secreted (secretion efficiency ∼57%) and retains Man-6-P binding ability. Binding to pentamannosyl phosphate affinity columns was also retained when Thr-458 in domain 3 was replaced, whereas substitutions of Tyr-368 or Ser-430 in domain 3 or Tyr-1264 in domain 9 resulted in only a partial inhibitory effect on Man-6-P binding. In summary, these studies identified four residues (Gln-392, Ser-431, Glu-460, and Tyr-465) in domain 3 and four residues (Gln-1292, His-1329, Glu-1354, and Tyr-1360) in domain 9 as essential for Man-6-P recognition by the IGF-II/MPR (Fig. 3) in addition to the previously identified Arg-435 (domain 3) and Arg-1334 (domain 9) residues (30.Dahms N.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In preparation for binding affinity studies, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose affinity chromatography was used to purify wild-type and selected Dom1–3His mutants that exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (Y368F) or a complete elimination (Q392N, S431A, E460D, and Y465F) of Man-6-P binding ability. Unlike the Dom1–3His construct, the Dom7–11 construct used to identify essential Man-6-P-binding site residues in domain 9 of the IGF-II/MPR does not contain a His6 tag. Consequently, a Dom7–11His construct was generated by adding a tag of six histidine residues to the C terminus of the wild-type Dom7–11 construct. Surprisingly, the Dom7–11His construct was retained within transien"

Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-β1 rapidly resulted in down-regulation of cytosolic IκBα and hyaluronidase prevented this effect, suggesting a possible role of IκBα in the growth regulation. Ectopic expression of wild-type and dominant negative IκBα prevented TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression. Nonetheless, the blocking effect of IκBα is not related to regulation of NF-κB function by its N-terminal ankyrin-repeat region (amino acids 1–243). Removal of the PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain-containing C terminus (amino acids 244–314) abolished the IκBα function, and the C terminus alone blocked the TGF-β1 growth-inhibitory effect. Co-immunoprecipitation by anti-p53 antibody using Mv1Lu and other types of cells, as well as rat liver and spleen, revealed that a portion of cytosolic IκBα physically interacted with p53. In contrast, Mdm2, an inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable in the immunoprecipitates. The cytosolic p53·IκBα complex rapidly dissociated in response to apoptotic stress, etoposide- and UV-mediated DNA damage, hypoxia, and TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression. Also, a rapid increase in the formation of the nuclear p53·IκBα complex was observed during exposure to etoposide and UV. In contrast, TGF-β1-mediated promotion of fibroblast growth failed to mediate p53·IκBα dissociation. Mapping by yeast two-hybrid showed that the non-ankyrin C terminus of IκBα physically interacted with the proline-rich region and a phosphorylation site, serine 46, in p53. Deletion of serine 46 or alteration of serine 46 to glycine abolished the p53·IκBα interaction. Alteration to threonine retained the binding interaction, suggesting that serine 46 phosphorylation is involved in the p53·IκBα complex formation. Functionally, enhancement of p53 apoptosis was observed when p53 and IκBα were transiently co-expressed in cells.

TGF-β promotes the growth of fibroblasts and other cell types, whereas it inhibits epithelial cell growth and induces apoptosis of hepatocytes and various cancer cells. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. TGF-β signaling involves binding of TGF-β to the type II receptor, followed by recruiting the type I receptor, then inducing phosphorylation and hetero-dimerization of Smad2 and 3, and binding of Smad4 to the Smad2/3 complex. The Smad2/3/4 protein complex migrates to the nucleus and regulates the transcription of target genes (1Ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 64-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Cross-talk of the TGF-β/Smad pathway with other cellular signaling pathways has been demonstrated (5Zhang Y. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 274-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For example, the Smad2/3/4 protein complex may recruit c-Jun, ATF-2, CBP/p300, and STAT3 in the transcriptional regulation of a target gene (2Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). These recruited proteins are also transducers of the stress and STAT signaling pathways, respectively. NF-κB p65 regulates Smad7 promoter activity (6Nagarajan R.P. Chen F. Li W. Vig E. Harrington M.A. Nakshatri H. Chen Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Smad7 is an inhibitor of the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β activates Ras and three members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily in epithelial cells (7Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, TGF-β-mediated activation of p44/42 MAPK (ERK) pathway is due to autocrine secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor in fibroblasts (8Finlay G.A. Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L.

TGF-β1 and its induced matrix protein(s) protect L929 fibroblasts from killing by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (9Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 suppresses the proliferation of mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells and hyaluronidase inhibits the suppression (12Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, it is demonstrated that TGF-β1 rapidly down-regulated IκBα expression in Mv1Lu cells and hyaluronidase abolished the down-regulation, suggesting that IκBα participates in the TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression. Ectopic expression of IκBα blocked TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression of Mv1Lu cells, and the non-ankyrin C terminus of IκBα was found to contribute to this regulatory activity. This region of IκBα contains an acidic PEST (proline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine) domain and fails to inhibit NF-κB function (14Simeonidis S. Stauber D. Chen G. Hendrickson W.A. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Notably, a portion of cytosolic IκBα was found to interact with p53 in Mv1Lu and other unstimulated resting cells, as well as rat liver and spleen. Dissociation of the p53·IκBα complex occurred in response to growth suppression by TGF-β1, apoptotic stress, hypoxia, DNA damage, and UV radiation. The dissociation allows p53 nuclear translocation. In contrast, TGF-β1-mediated promotion of fibroblast growth failed to mediate p53·IκBα dissociation. Enhancement of p53 apoptosis was observed when various cells were co-transfected with p53 and IκBα expression constructs. This study suggests that IκBα regulates cytosolic p53 function in resting cells and participates in p53-mediated apoptosis in response to various stresses. The structural basis of the p53·IκBα binding interaction was analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid system, and functional significance of this binding interaction was discussed. Mink lung Mv1Lu epithelial cells, human Molt-4 T cells, human prostate Du145 cells, monkey kidney Cos7 fibroblasts, and murine L929 fibroblasts were from American Type Culture Collections (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured according to provider's instructions.

The extent of cell proliferation was determined by both crystal violet staining and the MTS proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments were performed using L929 fibroblasts. A murine full-length IκBα cDNA was found in the universal EST data base (GenBankTM accessionAA606238) and the clone was obtained from the Incyte Genosystems (St. Louis, MO). Three expression constructs were made with the pEGFP-C1 vector (cloning site, EcoRI; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA): (i) IκBα, the entire coding region (amino acids 1–314); (ii) IκBα243N, the N-terminal surface-exposed and the ankyrin region (amino acids 1–243); (iii) IκBα243C, the C-terminal acidic PEST domain region (amino acids 244–314) (see Fig. 3). Additionally, these IκBα cDNAs were constructed with the pSos vector (cloning site, Mlu1; Stratagene, San Diego, CA) for yeast two-hybrid experiments as described below. Wild-type p53 cDNA (18Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol.

Also, p53 was tagged with an N-terminal FLAG epitope using pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen).

Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A dominant negative IκBα construct was made by altering Ser-32 to Arg-32 and Ser-36 to Ala-36 (19Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) using the following primers: forward, 5′-CGCCACGACAGAGGCCTGGACGCCATGAAGGA; reverse, 5′-TCCTTCATGGCGTCCAGGCCTCTGTCGTGGCG. Mv1Lu cells (3 million cells in 500 μl of serum-free minimal essential medium) were electroporated in duplicates with 20 μg of the above expression constructs (200 V and 50 ms using the BTX ECM 630 electroporator, Genetronics, San Diego, CA). The cells were then seeded onto 30-mm Petri dishes, grown overnight, and exposed to TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 48 h. The cells were then stained with crystal violet to determine the extent of cell growth as well as growth inhibition by TGF-β1. In other experiments, Mv1Lu and other types of cells were co-transfected with p53-DsRed and the full-length IκBα or IκBα243C (in pEGFP-C1) by electroporation. The cells were cultured for 48 h, and the extent of p53-mediated cell death was examined by crystal violet staining. To determine whether p53 physically interacts with IκBα in vivo, we utilized the CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system (Stratagene) as previously described (18Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Binding of a cytosolic Sos-tagged bait protein to a cell membrane-anchored target protein (tagged with a myristoylation signal) results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway in yeast. This binding interaction allows mutant yeast cdc25H to grow in 37 °C using a selective agarose plate containing galactose. Without binding, yeast cells fail to grow at 37 °C. The above-indicated IκBα constructs were used as baits (in pSos vector; see Table I for synthetic primers). The following p53 target constructs were made as previously described (18Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar): (i) a full-length p53, (ii) a partial N-terminal p53 (amino acids 1–100), and (iii) the proline-rich (or growth regulatory) region of p53 (amino acids 66–100). Additionally, a p53 construct without the proline-rich region was made (in pMyr vector). The original proline-rich region-deleted p53 construct (20Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Levine A.J. Haupt Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3785-3790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. U. Moll of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Dr. A. J. Levine of the Rockefeller University. Self-interaction between pSos-MafB and pMyr-MafB as well as pMyr-p53 and pSos-WOX1 (WW domain oxidoreductase) (18Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) were tested as positive controls. Vector combinations for negative binding interactions were empty pSos versus empty pMyr and pSos-Lamin Cversus pMyr-p53. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (18Chang N.-S. Pratt N. Heath J. Schultz L. Sleve D. Carey G.B. Zevotek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3361-3370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Both cytosolic and nuclear proteins from Mv1Lu, L929, and other types of cells were extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Endogenous p53 was precipitated by antibodies against p53 and protein A-agarose (Pierce), separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected in Western blotting. Co-precipitation of IκBα with p53 was determined using anti-IκBα antibody in duplicate precipitation experiments. In additional experiments, FLAG-tagged p53 (in pcDNA3.1) was expressed in cells and precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) from the cell lysates. The presence of FLAG-p53 and the co-precipitated endogenous IκBα was determined by antibodies against p53 and IκBα, respectively, in Western blotting. Where indicated, agarose bead-conjugated anti-p53 IgG was used in immunoprecipitation experiments. The immobilized anti-p53 IgG was less effective in binding to antigen than the solution-phase anti-p53 IgG. Additionally, liver extracts from male Wistar rats were prepared by an ultrasonication-based Tissumizer (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH), using a lysis buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (11Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7765-7772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cytosolic lysate (∼5 mg) was incubated with agarose beads covalently conjugated with anti-IκBα IgG or anti-p53 IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated at 4 °C for 4 h. Co-precipitation of IκBα and p53 was then determined in Western blotting. Where indicated, Mv1Lu cells were cultured on coverslips overnight and co-transfected with IκBα-pEGFP-C1 and p53-DsRed constructs by FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), a liposome-based reagent. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed with 3.3% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and stained with the nuclear dye DAPI. (Calbiochem). The cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy. L929 and other indicated cells were treated with staurosporine (1 μm) for 1 h to induce apoptosis, followed by preparation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions from the cells and immunoprecipitation using anti-p53 IgG beads (or anti-p53 IgG and protein A-agarose beads). Similarly, the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions in the presence of deferoxamine (100 μm) for 16 h prior to processing cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. Also, cells were treated with etoposide (50 μg/ml) or exposed to UV light (120 mj/cm2; using a UV cross-linker from Fisher Scientific). One hour later, the cells were subjected to lysis and co-immunoprecipitation. Where indicated, fresh spleen cells were isolated from the spleens of sacrificed male Wistar rats and treated similarly as above. TGF-β1 inhibits the proliferation of Mv1Lu epithelial cells (13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of Mv1Lu cells to TGF-β1 for 48 h resulted in growth inhibition by ∼40% (Fig.1 A). We have shown that bovine testicular hyaluronidase counteracts TGF-β1-mediated protection of TNF-α cytotoxicity in L929 and LNCaP prostate cells (13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous observations (13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of Mv1Lu cells with hyaluronidase resulted in increased cell proliferation and reduction of TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). TNF-α antagonizes various functions of TGF-β1 (9Chang N.-S. Mattison J. Cao H. Pratt N. Zhao Y. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 11Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7765-7772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TGF-β1 protects L929 fibroblasts from TNF-mediated cell death (11Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7765-7772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether TNF-α blocked the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 in Mv1Lu cell growth was determined. The results showed that TNF-α failed to prevent TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition (Fig.1 B). Indeed, both TNF-α and TGF-β1 suppressed the proliferation of Mv1Lu cells in an additive manner (Fig.1 B). To determine the mechanisms for the functional antagonism between TGF-β1 and hyaluronidase, Mv1Lu cells were treated with TGF-β1 for various indicated times, followed by determining the expression of p65 NF-κB and IκBα by Western blotting. TGF-β1 rapidly down-regulated the expression of cytosolic IκBα in 30 min, whereas it had no effect on p65 NF-κB (Fig.2 A). Notably, pretreatment of Mv1Lu cells with hyaluronidase for 1 h, followed by exposure to TGF-β1, prevented the down-regulation of IκBα (Fig.2 A). These results suggest that suppression of IκBα expression is necessary for TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression of Mv1Lu cells. Either TGF-β1 or hyaluronidase increases L929 cell growth by 10–30% in 48 h (11Chang N.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7765-7772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Chang N.-S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1987-C1994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no significant enhancement of cell growth (0 ± 10%) was observed when L929 cells were exposed to both proteins. In control experiments, L929 fibroblasts were pretreated with hyaluronidase for 1 h and then exposed to TGF-β1 for various indicated times. The cytosolic level of IκBα was not affected by TGF-β1 or by TGF-β1 and hyaluronidase in combination (Fig. 2 B). TGF-β1 reduced the cytosolic level of p65 NF-κB in a time-related manner (Fig. 2 B). Hyaluronidase-pretreated cells had a reduced level of cytosolic p65 NF-κB, whereas TGF-β1 restored the NF-κB level (Fig.2 B). To determine whether IκBα is involved in the TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression, Mv1Lu cells were electroporated with the control GFP or the GFP-IκBα construct. Following overnight culturing, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 48 h. TGF-β1 mediated 37.7% of the growth inhibition of GFP-expressing cells, whereas IκBα reduced the growth inhibition down to 10.7% (Fig. 3). Dominant negative IκBα also reduced the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 to 2.3% (Fig. 3). The dominant negative IκBα could not undergo phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, thereby effectively preventing activation of NF-κB (19Traenckner E.B. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, blocking of TGF-β1-mediated growth inhibition is not related with IκBα regulation of NF-κB function. The inhibitory effect of IκBα on TGF-β1 was abolished by removing its non-ankyrin C terminus. That is, ectopic expression of IκBα243N, the N-terminal ankyrin-rich or NF-κB-interacting region (amino acids 1–243) (14Simeonidis S. Stauber D. Chen G. Hendrickson W.A. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), in Mv1Lu cells failed to block the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 (52.8% growth inhibition) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the non-ankyrin C terminus, IκBα243C (amino acids 244–314), abolished the TGF-β1 effect (−2.0% growth inhibition) (Fig. 3). p53 is involved in the TGF-β1-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis (21Blaydes J.P. Schlumberger M. Wynford-Thomas D. Wyllie F.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar, 22Landesman Y. Bringold F. Milne D.D. Meek D.W.

Cell Res. 2000; 259: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The possible binding interaction between p53 and IκBαin vivo was examined. Immunoprecipitation of both cytosolic and nuclear p53 from Mv1Lu cells was performed using anti-p53 IgG antibody (against wild-type p53). Endogenous p53 was found in both cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 4 A). IκBα was co-precipitated with p53 in the cytosol but not in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). The p53·IκBα interaction could not be abolished by treatment of cells with EDTA (5 mm), indicating that the binding is calcium-independent. Similarly, transient overexpression of FLAG-tagged p53 in L929 cells, followed by overnight culturing and processing immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG IgG, resulted in the presence of FLAG-p53 in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 4 B). Endogenous IκBα was co-precipitated with FLAG-p53 in the cytosol but not in the nucleus (Fig. 4 B). When rat liver cytosolic extract was incubated with immobilized anti-IκBα IgG beads, p53 was found in the precipitate of IκBα (Fig. 4 C), again indicating that a portion of cytosolic p53 physically interacts with IκBα in vivo. Similarly, precipitation of p53 using anti-p53 antibody also resulted in the co-presence of p53 and IκBα in the precipitate using the rat liver cytosolic extract (Fig. 4 C). In negative controls, when the above antibodies were heat-inactivated (75 °C for 30 min) and used for immunoprecipitation, no precipitated target proteins were found (data not shown). In parallel with the above observations, co-transfection of Mv1Lu cells with p53-DsRed and IκBα-pEGFP-C1 constructs was performed. The cells were cultured overnight and then examined under fluorescence microscopy. Both the expressed p53-DsRed and GFP-IκBα were co-localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 D). To further elucidate the functional significance of p53·IκBα binding in vivo, various cell lines were treated with TGF-β1, TNF, staurosporine, and deferoxamine, then the dissociation of p53·IκBα complex in the cytoplasm and nucleus was examined. Exposure of L929 cells to TNF-α resulted in IκBα degradation (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the TNF-dependent IκBα degradation was abolished in an established L929 cell line stably expressing GFP (Fig. 5 A). This cell line is suitable for examining TNF-mediated p53·IκBα complex formation and dissociation. The abundance of cytosolic IκBα was greater than that of p53 (Fig. 5 A; seePre-IP). Mdm2, a known inhibitor of p53, was barely detectable (Fig. 5 A). Indeed, p53 level is normally low in unstimulated resting cells (Ref. 25Chang N.-S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 19-24PubMed Google Scholar, review). Precipitation of p53 with anti-p53 IgG beads showed the presence of cytosolic p53 and IκBα in the precipitate, and TNF mediated p53·IκBα dissociation (Fig.5 A). Mdm2 was barely detectable (Fig. 5 A). The results indicate that the cytosolic p53 complexes with IκBα, rather than with Mdm2, in unstimulated L929 cells. Also, only a small portion of cytosolic IκBα physically interacts with p53. Similarly, staurosporine-medi"

The three-dimensional structures of a binary complex with the inhibitor 5-iodouracil and two ternary complexes with NADPH and the inhibitors 5-iodouracil and uracil-4-acetic acid were determined by x-ray crystallography. In the ternary complexes, NADPH is bound in a catalytically competent fashion, with the nicotinamide ring in a position suitable for hydride transfer to FAD. The structures provide a complete picture of the electron transfer chain from NADPH to the substrate, 5-iodouracil, spanning a distance of 56 Å and involving FAD, four [Fe-S] clusters, and FMN as cofactors. The crystallographic analysis further reveals that pyrimidine binding triggers a conformational change of a flexible active-site loop in the α/β-barrel domain, resulting in placement of a catalytically crucial cysteine close to the bound substrate. Loop closure requires physiological pH, which is also necessary for correct binding of NADPH. Binding of the voluminous competitive inhibitor uracil-4-acetic acid prevents loop closure due to steric hindrance. The three-dimensional structure of the ternary complex enzyme-NADPH-5-iodouracil supports the proposal that this compound acts as a mechanism-based inhibitor, covalently modifying the active-site residue Cys-671, resulting in S-(hexahydro-2,4-dioxo-5-pyrimidinyl)cysteine.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 8: 629-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In mammals, this is the only pathway leading to the synthesis of the putative neurotransmitter β-alanine (2.Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The human enzyme has recently evolved as an adjunct target for anticancer drug design because it also degrades 5-fluorouracil (5FU), one of the most widely prescribed chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of many common malignancies (3.Milano G. Etienne M.-C. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 2295-2297PubMed Google Scholar). 5FU primarily targets the enzyme thymidylate synthase and thereby interferes with DNA synthesis (4.Papamichael D. Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Approximately 85% of the administered dose is rapidly degraded by DPD to therapeutically inactive but toxic fluorinated products (5.Woodcock T.M. Martin D.S. Damin L.E.M. Cancer. 1980; 45: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Heggie G.D. Sommadossi J.-P. Cross D.S. Huster W.J. Diasio R.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2203-2206PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, accurate determination of an optimal drug dose proved to be very difficult due to substantial differences in the activity of DPD among individuals (7.Lu Z.H. Zhang R. Diasio R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5433-5438PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Tuchman M. Stoeckeler J.S. Kiang D.T. O'Dea R.F. Ramnaraine M.L. Mirkin B.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Severe life-threatening toxicities have been reported after treatment of cancer patients with inherited DPD deficiency with standard doses of 5FU (9.Shehata N. Pater A. Tang S.-C. Cancer Invest. 1999; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10.Van Kuilenburg A.B.P. Haasjes J. Richel D.J. Zoetekouw L. Van Lenthe H. De Abreu R.A. Maring J.G. Vreken P.

The catabolism of 5FU via DPD and the other two enzymes of the pyrimidine degradation pathway thus represents a major determinant of the pharmacokinetics of this anticancer drug. Its inhibition may result in increased 5FU efficacy, administration of lower doses, and diminished drug side effects. To date, several DPD inhibitors (eniluracil, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and 3-cyano-2,6-dihydropyridine) are utilized or under evaluation as modulators of 5FU treatment (12.de Bono J.S. Twelves C.J. Invest. New Drugs. 2001; 19: 41-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The high sequence identities (>90%) between human (13.Yokota H. Fernandez-Salguero P. Furuya H. Lin K.

Johnson M.R. Diasio R.B. DNA Sequence. 1996; 6: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and pig (13.Yokota H. Fernandez-Salguero P. Furuya H. Lin K. McBride O.W. Podschun B. Schnackerz K.D. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23192-23196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggest very similar reaction mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. Recently, the x-ray structure of the best-characterized mammalian enzyme, recombinant pig liver DPD, has been determined to a resolution of 1.9 Å (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a homodimer of 2 × 111 kDa. Each subunit of 1025 amino acids carries one FAD, one FMN, and four [4Fe-4S] clusters (16.Rosenbaum K. Jahnke K. Curti B. Hagen W.R. Schnackerz K.D. Vanoni M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17598-17609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). According to the non-classical two-site ping-pong kinetic mechanism, the enzyme contains separate binding sites for the electron-donating cosubstrate NADPH and the electron-accepting pyrimidines, respectively (17.Podschun B. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12966-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters suggests the following reaction mechanism for the reduction of uracil/thymine by pig liver DPD (17.Podschun B. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12966-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH binds to site 1 with the pro-S side of the nicotinamide facing toward the FAD-isoalloxazine ring. Hydride is transferred from the C-4 of NADPH to N-5 of FAD, leaving NADP+ and FADH − . There is evidence from kinetic isotope effects that electron transfer to site 2 via the [4Fe-4S] clusters does not occur until NADP+ is released. At site 2 reduced FMN is formed. The pyrimidine substrate is bound with the si-face at the C-6 atom directed toward the N-5 of FMN and with the si-face of C-5 directed toward an enzyme general acid, which has been identified as the thiol group of cysteine 671 (16.Rosenbaum K. Jahnke K. Curti B. Hagen W.R. Schnackerz K.D. Vanoni M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17598-17609Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The transfer of hydride from reduced FMN and the proton from Cys-671 is proposed to occur in a concerted anti-addition reaction. The three-dimensional structure of pig liver DPD (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) revealed a highly modular organization of the subunit. It consists of five distinct domains, each carrying a subset of the various prosthetic groups. The α-helical domain I (residues 27–172) contains two of the iron-sulfur clusters, nFeS1 and nFeS2, of which the latter shows an unusual cluster coordination comprising one glutamine and three cysteine residues. The Rossmann-type nucleotide binding folds of domains II (residues 173–286, 442–524) and III (residues 287–441) bind FAD and NADPH, respectively. The interface between these domains forms site 1 of DPD, whereas the pyrimidine binding site 2, containing FMN, is located on top of the α8/β8-barrel domain IV (residues 525–847). The remaining iron-sulfur clusters cFeS1 and cFeS2 are bound to the core of the C-terminal domain V (residues 1–26 and 848–1025). The three-dimensional arrangement of the distinct domains in the homodimeric enzyme leads to the formation of two electron-transfer chains, in which the electrons are transferred from the FAD to nFeS2 and subsequently to nFeS1. The remaining gap between nFeS1 and the FMN is closed by the clusters of the C-terminal domain V of the other subunit in the dimer. This domain swapping makes the dimer the minimal catalytic unit of pig liver DPD. In addition to the x-ray structure of ligand-free DPD, that of a catalytically inactive mutant (C671A) in complex with NADPH and the anti-cancer drug 5FU was determined to 2.0-Å resolution (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two observations led to the conclusion that this ternary complex does not represent a productive enzyme-substrate complex. First, the nicotinamide ring of NADPH was not placed in a position suitable for hydride transfer from its C4 atom to the FAD N-5 atom. Second, the loop comprising residues 670–682 (referred to as “active site loop”), which is proposed to close over the active site while catalysis occurs, is seen in an open and partially disordered conformation. Hence, the alanine at position 671, which in the mutant replaces the general acid Cys-671, was located too distant from the C5 atom of 5FU. Possible explanations for the failure to trigger the putative active-site closure upon substrate binding are the mutation of the cysteine to alanine or the pH difference between crystallization conditions (4.7) and optimal catalytic activity (∼7.3). The assumption that pH might influence the loop conformation is based on the presence of a histidine residue at position 673, which most likely participates in substrate binding. This histidine residue should be positively charged at pH 4.7 but neutral at the pH optimal for catalytic activity. To address this question, we prepared crystals of wild-type pig liver DPD with NADPH and two different inhibitors, 5- iodouracil (5IU) and uracil-4-acetic acid (UAA), respectively. While UAA is a competitive inhibitor of DPD (apparent Ki = 78.6 ± 20.2 μm) (18.Naguib F.N.M. El Kouni M.H. Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), 5IU serves as a substrate and is converted to 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil, which has been shown to be a potent alkylating agent able to covalently modify the Cys-671-thiol group (19.Porter D.J.T. Chestnut W.G. Taylor L.C.E. Merril B.M. Spector T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19988-19994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may lead to trapping of the active-site loop in its closed conformation. Additionally and for purposes of comparison, the structure of the binary DPD·5IU complex was determined. In this report, we describe the three-dimensional structures of these inhibitor-enzyme complexes and discuss their implication for the mechanism of DPD. Pig liver DPD was produced as recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, and has been purified and crystallized as described previously (20.Rosenbaum K. Schaffrath B. Hagen W.R. Jahnke K. Gonzalez F.J. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21.Dobritzsch D. Persson K. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 57: 153-155Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The binary complex of DPD was obtained by crystallization of wild-type DPD in the presence of 1 mm 5IU, the ternary DPD·5IU·NADPH complex, by cocrystallization of DPD with 1 mm 5IU and 5 mmNADPH. A change of pH in the crystals was achieved by soaking crystals of the complex DPD·5IU·NADPH in 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 22% polyethylene glycol 6000 (w/v), 0.8 mm NADPH, for 20 min before data collection. The complex DPD·UAA·NADPH was prepared by soaking wild-type DPD crystals for 2.5 h in a solution containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 22% polyethylene glycol 6000 (w/v), 1 mm UAA, 2.5 mm NADPH. The crystals were stable under these conditions and did not change their appearance. All DPD complexes crystallized in space group P21, with four molecules (two homodimers) in the asymmetric unit. Before data collection, DPD·5IU crystals were transferred for 5 min into a cryo solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.7), 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. For the DPD·5IU·NADPH crystal, the buffer component of this cryo solution was replaced by 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). The crystal of the DPD·UAA·NADPH complex was soaked in a cryo solution consistent with that used for ligand soak/pH change, but 20% (v/v) glycerol were added. All crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beam line ID-EH3 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) with a MAR CCD detector for the two ternary complexes and at the EMBL beam line BW7B at the DORIS storage ring, Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (Hamburg/Germany) with a MARResearch Imaging Plate for the binary complex. Data were indexed and integrated using DENZO (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) and scaled with the CCP4 suite of programs (23.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Open table in a new tab Initial rigid body refinement using the refined structure of the ligand-free enzyme (without water molecules) as a model and data to 2.5-Å resolution resulted in values of 27.9% for Rcryst and 28.8% for Rfree, respectively. The ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map computed from this initial model showed clear electron density for 5IU bound close to the cofactor FMN. Models for the inhibitor and water molecules were added. The high resolution of the data allowed the identification of several alternative conformations of amino acid side chains (residues 187, 245, 947, 962 in chain A, residues 14, 167, 410, 577, 932 in chain B, residues 167, 245, 281, 368, 410, 577, 779, 858, 932, 947, 1006 in chain C, and residues 14, 410, 775, 779, 858, 947, 962, 1006 in chain D) that were included into the model. Model building and refinement resulted in Rcryst = 18.3% and Rfree = 19.8% (Table II). The final model contains residues 2–674, 681–901, and 908–1017 for chain A, residues 2–673, 680–901, and 908–1018 for chain B, residues 2–675 and 682–1017 for chain C, and residues 2–902 and 907–1019 for chain D, four FAD, four FMN, 16 [4Fe-4S] clusters, four 5IU, and 4849 water molecules. All missing amino acids belong either to disordered, surface-located loop regions (such as the active-site loop and the “proline-rich loop” (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y.

Open table in a new tab Initial rigid body refinement using the same model as for DPD·5IU did not result in reasonable R values or in interpretable electron density maps. Therefore, molecular replacement was performed with the program AMoRe (24.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), again with the structure of the ligand-free DPD without water molecules as the search model, resulting in a solution with a correlation coefficient of 78.3. After one cycle of crystallographic refinement (including rigid body refinement, annealing, minimization, and individual B-factor refinement), values of 24.1% for Rcryst and 26.6% for Rfree were obtained, and 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ and ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps were calculated. The maps showed clear electron density for NADPH, with its nicotinamide ring bound close to the FAD in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit, four 5IU molecules, or inhibitor derivatives (see “Results”) bound in the pyrimidine binding sites as well as a change in active-site-loop conformation. Inhibitor models (5IU) and NADPH molecules were fitted into the electron density. The active-site-loop residues were rebuilt into the observed density, and minor readjustments of several amino acid side chains were necessary. The final model contained residues 2–1020 for chains A and D, residues 2–900 and 908–1020 for chain B, residues 2–902 and 907–1020 for chain C, all cofactors, one 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil molecule (chain B), one 5IU molecule (chain C), one uracil molecule (chain D), four NADPH, and 3073 water molecules. In chain A, Cys-671 is covalently modified to S-(hexahydro-2,4-dioxo-5-pyrimidinyl) cysteine. Because the active sites of molecules B and C do not exclusively contain 5IU and 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil, respectively, but also uracil or 5,6-dihydrouracil (see “Results”), the occupancies for the iodine atoms of both molecule models were adjusted correspondingly. For initial rigid body refinement the AMoRe solution for the DPD·5IU·NADPH ternary complex (after removal of inhibitor, cosubstrate, and water molecules) was used, resulting in R values of 29.6% (Rcryst) and 29.7% (Rfree). Because the initial ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ map indicated binding of NADPH and UAA to the active sites of all four molecules in the asymmetric unit, models of cosubstrate and inhibitor were added to the structure. Due to the low resolution of the data, grouped instead of individual B-factor refinement was carried out. The final model contains residues 2–677 and 680–1018 for chain A, residues 2–676, 680–900, and 907–1018 for chain B, residues 2–672 and 682–1016 for chain C, and residues 2–676, 680–901, and 906–1018 for chain D. R-factors were refined to 21.7% for Rcryst and 27.3% for Rfree, respectively. All model building was carried out in O (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), the refinement and water-picking routine for the complexes was done using the program CNS (26.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). NCS restraints were used during refinement, with looser restraints for side-chain atoms. Excluded from these NCS restraints were residues 51–54, 264, 323–327, 397–404, 415–417, 671–683, and 899–907, which belong to solvent-exposed loop regions, showing slightly different conformations in the four molecules present in the asymmetric unit. All three models have good stereochemistry, as determined by the program PROCHECK (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in Table II. Structural alignments were achieved with the programs TOP (28.Lu G.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). Crystal contacts were determined with CONTACT of the CCP4 suite of programs (23.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). The crystallographic data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with accession codes 1gte(DPD·5IU), 1gth (DPD·5IU·NADPH), and 1gt8(DPD·UAA·NADPH). The pH change from 4.7 to 7.5 did not have any obvious effects on the appearance of the DPD crystals. Nevertheless, it caused significant changes in unit cell dimensions and packing of the molecules within the crystal. Both ternary complexes obtained at pH 7.5 showed an elongation of unit cell dimension c by ∼4 Å. This was accompanied by a change in packing of the two tightly associated homodimers within the asymmetric unit, leading to substantial alterations in dimer-dimer and crystal contacts. The majority of the contacts observed in unliganded DPD are absent in DPD·5IU·NADPH (pH 7.5) and DPD·UAA·NADPH (pH 7.5), and new but fewer contacts are formed. The binding of the pyrimidine analogs at pH 4.7 did not introduce major changes in the protein backbone structure, as reflected by a root mean square deviation of 0.24 Å, measured for all Cα atoms of the subunits of ligand-free DPD and the binary complex DPD·5IU. For the ternary complexes obtained at pH 7.5, the superposition with ligand-free DPD yielded root mean square deviations of 0.40 Å for all Cα atoms. In complex DPD·5IU·NADPH (pH 7.5), but not in complex DPD·UAA·NADPH (pH 7.5), the active-site loop was observed in its closed conformation. Differences to ligand-free DPD occurring in both ternary complexes are located in the NADPH-binding site, where several amino acids adopt different conformations to allow proper NADPH binding, as described below. In addition, a slight movement of the NADPH binding domain with respect to the domain arrangement for unliganded DPD was observed. Superposition of the α8/β8-barrel domain IV of the corresponding structures reveals that the NADPH binding domain III changes its position by a modest movement (maximum difference in Cα-coordinates is 2.7 Å for residue 415) with respect to the FAD binding domain II, resulting in a slight widening of the NADPH binding cleft (Fig. 1). The displacement corresponds to a rotation by approximately 2° and a translation along the rotation axis by 0.7 Å. Binding of NADPH in the cleft formed between domains II and III was accompanied by only local changes of amino acid conformations within domain II, whereas it involved both local conformational changes and more global rigid body movements of residues originating from domain III (Fig. 2). A reorientation of the side chains of Phe-438 and Arg-364 resulted in stacking interactions of these residues with the NADPH adenine moiety. Residues 485–488, comprising a loop and the first residue of the following α-helix of domain II, moved in all NADPH-containing complexes with respect to their position in ligand-free DPD. The observed displacement of Cα atoms was maximal for Ala-486 (∼1.7 Å). The position of the side chain of Asn-487 as observed in ligand-free DPD would cause steric clashes with a bound NADPH molecule. By rotation around the N-Cα and Cα-C bonds of Ala-486, a shift of the Asn-487 side chain by 5.6 Å measured for the carboxamide nitrogen is achieved, which then interacted with the 3-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide-ribose via a hydrogen bond. The new backbone conformation of stretch 485–488 is stabilized by two new hydrogen bonds formed between the main chain nitrogen atoms of Asn-487 and Thr-488 to the carboxyl-group of Glu-491. The most significant conformational change necessary for the proper positioning of the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH involves Asp-342. In all complexes obtained at pH 4.7, its side chain partially occupies the space for the nicotinamide of NADPH when bound in productive fashion. In ligand-free DPD a carboxylate oxygen is at a 3.6-Å distance from the FAD N5 at a position very close to the C4 atom of NADPH in complex DPD·5IU·NADPH (pH 7.5). After NADPH binding the Cα of Asp-342 is displaced by 1.9 Å, the NADPH-nicotinamide moiety is stacked between the FAD isoalloxazine ring and the side chain of Asp-342, and one of the carboxyl oxygens of Asp-342 is hydrogen-bonded to the backbone amide of Val-373. Additionally, this movement of Asp-342 causes a displacement of residues 340–344, resulting in disruption of the hydrogen bonds between the backbone oxygen of Ala-340 and the backbone nitrogen atoms of Arg-371 and Ala-372, which are found in ligand-free DPD, the DPD·5IU (pH 4.7) complex, and also in the previously reported complex DPD·5FU·NADPH (pH 4.7) (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the latter, the mode of NADPH binding was non-productive, because the nicotinamide ring was partially disordered and flipped away from the FAD isoalloxazine ring onto the protein surface. In that complex no domain rearrangement could be observed. Nevertheless, most of the more local alterations in the conformation of residues lining the walls of the NADPH binding pocket are seen in DPD·5FU·NADPH (pH 4.7). For all complexes of DPD, electron density shows the inhibitor molecules bound almost parallel to the FMN isoalloxazine ring plane, replacing several water molecules found in the active site of the unliganded enzyme (Fig. 3A). In DPD·5IU (pH 4.7), the electron density is well defined for all atoms of 5-iodouracil (Fig. 3C). The binding geometry corresponds to that observed for 5-fluorouracil in the DPD·5FU·NADPH structure (15.Dobritzsch D. Schneider G. Schnackerz K.D. Lindqvist Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B), with the C6 atom of the inhibitor closest to the N5 of FMN (3.8 Å), the O2 atom in a 3.7-Å distance to both, the N10 and C9A of FMN, and the iodine located 3.7 Å from the FMN O4. As already noted for 5FU, there are no hydrogen bonds between amino acid side chains and the 5-halogen atom. The ligand-associated electron density seen in DPD·UAA· NADPH (pH 7.5) is large enough to fit an uracil-4-acetic acid molecule, but due to the low resolution of the data, the binding geometry of the inhibitor cannot unambiguously be determined and will therefore not be discussed in further detail (Fig. 3D). The electron density observed for inhibitor molecules bound in the active sites of the DPD·5IU·NADPH (pH 7.5) complex is heterogeneous and differs between each of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4, A–D). Furthermore, there are ambiguities in assignment of the observed electron density to distinct inhibitor derivatives for these active sites. In the following, we will therefore describe only the features of the most prominent inhibitor derivative species (with the highest occupancy) for each active site. In chain A, no density was observed for the iodine atom, but there was continuous density between the sulfhydryl group of Cys-671 and the C5 atom of the pyrimidine ring. This electron density suggests that in subunit A the expect"

Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with the MEK (MAP/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 had little effect on the Ros-induced monolayer and anchorage-independent growth of chicken embryo fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells even though more than 70% of the MAPK was inhibited. In contrast, inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway with the drug LY294002, a dominant negative mutant of PI3K, Δp85, or the phosphatidylinositol phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome ten) resulted in a dramatic reduction of v-Ros- and epidermal growth factor receptor-Ros-promoted anchorage-independent growth of chicken embryo fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cells, respectively. Parallel and downstream components of PI3K signaling such as the Rho family GTPases (Rac, Rho, Cdc42) and the survival factor Akt were all shown to contribute to Ros-induced anchorage-independent growth, although Rac appeared to be less important for Ros-induced colony formation in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, the transformation-attenuated v-Ros mutants F419 and DI could be complemented by constitutively active mutants of PI3K and Akt. Finally, we found that overexpressing a constitutively active mutant of STAT3 (STAT3C) conferred a resistance to the inhibition of Ros-induced anchorage-independent growth by LY294002, suggesting a possible overlap of functions between PI3K and STAT3 signaling in mediating Ros-induced anchorage-independent growth.

Although its ligand remains unknown, c-Ros expression is specific and highly regulated. c-Ros has been found to be expressed in a variety of organs/tissues, with relatively high levels in the kidney and intestine. c-Ros protein has been shown to be localized in the epithelial cells of the kidney collecting duct and intestinal villi in chicken (3.Chen J. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 773-780PubMed Google Scholar). v-Ros is the oncogenic form of c-Ros and was identified as the transforming gene of the avian sarcoma virus UR2 (4.Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 914-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the v-Ros oncogene with c-Ros revealed that all but 21 nucleotides immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain of c-Ros were deleted and replaced by the 150 amino acids of the retroviral p19 gag sequence (5.Wang L.-H. Hanafusa H. Notter M.F.D. Balduzzi P.C. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 833-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). v-Ros codes for a gag-Ros fusion protein with the p19 gag sequence protruding extracellularly (6.Jong S.M. Wang L.-H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 7-21PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from enhanced monolayer and anchorage-independent growth, UR2-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) display a distinct transforming characteristic with an extremely elongated morphology. Expression of v-Ros in CEF results in alteration of the tyrosine phosphorylation status of a number of cell-cell or cell-matrix-associated proteins and activation of various signaling pathways including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (7.Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Two UR2 mutants, F419 and DI, were shown to retain the PT kinase activity and growth-stimulating ability of cells maintained in monolayer but not in anchorage-independent conditions (7.Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). F419 has a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at amino acid 419, whereas DI has a deletion of the unique 6-amino acid insertion located 3 amino acids downstream of the predicted catalytic loop of the PT kinase domain (Fig. 1A). Previous analysis revealed that F419 is impaired in its ability to activate insulin receptor substrate-1 and PI3 kinase, which appears not to affect the ability of F419 to promote the growth of cells in monolayer but does correlate with the impaired ability of F419 to promote anchorage-independent growth (7.Zong C.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). receptor protein-tyrosine kinase chicken embryo fibroblast(s) constitutively active Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dominant negative epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase green fluorescent protein insulin-like growth factor I receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)P3 protein-tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol(s) signal transducers and activators of transcription phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted in chromosome ten The study of Ros-induced signaling and transformation has been hampered by the absence of a known ligand for c-Ros and the inability to overexpress wild-type c-Ros in several types of mammalian cells. 2C. S. Zong, J. Chen, Q. Xiong, and L.-H. Wang, unpublished data. One strategy employed to overcome these obstacles involved the generation of two chimeric receptors, ER1 and ER2, between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Ros (8.Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). The ER1 chimeric receptor contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR fused to the cytoplasmic domain of c-Ros (Fig. 1C), whereas ER2 contains only the extracellular domain of EGFR fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of c-Ros (Fig. 1C). In NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts that overexpress either ER1 or ER2, EGF activated these chimeric receptors and induced colony formation of these cells in soft agar (Fig. 1D). Activation of either ER1 or ER2 leads to activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways (8.Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was shown to be important for Ros-induced cell transformation (9.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The MAPK pathway was one of the first mitogenic signaling pathways identified downstream of RPT kinases. The cascade of Ras-Raf-MEK leads to the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK (10.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). MAPK itself is a serine/threonine protein kinase implicated in cellular growth. It can phosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates involved in protein synthesis. Activated MAPK also translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate transcription factors leading to activation of gene expression. Considering the high frequency of Ras mutations in cancer, the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway has been linked to cell proliferation and cancer. However, no recurring mutations downstream of Ras in the MAPK pathway have been identified in human malignancies (11.Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). In addition, MAPK has not been consistently shown to be required for survival, a key component in tumor development (12.Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 13.Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 701-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 14.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). The PI3K signaling pathway has been shown to be essential for growth factor-mediated promotion of cell survival (14.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 15.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K is a lipid kinase that is recruited to the membrane and activated by RPT kinase. At the plasma membrane, PI3K phosphorylates the phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) to generate PtdIns (3.Chen J. Zong C.S. Wang L.H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 773-780PubMed Google Scholar)P, PtdIns (3,4)P2, or PtdIns (3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). These phosphorylated substrates then serve to recruit and activate a diverse array of proteins that contain pleckstrin homology domains that interact with the lipid moiety. The plethora of such proteins includes protein kinases (PDK1, PDK2, and Akt), nucleotide exchange factors (Tiam1, Vav, and Sos (son of sevenless) 1), GTPase-activating factors, phospholipases, and many others (16.Bottomley M.J. Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17.Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is a major downstream effector of PI3K whose function contributes to both growth (18.Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19.Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), which are key requirements in tumor growth and progression. The list of Akt substrates comprises of at least 13 molecules. These substrates have been shown to be involved in growth (mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), p21, FKHR, and GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3β)), survival (FKHR, Bad, caspase-9, CREB, p21, IKK, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)), metabolism (GLUT4, phosphofructokinase-2, and GSK-3β), and possibly angiogenesis and DNA repair (eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) and BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene)) (11.Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar, 24.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

The rapamycin-sensitive mammalian TOR (mTOR) regulates the ribosomal S6 kinase, p70S6K, which is a key regulator of cell growth through its phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal protein S6, a major component of the protein synthesis machinery (11.Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, in addition to recruiting the survival factor Akt, PIP3 also recruits nucleotide exchange factors such as Tiam1 and Vav family members to the membrane, which subsequently leads to the activation of the Rho family of GTPases (Rac, Rho, and Cdc42). Under physiologic conditions, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 regulate the actin cytoskeleton and help to maintain cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix interactions that are crucial for establishing the polarized epithelium. Rac regulates the formation of membrane ruffles called lamellipodia (26.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar), Rho is involved in the formation of stress fibers (27.Del Peso L. Hernandez-Alcoceba R. Embade N. Carnero A. Esteve P. Paje C. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and Cdc42 regulates the formation of pole-like projections called filapodia (26.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). Under tumorigenic conditions, however, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 have been implicated in motility and invasion (28.Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell. Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The first evidence implicating Rho family members in migration and invasion came from the identification of Tiam1 from a retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen (29.Habets G.G.M. Scholtses E.H.M. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tiam1 and its downstream effectors, Rac and Cdc42, were identified as the factors responsible for the invasion of the virus-induced T-cell lymphoma (29.Habets G.G.M. Scholtses E.H.M. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 30.Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Rho has also been shown to promote invasion of tumor cells (27.Del Peso L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5146-5154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ros has also been shown to recruit Vav3, another member of the Vav family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which can also regulate the Rho family GTPases (34.Zeng L. Sachdev P. Yan L. Chan J.L. Trenkle T. McClelland M. Welsh J. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9212-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to the MAPK and the PI3K pathways, a previous study showed that STAT3 was also activated by Ros (9.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of the six STAT family members, STAT3 stands out in its involvement in growth and oncogenesis. STAT3 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal, suggesting that STAT3 plays an essential role in early development (35.Takeda K. Noguchi K. Shi W. Tanaka T. Matsumoto M. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3801-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). STAT3 was shown to be required for v-Src-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells (36.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 37.Turkson J. Bowman T. Garcia R. De Caldenhoven E. Groot R.P. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has also shown that STAT3 is required for Ros and IGFR-induced transformation of NIH3T3 cells (9.Zong C.S. Zeng L. Jiang Y. Sadowski H.B. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28065-28072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which STAT3 promotes growth and transformation is still unclear. In the present report, we explore the role of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in Ros-induced growth and transformation of CEF and NIH3T3 cells. Our results indicate that the MAPK pathway plays a minor role in the monolayer growth and no significant role in anchorage-independent growth of Ros-transformed cells. By contrast, the PI3K pathway plays a more significant role in the growth of Ros-transformed cells in monolayer and is essential for their anchorage-independent growth. We also found that overexpression of a constitutively activated STAT3 could alleviate the inhibitory effect of the PI3K drug inhibitor LY294002 on colony formation in soft agar. These results suggest that PI3K and STAT3 share certain overlapping functions in promoting anchorage-independent growth of Ros-transformed cells. CEF were prepared from 11-day-old embryos and maintained according to previously published protocols (6.Jong S.M. Wang L.-H. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 7-21PubMed Google Scholar). CEF cells were maintained in monolayer in F-10 medium containing 5% calf serum and 1% chick serum. The molecularly cloned avian sarcoma viruses UR2, F419, and DI used in this study (Fig. 1A) have been described previously (4.Neckameyer W.S. Wang L.-H. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 914-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol.

Briefly, the F419 mutant contains a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at amino acid 419, and the DI mutant contains a deletion of the unique 6-amino acid insertion found in UR2 located 3 amino acids downstream of the predicted catalytic loop of the PT kinase domain. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 5% calf serum. The EGFR-Ros chimeric receptor constructs (ER1 and ER2) (Fig. 1C) have been described previously (8.Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Δp85 construct was obtained from Dr. Julian Downward (Signal Transduction Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, U. K.). The PTEN construct was obtained from Dr. K. M. Yamada (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The constitutively active myristoylated Akt (myrAkt) and dominant negative, kinase dead Akt (dnAkt) constructs were obtained from Dr. Phillip Tsichlis (Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The BD110 construct was obtained from Dr. Yasu Fukui (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The dominant negative MEK (LIDA) was obtained from Dr. M. Weber (University of Virginia). The dominant negative ERK2 was obtain from M. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The original caRac/Rho/Cdc42 (Rac1V12, RhoAL63, Cdc42V12) and dnRac/Rho (Rac1N17, RhoAN19) constructs were obtained from Dr. Toru Miki (39.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N.

The original activated and dominant negative constructs were hemagglutinin-tagged and transferred to the phEF-neo vector as described previously (34.Zeng L. Sachdev P. Yan L. Chan J.L. Trenkle T. McClelland M. Welsh J. Wang L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9212-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ACK42 was obtained from Dr. Maruta (41.Nur-e-Kamal M.S. Kamal J.M. Qureshi M.M. Maruta H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7787-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). STAT3C was obtained from Dr. James Darnell (42.Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-p70S6 kinase, and anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-ERK-2 (C-14) and anti-p70S6 kinase antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one), PD98059, and rapamycin were purchased from Calbiochem. The LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in medium containing 5% serum in the presence or absence of the different drug inhibitors at varying concentrations. Cell numbers were counted on the 4th day. Day 0 was defined as the day of seeding. Day 1 was defined as the day when drug treatment started. 5 × 104–1 × 105 cells were resuspended with or without specific inhibitors (10 or 25 μm PD98059, 5 or 10 μmLY294002, 5 or 10 ng/ml rapamycin) in 4 ml of top agar medium (DMEM with 10% calf serum and 0.41% agar) and layered over 5 ml of bottom agar medium (DMEM with 10% calf serum and 0.72% agar) in 6-mm dishes. The medium, with or without the specific inhibitor, was laid over the bilayered soft agar every 5 days. To analyze the effect of the dominant negative or constitutively active mutants of various signaling molecules on the colony-forming ability of control and transformed cells, an empty plasmid or mutant-expressing vector was transfected into the transformed cells using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. In addition, to monitor the transfection efficiency, 1:10 of the amount of pGFP plasmid was also transfected into the transformed cells; alternatively, a parallel culture was transfected with an equivalent amount of pGFP plasmid. A subculture was observed under a fluorescence microscope 24–48 h after transfection to assess the transfection efficiency based on the expression of GFP. Typically, 50–70% transfection efficiency was obtained for NIH3T3 cells, and 25–50% efficiency was obtained for CEF. 48 h post-transfection, 5 × 104–1 × 105 cells were subjected to colony formation assay as described above. All of the colony assays for EGFR-Ros-expressing NIH3T3 cells were in the presence or absence (as control) of 30 ng/ml EGF. Cells not used for colony assay were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and total protein lysates were analyzed for expression of the dominant negative or constitutively active mutants. The colonies were stained on day 10–14 with iodonitrotetrazonium (0.25 mg/ml in H2O or regular medium) for 2 days at 37 °C before counting. The UR2 virus and its mutants DI and F419 are described above. We have shown previously that all three viral encoded PT kinases are kinase-active and promote growth in CEF (7.Zong C.S. Chan J.L.-K. Yang S.-K. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1500-1506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). All three viruses are able to induce colony formation of infected CEF in soft agar; however, the transforming abilities of F419 and DI were attenuated compared with that of UR2 as reflected in the size of the induced CEF colonies (Fig. 1B). The EGFR-Ros chimeras (ER1 and ER2) have been described previously, and their sequence make-ups are depicted in Fig. 1C. ER1 and ER2 induce colony formation of NIH3T3 cells in soft agar only in the presence of EGF (8.Xiong Q. Chan J.L.-K. Zong C.S. Wang L.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). The MAPK, PI3K, and p70S6K signaling pathways have been associated with growth factor receptor-mediated mitogenicity in various cell lines. We wanted to assess the significance of these pathways in monolayer growth of control and Ros-transformed CEF and NIH3T3 cells. The Ros-transformed cells were seeded at low density and permitted to proliferate in the presence or absence of various drug inhibitors in the regular maintenance medium. The drug inhibitors that were utilized included PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor of MEK in the MAPK pathway, LY294002, which is a specific inhibitor of PI3K, and rapamycin, which is a specific inhibitor of mTOR/FRAP that is required to activate p70S6K. PD98059, LY294002, and rapamycin were able to inhibit MAPK, Akt (as a measure of PI3K activity), and p70S6K, respectively, substantially as reflected by the decrease of the respective phosphorylated forms of the proteins at the two dosages tested (Fig. 2, A and B). In UR2 CEF, the degree of inhibition of Erk and Akt by 25 μmPD98059 and 10 μm LY294002 was similar compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 2A). In EGFR-Ros-expressing NIH3T3 cells, the upper species of the activated Erk was almost completely inhibited, and the lower species was inhibited more than 75% at 25 μm PD98059 (Fig. 2B). The pattern of growth inhibition by the three drugs was consistent among all control and transformed cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Overall, inhibiting the MAPK pathway with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 only slightly inhibited the monolayer growth. CEF infected by UR2 or the two UR2 mutants, F419 and DI, grew on average to 83 and 68% of their untreated counterparts in the presence of 10 μm and 25 μm PD98059, respectively. The control NIH3T3 cells (N5), along with those stably transfected with either of the two EGFR-Ros chimeric receptors (ER1 or ER2), in the presence of EGF grew to an average of 84 and 65% of the untreated controls in the presence of 10 μm and 25 μm PD98059, respectively. In contrast, inhibiting the PI3K pathway with LY294002 had a more substantial effect on the monolayer growth of normal and infected CEF and the control and ER1/ER2-expressing NIH3T3 cells, although CEF appeared to be more sensitive than the NIH3T3 cells to LY294002. The control and virus-infected CEF grew on average to only 45 and 27% of the untreated cells in the presence of 5 μm and 10 μm LY294002, respectively. Similarly, the control and ER1/ER2-expressing NIH3T3 cells grew on average to 60 and 41% of the untreated cells in the presence of 5 μm and 10 μm LY294002, respectively. In CEF, inhibition of p70S6K with the anti-fungal and immunosuppressant agent rapamycin produced a moderate inhibition on monolayer growth which was slightly more significant than treatment with PD980"
https://openalex.org/W2013232320,"Plesiomonas shigelloides is a Gram-negative, flagellated, rod-shaped bacterium. This ubiquitous and facultatively anaerobic organism has been isolated from such sources as freshwater, surface water, and many wild and domestic animals. The infections correlate strongly with the surface water contamination and are particularly common in tropical and subtropical habitats (1.Farmer III, J.J. Arduino M.J. Hickman-Brenner F.W. Balows A.

Human infections with P. shigelloides are mostly related to drinking untreated water, eating uncooked shellfish (2.Van Houten R. Farberman D. Norton J. Ellison J. Kiehlbauch J. Morris T. Smith P.

However, it has also been associated with diarrheal illness (11.Bravo L. Monte R. Ramirez M. Garcia B. Urbaskova P. Aldova E. Cent. Eur. J. Public Health. 1998; 6: 67-70PubMed Google Scholar) and other diseases in normal hosts. P. shigelloides has been isolated from an assortment of clinical specimens, including cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, and respiratory tract. It causes gastrointestinal and localized infections originating from infected wounds, which can disseminate to other parts of the body (12.Korner R.J. Macgowan A.P. Warner B. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. 1992; 277: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cases of meningitis and bacteremia (10.Fujita K. Shirai M. Ishioka T. Kakuya F. Acta Paediatr. Jpn. 1994; 36: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) caused by P. shigelloides are of special interest due to their seriousness. P. shigelloides has been traditionally classified as a member of the Vibrionaceae family based on phenotypic characteristics such as polar flagella, oxidase production, and fermentation properties (1.Farmer III, J.J. Arduino M.J. Hickman-Brenner F.W. Balows A. Trüper H.G. Dworkin M. Wim H. Schleifer K.H. The Prokaryotes. 3. Springer-Verlag, New York1992: 3012-3043Google Scholar).

The O-specific polysaccharide of strain CNCTC 113/92 LPS (serotype O54) is composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit with the following structure: The core oligosaccharide is important for biological and physical properties of the overall lipopolysaccharide and plays a significant role in interactions with the host.

The bacteria were grown and harvested as described previously (22.Czaja J. Jachymek W. Niedziela T. Lugowski C. Aldova E. Kenne L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1672-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). LPS was extracted from bacterial cells by the hot phenol/water method (24.Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-89Google Scholar) and purified as reported earlier (23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The yield of LPS was 2% of the dry bacterial mass. LPS (200 mg) was degraded by treatment with 1.5% acetic acid containing 2% SDS at 100 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was freeze-dried, the SDS removed by extraction with 96% ethanol, and the residue suspended in water and centrifuged. The supernatant was fractionated on Bio-Gel P-10, where O-specific polysaccharide separated from shorter chains (OSIII, 33 mg) and core oligosaccharides (OSIV, 12 mg). The core oligosaccharides were further fractionated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2 yielding two oligosaccharides: OSIVA (8.9 mg) and OSIVB (0.9 mg). The gel permeation chromatography was performed on columns (1.6 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-10 and Bio-Gel P-2, equilibrated with 0.05m pyridine/acetic acid buffer, pH 5.6. Eluates were monitored with a Knauer differential refractometer and all fractions were checked by 1H NMR spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and freeze-dried. For a rapid screening of LPS from different P. shigelloides serotypes proteinase K-digested whole cell lysates were obtained by the method described earlier (25.Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Bacteria were grown on solid medium, harvested, and suspended in PBS to a turbidity giving A600 nm = 0.6. A portion (1.5 ml) of the suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of lysing buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 4% SDS and 4% glycerol) and heated for 10 min at 100 °C. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64, Sigma-Aldrich) (∼200 μg) in the lysing buffer (80 μl) was added, followed by overnight incubation at 21 °C. The digested bacterial lysate was boiled for 20 min prior to electrophoresis. The LPS was analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously (27.Niedziela T. Petersson C. Helander A. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The LPS bands were visualized by the silver staining method (28.Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Sugars were analyzed as their alditol acetates by GC-MS (23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29.Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A.R. Anal. Chem. 1965; 37: 1602-1604Crossref Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). The absolute configurations of the sugars were determined as described by Gerwig et al. (30.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 349-357Crossref Scopus (800) Google Scholar, 31.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) using (−)-2-butanol for the formation of 2-butyl glycosides. The trimethylsilylated butyl glycosides were then identified by comparison with authentic samples (produced from re-spective sugar and (−)-2-butanol) on GC-MS. Carboxyl reduction of the native oligosaccharide was carried out according to the method of Taylor et al. (32.Taylor R.L. Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Methods. Carbohydr. Chem. 1976; 7: 149-151Google Scholar) as described previously (23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Methylations were performed both on N-acetylated and carboxyl-reduced oligosaccharides and only N-acetylated oligosaccharides according to the method of Hakomori (33.Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar). The methyl ester groups of the latter methylated oligosaccharides were reduced with Superdeuteride (LiB(C2H5)32H) as described by Bhat et al. (34.Bhat U.R. Krishnaiah B.S. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The methylated sugars were analyzed as partially methylated alditol acetates by GC-MS as previously described (23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GC-MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard 5971A system using an HP-1 fused-silica capillary column (0.2 mm × 12 m) and a temperature program 150 → 270 °C at 8 °C min−1. Amino acid analysis was carried out as described (35.MacKenzie S.L. Tenaschuk D. J. Chromatogr. 1974; 97: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36.MacKenzie S.L. Hogge L.R. J. Chromatogr. 1977; 132: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The core oligosaccharide (1 mg) was hydrolyzed with 6m hydrochloric acid at 100 °C for 24 h and concentrated to dryness. Subsequently, n-butanol (0.5 ml) and acetyl chloride (50 μl) were added, and the reaction was carried out at 120 °C for 20 min, followed by the evaporation to dryness. Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (100 μl) was added, and the mixture was heated for 5 min at 150 °C. The N-heptafluorobutyryl n-butyl ester derivative of amino acid was analyzed by GC-MS on the same system as described above, but a temperature program 100 → 270 °C at 5 °C min−1. Oligosaccharide OSIII (5 mg) was dissolved in saturated NaHCO3 (2 ml) at 0 °C and treated with acetic anhydride (3 × 100 μl, with 10-min intervals). Reaction mixture was stored for additional 30 min at 0 °C, the product purified on a column (1.6 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 and the N-acetylated OSIII oligosaccharide examined by NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS. MALDI MS of the investigated oligosaccharides, in positive or negative mode, was run on a Bruker Reflex III time-of-flight instrument. Conjugates of core oligosaccharides with BSA were analyzed using a Kratos Kompact-SEQ instrument. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid and sinapinic acid were used as matrices for analyses of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, respectively. NMR spectra of the oligosaccharides were obtained for 2H2O solutions and H2O solutions containing 10% of 2H2O, at 35 °C on Bruker DRX 400 and DRX 600 spectrometers. All spectra were obtained using acetone (δH 2.225, δC 31.05) as internal reference. The core oligosaccharide fractions were repeatedly exchanged with 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. The data were acquired and processed using standard Bruker software. The processed spectra were assigned with the help of the SPARKY program (37.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. 3rd Ed. University of California, San Francisco2001Google Scholar). The signals were assigned by one- and two-dimensional experiments (COSY, clean-TOCSY, NOESY, ROESY, HMBC, HSQC-DEPT, and HSQC with and without carbon decoupling). In the clean-TOCSY experiments the mixing times used were 30, 60, and 100 ms. The delay time in the HMBC was 60 ms and the mixing times in the NOESY and ROESY experiments were 200 ms. The core oligosaccharide (OSIVA) was isolated and purified as described above. The conjugation was carried out as described previously (38.Boratynski J. Roy R. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, core oligosaccharide OSIVA (2.5 mg) solutions in H2O (100 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of BSA (1 mg) solution in H2O. Dimethylformamide was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the mixture was freeze-dried. Dry preparation was heated at 110 °C for 30 min, dissolved in PBS (1 ml), and dialyzed against PBS (3 × 1 liter). The products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and their antigenic properties were determined in the immunoblotting test, using polyclonal anti-P. shigelloides CNCTC 113/92 antibodies. Rabbits were immunized with the P. shigelloides core oligosaccharide-BSA conjugate, suspended in a complete Freund adjuvant, and polyclonal antibodies against the conjugates were obtained by the procedures previously described (39.Lugowski C. Romanowska E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using LPS as solid-phase antigen, was performed by a modification (40.Jennings H.J. Lugowski C. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1011-1018PubMed Google Scholar) of the method described by Voller et al.(41.Voller A. Draper C. Bidwell D.E. Bartlett A. Lancet. 1975; 1: 426-428Abstract PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was done as previously described (23.Petersson C. Niedziela T. Jachymek W. Kenne L. Zarzecki P. Lugowski C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) was used as the second antibody and p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium were applied as detection systems for ELISA and immunoblotting, respectively. The LPS of P. shigelloides CNCTC 113/92 was isolated by conventional methods and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, showing fractions consisting of core oligosaccharide substituted with different numbers of oligosaccharide repeating units as well as unsubstituted core oligosaccharides. The O-specific polysaccharide and core oligosaccharides were liberated by mild acidic hydrolysis of the LPS and isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10. In addition to the polysaccharide fraction, which was analyzed previously (22.Czaja J. Jachymek W. Niedziela T. Lugowski C. Aldova E. Kenne L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1672-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), two fractions with lower molecular mass components were obtained, i.e. OSIII (yield, 16.5% of LPS) and OSIV (yield, 6% of LPS). The fraction OSIV was further separated on Bio-Gel P-2 giving the two main oligosaccharides OSIVA (yield, 4.5% of LPS) and OSIVB (yield, 0.5% of LPS). Because the initial NMR investigation indicated the presence of uronic acid, Kdo, and one non-acetylated glucosamine residue in the oligosaccharides, all subsequent sugar and methylation analyses were done on N-acetylated and carboxyl-reduced oligosaccharides to detect these residues. Composition analysis of the carboxyl-reduced and N-acetylated oligosaccharide OSIVB together with determination of the absolute configuration revealed the presence of ld-Hep, d-Glc, d-Gal, and d-GlcN (relative proportions of 2.7:1.8:2.9:0.8) in the carboxyl-reduced OSIVB oligosaccharide. Methylation analysis was performed on this carboxyl-reduced and N-acetylated OSIVB but also on only N-acetylated OSIVB. The methyl esters of the latter methylated material were reduced with Superdeuteride generating two deuterium on C-6 of the former uronic acid. These analyses showed the presence of 2,3,7-trisubstitutedld-Hep p, 3,4-disubstitutedld-Hep p, terminalld-Hep p, 4-substitutedd-Glc pN, terminal d-Glc p, terminal d-Gal p, 4-substitutedd-Gal pA, and 5-substituted Kdo (relative proportions 0.8:1.1:1.0:0.7:0.9:1.8:0.6:0.7) in the original core oligosaccharide OSIVB. In oligosaccharide OSIVA the ratio of terminald-Glc p was twice as high as in OSIVB and 4,6-disubstituted d-Glc pN was identified instead of 4-substituted d-Glc pN. All other components and ratios were found to be the same as in OSIVB. The substitution positions and the ring forms were supported by NMR data (see below). The MALDI-TOF mass spectra of the oligosaccharides (Fig. 1, A and B) showed main ions at m/z 1660.55 [M+Na]+, 1638.53 [M+H]+, and 1642.53 [M-H2O+Na]+for OSIVB and m/z 1822.76 [M+Na]+, 1844.75 [M-H+2Na]+, and 1804.74 [M-H2O+Na]+ for OSIVA. This suggests a nonasaccharide in OSIVB and a decasaccharide in OSIVA differing only in one hexose unit (162.21Da difference). The nine sugars, two Gal, one Glc, three Hep, one GalA, one GlcN, and one Kdo, give together a monoisotopic mass of 1637.52 and an average mass of 1638.41. The mass spectrum of the isolated OSIII (Fig. 1C) component showed main ions at m/z 2865.94 [M+H]+, 2887.91 [M+Na]+, and 2847.93 [M-H2O+H]+. The mass difference of 1065.15 between OSIII and OSIVA can be explained by one repeating unit of the O-specific polysaccharide substituting the core. The mass of OSIII thus supports a hexadecasaccharide structure with one repeating unit linked to the core oligosaccharide. The 1H (Fig. 2A) and HSQC-DEPT (Fig. 3) NMR spectra of the core oligosaccharide OSIVB contained main signals for eight anomeric protons and carbons, and in addition a Kdo spin system confirming a nonasaccharide (the sugar residues are indicated by capital letters as shown in the structure below, and these letters refer to the corresponding sugars through the entire text, tables, and figures). The 1H (Fig. 2B) and HSQC-DEPT NMR spectra of the core oligosaccharide OSIVA contained main signals for nine anomeric protons and carbons and a Kdo spin system, thus confirming a decasaccharide structure. Because all the 1H NMR spectra were complex and contained overlapping signals, the major signals and spin systems were assigned by COSY, TOCSY with different mixing times, and HSQC experiments. By comparing the chemical shifts with previously published NMR data for respective monosaccharides (42.Gorin P.A. Mazurek M. Can. J. Chem. 1975; 53: 1212-1227Crossref Google Scholar, 43.Jansson P.E.

The spectra were obtained for H2O/2H2O solutions at 600 MHz and 35 °C. The cross-peaks are labeled as explained in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Starting with the signal for the anomeric proton, H-1, the COSY spectrum identified the H-2 signal and the TOCSY spectra with different mixing times the H-3 to H-7 signals. The H-7 signals of heptose residues were identified in the TOCSY experiments starting with the assigned H-3 and H-4 signals. The HSQC-TOCSY experiments were used for unambiguous assignment of overlapping signals. From the assigned 1H signals and the one-bond C–H connectivities, the carbon signals were assigned in the gradient-enhanced HSQC-DEPT spectrum (Fig. 3), and the linkage positions were determined from the high chemical shifts of the signals from the substituted carbons. The CH2 carbon signals were readily identified in the HSQC-DEPT experiment from negative cross-peaks. An unequivocal identification of the H-7, C-7 as a negative cross-peak in the HSQC-DEPT experiment was further confirmed in the HSQC-TOCSY experiment.

https://openalex.org/W2061015483,"The Ku heterodimer plays a central role in non-homologous end-joining. The binding of recombinant Ku to DNA has been investigated by dynamic light scattering, double-filter binding, fluorescence spectroscopy, and band shift assays. The hydrodynamic radius of Ku in solution is 5.2 nm and does not change when a 25-bp double-strand DNA (dsDNA) fragment (D25) is added, indicating that only one Ku molecule binds to a 25-bp fragment. The dissociation constant (k d) for the binding to D25 is 3.8 ± 0.9 nm. If both ends of the substrate are closed with hairpin loops, Ku is still able to bind with little change in thek d. The k d is not affected by ATP, Mg2+, or ionic strength. However, the addition of bovine serum albumin decreases the k d by 2-fold. DNA substrates of 50 bp can bind two Ku molecules, whereas three molecules are bound to a 75-bp substrate. Data analysis with the Hill equation yields a value of the Hill coefficient (n) close to 1, and the k d values for the binding of Ku to both ends of these substrates are the same. Thus, we demonstrate that there is no cooperative interaction among the Ku heterodimers binding longer substrates. The Ku heterodimer plays a central role in non-homologous end-joining.

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Immunological diversity is generated by V(D)J recombination that produces DSBs during the process of rearrangement of genes encoding B cell immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (3Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 425-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). They are also generated by both exogenously and endogenously generated DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation and reactive oxygen species that arise as by-products of DNA metabolism. If left unrepaired, they lead to broken chromosomes and cell death. On the other hand, if DNA DSBs are repaired incorrectly, they may lead to chromosome translocation and cancer. Cells have evolved two different pathways for repairing DSBs, namely homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining DNA (NHEJ). NHEJ is the dominant pathway in cells of multicellular eukaryotes, while homologous recombination prevails in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Sargent R.G. Brenneman M.A. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells utilize the same reaction to repair both radiation-induced DSBs and breaks induced during V(D)J recombination (6Roth D.B. Lindahl T. Gellert M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Five proteins that function in NHEJ in mammalian cells have been identified to date, namely Ku70, Ku80 DNA-PKcs, Xrcc4, and ligase IV (7Jeggo P.A. Adv. Genet. 1998; 38: 185-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Three of these (Ku70, Ku80, and DNA-PKcs) constitute a complex termed the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PKcs is a large protein of 469 kDa and a member of a sub-group of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, called phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (8Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Ku70 and Ku83 are subunits of the heterodimeric protein Ku and require heterodimerization for stability and function (9Jin S. Weaver D.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6874-6885Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Ku has double-stranded (ds) DNA end binding activity (10Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and once bound can slide along the DNA in an energy-independent manner (11de Vries D.J. Blumberg P.M. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the Ku heterodimer, both in the presence and absence of DNA, has been determined (12Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The structure shows that Ku has the shape of a ring with a large base and a narrow “handle.” When bound to DNA, the conformation of Ku does not change, and a dsDNA duplex fits precisely inside the ring. One face of the duplex DNA remains relatively accessible to the solvent, because it is only partially covered by the narrow handle of the Ku molecule. In this way, the processing enzymes may have easy access to this side of the DNA duplex to remove damaged nucleotides and fill gaps prior to ligation. Although the structural studies are very useful in providing a structure of how Ku binds to DNA, they do not provide information on the dynamics of the interaction with Ku. Here, we exploit biophysical studies to evaluate further the information gained from the structural studies. In addition, the structure was determined for a Ku variant that lacked the C terminus of Ku83, a region that does not seem to be involved in the binding of Ku to DNA but is required for the interaction with DNA-PKcs (13Singleton B.K. Torres-Arzayus M.I. Rottinghaus S.T. Taccioli G.E. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3267-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have investigated the binding of Ku to DNA and have shown that Ku cannot bind any DNA substrate shorter than 14 bp (14Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that Ku binds avidly to dsDNA ends independently of the oligonucleotide sequence and of the exact structure of the ends, whether they are blunt, with 5′ or 3′ overhangs, or even with hairpin loops (15Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies performed by different groups with dsDNA fragments of similar length and structure have yielded values of the dissociation constants (k d) that vary from the low picomolar to the nanomolar range (10Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, little is known about the cooperativity of Ku binding to DNA (18Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, we have examined the binding of Ku to dsDNA fragments of different length and structure. The stoichiometry of the complexes that Ku forms with the different substrates was determined by dynamic light scattering, which reflects the change in the value of the hydrodynamic radius of the Ku heterodimer when DNA is added (19Huffman J.L. Mokashi A. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40537-40544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the value of the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule provides valuable information on the shape and the hydration shell of the protein. The affinity of Ku for DNA and the presence of cooperativity among the Ku molecules binding longer substrates was investigated by double-filter binding, an improved filter binding technique that has already been used to study protein·DNA interactions (20Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 21Ali J.A. Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 815-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fluorescence studies have also been performed to support the results obtained by double-filter binding. Our results provide an accurate estimate of the dissociation constant for binding that is consistent with the two methods employed. We show that there is no cooperativity among the Ku molecules binding to DNA substrates and that Ku binds efficiently to hairpin loops. Together our results provide novel insights into the mechanism of Ku binding to DNA.RESULTSThe baculovirus expression system allows the expression and the purification of milligram quantities of highly pure (>99% as judged from Coomassie- and Silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel) recombinant Ku heterodimer (rKu) (Fig.1 A). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that rKu binds the 25-bp blunt-end dsDNA substrate (D25) with the same affinity of the native Ku, purified from HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B). Circular dichroism and fluorescence studies proved that the recombinant and native proteins have almost identical secondary structure (data not shown).Stoichiometry of Ku Binding to dsDNAThe size of the Ku molecule alone and in complex with dsDNA fragments of different length and structure was measured by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (TableII). The linear trend of the autocorrelation function (ACF) transformed according to the cumulant analysis (25Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1972; 57: 4814-4820Crossref Scopus (2704) Google Scholar)(Fig. 2 B) and the low values of the polydispersity (Table II) demonstrates that the samples are monodispersed both in the absence and presence of dsDNA, showing that the Ku heterodimer does not aggregate under these conditions. In addition, no change in the average size and in the polydispersity of the protein preparation was observed under different temperatures ranging from 6 to 25 °C (data not shown). Fig.2 A shows the autocorrelation function measured for Ku alone, Ku bound to the 25-bp dsDNA (D25), and Ku bound to the 50-bp dsDNA (D50). The ACF of the solution containing Ku alone is indistinguishable from that of the solution containing the complex of Ku with D25, whereas the solution containing the Ku·D50 complex clearly shows an ACF with a longer decay time (Fig. 2 A). The hydrodynamic radius of rKu alone is calculated to be 5.21 ± 0.04 nm (TableII). This value does not change significantly when Ku is complexed with the D25 substrate demonstrating that only one Ku molecule is bound to a blunt-end DNA substrate of 25 bp. In contrast, the hydrodynamic radius increases to 7.06 ± 0.02 nm when Ku is incubated with the D50 substrate indicating that the Ku·D50 complex contains more than one Ku molecule (Table II).Table IIDLS determination of the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and polydispersity of Ku bound to different dsDNA fragmentsSampleR hPolidispersitynmKu5.21 ± 0.040.045 ± 0.014Ku + D255.31 ± 0.040.055 ± 0.006Ku + H255.45 ± 0.020.052 ± 0.004Ku + 2H255.35 ± 0.020.046 ± 0.006Ku + D507.06 ± 0.020.069 ± 0.008Ku + H507.55 ± 0.020.067 ± 0.005All experiments were done with a molar [DNA]/[Ku] ratio of 1.25.

When Ku is incubated with the D25 substrate, a major lower band is detectable, while two distinct bands are visible in the presence of the D50 probe indicating that the 50-bp fragment can form a complex with one or two Ku molecules consistent with the conclusion based on DLS. Fig. 3 shows that Ku is also able to bind a 25-bp substrate where one (H25) or both ends (2H25) have been modified with the addition of an eight-nucleotide hairpin loop. Thefainter upper bands present in the experiments done with D25, H25, and 2H25 suggest that these substrates may also be able to accommodate two Ku molecules. Because the crystal structure shows that each Ku molecule covers about 20 bp and all these substrates are shorter than 40 bp, the upper bands may represent a less likely situation where two Ku molecules are not “fully” bound to the substrate. Experiments done with a 75-bp duplex DNA show the presence of a third upper band suggesting that, in this case, three Ku molecules are bound to DNA (see below).Figure 3Band shift assays with the substrates D25 , H25 , 2H25, and D50 in the presence (+) and in the absence (−) of Ku. The experiments were carried out with 0.2 μm Ku and 20 nm DNA substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding Affinity of Ku for dsDNAThe double-filter binding technique, which has been used previously to study protein·DNA interactions, was exploited here to measure the binding affinity of Ku for eight different DNA probes (TableIII). This technique utilizes a DEAE membrane beneath the nitrocellulose membrane as an additional means to trap DNA that fails to bind to the nitrocellulose filter. This modification increases both the accuracy and precision of the measurements while reducing the time required for analysis. Fig.4 A shows the β-emission images for both the nitrocellulose and DEAE membranes where the 25-bp blunt-end dsDNA (0.8 nm) was titrated with the Ku protein. There is an inverse relationship between the radioactivity retained by the two filters and quantification of the radioactivity allowed the construction of the binding curves shown in Fig. 4 B. The dissociation constant (k d) for the binding of recombinant Ku to the blunt-end dsDNA substrate of 25-bp (D25) is 3.8 ± 0.9 nm. Surprisingly, the addition of one or two hairpin loops to the same substrate (H25 and 2H25) has only a small effect on the k d values (Table III) demonstrating that Ku binds to a “closed” substrate lacking free ends (2H25). As already shown by light scattering and band shift experiments, a dsDNA fragment of 50 bp (D50) can bind two Ku molecules. The dissociation constant (k d) for the binding of Ku to both sites of D50 is 7.9 ± 0.6 nm, and the value of the Hill coefficient (n) is close to 1 indicating the absence of cooperativity (Table III). This k d value remains the same within experimental error if the data are fitted with the Langmuir equation. Thus, our experiments demonstrate that the two Ku binding sites on the D50 probe are identical and independent (Fig.5). The 75-bp dsDNA probe (D75) can accommodate three molecules of Ku. Two are bound to the dsDNA ends, and the third must, therefore, lie internally. Again, no cooperative interaction is observed (n ≈ 1) between the molecules of Ku binding the substrate (Fig. 5). The k d value for the binding of Ku to the two ends of D75 is the same, within the experimental error, measured for the binding of the heterodimer to the D50 probe (Table III).Table IIIDouble filter binding determination of dissociation constant for different dsDNA fragmentsSubstrateK dn HnmD253.8 ± 0.91.3 ± 0.1H257.9 ± 1.01.3 ± 0.22H2511.4 ± 0.91.4 ± 0.1D507.9 ± 0.61.4 ± 0.1H507.0 ± 1.81.1 ± 0.1D758.2 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.1H758.6 ± 2.41.4 ± 0.4The experiments were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Figure 5Double-filter binding titration experiments of four different DNA substrates (D50, H50, D75, and H75) with rKu.

The 2 extra Phe and 8 extra Tyr residues that are present in the sequence of the histidine-tag significantly affect the fluorescence spectrum of the rKu molecule, shifting the emission maximum from 349 to 355 nm (Fig.6 A). The values of the dissociation constants (k d) determined for the protein with and without the histidine-tag are very similar, suggesting that this extra N-terminal tail of 30 amino acids does not affect the binding of Ku to DNA. The fluorescence signal is reduced or quenched by about 10–15% when rKu is titrated with increasing amounts of dsDNA substrates (Fig. 6 B). The experimental data obtained titrating Ku with a 25-bp blunt-end dsDNA fragment (D25), can be fitted very well with the simple 1:1 Langmuir equation (Fig. 6 C) giving a k d value of 6.6 ± 1.5 nmthat agrees with the one obtained from double-filter binding experiments. Taken together, the fluorescence studies carried out with D50 and D75 as well as with the other substrates used in this work give results consistent with those obtained by filter binding (data not shown).Figure 6Fluorescence studies on Ku binding to D25.

The values of the dissociation constants are not affected significantly by the presence of Mg2+ or ATP (Fig.7 A). However, the presence of 80 μg/ml BSA improves the affinity of Ku for DNA by a factor of two (Fig. 7, top panel). The values of the dissociation constant do not change when the KCl concentration is varied from 0 to 150 mm (Fig. 7,bottom panel) in agreement with previous salt dependence studies carried out by other groups (28Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This behavior of Ku raises interesting questions on the mechanism of Ku binding to DNA, because it is distinct from that observed for other DNA binding proteins where the salt concentration dramatically affects the affinity for DNA (29Misra V.K.

Because the crystal structure shows that Ku has a shape of an ellipsoid with an axial ratio of two, the Perrin coefficient F = 1.044 (f = 6πηRF) can be used to correct the hydrodynamic radius for the ellipsoid shape (31Cantor C.R. Schimmel I.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar) giving a new hydrodynamic radius of 4.93 nm. This value is similar to the one calculated for Ku by other laboratories but is greater than that predicted for a molecule of similar size (153.5 kDa) (11de Vries D.J. Blumberg P.M. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 32Zhao J. Wang J. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In fact, assuming a value for the specific volume of 0.74 cm3/g (31Cantor C.R. Schimmel I.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar), an anhydrous molecular volume of 190 nm3, and a theoretical hydrodynamic radius (R h) of 3.57 nm would be predicted for a molecule of 153.5 kDa. Consistent with our results, the recent crystal structure of rKu indicates that the molecule has the shape of an ellipsoid with an overall dimension of 12 × 7 × 6 nm that corresponds to a molecule with an anhydrous molecular volume of 264 nm3 and an average anhydrous radius of 3.78 nm (Fig.8). Adding the 167 amino acid residues that are missing at the C terminus of the Ku83 subunit in the crystal structure, we estimate that the value of the radius for the entire molecule would be 4.16 nm. A possible reason why this value is considerably bigger than the theoretical value measured for a globular protein of similar size (R h = 3.57 nm) is that the structure of Ku shows the presence of a 2-nm diameter hole in the center of the molecule that increases the total radius (Fig. 8). However, this value of 4.16 nm estimated from the crystal structure is still smaller than that obtained in our DLS studies. Even adding a typical 1- to 1.3-nm hydration shell (33Arosio D. Kwansa H.E. Gering H. Piszczek G. Bucci E. Biopolymers. 2002; 63: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to the anhydrous radius estimated from the crystal structure, a value 4.45–4.52 nm is obtained. This value is 0.48–0.44 nm smaller than ours (4.93 nm) raising the possibility that Ku may be surrounded with a hydration shell thicker than 1.3 nm.Figure 8Connolly surface of rKu constructed from the crystal structure (pdb code: 1JEQ).

Gellert M. Yang W. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 881-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R. Alt F.W. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that this dsDNA binding protein may be involved in other fundamental physiological processes such as DNA replication (36Novac O. Matheos D. Araujo F.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3386-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding a plethora of knowledge about Ku, the biophysical properties of this molecule in solution and the mechanism of Ku binding to DNA still demand further investigation. Because biophysical studies often require milligram quantities of material, an efficient baculovirus expression system for the Ku heterodimer was developed. With this procedure, ∼0.5 mg of rKu are obtained from 5 × 107 infected Sf9 cells. Although the histidine-tag does not seem to affect the binding of Ku to dsDNA, this 30-amino acid tail was removed from both subunits.By DLS we have demonstrated that the rKu heterodimer, with or without the histidine-tag, does not aggregate. We have also determined the stoichiometry of the complexes that Ku forms with the different DNA probes by measuring the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule in solution. The hydrodynamic radius of rKu alone in solution is 5.21 or 4.93 nm if the correction for a ellipsoid is applied. This value is greater than the one that can be predicted for a molecule of similar size (153.5 kDa) in agreement with previous results (11de Vries D.J. Blumberg P.M. Life Sci. 1989; 44: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 32Zhao J. Wang J. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One explanation of this difference is the presence of a 2-nm diameter hole in the center of the molecule, which may serve to increase the radius (Fig. 8). However, the value obtained from our DLS studies is also greater than the anhydrous hydrodynamic radius that can be estimated from the crystal structure (4.16 nm). A possible explanation is that Ku may be surrounded by a thick hydration shell that increases the radius of the molecule in solution. The surface of the molecule is strongly charged, and the structure shows a disordered highly acidic N-terminal tail of 33 amino acids in the Ku70 subunit that points outside the globular domain, which is likely to be highly hydrated.The hydrodynamic radius does not change significantly when the 25-bp duplex DNA (D25) is added to the solution containing Ku (Table II). This result indicates that only one Ku molecule is involved in the binding of a DNA probe of 25-bp in contrast to previous gel filtration studies done with DNA fragments of similar length (37Cary R.B. Peterson S.R. Wang J. Bear D.G. Bradbury E.M. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) but in agreement with several studies done by other laboratories (18Ma Y. Lieber M.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9638-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Zhao J. Wang J. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, a 50-bp fragment can bind two Ku molecules increasing the hydrodynamic radius from 5.31 ± 0.04 nm (D25) to 7.55 ± 0.04 nm (D50). It is worth mentioning that simply doubling the mass of a molecule with a radius of 5.21 nm would yield a new radius of 6.7 nm. The bigger value measured experimentally probably reflects the fact that the two molecules lie adjacent to one another on the 50-dp duplex DNA.Our mea"
https://openalex.org/W2090442581,"Cytosolic GTP-bound Ras has been shown to act as a dominant negative (DN) inhibitor of Ras by sequestering Raf in non-productive cytosolic complexes. Nevertheless, this distinct class of DN mutants has been neither well characterized nor extensively used to analyze Ras signaling. In contrast, DN Ras17N, which functions by blocking Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, has been well characterized and is widely used. Cytosolic GTP-bound Ras mutants could be used to inhibit particular Ras effectors by introducing additional mutations (T35S, E37G or Y40C) that permit them to associate selectively with and inhibit Raf, RalGDS, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase, respectively. When the wild-type Ras effector binding region is used, cytosolic Ras should associate with all Ras effectors, even those that are not yet identified, making these DN Ras mutants effective inhibitors of multiple Ras functions. We generated cytosolic GTP-bound H-, N-, and K-Ras, and we assessed their ability to inhibit Ras-induced phenotypes. In fibroblasts, cytosolic H-, N-, and K-Ras inhibited Ras-induced Elk-1 activation and focus formation, induced a flattened cell morphology, and increased adhesion to fibronectin through modulation of a β1-subunit-containing integrin, thereby demonstrating that DN activity is not limited to a subset of Ras isoforms. We also generated cytosolic GTP-bound Ras effector domain mutants (EDMs), each of which reduced the ability of cytosolic GTP-bound Ras proteins to inhibit Elk-1 activation and to induce cell flattening, implicating multiple pathways in these phenotypes. In contrast, Ras-induced focus formation, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-, or Ras-induced phospho-Akt levels and cell adhesion to fibronectin were affected by T35S and Y40C EDMs, whereas PDGF- or Ras-induced phospho-Erk levels were affected only by the T35S EDM, implying that a more limited set of Ras-mediated pathways participate in these phenotypes.

These data constitute the first extensive characterization of this functionally distinct class of DN Ras inhibitor proteins. The small GTPase, Ras, is involved in numerous aspects of normal cellular metabolism including proliferation, survival/apoptosis, differentiation, and adhesion/motility (1.Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ras must be localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where, in its GTP-bound active form, it translocates cytosolic effector proteins such as Raf kinase, Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RalGDS), 1The abbreviations used are: RalGDSRal guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulatorPI3-Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseDNdominant negativePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorEDMseffector domain mutantsPBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumBSAbovine serum albuminCAAXcysteine aliphatic aliphatic any amino acidHAhemagglutininFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) to the membrane for subsequent activation. Ras is anchored at the membrane as the result of a series of post-translational modifications beginning with the attachment of a farnesyl isoprenoid to a conserved cysteine residue (cysteine 186 in H- and N-Ras; cysteine 185 in K-Ras) located within the “C AAXbox,” a motif consisting of the carboxyl-terminal four amino acids of Ras. Mutation of the C AAX cysteine therefore prevents both Ras farnesylation and membrane association, leaving the Ras protein unprocessed in the cytosol, where the mutationally active, GTP-bound form can bind effector proteins but without translocating them to the membrane for activation. Thus, cytosolic GTP-bound H-Ras(C186S) is thought to act as a dominant negative (DN) inhibitor of normal Ras signaling (2.Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 3.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell.

Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), a distinct class of DN Ras that is well characterized (reviewed in Ref. 2.Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Ras(S17N) is membrane-localized but GDP-bound. Therefore, Ras(S17N) fails to bind effector proteins but instead binds tightly to guanine nucleotide exchange factors, sequestering them in non-productive complexes and thereby preventing them from activating Ras. The Ras(G15A) mutant is also of this class of DN, although it is considered to be nucleotide-free and therefore even more efficient at sequestering Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Ras(S17N) is widely used as a specific inhibitor of Ras activation and has proven useful in defining the role of Ras in a variety of cellular functions (2.Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Despite their potential utility as biochemical tools to study Ras signaling, cytosolic GTP-bound Ras proteins are not well characterized, and literature regarding them is limited. Cytosolic GTP-bound Ras(G12V) was originally shown to inhibit Ras-induced germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus oocytes (6.Gibbs J.B. Schaber M.D. Schofield T.L. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), implying the existence of a cytosolic factor required for Ras function. Later, Ras(S17N) and cytosolic GTP-bound Ras were shown to inhibit preferentially signaling by wild-type and oncogenic Ras, respectively (3.Stacey D.W. Feig L.A. Gibbs J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4053-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is consistent with their different mechanisms of action. We have shown previously (4.Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) that cytosolic GTP-bound H-Ras(Q61L), generated pharmacologically by treatment with an inhibitor of the Ras-prenylating enzyme farnesyltransferase, forms nonproductive cytosolic complexes with Raf and prevents Raf activation. Similar results were obtained using H-Ras(G12V) rendered cytosolic by mutation of the farnesylated cysteine (7.Miyake M. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether N- or K-Ras can also act as DN inhibitors, whether DN activity is dependent on the Ras-activating mutation (position 12 versus 61), or whether Ras effectors other than Raf can be functionally blocked. One potential advantage of cytosolic GTP-bound Ras is that additional single mutations (e.g. at residues 35, 37, and 40) can be introduced within the Ras effector binding domain (residues 32–40) that selectively impair Ras association with specific effector proteins (8.White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), including the most well characterized Ras effectors, the serine/threonine kinase Raf, PI3-K, and RalGDS. Ras effector domain mutants (EDMs) are well characterized and, in their fully processed and membrane-localized forms, have been used extensively to demonstrate that individual Ras effector pathways are sufficient to induce particular Ras-dependent phenotypes (see for example Refs.8.White M.A. Nicolette C.

We envisioned that, in a complementary way, the unprocessed and therefore cytosolic GTP-bound Ras EDMs could be used to selectively impair Ras signaling through specific effectors and to show that particular pathways are necessary for Ras-dependent phenotypes. To characterize the potential of cytosolic GTP-bound Ras EDM proteins to act as DN inhibitors of Ras activity, we generated a series of unprocessed, oncogenically activated H-, N-, and K-Ras4B mutants to study various phenotypes that are altered during Ras-induced transformation, including activation of transcription factors and signaling intermediates and changes in cell morphology and adhesion. Together, our data characterize the function of cytosolic GTP-bound H-, N-, and K-Ras4B proteins and demonstrate that they can be used effectively as DN inhibitors of Ras-dependent signaling, thereby permitting the dissection of Ras signaling pathways in ways different from those of the more conventional Ras(S17N) and Ras(G15A) DN mutants. The following unprenylated Ras mutants were generated by PCR by methods described previously (16.Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson II, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using templates containing activating mutations at either position 12 or position 61: H-Ras(G12V/C186S), H-Ras(G12V/T35S/C186S), H-Ras(G12V/E37G/C186S), H-Ras(G12V/Y40C/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/T35S/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/E37G/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/Y40C/C186S), N-Ras(G12D/C186S), N-Ras(G61K/C186S), and K-Ras(G12V/C185S). Mutation of the prenylated cysteine (position 185/186) near the carboxyl terminus was accomplished using mutagenic 3′-PCR primers (University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Nucleic Acids Core Facility). Effector domain mutants (EDMs) were generated from templates that also contained effector domain mutations at positions 35, 37, or 40. PCR primers were designed to introduce restriction sites for subcloning of the product into the mammalian expression vectors pZIPneoSV(X)1 (17.Cepko C.L. Roberts B.E. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1984; 37: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) or the pZIP-related vector pZBE-HA (G. Clark, National Institutes of Health). Both vectors drive protein expression from a Moloney murine leukemia virus 5′-long terminal repeat promoter and contain an SV40 origin of replication (16.Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson II, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ras coding sequences in pZBE-HA are fused to the coding sequence for the hemagglutinin epitope (MASSYPYDVPDYASLGGPSS-). The Ras coding sequence of each construct was confirmed before use by automated DNA sequencing (Automated Sequencing Facility, University of North Carolina). NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained humidified at 37 °C in DMEM-H (Invitrogen) with 10% Colorado calf serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) and antibiotics. All luciferase assays were performed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts as described previously (18.Quilliam L.A. Castro A.F. Rogers-Graham K.S. Martin C.B. Der C.J. Bi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23850-23857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNA was precipitated in the presence of high molecular weight carrier DNA (calf-thymus DNA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 125 mm calcium phosphate and layered onto cells for 3–5 h. Cells were washed, shocked in 15% glycerol for 3 min, and returned to complete medium for 48 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. To evaluate the ability of each cytosolic Ras protein to inhibit Elk-1 activation by each membrane-localized Ras protein, NIH 3T3 cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish plated the day before use) were transiently transfected in duplicate with 100 ng of plasmid (pZIP) containing the coding sequence for each membrane-localized GTP-bound Ras protein (to drive Elk-1 activation) along with 1 μg of vector (pZIP or pZBE-HA) or vector containing the coding sequence of each cytosolic Ras protein to inhibit Elk-1 activation. Each transfection also contained 250 ng of a Gal-Elk-1 reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of 5×Gal-Luciferase plasmid (19.Foos G. Galang C.K. Zheng C.F. Hauser C.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Raw data from duplicate samples were averaged and expressed as percent luciferase activity compared with vector co-transfected cells. All assays were performed at least three times, and representative data are displayed ± S.D. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts plated at 2.5 × 105/60-mm dish the day before use were transfected as described above with 100–200 ng of each Ras-expressing construct by calcium phosphate precipitation. After 48 h, cells were passaged into complete medium with selection (750 μg/ml G418) and fed every other day with fresh selection medium. Colonies appeared after 2 weeks, and 40–70 colonies of each cell line were pooled for use. Protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis or by autoradiography following radiolabeling of cells with [35S]cysteine/methionine and immunoprecipitation using Ras-specific antibodies. Similar expression levels were observed for each protein (data not shown). To confirm that apparent functional differences were not because of unusually unstable proteins, we performed pulse-chase assays on each of the stable cell lines. Our data (not shown) indicate that all cytosolic Ras constructs had a half-life comparable to that of membrane-localized H-Ras(Q61L) (i.e.≈22 h (20.Ulsh L.S. Shih T.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)) and that our results were therefore unlikely to result from variations in protein stability. We also confirmed that all unprenylated Ras proteins remained cytosolic by cell fixation in formaldehyde followed by immunofluorescent staining as described previously (21.Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using either anti-HA or anti-pan-Ras antibodies visualized with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. To evaluate the ability of cytosolic Ras proteins to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt and Erk by growth factor stimulation, NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing cytosolic H-Ras(Q61L/C186S), its corresponding effector domain mutants (T35S, E37G, or Y40C), or vector were plated at 1 × 104cells/35-mm dish and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were serum-starved (0.5% serum) overnight and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; Sigma) for 5 min. Alternatively, adherent cells were transfected as described above with 200 ng of oncogenic H-Ras(Q61L) and serum-starved overnight. In either case, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), and 10 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma)) and a phosphatase inhibitor (1 mm sodium vanadate). Lysates were normalized to total protein, and 5 μg of total protein/lane was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis using either anti-phospho(serine 473)-Akt antibody, anti-total Akt antibody, anti-phospho-Erk antibody, or anti-total Erk antibody (all antibodies from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). To demonstrate expression of each cytosolic Ras protein, Western analyses using anti-H-Ras antibody (146-3E4, Quality Biotech, Camden, NJ) were also done to show relative expression levels of cytosolic Ras proteins. Proteins were visualized by ECL (SuperSignal, Pierce). Confluent NIH 3T3 cells in 100-mm dishes were harvested with 4 ml of pre-warmed non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ). Alternatively, cells were removed from the dish using pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) and resuspended in 8 ml of DMEM-H containing 9% bovine calf serum. Adhesion results were similar with both methods. Harvested cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for 40 min at 37 °C, pelleted by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in 8 ml of DMEM-H with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Pentex) but no serum. Cells were washed twice in the same media and manually counted using a hemocytometer. Cells (1 × 104 per well) were loaded in a 96-well plate coated with 1% BSA or 10 ng/ml fibronectin (Enzyme Research, South Bend, IN). Cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C and then washed 5 times with 100 μl of the above media. Adherent cells were quantitated using an assay that measures luciferase activity as a function of intracellular ATP, a co-substrate for luciferase (ATP-lite, Packard Instrument Co.). Cell numbers were determined by comparing luminescence values of samples to a standard curve plotted as luminescence versus known cell number. Number of cells adhering to BSA was defined as nonspecific and subtracted from number of cells adhering to fibronectin. Adhesion was expressed as the ratio (%) of adherent cells to total cells loaded into the assay (1 × 104). To determine whether integrin-specific antibodies could block cell adhesion to fibronectin, subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 30 min in serum-containing growth media. Cells were washed three times in DMEM, 1% BSA to remove serum, counted, and incubated with 40 μg/ml of β1 integrin antibody (CD29, clone Ha2/5; BD PharMingen) or control antibody (clone G235–1; BD PharMingen) at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation with the blocking antibody, 1 × 104 cells were loaded into individual wells of a 96-well plate (Falcon) that had been previously coated with 10 ng/ml human fibronectin (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN). Adhesion was allowed to take place for 25 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed with DMEM, 1% BSA five times to remove unbound cells. The remaining adherent cells were quantitated using the ATP-dependent luminescent assay described above. Results were displayed as the percentage of total cells bound. Subconfluent NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing each cytosolic Ras mutant or vector were harvested with 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA, added to 10 ml of serum-containing media, and allowed to recover for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS, 1% BSA, resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, 1% BSA, and incubated with β1 integrin antibody (CD29, clone Ha2/5 BD PharMingen) in parallel with an isotype-matched control antibody (clone G235–1; BD PharMingen) at 1 μg/ml for 60 min on ice. For detection of β1 integrin, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig Fab′ antibody (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) was used at 10 μg/ml for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed two times in cold PBS, 1% BSA and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Fluorescence was detected by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). To assess the ability of cytosolic Ras proteins to inhibit the growth of oncogenic H-Ras-induced foci on a monolayer of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, cells stably expressing cytosolic Ras proteins or vector were transiently transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (22.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) with 200 ng of pZIP H-Ras(G12V) or H-Ras(Q61L). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 10% CO2 in DMEM-H (Invitrogen) containing 10% Colorado calf serum plus antibiotics and fed every other day. After 2 weeks cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, fixed for 10 min in 75% methanol, 25% acetic acid, stained for 1 min with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol, and washed extensively with water until excess stain was removed. All transfections were done in duplicate. Cytosolic Ras proteins containing GTPase-inactivating mutations have been shown to act as DN inhibitors of Ras signaling, whereas corresponding versions lacking a GTPase-inactivating mutation do not (3.Stacey D.W.

However, these studies were somewhat limited. First, only H-Ras, but not N- or K-Ras, was evaluated for DN activity. Second, direct comparisons between Ras(G12V) and Ras(Q61L) to determine the respective effects of these activating mutations on the potency of DN activity were not performed. Third, although it was shown that Ras-dependent Raf signaling could be inhibited, the potential of cytosolic GTP-bound Ras to inhibit other Ras effectors, such as PI3-K, was not evaluated. To address these points, we generated a series of H-, N-, and K-Ras mutants that were rendered unprenylated and, therefore, cytosolic by cysteine to serine mutations at position 186 (185 in K-Ras). Each protein also contained an activating mutation at either position 12 or 61. These constructs were H-Ras(G12V/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/C186S), N-Ras(G12D/C186S), N-Ras(Q61K/C186S), and K-Ras4B(G12V/C186S). In addition, H-Ras(G12V/C186S) and H-Ras(Q61L/C186S) constructs also containing single mutations in the Ras effector domain (residues 32–40) were generated. Effector domain mutations (EDMs) at positions 35, 37, and 40 were originally identified by their abilities to bind preferentially to and activate the Ras effector Raf, RalGDS, or PI3-K, respectively (8.White M.A. Nicolette C.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, these Ras proteins H-Ras(G12V/T35S/C186S), H-Ras(G12V/E37G/C186S), H-Ras(G12V/Y40C/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/T35S/C186S), H-Ras(Q61L/E37G/C186S), and H-Ras(Q61L/Y40C/C186S) were designed to preferentially block Ras signaling through particular effector pathways. Although the H-Ras constructs but not the N- or K-Ras constructs contained an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, we have shown previously that there is no difference between tagged and untagged Ras proteins in either signaling or transformation (16.Fiordalisi J.J. Johnson II, R.L. Ulku A.S. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether DN activity is specific to H-Ras or a general feature of Ras proteins, we first assessed the ability of cytosolic, activated H-, N-, and K-Ras to inhibit Elk-1 signaling induced by the corresponding membrane-localized forms when co-transfected into NIH 3T3 cells in a transient transcriptional transactivation assay. As shown in Fig. 1, each cytosolic Ras protein was able to inhibit signaling induced by the corresponding membrane-localized Ras protein (45–90% inhibition). Generally, N-Ras mutants inhibited better (85 and 90%) than H-Ras mutants (55 and 70%). Despite equivalent stability, cytosolic K-Ras(G12V) showed the lowest and most variable ability to inhibit its membrane-localized counterpart, suggesting that this Ras isoform may have more limited DN activity than H- or N-Ras DNs. As expected, the DN Ras proteins alone showed no activity in this assay. The data presented in Fig. 1 also show that each cytosolic Ras protein could cross-inhibit Elk-1 signaling induced by other membrane-localized Ras isoforms. In general, each cytosolic GTP-bound N-Ras mutant (G12D or G61K) most strongly inhibited Elk-1 signaling induced by membrane-localized N-Ras, whereas this isoform specificity was not seen with cytosolic GTP-bound H-Ras or K-Ras4B mutants. Moreover, cytosolic N-Ras(G61K) generally had the highest level of DN activity regardless of the identity of the membrane-localized Ras protein being inhibited. Here again, cytosolic K-Ras4B(G12V) displayed the least ability to inhibit Elk-1 activation and produced the most variable results between assays. Overall, these data suggest that DN activity is a general feature of Ras proteins and is not limited to one isoform or to a particular activating mutation. Nevertheless, K-Ras4B(G12V/C185S) showed decreased DN ability compared with H-Ras or N-Ras in this assay. Although it is well established that Elk-1 activation results from Ras signaling through Raf, it is also clear that Elk-1 activation is modulated by Raf-independent inputs (24.Sutor S.L. Vroman B.T.

Furthermore, since all Ras isoforms bind to and activate the three major Ras effectors (Raf, RalGDS, and PI3-K), the DN inhibition of Elk-1 activation by cytosolic Ras proteins shown in Fig. 1 could be mediated by the sequestration of any (or any combination of) Ras effector proteins within the cytosol.

We present here the results of a set of computations that lead to an atomic model of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase heterodimer, Δ1–91RIIα-Cα. The first step in the modeling utilized the crystal structures for the porcine Cα and bovine Δ1–90RIαor rat Δ1–111RIIβ, to homology-model structures of the species and isoforms that had been used in the neutron scattering experiments (bovine Cαsubunit and murine Δ1–91RIIαsubunit, respectively). A docking procedure, constrained by the dimensions and positions of the ellipsoids in the neutron-derived R-C model as well as mutagenesis data, was used to develop “best fit” models for the heterodimer. Simulated annealing, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization were then used to refine the side chain packing at the heterodimer interface. For comparison, the calculations were done using the homology models derived from both the RIα and RIIβ crystal structures. Both resultant models had many similarities. Each predicted similar interfaces. The RIα-based model has 25% more hydrogen bonds than that based on RIIβ, with seven of these potential bonds in common. The distribution of hydrophobic, polar, and charged residues at the interface was similar for both models, with a distribution more characteristic of the exposed surface residues than those in the protein interior. The calculated interface area in each is relatively small (<2000 Å2). The RIα-based model, however, has a significantly better fit with the scattering data and is therefore the one of distinctly higher probability. With its small interface area that has a high proportion of charged and polar residues, the complex appears poised for dissociation, and each subunit existing as a stable entity. This result is consistent with the known physiological events required for cAMP-dependent activation of the kinase.

In the absence of a cAMP signal, the enzyme is inactive and exists as a dimer of dimers, having two identical regulatory (R) and two identical catalytic (C) subunits. The C subunit has the conserved catalytic core structure that is common to the majority of protein kinases. The R subunit has a dimerization domain, followed by a pseudosubstrate sequence that inhibits C subunit activity and two in tandem cAMP-binding domains (in order from the N to C termini). When two cAMP molecules bind to each of the R subunits, the C subunit is activated, presumably via some sort of release of the pseudosubstrate sequence. The activation of the C subunit has been assumed to involve dissociation of the C subunits from the R2homodimer (4.Tsuzuki J. Kiger J.A.

The strongest evidence for the dissociation of the C subunit is the fact that the C subunit, but not R2, is known to cross the nuclear membrane in order to phosphorylate a number of its target proteins (7.Sassone-Corsi P.

Fluorescence energy transfer measurements performed under equilibrium conditions have indicated, however, that full dissociation of C from R2 may not be required for activation and catalysis of phosphorylation (11.Johnson D.A.

The crystal structure of Cα shows that it has the now classical protein kinase bilobal structure, with the catalytic cleft located between the two lobes (14.Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F.

Biol. 1994; 4: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) have shown that binding of peptides that model either substrate or pseudosubstrate sequences results in closure of the catalytic cleft. This closure is achieved via a hinge movement about a conserved Gly residue (Gly125) located in the sequence that joins the two lobes. The crystal structures of the cAMP-binding domain of both the bovine RIα subunit and the rat RIIβ have been solved using the truncation mutants Δ1–90RIα and Δ1–111RIIβ, respectively, each of which is missing the dimerization domain but contains part of the pseudosubstrate sequence and the two in tandem cAMP-binding domains (19.Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Diller T.C Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Only the cAMP-binding domains plus a small part of the interconnecting peptide to the pseudosubstrate sequence are seen in the crystal structures. These crystal structures reveal very similar structures for the individual cAMP-binding domains for each R isoform but with the orientation between the two sites in RIαdiffering from that seen with RIIβ, resulting in the latter having a more compact structure. Based upon deuterium labeling and neutron scattering contrast variation experiments, we previously derived low resolution models for both an R-C heterodimer and the PKA holoenzyme (R2C2) (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A two-ellipsoid model was developed for the Δ1–91RIIα-Cα heterodimer that provided the overall dimensions of each subunit within the complex and their topographical relationship. Similarly, a model for the R2C2 holoenzyme was derived. The holoenzyme was shown to have a dumbbell shape, with the R2 dimerization domain forming the bar of the dumbbell connecting the two globular cAMP-binding lobes, each associated with a C subunit ellipsoid. The centers of mass of the two C subunits are 120 Å apart such that they do not interact. The previously solved crystal structures of the C subunit and of the cAMP-binding domain for R fit reasonably well into the neutron models, showing good agreement between the model ellipsoid dimensions and the overall dimensions of the crystal structures. Of note, based on recent evaluations, the more extended RIαcrystal structure (19.Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) fits significantly better into the neutron ellipsoid model compared with the more compact structure recently solved for RIIβ (20.Diller T.C Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the results of a set of computations that arrive at an atomic model of the Δ1–91RIIα-Cα heterodimer. The data used to develop this model include the neutron scattering-derived two-ellipsoid model for the heterodimer, crystal structures of the R and C subunits, and mutagenesis data identifying points of subunit-subunit contact. The model provides a detailed mapping of the subunit interface and an understanding as to why both nondissociated PKA and the dissociated subunits are each stable in aqueous solution. Sequence alignments were performed by running the program ALIGN from GeneStream (available on the World Wide Web at www2.igh.cnrs.fr/bin/align-guess.cgi). Homology modeling is a technique that uses the known structure (the template) of a protein with a homologous sequence to predict the structure of a protein of interest (the target). The details of our homology modeling method are described elsewhere (21.Tung C.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1999; 17: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To model the main chain structure of the target molecule, those regions aligned with no insertions or deletions between the target and the template molecules are assigned the structure of the corresponding regions in the template molecule. To model the insertions, we used an algorithm we developed previously to model loops (22.Tung C.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23.Ryu K.S. Lee H.Y. Kim S.P. Beauchanp J. Tung C.S. Issacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This algorithm is particularly efficient in the sampling of loop structures with fixed ends (22.Tung C.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To model the side chains, we initially assume that the residues in the target occupy the same space as those in the template. This consideration is very useful when the target protein is folded into a compact structure. In the docking procedure, the two subunits, as structured by the homology modeling, were treated as rigid bodies, and only the C-α coordinates were used. Amino acids were represented as 4-Å radius spheres centered at their respective C-α coordinate positions. The docking procedure was divided into two steps, the first being the coarse docking of the two subunits into the ellipsoid model for the complex derived from the neutron scattering study (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), while the second step is a detailed search in the conformational space around the structures derived from the coarse docking procedure. The coarse docking was achieved by matching the centers of mass and principal moment axes between the two homology-modeled subunits and the ellipsoids of the neutron-derived model. The three principal moment axes of a molecule were derived by diagonalizing the transformation matrix defined as follows (24.Goldstein H. Classical Mechanics. Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, MA1950: 149-151Google Scholar), I=IxxIxyIxzIyxIyyIyzIzxIzyIzzEquation 1 where the diagonal elements are known as the moment of inertia coefficients, and have the form, Ixx=∑i=1nmi·(ri2−xi2)Equation 2 where mi represents the mass of the ith atom, and ri is its position. The off-diagonal elements are designated as products of inertia, a typical one being the following, Ixy=−∑i=1nmi·xi·yiEquation 3 Because of the rotational symmetries of the ellipsoids representing the subunits in the neutron-derived model, there are 16 possible ways to dock the subunits in this coarse docking step. To further delineate these selected structures, we defined three empirical energy terms: Evdw, EC1, and EC2. Evdw is a measure of the van der Waals energy with parameters corresponding to a van der Waals radius of 4.0 Å and a depth of 0.12 Kcal/mol.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and d1 to d6 are the shortest distances between the six residues identified as being in close contact with the interface region (R: Asp141, Lys247; C: Thr195, Trp196, Thr197, Lys217; see below) and the other subunit with qi defined as follows, qi=(di−8)2ifdi>8Equation 5 q:=0ifdi≤8Equation 6 EC2 is a parameter that measures the goodness of fit between the structure and the ellipsoid model. EC2 is defined to be the number of residues that are external to the ellipsoid model. Each residue in the structure that is external to the ellipsoid model is attributed with 1 Kcal/mol of energy. Residues were identified from mutagensis studies with either yeast or mammalian enzyme as either involved or not involved in the R-C interaction; the following residue numbers are for bovine Cα and murine RIIα sequences.

The final structural models obtained from the docking procedures were allowed to relax at room temperature (300 K) by subjecting the complex to a 100-ps run of constrained molecular dynamics using AMBER (26.Weiner S.J.

Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar). During the simulation, the secondary structures in both subunits were maintained to ensure that the molecule did not unfold. The experimentally determined ion pair as well as the residues identified as being in close contact with the interface region were used to constrain the relative orientations of the two subunits. Structures at every 10 ps throughout the simulations were selected and energy-minimized and provided a set of structures that were used to evaluate the detailed interactions between the subunits of the heterodimer. The neutron scattering experiments that provided the ellipsoid models of the PKA heterodimer and holoenzyme were done using bovine Cαsubunit. As the template for homology modeling of the structure of this C subunit form we chose the crystal structure (1CDK in the Protein Data Bank) of the porcine Cα subunit of PKA (16.Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H Huber H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The sequence of the target protein has been determined (28.Wiemann S. Kinzel V. Pyerin W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number X67154). The sequence identity between the target bovine Cα subunit and the porcine Cαsubunit template is extremely high, with no insertions or deletions and only a single amino acid change. Modeling the target structure based on the template structure was therefore simple and straightforward. The porcine crystal structure (16.Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H Huber H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) is for C complexed with PKI peptide, and hence the catalytic cleft is in its “closed” conformation (17.Olah G.A. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T.R. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since the binding of the R subunit pseudosubstrate domain to the C subunit also results in a closed catalytic cleft (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this model is the best choice for constructing an R-C heterodimer. There are two published crystal structures of the R subunit: bovine Δ1–90RIα (19.Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) (1RGS in the Protein Data Bank) and rat Δ1–111RIIβ (20.Diller T.C Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (1CX4 in the Protein Data Bank). The initial residues from the N terminus of these deletion mutants, including those of the pseudosubstrate sequence, are missing from the crystal structure coordinates, presumably because they are disordered in the crystals. The homology modeling therefore only included residues starting from 112 for bovine RIα and 139 for rat RIIβ. Each of these structures was used, in turn, to develop an RIIα-Cα model in order to compare and contrast the derived heterodimer models and to optimize the final structure against the combined experimental data. The murine Δ1–91RIIα subunit used for previous neutron scattering experiments of PKA heterodimer and holoenzyme was the target sequence (29.Scott J.D. Glaccum M.B. Zoller M.J. Uhler M.D. Helfman D.M. McKnight G.S. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession numberJ02935). This form of RIIα contains the pseudosubstrate and cAMP-binding domains but not the dimerization domain, and thus in combination with the C subunit it produces an R-C heterodimer. The target RIIα sequence is 43% identical to RIα with 22% conservative substitutions and 73% identical to RIIβ with 8% conservative substitutions. In addition, RIα has three insertions (11 additional residues) and RIIβ has two insertions (9 additional residues) compared with RIIα. The alignments of the template and target sequences are shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel). The homology-modeled structures of the target molecule as well as the structure of the template molecules are shown at the lower panel of Fig. 1. The root mean square deviations between the main chain atoms in the aligned residues of the template and the target molecules are small (<1 Å) for both the RIα and RIIβtemplates. The insertions in the target molecules are shown in yellow. The insertions are not close to the interface area and hence will not influence the modeling of the interface. The template R subunits used in both cases here were the cAMP-bound crystal structures (19.Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 20.Diller T.C Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our previous x-ray scattering data show that there is no change in the overall shape of RIIα upon cAMP binding (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cAMP-bound protein is a suitable template structure to determine the target R subunit structure. The structure of RIIα derived from neutron scattering studies appears to better match the crystal structure for RIα. The crystal structures for RIα and RIIβ differ predominantly in the relative orientations of the two cAMP-binding domains, which are otherwise individually similarly structured in the two forms. This difference in orientation results in RIIβ having a significantly more compact structure. Overlay of the neutron-derived ellipsoid model for RIIα with the two crystal structures shows a better fit for RIα, with the more bent RIIβ structure protruding more out of the highly asymmetric, cigar-shaped ellipsoid model for RIIα. Thirty-five more residues were external to the neutron scattering-derived ellipsoid for RIIβcompared with RIα. The compaction of RIIβcan be seen in the radius of gyrations (Rg) and maximum linear dimensions (dmax) calculated for the crystal structures (RIIβ Rg = 19 Å and dmax = 63 Å; RIα Rg = 21 Å and dmax = 72 Å, respectively). The higher values for RIα also better match the values for RIIα obtained from the scattering studies for RIIα (Rg = 23 Å and dmax = 86 Å) (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although the scattering data include contributions from the pseudosubstrate region that is missing from the crystal structures; hence, direct comparison is not possible. Despite these apparent differences, we nonetheless chose to pursue modeling the RIIα-Cα interaction based upon both R crystal structures at this stage for the purposes of comparison and to see how robust our modeling approach is. From studies with either homologous mammalian or yeast enzymes (25.Gibson R.M. Ying J.B. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Gibbs C.S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6843-6846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), five residues on the Cα subunit have been identified as probably being involved in the R-C interaction: Thr195, Trp196, Thr197, Lys213, and Lys217 (see “Materials and Methods”). These are residues that are not part of the pseudosubstrate binding domain; nor do they directly contribute to phosphotransferase activity. Similar mutation studies have identified five residues on the RIα subunit as involved in binding C (25.Gibson R.M. Ying J.B. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Gibson R.M. Ji-Buechler Y. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16343-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar): Asp140, Glu143, Asp170, Lys242, and Asp258 (see “Materials and Methods”). From the aligned sequences, these residues map to Asp141, Gln144, Asp171, Lys247, and Glu263 on the RIIαsubunit and Asp157, Gln160, Asp187, Lys263, and Glu279 on the RIIβsubunit. Compensatory mutation studies further indicate a direct electrostatic bridge between the subunits involving Glu143on RIα and Lys213 on Cα (25.Gibson R.M. Ying J.B. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1825-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Residue Glu143 of RIα maps to Gln144 of RIIα and Gln160 of RIIβ in the aligned sequences, and because Gln is not charged, it cannot form an ion pair. However, the residue immediately 5′ to this Gln residue is a Glu on both RII isoforms (Glu143 on RIIα and Glu159 on RIIβ) and therefore in both an ideal candidate for forming an ion pair with Lys213 on Cα. This ion pair was used as a key anchor in the modeling to determine the initial orientation of the R and C subunits with respect to each other. Two full sets of computations were completed to develop alternate models for the RIIα-Cα interaction. The first used the RIα crystal structure based homology model for RIIα, while the second followed the same protocol but used the RIIβ crystal structure to model RIIα. Described now in detail are the computations for RIα-based structure. The first step in docking the R and C subunits was a coarse docking in which the centers of mass and principal moment axes were determined for the homology-modeled murine Δ1–90RIIα and bovine Cα coordinates (see “Materials and Methods”). These axes and centers are illustrated in Fig. 2 in relationship to the Cαmain chain structures for R (upper left) and C (upper right). Each subunit could then be aligned with the center of mass and principal moment axes of its respective ellipsoid in the heterodimer model derived from the neutron scattering data (1.Zhao J. Hoye E. Boylan S. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30448-30459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This type of relationship is illustrated in the lower center of Fig. 2. With its highly asymmetric ellipsoid, the placement of R could be done with more precision compared with C, which is more globular and symmetric overall. Due to the rotational symmetries of the ellipsoids in the neutron model, each of the subunits can be placed in four different orientations (by rotating 180° with respect to each of the principal moment axes), giving a total of 16 possible configurations for the dimer. Of these 16 configurations, however, only four allow the R-Glu143 and C-Lys213 ion pair to form, thereby restricting the number of possible configurations from this first modeling iteration to the four configurations (A–D) illustrated in the lower part of Fig. 2. The second step in the docking was a detailed search in the configuration space around the four heterodimer structures derived from the coarse docking procedure and the ion pair constraint.

Here, we were interested in regulation of GFRP expression by proinflammatory cytokines and stimuli, which are known to induce GTP cyclohydrolase I expression. Recombinant human GFRP stimulated recombinant human GTP cyclohydrolase I in the presence of phenylalanine and mediated feedback inhibition by tetrahydrobiopterin. Levels of GFRP mRNA in human myelomonocytoma (THP-1) cells remained unaltered by treatment of cells with interferon-γ or interleukin-1β, but were significantly down-regulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml), without or with cotreatment by interferon-γ, which strongly up-regulated GTP cyclohydrolase I expression and activity. GFRP expression was also suppressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with 1 μg/ml LPS, as well as in rat tissues 7 h post intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg LPS. THP-1 cells stimulated with interferon-γ alone showed increased pteridine synthesis by addition of phenylalanine to the culture medium. Cells stimulated with interferon-γ plus LPS, in contrast, showed phenylalanine-independent pteridine synthesis. These results demonstrate that LPS down-regulates expression of GFRP, thus rendering pteridine synthesis independent of metabolic control by phenylalanine.

GTP cyclohydrolase I feedback regulatory protein lipopolysaccharide isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside human umbilical vein endothelial cells high performance liquid chromatography GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) is the first and key enzyme of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. Tetrahydrobiopterin is required as cofactor for certain hydroxylases, including phenylalanine-4-, tyrosine-3-, tryptophan-5-, and glyceryl ether-monooxygenase, as well as nitric-oxide synthase (1Thöny B. Auerbach G. Blau N. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). To ensure efficient degradation of phenylalanine by phenylalanine hydroxylase, GTP cyclohydrolase I activity and hence tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis is stimulated by phenylalanine, but not by other substrates of tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent enzymes. On a molecular level, this regulation is achieved by a small (9.7 kDa) regulatory protein associated with GTP cyclohydrolase I (2Harada T. Kagamiyama K. Hatakeyama K.

Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On a molecular level, this regulation is achieved by increased transcription/translation, yielding increased GTP cyclohydrolase I protein levels (8Plüss C. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Pfeilschifter J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Golderer G. Werner E.R. Heufler C. Strohmaier W. Gröbner P. Werner-Felmayer G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A role for this induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I by proinflammatory stimuli is the supply of sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin for the abundant formation of nitric oxide by the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase, which is induced in parallel (7Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).In the present work we investigated the role of GFRP in cytokine-induced tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. We present evidence that GFRP is down-regulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cultured human cells and in rats in vivo, thus rendering tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis independent of metabolic control by phenylalanine.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper we studied the influence of proinflammatory stimuli on the expression of GFRP. We show that LPS down-regulates expression of GFRP in two cultured human cells as well as in rats treated with LPS in vivo. This finding was unexpected, since we had anticipated that GFRP would be induced together with the protein it regulates, i.e. with GTP cyclohydrolase I. In the case of LPS stimulation, just the opposite is the case. Parallel to the strong induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I, GFRP mRNA is down-regulated. This renders GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the cells independent of the metabolic control by l-phenylalanine. A goal of the induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I by proinflammatory stimuli is to provide sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin for optimal formation of nitric oxide from l-arginine by the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which is induced in parallel to GTP cyclohydrolase I (7Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By down-regulation of GFRP, accumulation of tetrahydrobiopterin in cells is potentially maximized due to down-regulation of the feedback inhibitory mechanism. In addition, the metabolic control by phenylalanine, which is not required in the context of immunologically triggered nitric oxide formation, is switched off.The time course of the down-regulation of GFRP mRNA by LPS (Fig.2 C) and mRNA stability data (Fig. 2 D) suggest that this down-regulation is caused by decreased transcription of GFRP mRNA. Unfortunately, the expression of GFRP in the cells is too low to allow for a direct examination of transcription rates by nuclear run on assays due to sensitivity limitations. In our rat experiments, we found significant decreases of GFRP upon LPS treatment in all organs investigated except for the brain. The reason for this exception might be that LPS is applied intraperitoneally to the animals, and that the blood-brain barrier protects the brain from most of this peripherally administered LPS.This paper is the first to describe regulation of human GTP-cyclohydrolase I by human GFRP, all other studies had been done with the corresponding rat proteins. Consistent with our observations of neopterin formation by intact THP-1 cells, we find that phenylalanine not only overcomes feedback inhibition by tetrahydrobiopterin, but is also a stimulator of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the absence of added tetrahydrobiopterin. This is in line with observations on GFRP expressing serotonin neurons (14Kapatos G. Hirayama K. Shimoji M. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as well as on purified rat proteins (15Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Compared with previous studies (2Harada T. Kagamiyama K. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) we needed somewhat higher tetrahydrobiopterin concentrations to achieve feedback inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase I, which may be explained by different experimental conditions rather than by differences in the enzymatic properties. In contrast to these previous studies (2Harada T. Kagamiyama K. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we used standard GTP cyclohydrolase I assay conditions,i.e. saturating levels of GTP (2 mm instead of 0.2 mm) and higher salt concentrations (0.3 mKCl instead of 0.1 m KCl) to ensure a specific interaction of the components and to avoid artifacts due to GTP limitation.While treatment of THP-1 cells with LPS in addition to interferon-γ abolished the stimulating effect of phenylalanine, the feedback inhibition by sepiapterin apparently did not change. Similarly, dopamine neurons, which did not express GFRP and showed tetrahydrobiopterin levels unaltered by phenylalanine, were still susceptible to feedback inhibition by dihydroneopterin (14Kapatos G. Hirayama K. Shimoji M. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, either low levels of GFRP still mediated feedback inhibition by pterins but can no longer mediate phenylalanine effects, or yet unknown proteins different from GFRP may be responsible for this effect. GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) is the first and key enzyme of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. Tetrahydrobiopterin is required as cofactor for certain hydroxylases, including phenylalanine-4-, tyrosine-3-, tryptophan-5-, and glyceryl ether-monooxygenase, as well as nitric-oxide synthase (1Thöny B.

In addition to the metabolic roles mentioned above, GTP cyclohydrolase I is induced by proinflammatory cytokines in a number of cells and tissues (6Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Fuchs D. Hausen A.

Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On a molecular level, this regulation is achieved by increased transcription/translation, yielding increased GTP cyclohydrolase I protein levels (8Plüss C. Werner E.R. Wachter H. Pfeilschifter J.

J. 2001; 355: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A role for this induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I by proinflammatory stimuli is the supply of sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin for the abundant formation of nitric oxide by the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase, which is induced in parallel (7Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the present work we investigated the role of GFRP in cytokine-induced tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. We present evidence that GFRP is down-regulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in cultured human cells and in rats in vivo, thus rendering tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis independent of metabolic control by phenylalanine. DISCUSSIONIn the present paper we studied the influence of proinflammatory stimuli on the expression of GFRP. We show that LPS down-regulates expression of GFRP in two cultured human cells as well as in rats treated with LPS in vivo. This finding was unexpected, since we had anticipated that GFRP would be induced together with the protein it regulates, i.e. with GTP cyclohydrolase I. In the case of LPS stimulation, just the opposite is the case. Parallel to the strong induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I, GFRP mRNA is down-regulated. This renders GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the cells independent of the metabolic control by l-phenylalanine. A goal of the induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I by proinflammatory stimuli is to provide sufficient tetrahydrobiopterin for optimal formation of nitric oxide from l-arginine by the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which is induced in parallel to GTP cyclohydrolase I (7Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Mayer B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By down-regulation of GFRP, accumulation of tetrahydrobiopterin in cells is potentially maximized due to down-regulation of the feedback inhibitory mechanism. In addition, the metabolic control by phenylalanine, which is not required in the context of immunologically triggered nitric oxide formation, is switched off.The time course of the down-regulation of GFRP mRNA by LPS (Fig.2 C) and mRNA stability data (Fig. 2 D) suggest that this down-regulation is caused by decreased transcription of GFRP mRNA. Unfortunately, the expression of GFRP in the cells is too low to allow for a direct examination of transcription rates by nuclear run on assays due to sensitivity limitations. In our rat experiments, we found significant decreases of GFRP upon LPS treatment in all organs investigated except for the brain. The reason for this exception might be that LPS is applied intraperitoneally to the animals, and that the blood-brain barrier protects the brain from most of this peripherally administered LPS.This paper is the first to describe regulation of human GTP-cyclohydrolase I by human GFRP, all other studies had been done with the corresponding rat proteins. Consistent with our observations of neopterin formation by intact THP-1 cells, we find that phenylalanine not only overcomes feedback inhibition by tetrahydrobiopterin, but is also a stimulator of GTP cyclohydrolase I activity in the absence of added tetrahydrobiopterin. This is in line with observations on GFRP expressing serotonin neurons (14Kapatos G. Hirayama K. Shimoji M. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), as well as on purified rat proteins (15Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K.

Similarly, dopamine neurons, which did not express GFRP and showed tetrahydrobiopterin levels unaltered by phenylalanine, were still susceptible to feedback inhibition by dihydroneopterin (14Kapatos G. Hirayama K. Shimoji M. Milstien S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2134819882,"Hyaluronan (HA) synthase (HAS) is a membrane-bound enzyme that utilizes UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and UDP-GlcNAc to synthesize HA. The HAS from Streptococcus pyogenes (spHAS, 419 amino acids) contains six Cys residues, whereas the enzyme from Streptococcus equisimilis (seHAS, 417 amino acids) contains four Cys residues. These Cys residues of seHAS are highly conserved in all Class I HAS family members. Here we investigated the structural and functional roles of these conserved cysteines in seHAS by using site-directed mutagenesis and sensitivity to sulfhydryl modifying reagents. Both seHAS and spHAS were inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and iodoacetamide in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. These inhibition curves were biphasic, indicating the presence of sensitive and insensitive components. After treatment of seHAS with NEM, theVmax value was decreased ∼50%, and theKm values changed only slightly. All the Cys-to-Ala mutants of seHAS were partially active. The least active single (C226A), double (C226A,C262A), or triple (C226A,C262A,C367A) Cys mutants retained 24, 3.2, and 1.4% activity, respectively, compared with wild-type enzyme. Surprisingly, the Vmaxvalue of the seHAScys-null mutant was ∼17% of wild-type, although the Km values for both substrates were increased 3–6-fold. Cys residues, therefore, are not involved in a critical interaction necessary for either substrate binding or catalysis. However, the distribution of HA products was shifted to a smaller size in ∼25% of the seHAS Cys mutants, particularly the triple mutants. Mass spectroscopic analysis of wild-type and Cys-null seHAS as well as the labeling of all double Cys-to-Ala mutants with [14C]NEM demonstrated that seHAS contains no disulfide bonds. We conclude that the four Cys residues in seHAS are not directly involved in catalysis, but that one or more of these Cys residues are located in or near substrate binding or glycosyltransferase active sites, so that their modification hinders the functions of HAS.

HA is a linear hetero-polysaccharide consisting of repeating (GlcUAβ(1,3)-GlcNAcβ(1,4)) disaccharide units (1.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

HA is a ubiquitous component of extracellular matrices in vertebrates. This glycosaminoglycan is present in large amounts to serve specialized functions in cartilage, synovial fluid, dermis, and the vitreous humor of the eye (1.Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E.

In many Group A and Group C streptococcal strains, HA forms a capsule that helps these pathogens evade the host immune system during infection (5.Fenderson B.A. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A.

The single HAS polypeptide binds both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcUA and transfers these two different precursor sugars to the growing HA chain (the bound acceptor) via two different linkages. In addition to these five discrete substrate binding or catalytic functions, HAS is able to extrude or translocate the growing HA chain into the extracellular space while it remains bound to the enzyme at the plasma membrane (25.Philipson L.H.

Two recombinant prokaryotic HASs, spHAS and seHAS, have been purified and characterized kinetically (24.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Kumari K. Heldermon C. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

All recombinant HASs, either from vertebrates or prokaryotes, have been shown to synthesize high molecular weight HA in vitro. The Class I HAS proteins likely have essentially identical topological organizations in their N-terminal regions that are highly homologous with spHAS, the only HAS whose membrane topology has been determined experimentally (22.Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the possibility that one or more of the conserved Cys residues in seHAS may be necessary for one of the six discrete HAS functions. Beginning in the 1950s almost all studies of prokaryotic or eukaryotic HAS function have used isolated membranes, in part because most of the eukaryotic HAS enzymes cannot be detergent-solubilized with retention of activity. Therefore, we performed a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification, and kinetic analyses using isolated membranes to characterize the structural and functional role(s) of Cys in seHAS. The expression vector pKK223 was from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.. Escherichia coli SURE cells were from Stratagene. The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene. All of the mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (Spring, TX) and were purified by reverse-phase chromatography. Cy-5 fluorescent sequencing primers were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Resource Facility, Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center. Other oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by The Great American Gene Co. (Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc., CA). UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were from Fluka and Sigma, respectively. UDP-[14C]GlcUA (300 mCi/mmol) and [14C]NEM (40 mCi/mmol)were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NEM and biotin-PEO-maleimide were from Sigma. All other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The seHAS gene with a fusion at the 3′ end encoding a His6 tail (seHAS-His6) was cloned into pKK233 as described earlier (27.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers were designed to change the cysteines to either Ala or Ser at positions 226, 262, 281, and 367. Two complementary oligonucleotide primers encoding the desired mutation were used to create the single Cys mutations (Table I). Mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange method according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pKK233 plasmid containing the seHAS-His6 gene was grown in SURE cells, purified using a Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen), and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the correct size. The purified pDNA was used as the template for the primer extension reaction with a pair of mutagenic primers. The PCR amplification conditions for PCR, using Pfu DNA polymerase, were 16 cycles of the following: 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 18 min. This amplification generated mutated plasmids with staggered nicks, which were then treated with DpnI to digest the methylated and hemi-methylated parental DNA. The digested pDNA was transformed into SURE cells, and colonies were screened for the desired mutations by sequencing the isolated plasmid DNA using fluorescently labeled terminators (ABI Prism 377 MODEL program, v2.1.1). The complete open reading frames of selected mutants were confirmed by sequencing in both directions with Cy-5-labeled vector primers on a Amersham Biosciences, Inc. ALF Express DNA Sequencer. Data were analyzed using ALF Manager, v3.02. The double, triple, and null Cys mutants of seHAS-His6 were made using the appropriate single, double, or triple Cys mutant plasmid DNA as the template, respectively.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used to make seHAS mutantsseHAS mutantSequenceC226A5′-GGTAATATCCTTGTTGCCTCAGGTCCGCTTAGCC226S5′-GGTAATATCCTTGTTTCCTCAGGTCCGCTTAGCC262A5′-ATTGGTGATGACAGGGCCTTGACCAACTATGCAC262S5′-ATTGGTGATGACAGGTCCTTGACCAACTATGCAC281A5′-CAATCCACTGCTAAAGCTATTACAGATGTTCCTC281S5′-CAATCCACTGCTAAATCTATTACAGATGTTCCTC367A5′-TTCATTGTTGCCCTGGCTCGGAACATTCATTACC367S5′-TTCATTGTTGCCCTGTCTCGGAACATTCATTACThe boldface font indicates the altered codon.

E. coli SURE cells transformed with plasmids containing various seHAS mutants were grown in LB medium with vigorous shaking at 32 °C to a A600 ∼ 0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested, and membranes were prepared as described previously (28.Ito K. Sato T. Yura T. Cell. 1977; 11: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The initial activities for HAS were determined at 37 °C in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTE, 240 μm UDP-GlcUA, 0.7 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA, and 0.6–1.0 mm UDP-GlcNAc. The kinetic constants for both UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were determined in 100 μl of 25 mm sodium and potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 μm UDP-[14C]GlcUA, and various amounts of one substrate (0.01–4 mm) while holding the other constant at 1 mm. Some assays also contained 0.1 mm EDTA and 20% glycerol (v/v). To initiate the enzyme reaction, ∼0.5–40 μg of membrane protein was added, and the mixtures were gently shaken in a MicroMixer X-36 (Taitec) at 30 °C for 1–2 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). The incorporation of radioactive [14C]GlcUA was determined by descending paper chromatography, and theKm and Vmax values were determined as described by Tlapak-Simmons et al. (24.Tlapak-Simmons V.L.

Data were analyzed by the methods of Michaelis-Menten (29.Michaelis L. Menten M.L. Biochem. Z. 1913; 49: 333-338Google Scholar) or Hill (30.Hill A.V. Biochem. J. 1913; 7: 471-480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. All Cys mutant or sulfhydryl-treated seHAS samples were assayed in duplicate or triplicate using two or three independent membrane preparations. The results are presented as the mean ± S.E. All enzyme assays were performed under conditions that were linear with respect to time and protein concentration. None of the seHAS variant enzymes were unstable under the conditions employed. The relative Mr of the HA synthesized by wild-type seHAS or the Cys mutants was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (32.Lee H.G. Cowman M.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) of 14C-labeled HA products synthesized under the assay conditions described above. The wild-type seHAS synthesizes and releases an HA chain in <5 min under these steady-state conditions (18.Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) so that each enzyme molecule on average synthesizes >10 HA chains during the incubation. The reactions were terminated by heating at 95 °C for 1 min, the mixtures were then centrifuged at high speed, and the HA-containing supernatants were recovered. The samples were concentrated ∼10-fold using Microcon YM-3 filters (Amicon Bioseparations, Inc.) and treated with DNase and RNase (4 μg/ml each) in the presence of 60 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 22 °C. The samples and a combination of DNA standards were then electrophoresed on a 1.3% (w/v) agarose gel at 80–90 V. The gels were dried without heating and exposed to Biomax-MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–4 weeks. The autoradiograms were scanned to create digital files using a FluorchemTM8000 (Alpha Innotech Corp.) image analysis station. As a control, samples were treated withStreptomyces hyaluronate lyase (80 units) at 37 °C overnight, which resulted in the complete loss of radiolabeled bands. The recombinant seHAS protein in isolated membranes is a major component comprising ∼5–8% of the total protein, is well separated from other major proteins by SDS-PAGE, and can be readily identified in Coomassie Blue-stained gels (18.Kumari K. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32539-32546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).E. coli membranes containing wild-type or mutant seHASs were solubilized and electrophoresed on 10% (w/v) gels following the procedure of Laemmli for SDS-PAGE (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). The amount of seHAS protein in each membrane preparation was quantitated by image analysis of the stained gel using a FluorchemTM8000 (Alpha Innotech Corp). The linearity of Coomassie Blue-stained seHAS bands was verified by loading different amounts of membrane protein. To generate a standard curve, various amounts of affinity-purified seHAS-His6 were subjected to identical SDS-PAGE, and the integrated density value was determined for each band. The integrated density values were plotted against pmol of pure seHAS (e.g. see Fig. 1 in Ref. 22.Heldermon C.D. DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2037-2046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The integrated density value values for seHAS bands in membranes containing wild-type or mutant proteins were then compared with the standard to estimate the seHAS protein content per mg of membrane protein. These data were then used to normalize the seHAS enzyme activity in the membrane preparations for wild-type and each variant seHAS. Stock solutions (10–100 mm) of NEM, iodoacetamide, or other sulfhydryl reagents were made in PBS, pH 7.0. Suspensions of membranes containing seHAS or spHAS were incubated with 0–5 mm sulfhydryl reagent at 4 °C, and the reactions were stopped by adding DTE to a final concentration of 10 mm. The membranes were then assayed for HAS activity as described above. Isolated membranes from wild-type seHAS and each of the six double Cys mutants of seHAS were incubated at 4 °C with 2.5 mm[14C]NEM (∼8 × 106 dpm) for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of DTE to a final concentration of 5 mm. Total membrane proteins were precipitated by incubation with 10% trichloroacetic acid overnight at 4 °C, and free [14C]NEM was then removed by two cycles of centrifugation and resuspension with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 1× SDS Laemmli sample buffer (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar), neutralized by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10% gel. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel was scanned using a model PDSIP60 densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) then treated with scintillants and subjected to fluorography using Biomax-MR (Kodak) film and an exposure of ∼1 week. E. colimembranes prepared from cells transformed with vector alone, containing no seHAS, were included as a control. As previously described (27.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), wild-type seHAS-His6 was bound to a Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid chelate resin (Qiagen), washed, and treated with biotin-PEO-maleimide (10 mg/ml) for 2 h on ice. After washing the column, the enzyme was eluted with distilled water containing 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 0.02% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside. The degree of modification of Cys residues in treated seHAS samples was determined using a MALDI-TOF Voyager Elite mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) that was equipped with a N2 laser (337 nm), located in the National Science Foundation EPSCoR Oklahoma Laser Mass Spectrometry Facility. The sample (1 μl) was spotted to a sample plate followed by matrix solution (1 μl) and allowed to air dry. The matrix used was a 20 mg/ml solution of 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.05% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside. Samples were analyzed in the linear, positive ion mode using a delayed extraction of 300 ns and a grid voltage of 87.8% and were subject to a 25 kV accelerating voltage. External and internal calibrations were routinely performed using horse apomyoglobin and bovine serum albumin (16,951 and 66,430 Da, respectively). Spectra were an average of 80–120 scans and were processed using the 19-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing option included in the software provided by the manufacturer. SeHAS is the smallest HAS protein (417 amino acids) and contains four Cys residues. The four cysteines of seHAS are completely conserved among the three prokaryotic HASs (excluding P. multocida HAS) and are conserved positionally among all the vertebrate HASs (Fig. 1). To explore the possible role of cysteines in the function of HAS, the activities of seHAS and spHAS were assayed in the presence of different sulfhydryl reagents (Table II). Almost identical sensitivities were observed for the two enzymes. For example, seHAS activity was inhibited >93% by methylmethanethiosulfonate (0.05 mm) and ∼70% by NEM (5 mm), whereas iodoacetamide inhibited only 15%. Sodium arsenite and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) also inhibited each HAS activity. These results indicate that one or more Cys residues are important for the overall HA synthesis activity of the seHAS and spHAS proteins. The inhibition of each HAS by NEM was examined in more detail with respect to the time of incubation and NEM concentration (Fig. 2). Both seHAS and spHAS were inhibited in a biphasic manner with respect to incubation time or NEM concentration. Although the extent of inhibition varied from experiment to experiment, a 60–70% effect was typical. About half of the observed inactivation occurred at ≤1 mm NEM, whereas the remaining inactivation occurred from 1 to 6 mm (Fig. 2A). Kinetically, there was a fast initial inactivation and then a much slower phase of inhibition; again, each of the phases involved about half of the affected activity (Fig. 2B). A potential complication in the above NEM studies is that the effects of a sulfhydryl-modifying reagent could be due to secondary effects caused by modification of other molecules in the membranes being tested. Although this possibility is highly unlikely since seHAS is the only protein necessary for HA biosynthesis (21.Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 27.Tlapak-Simmons V.L. Baggenstoss B.A. Clyne T. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4239-4245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of sulfhydryl reagents on the seHAS Cys-null mutant in isolated membranes under the conditions shown in Fig. 3. The activity of seHASCys-null was not affected (≤1%) by treatment with NEM, iodoacetamide, or sodium arsenite, which eliminates the possibility that modified secondary proteins in the membranes preparations were responsible for the altered HAS activity.Table IIEffect of different sulfhydryl reagents on seHAS or spHAS activitySulfhydryl reagentInhibition of HAS ActivityseHASspHAS% relative to controlN-Ethylmaleimide70 ± 4.860 ± 3.5Iodoacetic acid15 ± 6.013 ± 5.45,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)52 ± 6.552 ± 4.9Methylmethanethiosulfonate93 ± 5.489 ± 5.5Sodium arsenite40 ± 4.046 ± 5.1E. coli membranes expressing the recombinant seHAS-His6 or spHAS-His6 proteins were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with PBS containing either 5 mm NEM, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5 mm5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), 0.05 mmmethylmethanethiosulfonate, 10 mm sodium arsenite, or no addition (control).

This region may contain a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) and fold into an I domain-like structure. Two recombinant fragments, β3-(95–373) and β3-(95–301), were expressed and found to bind fibrinogen. Whereas 0.1 mmCa2+ supported ligand binding to both recombinant fragments, 1.0 mm Ca2+ suppressed binding to the longer but not the shorter fragment. These properties suggest that β3-(95–373) contains both the ligand-competent (LC) and inhibitory (I) cation binding sites, and β3-(95–301) lacks the I site. In equilibrium dialysis experiments, β3-(95–373) contained two divalent cation binding sites, one reactive with either Mg2+ or Ca2+ and one Ca2+-specific, whereas β3-(95–301) lacked the Ca2+-specific site. Mutant forms of β3-(95–373) suggested that the LC site is a MIDAS motif involving Asp119, Ser121, Ser123, Asp217, and/or Glu220 as coordination sites, and the I site was dependent upon residues within β3-(301–323). In a molecular model of β3-(95–373), a second Ca2+ could be docked onto a flexible loop in close proximity to the MIDAS. These results indicate that the ligand competent and Ca2+-specific inhibitory cation binding sites are distinct and reside in β3-(95–373).

Cell. 1987; 48: 549-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar), being composed of an α (αIIb) and a β (β3) subunit, which associate to form a noncovalent heterodimer. This integrin is the most abundant membrane protein on the platelet surface and serves as a receptor for multiple adhesive proteins including fibrinogen (Fg). 1The abbreviations used are: FgfibrinogenMIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteHis tagthe MRGSHHHHHHGS sequence at the N terminus of expressed recombinant proteinsLC siteligand competent cation binding siteI siteinhibitory cation binding sitemAbmonoclonal antibody 1The abbreviations used are: FgfibrinogenMIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteHis tagthe MRGSHHHHHHGS sequence at the N terminus of expressed recombinant proteinsLC siteligand competent cation binding siteI siteinhibitory cation binding sitemAbmonoclonal antibody Two sets of peptides (HHLGGAKQAGDV, corresponding to the sequence at the C terminus of the Fg γ-chain (2.Kloczewiak M.

Essential residues for ligand binding to αIIbβ3 reside in two major regions: a midsegment of β3, β3-(95–400), and the amino-terminal aspect of αIIb, αIIb-(1–334) (11.Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E.

The midsegment of the β3 subunit is highly conserved among integrin β subunits and exhibits some structural and functional features of an I domain. I domains are present in nine integrin α subunits and play major roles in the ligand binding functions of their integrin heterodimers (15.Michishita M. Videm V.

In MIDAS motifs, three of the five cation coordination sites are provided by a D XS XS sequence and two other coordination sites are provided by oxygenated residues distant in the primary sequence. Mutations of the cation-coordinating residues in a MIDAS motif often cause loss of ligand binding functions of an integrin, and ligand binding sites map in close proximity to MIDAS motifs (18.Lee J.-O.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12238-12246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To account for the influential role of cations in integrin function, it has been proposed that ligand and cation may share a common binding pocket on the integrin (36.D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A.

One class must be occupied for ligand to bind, the ligand-competent (LC) sites, and the second class is specific for Ca2+ and has an inhibitory effect on ligand binding, the inhibitory (I) site(s). Taking into consideration the significant role of the midsegment of the β3 subunit in the function of αIIbβ3 specifically and integrins in general, in this study we have attempted to map the location of ligand and cation binding sites within this region. Two series of mutants were produced. The first group was obtained by swapping individual homologous segments from the β2 subunit, which does not form high affinity RGD-binding integrins, for the corresponding segment in β3-(95–373). The second group contained mutants in which single amino acid residues known to coordinate cations in authentic I domains, such as in the αL I domain, were substituted by a site-directed mutagenesis. The results provide direct experimental support for the presence of not one but of two cation binding sites in β3-(95–373). The first of these sites displays the characteristics of MIDAS motif and is critical for ligand binding, while the second of these sites exhibits the properties and specificity of the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site. αIIbβ3was isolated from outdated platelets by RGD affinity chromatography (39.Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 40.Lam S.C.T. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Andrieux A. Ryckwaert J.-J. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 947-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm octyl glucoside, pH 7.3, centrifuged for 1 h at 30,000 × g, and applied onto a GRGDSPK-Sepharose column (12 × 2.5 cm). The affinity matrix was equilibrated with the lysis buffer. Detergent extracts of platelet proteins were recycled over the affinity matrix at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed with 10 column volumes of column buffer, identical to lysis buffer except that the octyl glucoside concentration was lowered to 25 mm. Protein remaining bound onto RGD affinity matrix was eluted with buffer containing RGDF (1 mg/ml). Fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7% acrylamide gels in SDS under nonreducing conditions (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207048) Google Scholar). Prior to ligand binding experiments, samples of αIIbβ3 were dialyzed against 0.02m HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, containing 0.15m NaCl, 25 mm octyl glucoside, and selected divalent cations. Two recombinant β3 fragments, β3-(95–301) and β3-(95–373), were produced. Each contains the Val107–Ser292 segment, which corresponds to the putative I domain in the β3 subunit based on its homology to the I domains of αL and αM. Complementary DNAs encoding these fragments were generated by PCR using full-length human β3 cDNA as a template. To express β3-(95–301), a PCR fragment containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites was generated using the following primers: 5′-CTCCGCCTGggatccGATGATTCGAAG-3′ (upper primer) and 5′-CTCATTctcgagTCAGGTGGCATTGAAGGA-3′ (lower primer). To express β3-(95–301), 5′-CTCAATctcgagTCATTTCTGGGATAGCTTCTCAG-3′ replaced the lower primer. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes and inserted into pRSETa (Invitrogen) for expression in Escherichia coli (DH5α; Invitrogen) as His tag fusion proteins containing 12 residues (MRGSHHHHHHGS) at their N termini. To purify the recombinant β3 fragments, inclusion bodies were prepared, dissolved in 6 m urea, and separated by chromatography on chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), loaded with nickel ions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant β3-(95–301) or β3-(95–373) fragments were eluted with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 1.0m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 6 murea. Refolding of β3-(95–301) and β3-(95–373) was performed by dialysis of dilute protein solutions (100–200 μg/ml) against 1000 ml of the elution buffer at 4 °C. Then, the urea concentration was reduced by a continuous, slow drip of 1000 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, into the dialysis solution. Afterward, 1000 ml of the dialysis solution was removed, and the next 1000 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was added by a continuous drip, and this procedure was repeated five times at 4 °C under constant stirring. A final dialysis was then performed against 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.14m NaCl, NaN3 (1 mg/ml). Then the recombinant fragments were concentrated to ∼2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Each fragment migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE of either 31 kDa for β3-(95–373) or 21 kDa for the β3-(95–301). All mutations were created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two sets of mutant β3 fragments were produced. In the first set, individual segments from β3-(95–373) were replaced with the homologous segments from the integrin β2subunit. Nine mutants designated β3(F100-Y110), β3(L128-Q141), β3(K159-P170), β3(C177-C184), β3(L194-G206), β3(Q210-D217), β3(N279-S291), β3(Q301-E312), and β3(T311-S322) were expressed using the mutagenic primers. All were expressed as fusion proteins with His tags and were purified on chelating Sepharose as described above for the wild-type fragments. In the second set of mutants, the cation-coordinating residues of the putative MIDAS motif in the β3 subunit were changed to alanines. The specific mutations and the primers used were as follows: D119A (5′-ggacatctactacttgatggcactgtcttactccatg-3′ and 5′-catggagtaagacagtgccatcaagtagtagatgtcc-3′); S121A (5′-cttgatggacctggcatactccatgaaggatgatctg-3′ and 5′-cagatcatccttcatggagtatgccaggtccatcaag-3′), S123A (5′-ggacctgtcttacgcaatgaaggatgatctgtgg-3′ and 5′-ccacagatcatccttcattgcgtaagacagctac-3′), D217A (5′-gtcacggaaccgagcagccccagagggtggc-3′ and 5′-gccaccctctggggctgctcggttccgtgac-3′), and E220A (5′-ccgagatgccccagcaggtggctttgatgccatc-3′ and 5′-gatggcatcaaagccacctgctggggcatctcgg-3′). All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing and were subsequently subcloned into the pRSETa vector for expression. Human Fg was purified and characterized as described previously (42.Cierniewski C.S. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13896-13901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Fg to immobilized αIIbβ3, β3-(95–301), β3-(95–373), or its mutants was performed as described for intact receptor (35.Cierniewski C.S. Haas T.A. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12238-12246Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, microtiter wells (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were coated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of purified αIIbβ3 or β3 fragments dissolved at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. The plates were then washed and postcoated with 4% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. In binding experiments, 20 μl of 125I-fibrinogen with a specific radioactivity of ∼0.2 μCi/μg was added to each well and mixed with 100-μl aliquots of buffer or inhibitors. The plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. After this and between each preceding step, the wells were washed extensively with Tris buffer. Binding of Fg was determined by direct γ counting of the plastic wells. Nonspecific binding was defined as the residual binding observed in the presence of either 10 μm nonlabeled Fg or 2 mm EDTA (see “Results”). This value was subtracted from the total binding to obtain specific binding values. The amounts of recombinant β3 fragments and mutants bound to the plastic wells were verified to be similar by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a rabbit antiserum raised to β3-(95–373). Complex formation between Fg and β3-(95–373) or β3-(95–301) was also assessed in a fluid phase analysis. Fg (1 mg/ml) and the recombinant fragments of the β3subunit (0.2 mg/ml) were mixed in a total volume of 4 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 m glucose to yield a molar ratio of Fg to the recombinant β3 fragment of 1:3. After 4 h at room temperature, the mixtures were concentrated by centrifugation in 100 K Centricon tubes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and washed three times, each time followed by a concentration step in the Centricon tubes. The retentates were analyzed by electrophoresis on either nondenaturing 7.5% acrylamide gels (43.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10471) Google Scholar) or 12% acrylamide gels containing SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (41.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207048) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+ to purified αIIbβ3, β3-(95–301), β3-(95–373), or its mutants was determined by equilibrium dialysis using a 16-mirocell dialyzer (Sialomed Inc., Columbia, MD). Regulation of the free Ca2+by EGTA was used to obtain the Ca2+ concentrations needed to construct binding isotherms. The buffer used was 50 mmTris, 0.14 m NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 50 mmoctyl glucoside (the equilibrium buffer). Before use, glassware, plasticware, and dialysis tubing were treated as described by Gulino et al. (44.Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L.Y. Concord E. Rabiet M.J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1001-1007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total Ca2+ concentrations were determined by spectrofluorimetry, using Fura-2 and Ca2+standard solutions from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).45Ca2+ was measured in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000LL). Below 10 μm, the required free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by the addition of 7 mm EGTA, as calculated according to Fabiato (45.Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) to account for influence of pH, temperature, and ionic strength on the equilibrium constants used. Demineralization of the analyzed proteins was done by dialysis for 1 h at 22 °C against the equilibrium buffer containing enough EGTA to reduce the free Ca2+ to below 1 nm as described (34.Rivas G.A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dialysis experiments were then performed as follows. Various amounts of 10 mm CaCl2 were added in the equilibrium buffer containing 45Ca2+ (3 μCi/ml) to achieve free Ca2+ concentration between 0.01 and 1000 μm. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from the contaminating Ca2+, determined spectrofluorimetrically, plus the amount of added Ca2+.45CaCl2 (0.48 μCi) was injected into one half-cell, and the proteins were injected into the other one. After dialysis for 24 h at 21 °C, aliquots were removed for45Ca and protein determinations, SDS-PAGE, and ligand binding studies. αIIbβ3 and the recombinant β3-(95–373) mutants were used at the concentration of 5–10 and 30–40 μm, respectively. To test the effects of Mg2+ on Ca2+ binding, the equilibrium dialysis was performed in the presence of 45CaCl2 (500 μm), sufficient to saturate cation binding sites in the β3-(95–373) and its mutants, and serial dilutions of Mg2+, ranging from 0 to 100 mm, were added. The CD spectra of β3-(95–301), β3-(95–373), and various mutants were measured in the 200–260-nm range using a CD6 JOVIN YVON spectropolarimeter at protein concentrations of 80 μmusing 0.1-mm path length cells. The secondary structural content of the fragments was estimated by published protocols (46.Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 47.Sreerama N. Woody R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 497-507PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

Na125I (specific activity 15–17 μCi of 125I/mg of iodine) from Amersham Biosciences was used for radioiodination. Fg was labeled using IODO-GEN (Pierce). The iodinated protein was separated from free Na125I by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P2 column (Bio-Rad). The specific radioactivity of the 125I-Fg ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 Ci/g. Usually, >90% of the radioactivity incorporated into Fg was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid or by a monospecific antiserum. Aliquots of the radioiodinated protein were stored at −20 °C for no longer than 2 weeks before use. Molecular dynamic simulations and model building were carried out using the InsightII and Homology (Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) programs on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station as previously described (49.Haas T.A.

Plow E.F. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The sequence of β3-(82–405) was then aligned to the α2 sequence by sequence homology and by secondary structural predictions (Homology and Jpred). Structures for β3 segments were then assigned from 1zon, 1jlm, and 1aox, and gaps in structure were filled in by the generation and selection of loops. The sides of each loop were then relaxed to remove/reduce atomic overlap and torsions. The charges on the amino acids were adjusted to pH 7.2 using the Biopolymer Program. A minimized energy conformation for β3-(82–405) was then obtained by gradually minimizing the protein structure. A calcium ion was then docked at the MIDAS site and another at the putative I site using the Docking program. The resulting minimized structure was then subjected to a series of molecular dynamic simulations and energy minimizations using a time step of 1 fs and a Van der Waals and an electrostatic cut-off of 12. The resulting structure was then minimized to a maximum derivative of less than 0.05 kcal·(mol·Å)−1 using steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimizations. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) P37 was obtained from Dr. Rodriguez-Gonzalez and reacts with β3-(101–109) (53.Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem.

A polyclonal antibody was raised to β3-(95–373) by immunizing rabbits with the purified recombinant fragment. All of the final data are presented as the means of the averaged replicates ± S.D. The normal distribution of data was confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk's test. The analysis of variance and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons (55.Zar J.H. Biostatistical Analysis. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1984Google Scholar) were employed to assess the significance of differences (pvalues) among groups. Two recombinant fragments of the β3 subunit, β3-(95–301) and β3-(95–373), each containing the putative I domain, β3-(107–272), and its MIDAS, were expressed in E. coli as His tag fusion proteins, purified on nickel chelating columns in 6 m urea, and refolded by sequential dialysis to remove the denaturant. The final products were soluble in aqueous buffers and were homogenous as assessed by SDS-PAGE. When immobilized on microtiter plates, each of the recombinant β3fragments reacted with mAb 937 to β3-(101–109) (53.Calvete J.J. Henschen A. Gonzalez-Rodriguez J. Biochem.

As expected from a structure containing TSP type I motifs, ADAMTS-1 is incorporated into the extracellular matrix (ECM) after secretion from cells (12.Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A competition experiment with soluble heparin suggested that ADAMTS-1 binds to sulfated glycosaminoglycans of the ECM. Analyses of deletion mutants demonstrated that the spacing region of the C-terminal half, as well as the three TSP type I motifs, is responsible for the tight interaction of ADAMTS-1 with the ECM (12.Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, our data demonstrating that ADAMTS-1 is able to form a covalent binding complex with α2-macroglobulin indicate that ADAMTS-1 is an active metalloproteinase (13.Kuno K. Terashima Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18821-18826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These observations led us to predict that ADAMTS-1 functions through proteolysis of ECM molecules. On the other hand, it is also known that the anti-angiogenic activity of thrombospondin-1 can be attributed to its three type I motifs (14.Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Beau M.M.L.

In the last 3 years, several mammalian genes that are structurally related to ADAMTS-1 have been identified, and they make up the ADAMTS family (17.Colige A. Li S.-W. Sieron A.L. Nusgens B.V.

Our recent study demonstrated that ADAMTS-1 has aggrecan-cleaving activity (23.Kuno K. Okada Y. Kawashima H. Nakamura H. Miyasaka M. Ohno H. Matsushima K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Versican proteolysis by ADAMTS-1 and -4 was also reported (24.Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M. Fischer J.W. Wight T.N. Clowes A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). It therefore seems that ADAMTS family members may be involved in proteolysis of ECM molecules and may play a role in establishing tissue architecture and tissue degradation in various diseases. We have recently observed that disruption of the mouse adamts-1 gene results in renal anomalies involving enlargement of the calyx (25.Shindo T. Kurihara H. Kuno K. Yokoyama H. Wada T. Kurihara Y. Imai T. Wang Y. Ogata M. Nishimatsu H. Moriyama N. Oh-hashi Y. Morita H. Ishikawa T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Matsushima K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Intravenous pyelography revealed a partial obstruction in the ureteropelvic junction of ADAMTS-1−/− mice, demonstrating that ADAMTS-1 plays an important regulatory role in normal development of the ureteropelvic junction. In addition, an abnormal adrenal medullary architecture was observed in ADAMTS-1−/− mice. Robker et al.(26.Robker R.L. Russell D.L. Espey L.L. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Richards J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4689-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) have reported that ADAMTS-1 mRNA expression is induced after luteinizing hormone stimulation in preovulatory follicles. We found that fertilization is impaired in ADAMTS-1−/−females. These observations demonstrate that ADAMTS-1 is necessary for proper function of the female genital organs (25.Shindo T. Kurihara H. Kuno K. Yokoyama H. Wada T. Kurihara Y. Imai T. Wang Y. Ogata M. Nishimatsu H. Moriyama N. Oh-hashi Y. Morita H. Ishikawa T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Matsushima K. J. Clin.

Science. 2000; 288: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which is the model animal for the genetic investigation of behavior and development. It has been shown that SUP-17, a C. elegans membrane-type ADAM family protein related to Drosophila KUZBANIAN, is involved in development of the vulva through regulation of the LIN-12/NOTCH signaling pathway (26.Robker R.L. Russell D.L. Espey L.L. Lydon J.P. O'Malley B.W. Richards J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4689-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). GON-1, a C. elegans ADAMTS family protein, is essential for gonadogenesis (29.Blelloch R. Kimble J. Nature. 1999; 399: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A secretory-type ADAM family molecule without the TSP motif, MIG-17, has been shown to regulate migration of the distal tip cells during gonadogenesis (30.Nishiwaki K. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Science. 2000; 288: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified a novel C. elegans ADAMTS family gene, adt-1 (ADAMTS in C. elegans). To better understand the roles of the ADAMTS family in organogenesis of C. elegans, we isolated the deletion mutant for the adt-1 gene using Tc1 and found that the adt-1 deletion mutant exhibits abnormal morphology of the male copulatory organs. Nematodes were cultured on NGM agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli strain OP50 at 20 °C according to a standard procedure (31.Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains used in this work were as follows: MT3126 (mut-2(r459) IV, dpy-19(n1347) III), him-8(e1489) IV, and lon-2(e678). Total RNA was isolated from N2 animals using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). The 5′-end of the adt-1 cDNA was amplified using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH). A 1-μg sample of total RNA from N2 animals was reverse-transcribed with primer 2B5RPR-1 (5′-acgcaagcctgcataagtgg), followed by second-strand synthesis. After ligation of the adapter, the first PCR was carried out using primer 2B5RPR-1 and the primer within the adapter. Subsequently, nested PCR was performed using the first PCR product as a template with the internal primer of the adt-1 gene, 2B5RPR-2 (5′-gtgacatcatcgtctccatg), and another nested primer within the adapter. Next, the 600-bp PCR product was subcloned into the pGEM vector (Promega). For the RT-PCR experiment, total RNA (1.5 μg) from the wild-type or mutant animals was reverse-transcribed using random primers and Superscript II (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Specific primers for the adt-1 gene were used to amplify the cDNA. DNA sequencing analysis was performed by PCR employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and a Model 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The GFP reporter plasmid pPD95-75 was provided by Dr. A. Fire. 2A. Fire, personal communication. To construct the GFP expression vector, a Hin dIII-HindIII fragment (3.7 kb) containing both the promoter region and exons 1 and 2 of the adt-1 gene from cosmid C02B4 (obtained from Dr. Alan Coulson, Sanger Center, Hinxton, United Kingdom) was subcloned into pPD95-75. Subsequently, the SphI-HindIII fragment (940 bp) of this insert was replaced by the 0.4-kb PCR fragment (SphI-SalI) spanning from the SphI site to the initiator ATG of the adt-1 gene. The resultant GFP expression vector (pGFP75-adt-1-St) contains a 2.9-kb 5′-flanking region, a 0.32-kb 5′-untranslated region, and the first ATG codon of the adt-1 gene. adt-1(cn30) was generated by insertion and imprecise excision of the transposon Tc1 (33.Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7431-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). First, frozen stocks of the mutator strain MT3126 were screened by PCR using the adt-1 gene-specific primers CB1A (agctcaaagtctcttggacg) and CB1B (ttatgaccatggtgttctgc) and the Tc1-specific primers TC11 (agccagctacaatggctttc) and TC31 (gatgcaaacggatacgcgac). The Tc1 insertion strain TN281 (adt-1(cn28)), in which Tc1 is inserted into intron 10, was isolated. To obtain animals with deletions of the adt-1 gene, 50 cultures of the Tc1 insertion mutants (TN281, adt-1(cn28)) were screened for imprecise excision of Tc1 by PCR using the adt-1 gene-specific primers CB0A (cagagatgaaggacagatgg), CB3C (ccattggtgaacactacgtc), CB0B (aatggcttcgaactcgcaag), and CB3D (gttgctcgacaagtgctttg), which are ∼3 kb from each other on the genome. A line of mutant animals with an ∼1-kb deletion in the adt-1 gene relative to the wild-type animals were isolated. These mutant animals were out-crossed three times with wild-type animals to establish the TN145 strain (adt-1(cn30)). The Tc1 insertion site and the deletion breakpoints of the mutant animals were determined by sequencing of the PCR products. C. elegans transformation was carried out as described by Mello et al. (32.Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). The pRF4 plasmid, carrying rol-6(su1006dm), was used as a transformation marker. Hermaphrodites of either strain N2 or him-8 were injected with a DNA mixture containing plasmid pRF4 (80 μg/ml) and the GFP expression vector (20 μg/ml). Transgenic lines carrying the extrachromosomal array of injected DNA were established from F2 Rol progeny and were observed under fluorescent microscopy to examine GFP expression. For the rescue experiments, cosmid C02B4 (1–2 μg/ml) was injected with the pRF4 marker plasmid (100 μg/ml) into adt-1 deletion mutants. The F2 Rol progeny derived from the injected animals were observed under Nomarski optics. Six males and six lon-2 hermaphrodites at late L4 stage were placed on a 3.5-cm dish, and males were removed after 24 h. Total cross-progeny (non-Lon F1) were counted. To examine the roles of the ADAMTS family during various developmental processes, we first searched for novel ADAMTS family genes of C. elegans in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. A homology search analysis disclosed that cosmid C02B4 (accession number Z50004) contains the ADAMTS family gene (designated C02B4.1 by the C. elegans Sequencing Consortium) (34.C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar). We designated this gene as adt-1 ((ADAMTS in C. elegans). As shown in Fig. 1A, C. elegansADT-1 shows overall homology to mouse ADAMTS-1 without any large gap, indicating that the domain organization of C. elegans ADT-1 is very similar to that of mouse ADAMTS-1. This sequence alignment revealed that, like mammalian ADAMTS family proteins, ADT-1 is composed of multiple functional domains, including proprotein, metalloproteinase, and disintegrin-like domains and TSP type I motifs (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 1B, ADT-1 contains a complete zinc-binding motif (HE XXH XXG XXHD) and the subsequent Met turn, which comprises the zinc binding environment of the reprolysin family, including ADAM and snake metalloproteinases. This suggests the possibility that ADT-1 is an active metalloproteinase. The C-terminal region of ADT-1 is remarkably longer than these regions of ADAMTS-1 and other mammalian ADAMTS family members, and C. elegans ADT-1 has multiple repeats of TSP type I motifs (total of 13 copies) in its C-terminal half-region. It is known that two elements (W-S/G-X-W and CSVTCG) of the TSP type I motif of thrombospondin-1 are functional with regard to the binding to sulfated glycoconjugates (35.Bornstein P. Alfi D. Devarayalu S. Framson P. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16691-16698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As for ADT-1, nine of thirteen repeats have both elements, but repeats 1, 6, 9, and 11 of ADT-1 seem to be incomplete.Figure 2Schematic diagrams of mouse ADAMTS-1 and C. elegans ADT-1.

Black boxes indicate the signal peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Table I, the metalloproteinase domain of ADT-1 shows the highest homology to ADAMTS-1, -7, and -12 among mammalian ADAMTS family members. But the homology of ADT-1 to mammalian ADAMTS family members is relatively low compared with that of GON-1. GON-1 is more similar to ADAMTS-1 than is ADT-1. However, GON-1 also shows a higher sequence homology to other ADAMTS family members such as ADAMTS-8, -9, and -12. GON-1 may be similar to mammalian ADAMTS family members in its function, whereas ADT-1 may play a more specific role in C. elegans. The C. elegans genome contains other ADAMTS family genes (F08C6.1 and T19D2.1) in addition to adt-1 and gon-1.Table IAmino acid identity of C. elegans ADT-1 and GON-1 to mammalian ADAMTS family membersADT-1GON-1MPDIS-likeFirst TSP type I motifMPDIS-likeFirst TSP type I motif%%Mouse ADAMTS-1273437493667Bovine ADAMTS-2262631352750Human ADAMTS-4242639443469Human ADAMTS-5243134393460Human ADAMTS-7272629442652Human ADAMTS-8222231452863Human ADAMTS-9242427564157Human ADAMTS-10262629402865Human ADAMTS-12282432452756a.

The adt-1 gene is mapped on the chromosome X (Fig. 3A). In terms of the exon/intron organization of the C. elegans adt-1 gene, the GeneFinder program suggests that the adt-1 gene consists of 27 exons and encodes a polypeptide composed of 1444 amino acids (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium (34.C. elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar)). But this predicted amino acid sequence of ADT-1 estimated by the program does not contain the signal sequence at its N terminus, although ADT-1 does belong to the ADAMTS family. Therefore, the 5′-region of the adt-1 cDNA was re-examined through the sequencing of 5′-RACE reaction products using the wild-type worm. 5′-RACE analysis revealed the existence of an additional exon (exon 1 in Fig. 3) that encodes a signal sequence characterized by stretches of hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 1A). In addition, sequencing analyses of RT-PCR products confirmed that the remaining exons of the adt-1 gene are absolutely correct. Consequently, the adt-1 gene consists of 28 exons (Fig. 3B) and encodes a polypeptide composed of 1461 amino acids. These data suggest that, like other ADAMTS family members, the adt-1 gene encodes a secretory protein. The in vivo expression pattern of the adt-1 gene was investigated using a reporter gene encoding GFP driven by 2.9 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the adt-1 gene. Because ADT-1 is a putative secretory protein with a signal peptide at its N terminus, the first ATG codon of the ADT-1 protein was fused in frame with the GFP reporter, followed by the unc-54 3′-untranslated region. Adult hermaphrodites carrying this reporter gene were found to strongly express the GFP signal in a group of cells forming the vulva (Fig. 4, A, C, and G) and in the area surrounding the pharynx, probably in the head ganglia (Fig. 4, E and G). In addition, GFP expression was observed in the ventral nerve cord (Fig. 4C) and in the amphid neurons (Fig. 4E). A weak GFP signal was detected on the body surface (Fig. 4G). To address the in vivo function of the adt-1 gene, we inactivated the gene using a transposon-based PCR-sib selection method (33.Zwaal R.R. Broeks A. Meurs J. Groenen J.T.M. Plasterk R.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7431-7435Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). First, by screening a library of the mutator strain MT3126, we isolated a line of animals (TN281, adt-1(cn28)) in which Tc1 is inserted into intron 10 of the adt-1 gene (Fig. 3B). As a second step, a mutant line of animals (adt-1(cn30)) harboring a 1-kb deletion upstream of the Tc1 insertion site in the adt-1 gene were obtained (Fig. 3B). This deletion eliminated exons 8–10, which encode most of the metalloproteinase domain of ADT-1. When the adt-1 mRNA of the adt-1(cn30) deletion mutant animals was analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers near the deleted region, a RT-PCR product that was ∼550 bp shorter than that of the wild-type animals was detected in the adt-1(cn30) mutant (Fig. 3C). Sequencing analysis of this RT-PCR product revealed that exon 7 of the adt-1 transcript was linked to exon 11 in frame in the adt-1(cn30) mutant animals (Fig. 3D). This result suggests the possibility that the truncated ADT-1 protein, with the metalloproteinase domain deleted, is expressed in the adt-1(cn30) mutant. The adt-1(cn30) mutant hermaphrodites are generally healthy, and an embryonic lethality has not been observed in the adt-1 mutant. Embryogenesis and organogenesis of the gonad, intestine, and pharynx were found to be normal in adt-1 hermaphrodites. In addition, we found that reproduction and morphology were normal in adt-1(cn30) hermaphrodites. Despite the specific expression of the adt-1 gene in the nervous system, movement of the adt-1 mutant animals in culture appeared to be normal. Phenotypes in the males were examined by mating the adt-1 mutants with the him-8 strain to increase the frequency of males in a selfing population (37.Hodgkin J. Horvitz H.R. Brenner S. Genetics. 1979; 91: 67-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Males with the adt-1 mutation exhibited abnormal tail morphology. The tail portion of C. elegans males is highly modified for copulation and has male-specific copulatory organs, the rays and the fan. In wild-type males, the nine bilateral pairs of sensory rays projected laterally from the body within the fan and had a smooth, slightly tapered morphology (Fig. 5, A and D). In contrast, in adt-1(cn30) mutant males, ray 6 was transformed into a thickened shape close to the body, and the length of ray 6 appeared to be shortened (Fig. 5, B, C, E, and F). The morphological change to a thick shape of the ray was remarkable in ray 6, but this change was also observed at low frequency in other rays such as rays 2 and 4 (Fig. 6A). It is known that each of the nine rays are located at reproducible positions in the fan. Ray positions do not seem to be disturbed in the adt-1(cn30) mutant. In addition, no fusion of rays was observed in the adt-1(cn30) animals. These data demonstrate that the adt-1 gene is involved in morphogenesis of rays, especially ray 6.Figure 6Frequency of abnormal thick rays (A) and abnormal rounded protuberances between rays (B) found in adt-1 mutant males. The frequency is represented as a percentage of sides at which each ray is transformed into a thick shape (A) and at which an abnormal rounded protuberance appears between the rays (B) in adt-1(cn30) mutant males. Total number of sides examined = 110.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to abnormalities in ray morphology, many adt-1(cn30) mutant animals were found to have abnormal rounded protuberances between the sensory rays (Fig. 5, C and F). These rounded protuberances appeared frequently between rays 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and 4 and 5 and to a lesser extent between rays 1 and 2, 5 and 6, and 6 and 7 (Fig. 6B). In wild-type males, the fan extended laterally from both sides of the body and formed a plain sheet structure (Fig. 5G). The anterior end of the fan is located at the anterior of the cloaca. In contrast, in many adt-1(cn30) mutant males, the fan extending from both sides of the body linked to itself above the cloaca, creating the closed structure in the anterior region of the tail (Fig. 5H). In accordance with a closed shape of the fan, rays 1–3 of adt-1(cn30) mutant males were found frequently be bent inside and appeared to be shortened in the lateral view (rays 1–3 i"
