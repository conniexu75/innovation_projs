https://openalex.org/W2801697738,"Background For behaviour-change interventions to be successful they must be acceptable to users and overcome barriers to behaviour change. The Person-Based Approach can help to optimise interventions to maximise acceptability and engagement. This article presents a novel, efficient and systematic method that can be used as part of the Person-Based Approach to rapidly analyse data from development studies to inform intervention modifications. We describe how we used this approach to optimise a digital intervention for patients with hypertension (HOME BP), which aims to implement medication and lifestyle changes to optimise blood pressure control. Methods In study 1, hypertensive patients (N = 12) each participated in three think-aloud interviews, providing feedback on a prototype of HOME BP. In study 2 patients (N = 11) used HOME BP for three weeks and were then interviewed about their experiences. Studies 1 and 2 were used to identify detailed changes to the intervention content and potential barriers to engagement with HOME BP. In study 3 (N = 7) we interviewed hypertensive patients who were not interested in using an intervention like HOME BP to identify potential barriers to uptake, which informed modifications to our recruitment materials. Analysis in all three studies involved detailed tabulation of patient data and comparison to our modification criteria. Results Studies 1 and 2 indicated that the HOME BP procedures were generally viewed as acceptable and feasible, but also highlighted concerns about monitoring blood pressure correctly at home and making medication changes remotely. Patients in study 3 had additional concerns about the safety and security of the intervention. Modifications improved the acceptability of the intervention and recruitment materials. Conclusions This paper provides a detailed illustration of how to use the Person-Based Approach to refine a digital intervention for hypertension. The novel, efficient approach to analysis and criteria for deciding when to implement intervention modifications described here may be useful to others developing interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2799934298,"Pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas are associated with abnormal body composition visible on CT scans, including low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and low muscle radiodensity due to fat infiltration in muscle (myosteatosis). The biological and clinical correlates to these features are poorly understood.Clinical characteristics and outcomes were studied in 123 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic or non-pancreatic periampullary adenocarcinoma and who had available preoperative CT scans. In a subgroup of patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 29), rectus abdominus muscle mRNA expression was determined by cDNA microarray and in another subgroup (n = 29) 1H-NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to characterize the serum metabolome.Muscle mass and radiodensity were not significantly correlated. Distinct groups were identified: sarcopenia (40.7%), myosteatosis (25.2%), both (11.4%). Fat distribution differed in these groups; sarcopenia associated with lower subcutaneous adipose tissue (P<0.0001) and myosteatosis associated with greater visceral adipose tissue (P<0.0001). Sarcopenia, myosteatosis and their combined presence associated with shorter survival, Log Rank P = 0.005, P = 0.06, and P = 0.002, respectively. In muscle, transcriptomic analysis suggested increased inflammation and decreased growth in sarcopenia and disrupted oxidative phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in myosteatosis. In the circulating metabolome, metabolites consistent with muscle catabolism associated with sarcopenia. Metabolites consistent with disordered carbohydrate metabolism were identified in both sarcopenia and myosteatosis.Muscle phenotypes differ clinically and biologically. Because these muscle phenotypes are linked to poor survival, it will be imperative to delineate their pathophysiologic mechanisms, including whether they are driven by variable tumor biology or host response."
https://openalex.org/W2802522645,"The number of people diagnosed with dementia is expected to rise in the coming years. Given that there is currently no definite cure for dementia and the cost of care for this condition soars dramatically, slowing the decline and maintaining independent living are important goals for supporting people with dementia. This paper discusses a study that is called Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM). TIHM is a technology assisted monitoring system that uses Internet of Things (IoT) enabled solutions for continuous monitoring of people with dementia in their own homes. We have developed machine learning algorithms to analyse the correlation between environmental data collected by IoT technologies in TIHM in order to monitor and facilitate the physical well-being of people with dementia. The algorithms are developed with different temporal granularity to process the data for long-term and short-term analysis. We extract higher-level activity patterns which are then used to detect any change in patients’ routines. We have also developed a hierarchical information fusion approach for detecting agitation, irritability and aggression. We have conducted evaluations using sensory data collected from homes of people with dementia. The proposed techniques are able to recognise agitation and unusual patterns with an accuracy of up to 80%."
https://openalex.org/W2952850918,"Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required."
https://openalex.org/W2802868418,"In sub-Saharan Africa foodborne disease and foodborne disease outbreaks are frequently ascribed to poor personal hygiene of street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments. Evidence on the level of food hygiene practices and food safety measures among food handlers is required for proper planning and implementation of targeted interventions. In this study, we aimed to determine the level of food hygiene and safety measures among street food vendors and food handlers in food establishments of Dessie Town, Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was performed in Dessie town, Ethiopia from December 2013 to June 2014. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and an observational checklist by a trained data collector among 116 food handlers from 116 food establishments and 19 food handlers from 19 street food vendors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify the factors significantly associated with good level of food hygiene and safety practices.Almost three-quarter (72%; 84/116) of food handlers in food establishments had a good level of food hygiene and safety practices compared to nearly half (53%; 10/19) of street food vendors. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Average monthly income of >$21 US (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.2; 95%CI: 1.3-7.7), availability of service training (AOR = 6.7; 95%CI: 1.8-25), wearing a gown during food handling (AOR = 19; 95%CI: 6.8-51) and medical checkup (AOR = 5.2; 95%CI: 2.1-13) were significantly associated with good levels of food hygiene and safety measures.Comprehensive health education and promotion programs through continuous training on food hygiene and safety, with promotion of wearing gown during food handling, regular medical checkups of food handlers and programs that enhance the monthly income of food handlers are promising strategies for promoting proper food handling practices in Dessie town, Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2803024147,"NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of Fragaria vesca, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the Fragaria x ananassa fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2802349108,"Children in developing countries are highly vulnerable to impaired physical growth because of poor dietary intake, lack of appropriate care, and repeated infections. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of stunting and associated factors among children 6-59 months of age in Libo-kemekem district, northwest Ethiopia.A community based cross sectional study was conducted in Libo-Kemekem from October 15 to December 15, 2015. The multistage sampling technique was employed to select 1,320 children aged 6-59months. Data were collected by trained community health extension workers under regular supervision. Data were entered into EPI-Info version 3.5.1, and height for age was converted to Z-score with ENA-SMART software. Data were then exported to SPSS version 20 for descriptive and binary logistic regression analysees. The significance of associations was determined at p<0.05.Out of 1287 children included in the analysis, 49.4% (95% CI: 46.7%-52.3%) were found to be stunted. In the multivariate analysis, increased child age [AOR = 6.31, 95%CI: (3.65, 10.91)], family size of six and above [AOR = 1.77, 95%CI: (1.35, 2.32)] were positively associated with stunting, while, fathers with secondary school education [AOR = 0.50, 95%CI: (0.30, 0.81)], farmers as household heads [AOR = 0.56, 95%CI: (0.38, 0.84)] and self-employed parents as household head [AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: (0.28, 0.72)] were found to be preventive factors.The prevalence of stunting was high in the study area. We found that stunting was significantly correlated with child age, occupational status of household head, family size, and fathers' education. Therefore, intervention focusing on supporting housewives, family planning, and education on child feeding and nutrition should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2801611152,"Identification of voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 inhibitors for chronic pain therapeutic development is an area of vigorous pursuit. In an effort to identify more potent leads compared to our previously reported GpTx-1 peptide series, electrophysiology screening of fractionated tarantula venom discovered the NaV1.7 inhibitory peptide JzTx-V from the Chinese earth tiger tarantula Chilobrachys jingzhao. The parent peptide displayed nominal selectivity over the skeletal muscle NaV1.4 channel. Attribute-based positional scan analoging identified a key Ile28Glu mutation that improved NaV1.4 selectivity over 100-fold, and further optimization yielded the potent and selective peptide leads AM-8145 and AM-0422. NMR analyses revealed that the Ile28Glu substitution changed peptide conformation, pointing to a structural rationale for the selectivity gains. AM-8145 and AM-0422 as well as GpTx-1 and HwTx-IV competed for ProTx-II binding in HEK293 cells expressing human NaV1.7, suggesting that these NaV1.7 inhibitory peptides interact with a similar binding site. AM-8145 potently blocked native tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) channels in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, exhibited 30- to 120-fold selectivity over other human TTX-S channels and exhibited over 1,000-fold selectivity over other human tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) channels. Leveraging NaV1.7-NaV1.5 chimeras containing various voltage-sensor and pore regions, AM-8145 mapped to the second voltage-sensor domain of NaV1.7. AM-0422, but not the inactive peptide analog AM-8374, dose-dependently blocked capsaicin-induced DRG neuron action potential firing using a multi-electrode array readout and mechanically-induced C-fiber spiking in a saphenous skin-nerve preparation. Collectively, AM-8145 and AM-0422 represent potent, new engineered NaV1.7 inhibitory peptides derived from the JzTx-V scaffold with improved NaV selectivity and biological activity in blocking action potential firing in both DRG neurons and C-fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2802599780,"Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (P<0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (P<0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (P<0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (P<0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (P<0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (P<0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (P<0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (P<0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (P<0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2801314448,"The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents' spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically."
https://openalex.org/W2800180532,"Background In the early stage of sepsis, M1 macrophages result in the production of inflammatory mediators and AKI. Heparin-binding protein (HBP) have been shown to play important roles in sepsis-induced AKI. In this study, we investigate the association of HBP with M1 macrophages in sepsis-induced AKI. Methods Male C57BL6 mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham surgery. Biochemical and histological renal damage was assessed. Macrophage infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR was used to investigate the expression of heparin-binding protein (HBP), the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase 1 (Arg-1) mRNAs. Western blots were performed to assay the tissue levels of HBP, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Results High levels of HBP were obviously detected 24 h after sepsis-induced AKI. Heparin inhibited HBP expression during sepsis-induced AKI. The suppression of HBP expression by heparin injection after the establishment of sepsis-induced AKI resulted in a reduction in renal injury severity accompanied with a significant repression of M1 macrophage activation and expression of TNF-α and IL-6. Conclusions HBP plays an important role in the initial inflammatory reaction associated with sepsis-induced AKI, presumably by activating M1 macrophages and suppressing TNF-α and IL-6 secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2800710676,"Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is known to provide neuroprotective effect in the central nervous system. However, the detailed mechanism remains far more elusive. This study was designed to investigate the relevant mechanisms of DEX's neuroprotective effect. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were injected with dexmedetomidine and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and inflammatory cytokines in serum and in the hippocampus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). NF-κB in the brain tissue extracts was analyzed with western-blot. Then, we investigated whether NF-κB inhibitor prevents the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in rats injected with LPS. Our results indicated that compared with the control group, the rats exposed to LPS showed significant cognitive dysfunction. When compared to controls, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum and hippocampus homogenate were increased in rats treated with LPS. DEX pretreatment inhibited the rats' TNF-α, IL-6 and NF-κB levels induced by LPS. In response to LPS, PDTC pretreatment restrains the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Rats treated with PDTC and DEX alongside LPS exhibited less TNF-α and IL-6 than the LPS treated group. In combination, PDTC and DEX showed addictive effects. Our data suggest that DEX exerts a neuroprotective effect through NF-κB in part after LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2802830706,"The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others. We analyzed by gas-chromatography mass spectrometry the chemical composition of the essential oil of aerial parts of Glandora rosmarinifolia (Ten.) D.C. Thomas obtained by hydrodistillation and verified some biological activities on a panel of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HA22T/VGH, HepG2, Hep3B) and triple negative breast cancer cell lines (SUM 149, MDA-MB-231). In the essential oil we detected 35 compounds. The results of the biological assays indicate that essential oil of G. rosmarinifolia induces cell growth inhibition at concentration-dependent way in all cell line models. This oil does not seem to possess antioxidant activity, while the cytotoxicity of G. rosmarinifolia essential oil appeared to involve, at least in part, a pro-oxidant mechanism. Our results show for the first time the antitumoral and pro-oxidant activities of G. rosmarinifolia essential oil and suggest that it may represent a resource of pharmacologically active compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2799310771,"Purpose To examine the reported mental health outcomes of adolescent foreign-born non-citizens and adolescent foreign-born U.S. citizens compared to adolescent U.S.-born citizens. Methods Using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the National Health Interview Survey, we compared mental health status of U.S.-born adolescent citizens to foreign-born citizens and non-citizens in the years 2010–2015, and examined how differences in emotional difficulty changed based on time spent in the U.S. Results Results suggest that non-citizen adolescents experience better mental health outcomes than U.S.-born citizens. However, the mental health status of foreign-born citizens is indistinguishable from that of the U.S.-born, after accounting for basic socio-demographic characteristics. The prevalence of emotional difficulty experienced by immigrant adolescents increased with a family’s duration in the U.S. Conclusion Our findings are consistent with a broader health advantage for the foreign-born, but we present new evidence that the mental health advantage of foreign-born adolescents exists only for non-citizens."
https://openalex.org/W2801090941,"Background There was a paucity of data on the magnitude of potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) among Ethiopian elderly cardiovascular patients. Objective The aim of this study was to assess PIPs and associated factors in the elderly population with cardiovascular disorders using the START/STOPP screening criteria. Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at medical wards of a teaching hospital in Ethiopia from 1 December 2016–30 May 2017. Included patients were hospitalized elderly patients aged 65 years or older with cardiovascular disorders; their medications were evaluated using the START/STOPP screening criteria from admission to discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with inappropriate medications. One Way Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) was carried out to test significant differences on the number of PIPs per individual diagnosis. Results Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included in the analysis. More-than a third of the patients were diagnosed with heart failure, 88 (36.82%). A total of 221 PIPs were identified in 147 patients, resulting in PIP prevalence of 61.5% in the elderly population. Of the total number of PIPs, occurrence of one, two and three PIPs accounted for 83 (56.4%), 52(35.4%), and 12(8.2%) respectively. One way ANOVA test showed significant differences on the mean number of PIPs per individual diagnosis (f = 5.718, p<0.001). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) were the most common inappropriately prescribed medications, 32(14.5%). Hospital stay, AOR: 1.086 (1.016–1.160), number of medications at discharge, AOR: 1.924 (1.217–3.041) and the presence of co-morbidities, AOR: 3.127 (1.706–5.733) increased the likelihood of PIP. Conclusion Approximately, two-thirds of elderly cardiovascular patients encountered potentially inappropriate prescriptions. ACEIs were the most commonly mis-prescribed medications. Longer hospital stay, presence of comorbidities and prescription of large number of medications at discharge have been correlated with the occurrence of inappropriate medication. It is essential to evaluate patients’ medications during hospital stay using the STOPP and START tool to reduce PIPs."
https://openalex.org/W2800725057,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. In vitro, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1. These findings suggest that inhibiting the H3K4 methyltransferase SET7/9 ameliorates peritoneal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2951158965,"The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that exhibit a complex infectious life cycle in both arthropod and mammalian hosts. As obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae are highly adapted to living inside a variety of host cells, including vascular endothelial cells during mammalian infection. Although it is assumed that the rickettsiae produce numerous virulence factors that usurp or disrupt various host cell pathways, they have been challenging to genetically manipulate to identify the key bacterial factors that contribute to infection. Motivated to overcome this challenge, we sought to expand the repertoire of available rickettsial loss-of-function mutants, using an improved mariner-based transposon mutagenesis scheme. Here, we present the isolation of over 100 transposon mutants in the spotted fever group species Rickettsia parkeri. Transposon insertions disrupted genes whose products are implicated in a variety of pathways, including bacterial replication and metabolism, the type IV secretion system, factors with previously established roles in host cell interactions and pathogenesis, or are of unknown function. Given the need to identify critical virulence factors, forward genetic screens such as this will provide an excellent platform to more directly investigate rickettsial biology and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2801492020,"Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm) is a seed-borne pathogen that causes bacterial canker disease of tomato. Cmm is typically detected in tomato seeds using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with culture-based isolation. The viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state of Cmm may result in the underestimation or false negative detection of the pathogen. In the present study, propidium monoazide (PMA) and its improved structure PMAxx were used to pretreat Cmm prior to DNA extraction, followed by qPCR. Both PMA and PMAxx could bind to the chromosomal DNA of dead bacterial cells and therefore block DNA amplification by PCR. This effect, however, does not occur in living bacterial cells, as the chemicals cannot penetrate through the undamaged cell membrane. Both viable and dead Cmm cells were treated with PMA and PMAxx at various concentrations. With this treatment, the range of the cell population was determined for effective detection. PMAxx showed a better discrimination effect than PMA on the viable and dead cells of Cmm and was therefore used throughout the present study. VBNC cells of Cmm (108 CFU mL-1) was induced by 50 μM copper sulfate, which was detected at different sampling times up to a month by using both PMAxx-qPCR and flow cytometry assays. The optimal PMAxx concentration was 20 μM for detecting membrane-intact Cmm cells. High specificity and sensitivity were obtained at Cmm concentrations ranging from 103 to 107 CFU mL-1. The accurate and robust results of PMAxx-qPCR were confirmed by flow cytometry method to detect viable Cmm cells. Furthermore, the PMAxx-qPCR assay was successfully used in detecting VBNC Cmm cells in tomato seeds with as few as 10 seeds per set."

https://openalex.org/W2801512104,"The nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ have been demonstrated to be core members of the circadian clock and participate in the regulation of a diverse set of metabolic functions. Due to their overlapping tissue expression patterns and gene expression profiles, REV-ERBβ is thought to be redundant to REV-ERBα. Recent work has highlighted REV-ERBα’s role in the regulation of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and mitochondrial biogenesis. Considering the similarity between the REV-ERBs and the hypothesized overlap in function, we sought to determine whether REV-ERBβ-deficiency presented with a similar skeletal muscle phenotype as REV-ERBα-deficiency. Ectopic overexpression in C2C12 cells demonstrated that REV-ERBβ drives mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Intriguingly, knock down of REV-ERBβ in C2C12 cultures also resulted in mitochondrial biogenesis and increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. To determine whether these effects occurred in vivo, we examined REV-ERBβ-deficient mice and observed a similar increase in expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Consistent with these results, REV-ERBβ-deficient mice exhibited an altered metabolic phenotype compared to wild-type littermate controls when measured by indirect calorimetry. This likely compensated for the increased food consumption that occurred, possibly aiding in the maintenance of their weight over time. Since feeding behaviors are a direct circadian output, this study suggests that REV-ERBβ may have more subtle effects on circadian behaviors than originally identified. Furthermore, these data implicate REV-ERBβ in the control of skeletal muscle metabolism and energy expenditure and suggest that development of REV-ERBα versus REV-ERBβ selective ligands may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of metabolic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2802581658,"Background Among the potential factors which may contribute to the development and perpetuation of atrial fibrillation, dysregulation of miRNAs has been suggested. Thus in this study, we have quantified the basal expressions of 662 mature human miRNAs in left atrium (LA) from patients undergoing cardiac surgery for valve repair, suffering or not from atrial fibrillation (AF) by using TaqMan® Low Density arrays (v2.0). Results Among the 299 miRNAs expressed in all patients, 42 miRNAs had altered basal expressions in patients with AF. Binding-site predictions with Targetscan (conserved sites among species) indicated that the up- and down-regulated miRNAs controlled respectively 3,310 and 5,868 genes. To identify the most relevant cellular functions under the control of the altered miRNAs, we focused on the 100 most targeted genes of each list and identified 5 functional protein-protein networks among these genes. Up-regulated networks were involved in synchronisation of circadian rythmicity and in the control of the AKT/PKC signaling pathway (i.e., proliferation/adhesion). Down-regulated networks were the IGF-1 pathway and TGF-beta signaling pathway and a network involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing, suggesting for the first time that alteration of miRNAs in AF would also perturbate the whole miRNA machinery. Then we crossed the list of miRNA predicted genes, and the list of mRNAs altered in similar patients suffering from AF and we found that respectively 44.5% and 55% of the up- and down-regulated mRNA are predicted to be conserved targets of the altered miRNAs (at least one binding site in 3’-UTR). As they were involved in the same biological processes mentioned above, these data demonstrated that a great part of the transcriptional defects previously published in LA from AF patients are likely due to defects at the post-transcriptional level and involved the miRNAs. Conclusions Our stringent analysis permitted us to identify highly targeted protein-protein networks under the control of miRNAs in LA and, among them, to highlight those specifically affected in AF patients with altered miRNA signature. Further studies are now required to determine whether alterations of miRNA levels in AF pathology are causal or represent an adaptation to prevent cardiac electrical and structural remodeling."

In this study, we aimed to explore the expression profiles of SCN4B in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and its prognostic value in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) in classical PTC. In addition, we also examined the potential effect of DNA methylation on its expression. A retrospective study was performed by using data from available large databases, including the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Thyroid Cancer (THCA). Results showed that SCN4B is downregulated at both RNA and protein level in PTC compared with normal thyroid tissues. Preserved SCN4B expression was an independent indicator of favorable RFS in patients with classical PTC, no matter as categorical variables (HR: 0.243, 95%CI: 0.107–0.551, p = 0.001) or as a continuous variable (HR: 0.684, 95%CI: 0.520–0.899, p = 0.007). The methylation status of one CpG site (Chr11: 118,022,316–318) in SCN4B DNA had a moderately negative correlation with SCN4B expression in all PTC cases (Pearson’s r = -0.48) and in classical PTC cases (Pearson’s r = -0.41). In comparison, SCN4B DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) were not frequent and might not influence its mRNA expression. In addition, no somatic mutation was found in SCN4B DNA. Based on these findings, we infer that preserved SCN4B expression might independently predict favorable RFS in classical PTC. Its expression might be suppressed by DNA hypermethylation, but is less likely to be influenced by DNA CNAs/mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2799806393,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), is a transcription factor that governs pathways, such as lipid metabolism and immune response, that have been implicated in the etiology of LOAD. Previously, we established HepG2-derived cell-lines with stable knockdown of PPARγ gene, and showed an increase in mRNA levels of genes mapped in the APOE linkage disequilibrium (LD) region on chromosome 19q13.32, with the greatest effect observed for APOE-mRNA. Here, we extended the analysis using our PPARγ knockdown model system and investigated the broader effect on expression changes of genes implicated in LOAD via genome wide association studies (GWAS). We applied the nCounter gene expression assay (NanoString) using a panel of twenty-four LOAD-associated genes inferred by proximity to the top significantly associated SNPs. Two independent PPARγ knockdown cell-lines showed changes in mRNA levels of a total of seven genes compared to a control HepG2 cell-line; six of which, ABCA7, APOE, CASS4, CELF1, PTK2B, and ZCWPW1, were upregulated and one, DSG2, was downregulated upon PPARγ knockdown. Our results propose that PPARγ may act as a master regulator of the transcription of several genes involved in LOAD pathogenesis. Our study provided the premise for further analyses including a larger set of genes positioned within a wider range of linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions tagged by all LOAD significantly associated SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2802601363,"Glycan analysis may result in exploitation of glycan biomarkers and evaluation of heterogeneity of glycosylation of biopharmaceuticals. For N-linked glycan analysis, we investigated alkaline hydrolysis of the asparagine glycosyl carboxamide of glycoproteins as a deglycosylation reaction. By adding hydroxylamine into alkaline de-N-glycosylation, we suppressed the degradation of released glycans and obtained a mixture of oximes, free glycans, and glycosylamines. The reaction was completed within 1 h, and the mixture containing oximes was easily tagged with 2-aminobenzamide by reductive amination. Here, we demonstrated N-linked glycan analysis using this method for a monoclonal antibody, and examined whether this method could liberate glycans without degradation from apo-transferrin containing NeuAc and NeuGc and horseradish peroxidase containing Fuc α1–3 GlcNAc at the reducing end. Furthermore, we compared glycan recoveries between conventional enzymatic glycan release and this method. Increasing the reaction temperature and reaction duration led to degradation, whereas decreasing these parameters resulted in lower release. Considering this balance, we proposed to carry out the reaction at 80°C for 1 h for asialo glycoproteins from mammals and at 50°C for 1 h for sialoglycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2800687467,"The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage. Interestingly, while only a few adult bats visited the trapped bat, in every trial all or most of the eight young males in the colony would visit the trapped bat without feeding it. To test whether this behavioral difference resulted from age class differences in exploration, we compared responses of the bats to a trapped conspecific versus an inanimate novel object. Some adults and young showed interest in trapped conspecifics, but only the young males explored the novel objects. Additional novel object tests in a second captive colony showed that higher rates of novel object exploration were shown by young of both sexes. Our results corroborate past findings from other mammals and birds that age predicts exploration. If age-dependent exploration is indeed adaptive, then the role of age as a predictor of exploration tendency should depend on species-specific life history traits. Finally, because younger vampire bats also appear to have higher exposure to pathogens such as rabies virus, there may be implications for pathogen transmission if younger and more exploratory vampire bats are more likely to feed on novel hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2800171779,"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA1-439) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA1-76 fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25th-75th-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01-4.28) vs 0.75 nM (0.52-0.89), p = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09-7.10) vs 0.29 nM (0.26-0.32), p<0.001, respectively], but not of CgA1-439 or CgA1-373 fragment. VS-1 positively correlated with total-CgA (r = 0.65, p<0.001). The Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve was 0.9935 for VS-1 and 0.8824 for total-CgA (p = 0.067). Treatment of patients with somatostatin analogues decreased both total-CgA and VS-1. In contrast, administration of PPIs increased the plasma levels of total-CgA, but not of VS-1.These findings suggest that plasma VS-1 is a novel biomarker for ileal and pancreatic NENs. Considering that VS-1 is a well-defined fragment not induced by proton-pump inhibitors, this polypeptide might represent a biomarker for NENs diagnosis and follow-up more accurate and easier to standardize than CgA."
https://openalex.org/W2799674470,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne bacterial infection that is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by B. burgdorferi spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, B. burgdorferi infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of B. burgdorferi used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of B. burgdorferi meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by B. burgdorferi."
https://openalex.org/W2800079778,"Natural forests in inland China are generally distributed in montane area and secondary due to a semi-arid climate and past anthropogenic disturbances. However, quantification of carbon (C) stock in these forests and the role of altitude in determining C storage and its partition among ecosystem components are unclear. We sampled 54 stands of three secondary coniferous forests (Larix principis-rupprechtii (LP) forest, Picea meyerii (PM) forest and Pinus tabulaeformis (PT) forest) on Loess Plateau in an altitudinal range of 1200-2700m a.s.l. C stocks of tree layer, shrub layer, herb layer, coarse wood debris, forest floor and soil were estimated. We found these forests had relatively high total C stocks. Driven by both higher vegetation and soil C stocks, total C stocks of LP and PM forests in the high altitudinal range were 375.0 and 368.4 t C ha-1 respectively, significantly higher than that of PT forest in the low altitudinal range (230.2 t C ha-1). In addition, understory shrubs accounted for about 20% of total biomass in PT forest. The proportions of vegetation to total C stock were similar among in the three forests (below 45%), so were the proportions of soil C stock (over 54%). Necromass C stocks were also similar among these forests, but their proportions to total C stock were significantly lower in LP and PM forests (1.4% and 1.6%) than in PT forest (3.0%). Across forest types, vegetation biomass and soil C stock simultaneously increased with increasing altitude, causing fairly unchanged C partitioning among ecosystem components along the altitudinal gradient. Soil C stock also increased with altitude in LP and PT forests. Forest floor necromass decreased with increasing altitude across the three forests. Our results suggest the important role of the altitudinal gradient in C sequestration and floor necromass of these three forests in terms of alleviated water conditions and in soil C storage of LP and PM forests in terms of temperature change."
https://openalex.org/W2800593692,"Objectives Anma therapy (Japanese massage therapy, AMT) significantly reduces the severity of physical complaints in survivors of gynecologic cancer. However, whether this reduction of severity is accompanied by improvement in health-related quality of life is unknown. Methods Forty survivors of gynecologic cancer were randomly allocated to either an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8 weeks or a no-AMT group. We prospectively measured quality of life by using the Japanese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at 8-week follow-up. The QLQ-C30 response rate was 100%. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Measure of Adjustment to Cancer were also prespecified and prospectively evaluated. Results The QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life showed significant improvement at 8 weeks (P = 0.042) in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group, and the estimated mean difference reached a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (10.4 points, 95% CI = 1.2 to 19.6). Scores on fatigue and insomnia showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (P = 0.047 and 0.003, respectively). There were no significant between-group improvements in HADS anxiety and depression scales; however, POMS-assessed anger-hostility showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (p = 0.028). Conclusions AMT improved health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors. AMT can be of potential benefit for applications in oncology."
https://openalex.org/W2801050420,"Earlier studies have shown that estrogen possess protective function against the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms of estrogens (E2) protective effect are poorly understood. Additionally, abnormal activation of β-adrenergic signaling have been implicated in the development of pathological cardiac remodeling. However, the role of serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in pathological cardiac remodeling under the influence of β-adrenergic signaling have been sparsely investigated. In this study, we assessed the downstream effects of abnormal activation of PP1 upon isoproterenol (ISO) induced pathological cardiac changes. We found that pre-treatment of 17β-estradiol (E2), tet-on estrogen receptor-α, or both significantly inhibited ISO-induced increase in cell size, hypertrophy marker gene expression and cytosolic calcium accumulation in H9c2 cells. Additionally, treatment with estrogen receptor inhibitor (ICI) reversed those effects, implicating role of E2 in inhibiting pathological cardiac remodeling. However, specific inhibition of ERα using melatonin, reduced ISO-induced PP1c expression and enhanced the level of ser-16 phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB), responsible for regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) activity. Furthermore, hypertrophic effect caused by overexpression of PP1cα was reduced by treatment with specific inhibitor of ERα. Collectively, we found that estrogen and estrogen receptor-α have protective effect against pathological cardiac changes by suppressing PP1 expression and its downstream signaling pathway, which further needs to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2799333581,"Because punishments are expected to give offenders what they deserve proportionally to the severity of their offenses, the punishment of an entire group because of the misdeed of a few of its members is generally considered as unfair. Group entitativity might increase support for such collective punishment, because members of highly entitative groups are perceived as more similar and interchangeable. We designed three experiments comparing support for third-party collective punishment of low versus high entitative groups. As comparison base-rate, we included conditions in which participants punish an individual wrongdoer (Experiments 1 & 2). Results show that although support for individual punishment is higher than support for collective punishment, this difference was reduced (Experiment 1) or absent (Experiment 2) when the group was highly entitative. Experiment 3 replicated the increasing effect of group entitativity on support for collective punishment. We conclude that group entitativity increases the likelihood of an entire group being treated as a single unit, facilitating collective punishment when a few group members commit an offense."
https://openalex.org/W2802209183,"The bionematicidal effect of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM) of four volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the endophytic fungus Daldinia cf. concentrica against the devastating plant-parasitic root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica has been recently demonstrated in both in vitro and greenhouse experiments. However, the mode of action governing the observed irreversible paralysis of J2 larvae upon exposure to SVM is unknown. To unravel the mechanism underlying the anthelmintic and nematicidal activities, we used the tractable model worm Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans was also susceptible to both the fungal VOCs and SVM. Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of C. elegans mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used C. elegans TJ356 strain zIs356 (daf-16::GFP+rol-6), LD1 ldIs7 [skn-1B/C::GFP + pRF4(rol-6(su1006))], LD1171 ldIs3 [gcs-1p::gfp; rol-6(su1006))], CL2166 dvIs19 (gst-4p::GFP) and CF1553 muIs84 (sod-3p::GFP+rol-6), which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, gcs-1::GFP and gst-4::GFP compared to controls. In contrast, application of 4-heptanone or SVM to the sod-3::GFP line elicited a significant decline in overall fluorescence intensity compared to controls, indicating SOD-3 downregulation and therefore overall reduction in cellular redox machinery. Our data indicate that the mode of action of SVM and 4-heptanone from D. cf. concentrica differs from that of currently available nematicides, potentially offering new solutions for nematode management."
https://openalex.org/W2801971352,"Purpose 
To assess if there are differences in the structure-function associations between healthy and glaucomatous eyes.


Methods 
Structure-function associations were assessed in healthy and glaucomatous eyes in three datasets, globally and in the six sectors of the optic nerve head. Structural parameters included rim area (RA) and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT). Functional parameters included unweighted mean of sensitivity thresholds (MS) and unweighted mean of total deviation values (MD), assessed with standard automated perimetry, short-wavelength automated perimetry, frequency-doubling technology perimetry, or contrast sensitivity perimetry. All structural and functional parameters were expressed as percent of mean normal. SF associations were assessed with correlation analyses (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall). We also assessed the SF associations with linear regression analyses: the generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to adjust for inter-eye correlations and ordinary least squares (OLS) linear models were used when these adjustments were not necessary. We applied Bonferroni corrections to adjust for the impact of multiple comparisons.


Results 
Overall, none of the Pearson correlations tested in healthy eyes were significant (correlations ranged from -0.17 to 0.37), whereas 77% of the correlations tested in glaucomatous eyes were significant (correlations ranged from 0.01 to 0.79). Similarly, none of the slopes obtained with GEE and OLS were significant in healthy eyes (slopes ranged from -0.30 to 0.87), whereas 82% of the slopes obtained in glaucomatous eyes were significant (slopes ranged from 0.02 to 1.38).


Conclusions 
Significant associations between structure and function were consistently observed in glaucomatous eyes, but not in healthy eyes. These differences in association should be considered in the design of structure-function models for progression."

TRPM8 activity is modulated by many mechanisms, including an interaction with the small membrane protein phosphoinositide-interacting regulator of TRP (PIRT).

We found that human PIRT attenuated human TPRM8 conductance, unlike mouse PIRT, which enhanced mouse TRPM8 conductance. Quantitative Western blot analysis demonstrates that this effect does not arise from decreased trafficking of TRPM8 to the plasma membrane. Chimeric human/mouse TRPM8 channels were generated to probe the molecular basis of the PIRT modulation, and the effect was recapitulated in a pore domain chimera, demonstrating the importance of this region for PIRT-mediated regulation of TRPM8.

NMR experiments, supported by a pulldown assay, indicated that PIRT binds directly and specifically to the TRPM8 S1–S4 domain. Binding became saturated as the S1–S4:PIRT mole ratio approached 1.

Patel K.N. Maag D. Geng Y. Dong X. Pirt, a phosphoinositide-binding protein, functions as a regulatory subunit of TRPV1.Cell. 2008; 133 (18455988): 475-48510.1016/j.cell.2008.02.053Google Scholar). Cell-surface trafficking experiments indicate that enhanced channel activity in mice is not caused by changes in expression levels or channel trafficking, supporting the idea that PIRT enhances channel activity by interacting directly with the channels rather than increasing the number of channels in the membrane (12Tang Z. Kim A. Masuch T. Park K. Weng H. Wetzel C. Dong X. Pirt functions as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23863968): 2179Google Scholar, 14Kim A.Y. Tang Z. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Maag D. Geng Y. Dong X. Pirt, a phosphoinositide-binding protein, functions as a regulatory subunit of TRPV1.Cell. 2008; 133 (18455988): 475-48510.1016/j.cell.2008.02.053Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that PIRT works synergistically with PIP2 to enhance TRPM8 currents by increasing conductance at the single channel level (13Tang M. Wu G.Y. Dong X.Z. Tang Z.X. Phosphoinositide interacting regulator of TRP (Pirt) enhances TRPM8 channel activity in vitro via increasing channel conductance.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2016; 37 (26657057): 98-10410.1038/aps.2015.110Google Scholar). However, the details of this interaction including the binding site and stoichiometry of PIRT to TRPM8 are unknown. Notably, these studies were carried out using mouse models and apparently heterologous expression of the mouse Pirt and Trp channel genes. TRP channels exhibit remarkable functional and sequence diversity not only between different channels in the family, but also between orthologs, i.e. the same gene product from different species (18Hilton J.K. Rath P. Helsell C.V. Beckstein O. Van Horn W.D. Understanding thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels as versatile polymodal cellular sensors.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25812016): 2401-241310.1021/acs.biochem.5b00071Google Scholar, 19Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Molecular basis for species-specific sensitivity to “hot” chili peppers.Cell. 2002; 108 (11853675): 421-43010.1016/S0092-8674(02)00637-2Google Scholar). These differences can manifest as important selected features between species; for example, the thermosensitivity of different species of TRPM8 is evolutionarily tuned to the appropriate temperature range based on organismal core body temperature and environment (20Myers B.R. Sigal Y.M. Julius D. Evolution of thermal response properties in a cold-activated TRP channel.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4 (19492038): e574110.1371/journal.pone.0005741Google Scholar), and avian TRPV1 is insensitive to capsaicin, a potent agonist of the mammalian ortholog, which allows for seed disbursement (19Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Molecular basis for species-specific sensitivity to “hot” chili peppers.Cell. 2002; 108 (11853675): 421-43010.1016/S0092-8674(02)00637-2Google Scholar). The results of this study focus on the human TRPM8 and PIRT gene products and for the first time reveal that in contrast to the increased conductance seen in the mouse proteins, human TRPM8 currents are attenuated in the presence of human PIRT. Analogous to previously published mouse studies, human PIRT does not reduce human TRPM8 cell-surface expression. Additionally, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation and in vitro pulldown experiments show that PIRT binds specifically to the S1–S4 domain of TRPM8, with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Transmembrane domain chimeras of human/mouse TRPM8 show that residues in the transmembrane domain (helices S1–S6), and in particular the pore domain (S5–S6), are the basis for modulation by PIRT and the species differences observed. These results shed light on the PIRT–TRPM8 interaction and reveal that the PIRT–TRPM8 complex has evolved in a species-dependent manner. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure current responses of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that were transiently transfected with either human TRPM8 and human PIRT or human TRPM8 and empty vector (Fig. 1A). Current responses to voltage steps from −100 to +100 mV were recorded using a standard step protocol (Fig. 1D). At ambient room temperature (∼23 °C), recordings of cells transfected with both human TRPM8 and PIRT resulted in significantly reduced currents compared with cells transfected with human TRPM8 and an empty pIRES2–DsRed vector at voltages of +60 mV and above; at +100 mV, cells transfected with human PIRT showed on average ∼69% of the current measured from cells expressing hTRPM8 alone. We further tested hPIRT modulation of hTRPM8 in the more physiologically relevant context of low temperature and menthol stimuli. In the presence of a TRPM8 saturating concentration of menthol (500 μm) (21Janssens A. Voets T. Ligand stoichiometry of the cold- and menthol-activated channel TRPM8.J. Physiol. 2011; 589 (21878524): 4827-483510.1113/jphysiol.2011.216523Google Scholar), current from human PIRT-transfected cells was significantly reduced at and above +30 mV, with ∼65% of the maximum current observed at +100 mV (Fig. 1B). At 15 °C, a TRPM8 saturating temperature, human PIRT-transfected cells exhibited significantly attenuated currents at all measured voltages except −90 mV. At +100 mV, cells expressing hPIRT exhibited ∼54% of the current evoked from TRPM8 alone (Fig. 1C). Temperature-dependent inward hTRPM8 currents were significantly reduced at physiological voltages (Fig. 1C). Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired Student’s t test; a minimum of 15 and maximum of 43 cells were measured for these conditions and clearly specified in Fig. 1. Mouse PIRT (mPIRT) has previously been established as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8 that enhances TRPM8 currents (12Tang Z. Kim A. Masuch T. Park K. Weng H. Wetzel C. Dong X. Pirt functions as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23863968): 2179Google Scholar). Using whole-cell patch clamp experiments, we were able to reproduce these results using the mouse orthologs, with mTPRM8 currents significantly higher in the presence of mPIRT. We note that the hTRPM8 currents are about twice the magnitude of mTRPM8 currents when PIRT was not expressed, highlighting the inherent functional differences between the two TRPM8 orthologs (Fig. 2A). Cross-species expression of PIRT with TRPM8 (e.g. hTRPM8/mPIRT) did not result in significant differences in currents (Fig. 2B). Previous studies have shown that TRP channel activity can be modulated by associated proteins that regulate channel trafficking to the membrane (22Gkika D. Lemonnier L. Shapovalov G. Gordienko D. Poux C. Bernardini M. Bokhobza A. Bidaux G. Degerny C. Verreman K. Guarmit B. Benahmed M. de Launoit Y. Bindels R.J. Fiorio Pla A. Prevarskaya N. TRP channel-associated factors are a novel protein family that regulates TRPM8 trafficking and activity.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 208 (25559186): 89-10710.1083/jcb.201402076Google Scholar). To test whether hPIRT affects hTRPM8 trafficking, we performed cell-surface expression experiments on HEK-293 cells transfected with human TRPM8 alone or with human TRPM8 and PIRT. Western blotting quantification from three independent experiments showed no significant difference in hTRPM8 plasma membrane expression levels in the presence and absence of hPIRT expression, confirming that hPIRT does not affect hTRPM8 membrane trafficking (Fig. 3A). This agrees with previous similar studies of the mouse orthologs, which show that mouse TRPM8 membrane trafficking is also not affected by mouse PIRT coexpression and that mouse PIRT increases single channel conductance (12Tang Z. Kim A. Masuch T. Park K. Weng H. Wetzel C. Dong X. Pirt functions as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23863968): 2179Google Scholar, 13Tang M. Wu G.Y. Dong X.Z. Tang Z.X.

Previously reported co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that mTRPM8 and mPIRT interact in the context of HEK-293 cells (12Tang Z. Kim A. Masuch T. Park K. Weng H. Wetzel C. Dong X. Pirt functions as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23863968): 2179Google Scholar). In particular, the C-terminal 26 residues of PIRT were shown to bind to both TRPV1 and TRPM8; additionally, a glutathione S-transferase-tagged form of the PIRT C terminus was shown to modulate currents from these two channels (12Tang Z. Kim A. Masuch T. Park K. Weng H. Wetzel C. Dong X. Pirt functions as an endogenous regulator of TRPM8.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23863968): 2179Google Scholar, 14Kim A.Y. Tang Z. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Maag D.

However, a follow-up study using mTRPV1 and mPIRT fused to fluorescent proteins detected no FRET signal (23Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Klein R.M. Hua L. Angueyra J. Gordon S.E. Localization of the PIP2 sensor of TRPV1 ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21224382): 9688-969810.1074/jbc.M110.192526Google Scholar). To date, nothing has been published regarding which regions of TRPV1 or TRPM8 interact with PIRT. To further probe the molecular basis of the TRPM8–PIRT complex, we performed an in vitro pulldown experiment. Given that PIRT is a small transmembrane protein, we reasoned that it likely interacts with a transmembrane region within TRPM8. TRP channels have a transmembrane topology similar to voltage-gated potassium channels, with six transmembrane helices that form an S1–S4 domain and a pore domain (S5–S6 helices) (18Hilton J.K. Rath P. Helsell C.V. Beckstein O. Van Horn W.D. Understanding thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels as versatile polymodal cellular sensors.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (25812016): 2401-241310.1021/acs.biochem.5b00071Google Scholar). Using purified hPIRT and hTRPM8 S1–S4 domains, where only the hPIRT protein contained a histidine affinity tag, the two proteins were mixed, bound to Ni-NTA resin, washed extensively (>50 column volumes) and eluted from the column. Analysis of the eluted fractions by SDS-PAGE showed that both hPIRT and hTRPM8 S1–S4 domains were eluted from the mixture, demonstrating that hPIRT interacts directly with the hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain as shown in Fig. 3B. The pulldown experiment was performed twice and had consistent results in showing the hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain–PIRT interaction. To further study this interaction, we performed an NMR titration of 15N-labeled hPIRT with hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain. We used 1H,15N-TROSY-HSQC experiments to measure 1H and 15N chemical shifts of hPIRT with increasing concentrations of the hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain (Fig. 4, A and C). A number of hPIRT resonances exhibited significant chemical shift perturbation (Δδ) with increasing hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain concentrations. Fig. 4 highlights two representative resonances (Fig. 4B) and plots the change in chemical shift (Δδ) as a function of the hTRPM8 S1–S4:hPIRT mole ratio (Fig. 4D). Fitting a single binding site model to these plots shows that binding becomes saturated as the molar ratio approaches 1 (Fig. 4D). The saturating chemical shift changes of these resonances indicate that the perturbation is the result of direct and specific binding interactions. The calculated Kd values for the two highlighted resonances were near a molar ratio of ∼0.5. As a negative control, we expressed and purified the voltage-sensing domain of KCNQ1 (KCNQ1–VSD), a voltage-gated potassium channel that is structurally homologous to TRPM8 but has not been shown to be modulated by PIRT. The TROSY-HSQC titration data of hPIRT and KCNQ1–VSD (Fig. 4, E and F) indicates that hPIRT does not bind to KCNQ1 as there is nonsaturating and minimal chemical shift perturbation identified in this control experiment. These data confirm the pulldown experimental results and show that hPIRT binds specifically and directly to the hTRPM8 S1–S4 domain with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Chimeric ion channels have proven a valuable research tool for identifying molecular bases of channel regulatory mechanisms and of functional differences between orthologues (19Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Molecular basis for species-specific sensitivity to “hot” chili peppers.Cell. 2002; 108 (11853675): 421-43010.1016/S0092-8674(02)00637-2Google Scholar, 24Matos-Cruz V. Schneider E.R. Mastrotto M.

To probe the functional determinants of TRPM8 modulation by PIRT, we generated a series of mouse and human TRPM8 chimeras to search for regions that give rise to species-specific phenotypes. The transmembrane core is known to be the nexus of TRP channel integration of stimuli. Because of this and the concise nature of PIRT, we chose to focus our search on this region, and we generated a series of transmembrane domain (TMD) chimeras. Based on sequence homology with other TRP channels for which cryo-EM structures have been solved, we defined the TMD as residues 672–1012. Within this region, there are only 11 residues that are different between mouse and human TRPM8. A recently determined cryo-EM structure of Ficedula albicollis TRPM8 allowed us to map these residues to specific regions in the channel (Fig. 5A) (27Yin Y. Wu M. Zubcevic L. Borschel W.F. Lander G.C. Lee S.Y. Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8.Science. 2018; 359 (29217583): 237-24110.1126/science.aan4325Google Scholar). Two divergent residues are found in the helical pre-S1 domain, four in the S2 helix, three in the pore loop, one in the S6 helix, and one in the TRP helix. We mutated residues in mTRPM8 to the corresponding residues found in hTRPM8 to generate three chimeric channels: mTRPM8hTMD, which includes all 11 residues from hTRPM8; mTRPM8hS1S4, which includes only hTRPM8 residues from the S1–S4 domain; and mTRPM8hPD, which includes hTRPM8 residues from the pore domain and TRP helix (Fig. 5B). We performed electrophysiology measurements to determine whether these chimeras reproduce the human phenotype in the presence of human PIRT. The mTRPM8hTMD construct produced a phenotype similar to hTRPM8 in the presence of hPIRT. When coexpressed with hPIRT, the channel exhibited 67 ± 13% of the current density without hPIRT at +100 mV with 500 μm menthol; this is close to the reduction observed with WT hTRPM8 and hPIRT (vector only, n = 15; hPIRT, n = 15; p = 0.03). This channel exhibited no difference in current when expressed with or without mPIRT, suggesting that the TMD plays a key role in the modulatory effect (Fig. 5C). The mTRPM8hS1S4 channel also exhibited a decreased average current density to 67 ± 13% of the current without hPIRT; however, a Student’s t test resulted in a higher p value (vector only, n = 14; hPIRT, n = 14; p = 0.1) (Fig. 5C). Finally, mTRPM8hPD showed significantly decreased current density to 75 ± 10% of the current without hPIRT (vector only, n = 12; hPIRT, n = 13; p = 0.03) (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results point to the transmembrane domain, and particularly the pore domain, as key functional determinants of TRPM8 modulation by PIRT. Intriguingly, the mTRPM8hPD chimera showed significantly increased currents compared with the other chimeras (Fig. 5D). An analysis of variance test showed a significant difference between the three groups (p = 0.0001; F = 11.4121) and a Tukey HSD test showed a significant difference between mM8hPD and mM8hS1S4 (p = 0.004), and between mM8hPD and mM8hTMD (p = 0.0002), but not between mM8hS1S4 and mM8hTMD (p = 0.6). WT mTRPM8 current density was also significantly lower compared with WT hTRPM8; thus, the five mutations in the pore domain and TRP helix are sufficient to confer higher, human-like current density to the mTRPM8 chimera. PIRT has previously been shown in behavioral knock-out mice studies to be important in thermosensation via regulation of the thermosensitive TRP channels TRPV1 and TRPM8, demonstrating that the biophysical effects of PIRT on TRPM8 are functionally significant at the organismal level (12Tang Z.

These studies focused on mouse orthologs of both the Trp channel and Pirt genes. Here, we present data from the human orthologs and show that the human PIRT–TRPM8 interaction results in an opposite modulatory effect compared with the mouse proteins. Previous studies have investigated PIRT binding with TRP channels. Dong and co-workers (14Kim A.Y. Tang Z. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Maag D. Geng Y. Dong X. Pirt, a phosphoinositide-binding protein, functions as a regulatory subunit of TRPV1.Cell. 2008; 133 (18455988): 475-48510.1016/j.cell.2008.02.053Google Scholar) expressed the first 53 residues of the N terminus and the last 26 residues of the C terminus fused to glutathione S-transferase tags and performed a pulldown assay with mouse TRPV1 and TRPM8. Their results indicate that the PIRT C and N termini bind strongly and weakly to the two TRP channels, respectively (14Kim A.Y. Tang Z. Liu Q. Patel K.N. Maag D. Geng Y. Dong X. Pirt, a phosphoinositide-binding protein, functions as a regulatory subunit of TRPV1.Cell. 2008; 133 (18455988): 475-48510.1016/j.cell.2008.02.053Google Scholar). However, as whole cell lysate was used, these data do not rule out an indirect interaction with other partner proteins in the complex. A second study by Gordon and co-workers (23Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Klein R.M. Hua L. Angueyra J. Gordon S.E. Localization of the PIP2 sensor of TRPV1 ion channels.J. Biol.

No FRET signal was observed; nevertheless, the lack of FRET signal does not necessarily rule out an association between the proteins, as this negative result could potentially occur for a number of reasons, such as suboptimal structural arrangement of the fluorophores (23Ufret-Vincenty C.A.

https://openalex.org/W2799666023,"Individual differences in lie detection remain poorly understood. Bond and DePaulo’s meta-analysis examined judges (receivers) who were ascertaining lies from truths and senders (deceiver) who told these lies and truths. Bond and DePaulo found that the accuracy of detecting deception depended more on the characteristics of senders rather than the judges’ ability to detect lies/truths. However, for many studies in this meta-analysis, judges could hear and understand senders. This made language comprehension a potential confound. This paper presents the results of two studies. Extending previous work, in Study 1, we removed language comprehension as a potential confound by having English-speakers (N = 126, mean age = 19.86) judge the veracity of German speakers (n = 12) in a lie detection task. The twelve lie-detection stimuli included emotional and non-emotional content, and were presented in three modalities–audio only, video only, and audio and video together. The intelligence (General, Auditory, Emotional) and personality (Dark Triads and Big 6) of participants was also assessed. In Study 2, a native German-speaking sample (N = 117, mean age = 29.10) were also tested on a similar lie detection task to provide a control condition. Despite significantly extending research design and the selection of constructs employed to capture individual differences, both studies replicated Bond and DePaulo’s findings. The results of Study1 indicated that removing language comprehension did not amplify individual differences in judge’s ability to ascertain lies from truths. Study 2 replicated these results confirming a lack of individual differences in judge’s ability to detect lies. The results of both studies suggest that Sender (deceiver) characteristics exerted a stronger influence on the outcomes of lie detection than the judge’s attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2800463877,"Elevated testosterone (T) is routinely reported as a marker of hyperandrogenemia in rodent models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In women with PCOS, elevated serum androstenedione (A4) is associated with more severe phenotypes, including a positive correlation with serum T, DHEAS, free androgen index (FAI), LH, and LH/FSH ratio. Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to > 50 y).The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16-19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder. Significant A4 elevation develops between early adolescence and early adulthood in this PNA rat model."
https://openalex.org/W2802323558,"The period of early ontogeny constitutes a time when the physical immaturity of an organism is highly susceptible to external stimuli. Thus, early development plays a major role in shaping later adult behavior. The aim of the study was to check whether stimulating puppies at this early stage in life with sound would improve their responsiveness towards unfamiliar noises during the selection process of the police behavioral test for puppies. The cohort comprised 37 puppies from the litters of three mothers. At the commencement of the experiment the dogs were aged 16 days, rising to the age of 32 days at its close. The mothers and litters of the treatment group were either exposed to radio broadcasts, (see below; three litters totaling 19 puppies), while the control group was not exposed to any radio programs (eight litters totaling 18 puppies). All three mothers had previously experienced both auditory circumstances, as described herein. Ordinary radio broadcasts were played to the puppies in the treatment group three times a day for 20 minute periods, always during feeding time. The cohort was subjected to the so-called Puppy Test, i.e. analysis of the potential of each animal, once the dogs had reached the age of 7 weeks. Such tests included exposure to a sudden noise caused by a shovel (100 dB), noise when alone in a room, and response to loud distracting stimuli (the latter two at 70 dB). Said tasks were rated by the same analyst on a scale of 0-5 points; the better the response of the dog, the higher the score given. The differences between the treatment and control groups were analyzed via Mixed Models (PROC MIXED) in SAS. The animals comprising the treatment group responded with a higher score to the sudden noise caused by the shovel than the control dogs (P<0.01). Interestingly, gender was seen to affect response, with the males scoring more than the females (P<0.1). In conclusion, the results suggested that audio stimulation early in life improved the response of the dogs to intense sudden noise, as caused by the shovel. Therefore, acoustic stimulation during the very early period of life has the potential to raise the necessary skills of dogs for military and police purposes, or civilian life."
https://openalex.org/W2799707898,"Blasts from different patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) vary in the agent(s) to which they are most responsive. With a myriad of novel agents to evaluate, there is a lack of predictive biomarkers to precisely assign targeted therapies to individual patients. Primary AML cells often survive poorly in vitro, thus confounding conventional cytotoxicity assays. The purpose of this work was to assess the potential of two same-day functional predictive assays in AML cell lines to predict long-term response to chemotherapy. (i) Ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a downstream substrate of PI3K/akt/mTOR/ kinase and MAPK kinase pathways and its dephosphorylation is also triggered by DNA double strand breaks. Phospho-rpS6 is reliably measurable by flow cytometry and thus has the potential to function as a biomarker of responsiveness to several therapeutic agents. (ii) A cell’s propensity for apoptosis can be interrogated via a functional assay termed “Dynamic BH3 Profiling” in which mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization in drug-treated cells can be driven by pro-apoptotic BH3 domain peptides such as PUMA-BH3. The extent to which a particular cell is primed for apoptosis by the drug can be determined by measuring the amount of cytochrome C released on addition of BH3 peptide. We demonstrate that phospho-rpS6 expression and PUMA-BH3 peptide-induced cytochrome C release after 4 hours both predict long term chemoresponsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and DNA double strand break inducers in AML cell lines. We also describe changes in expression levels of the prosurvival BCL-2 family member Mcl-1 and the pro-apoptotic protein BIM after short term drug culture."

The present study is aimed to assess the potential differences in CT imaging by socioeconomic status (SES) in Spanish young scanned subjects and if such differences vary with different indicators or different time point SES measurements. The associations between CT scanning and SES, and between the CT scan rate per patient and SES were investigated in the Spanish EPI-CT subcohort. Various SES indicators were studied to determine whether particular SES dimensions were more closely related to the probability of undergoing one or multiple CTs. Comparisons were made with indices based on 2001 and 2011 censuses. We found evidence of socio-economic variation among young people, mainly related to autonomous communities of residence. A slightly higher rate of scans per patient of multiple body parts in the less affluent categories was observed, possibly reflecting a higher rate of accidents and violence in these groups. The number of CT scans per patient was higher both in the most affluent and the most deprived categories and somewhat lower in the intermediate groups. This relation varied with the SES indicator used, with lower CT scans per patients in categories of high unemployment and temporary work, but not depending on categories of unskilled work or illiteracy. The relationship between these indicators and number of CTs in 2011 was different than that seen with the 2001 census, with the number of CTs increasing with higher unemployment. Overall we observed some differences in the SES distribution of scanned patients by Autonomous Community in Spain. There was, however, no major differences in the frequency of CT scans per patient by SES overall, based on the 2001 census. The use of different indicators and of SES data collected at different time points led to different relations between SES and frequency of CT scans, outlining the difficulty of adequately capturing the social and economic dimensions which may affect health and health service utilisation."
https://openalex.org/W2799466153,"Background While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs). Methods Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented. Results The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years. Conclusion Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports."
https://openalex.org/W2800527220,"Claims and accusations of political bias are common in many countries. The essence of such claims is a denunciation of alleged violations of political neutrality in the context of media coverage, legal and bureaucratic decisions, academic teaching etc. Yet the acts and messages that give rise to such claims are also embedded within a context of intergroup competition. Thus, in evaluating the seriousness of, and the need for taking a corrective action in reaction to a purported politically biased act people may consider both the alleged normative violation and the political implications of the act/message for the evaluator's ingroup. The question thus arises whether partisans react similarly to ingroup-aiding and ingroup-harming actions or messages which they perceive as politically biased. In three separate studies, conducted in two countries, we show that political considerations strongly affect partisans' reactions to actions and messages that they perceive as politically biased. Namely, ingroup-harming biased messages/acts are considered more serious and are more likely to warrant corrective action in comparison to ingroup-aiding biased messages/acts. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the implementations of measures intended for correcting and preventing biases, and for the nature of conflict and competition between rival political groups."

Highly metastatic cell lines forming spontaneous metastasis following orthotopic implantation were previously developed and characterized regarding their biological and histological characteristics. This study aimed to non-invasively and longitudinally characterize the spatiotemporal pattern of metastasis formation and progression in the MDA-MB-231-derived triple negative LM2-4 and HER2+ LM2-4H2N cell lines, using bioluminescence imaging (BLI), contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), fluorescence imaging, and 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET).LM2-4, LM2-4H2N, and MDA-MB-231 tumors were established in the right inguinal mammary fat pad (MFP) of female SCID mice and resected 14-16 days later. Metastasis formation was monitored using BLI. Metabolic activity of primary and metastatic lesions in mice bearing LM2-4 or LM2-4H2N was assessed by [18F]FDG-PET. Metastatic burden at study endpoint was assessed by CT and fluorescence imaging following intravenous dual-modality liposome agent administration.Comparable temporal metastasis patterns were observed using BLI for the highly metastatic cell lines LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N, while metastasis formed about 10 days later for MDA-MB-231. 21 days post primary tumor resection, metastases were detected in 86% of LM2-4, 69% of LM2-4H2N, and 60% of MDA-MB-231 inoculated mice, predominantly in the axillary region, contralateral MFP, and liver/lung. LM2-4 and LM2-4H2N tumors displayed high metabolism based on [18F]FDG-PET uptake. Lung metastases were detected as the [18F]FDG-PET uptake increased significantly between pre- and post-metastasis scan. Using a liposomal dual-modality agent, CT and fluorescence confirmed BLI detected lesions and identified additional metastatic nodules in the intraperitoneal cavity and lung.The combination of complementary anatomical and functional imaging techniques can provide high sensitivity characterization of metastatic disease spread, progression and overall disease burden. The described models and imaging toolset can be implemented as an effective means for quantitative treatment response evaluation in metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2802159290,"The objective was to determine whether maternal nutritional factors are associated with transient neonatal hyperinsulinism (HI).Case control study in 4 French tertiary Obstetrics and Neonatology Departments between 2008 and 2015.Sixty-seven mothers of neonates diagnosed with transient hyperinsulinism and 113 mothers of controls were included. The screening for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in neonates was performed because of clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia or in the presence of conventional risk factors (small-for-gestational-age, prematurity, anoxo-ischemia, hypothermia, macrosomia, gestational diabetes). Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia was confirmed in the HI neonates and ruled out in the controls. This allowed for comparing maternal nutrition in cases and controls in a context of similar risk factors. One to 2 mothers of control neonates were included per case, and a food frequency questionnaire was addressed to the mothers between day 5 and day 10 after the birth of their newborn.Crude odds ratio showed that maternal weight gain, abnormal fetal rate, C-section, gender, consumption of fresh cooked vegetables, fresh fruits and fruit juices, low fat diary products, light fat products, and daily bread were significantly associated with hyperinsulinism. Maternal body mass index, hypertension, gestational diabetes, birth weight percentile, gestational age and 5-minute Apgar score were not related to HI. In a multiple backward logistic regression model, consumption of fresh cooked vegetable ≥1/day (OR = 0.33 [0.14-0.77]) and light-fat products ≥1/week (OR = 0.24 [0.08-0.71]) was protective against hyperinsulinism, whereas gestational weight gain >20 kg (OR = 9.5 [2.0-45.5]) and between 15-20 kg (OR = 4.0 [1.2-14.0]), abnormal fetal heart rate (OR = 4.4 [1.6-12.0]), and C-section (OR = 3.4 [1.3-8.9]) were risk factors.A diet rich in fresh cooked vegetable and reduced in fat, together with the avoidance of a high gestational weight gain may be protective against transient neonatal hyperinsulinism."
https://openalex.org/W2800068246,"Monoamines and neuropeptides often modulate the same behavior, but monoaminergic-peptidergic crosstalk remains poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the adrenergic-like ligands, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) require distinct subsets of neuropeptides in the two ASI sensory neurons to inhibit nociception. TA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by nlp-14 or nlp-18 from either synaptic/perisynaptic regions of ASI axons or the ASI soma, respectively, and OA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by nlp-9 asymmetrically, from only the synaptic/perisynaptic region of the right ASI axon. The predicted amino acid preprosequences of genes encoding either TA- or OA-dependent neuropeptides differed markedly. However, these distinct preprosequences were not sufficient to confer monoamine-specificity and additional N-terminal peptide-encoding sequence was required. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TA and OA specifically and differentially modulate the release of distinct subsets of neuropeptides from different subcellular sites within the ASIs, highlighting the complexity of monoaminergic/peptidergic modulation, even in animals with a relatively simple nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2800804588,"The role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement in the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in all consecutive patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% is still a matter of hot debate due to the fact that the population of these patients is highly heterogeneous in terms of the SCD risk. Nevertheless, reduced LVEF is still the only established criterion during qualification of patients for ICD implantation in the primary prevention of SCD, therefore identification of persons with particularly high risk among patients with LVEF ≤35% is currently of lesser importance. More important seems to be the selection of individuals with relatively low risk of SCD in whom ICD implantation can be safely postponed. The aim of the study was to determine whether well-known, non-invasive parameters, such as microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA), baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and short-term heart rate variability (HRV), can be helpful in the identification of low-arrhythmic risk patients with ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction.In 141 patients with coronary artery disease and LVEF ≤ 35%, MTWA testing, as well as BRS and short-term HRV parameters, were analysed. During 34 ± 13 months of follow-up 37 patients had arrhythmic episode (EVENT): SCD, non-fatal sustained ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF]), or adequate high-voltage ICD intervention (shock) due to a rapid ventricular arrhythmia ≥200/min. LVEF, non-negative MTWA (MTWA_non-neg), BRS and low frequency power in normalized units (LFnu) turned out to be associated with the incidence of EVENT in univariate Cox analysis. The cut-off values for BRS and LFnu that most accurately distinguished between patients with and without EVENT were 3 ms/mmHg and 23, respectively. The only variable that provided 100% negative predictive value (NPV) for EVENT was negative MTWA result (MTWA_neg), but solely for initial 12 months of the follow-up; the NPVs for other potential predictors of the EVENT were lower. The cut-off values for BRS and LFnu that provide 100% NPV for EVENT during 12 and 24 months were higher: 6.0 ms/mmHg and 73 respectively, but the gain in the NPV occurred at an expense of the number of identified patients. However, the number of identified non-risk patients turned out to be higher when the predictive model included MTWA_neg and the lower cut-off values for ANS parameters: 100% NPV for 12 and 24 months of follow-up was obtained for combination MTWA_neg and BRS ≥ 3 ms/mmHg, for combination MTWA_neg and LFnu ≥ 23 100% NPV was obtained for 12 months.Well-known, non-invasive parameters, such as MTWA, BRS and short-term HRV indices may be helpful in the identification of individuals with a relatively low risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias among patients with ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction; in such persons, implantation of ICD could be safely postponed."
https://openalex.org/W2799418374,"Nectin-2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is involved in the process of Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that Nectin-2 is over-expressed in breast and ovarian cancer tissues by using gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we discovered multiple anti-Nectin-2 fully human monoclonal antibodies which inhibited tumor growth in in vivo subcutaneous xenograft models with antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as the principal mechanism of action. In this report, we assessed the toxicity of Y-443, a fully human IgG1/kappa anti-Nectin-2 monoclonal antibody exhibiting strong in vitro ADCC and in vivo anti-tumor activity in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis (Cynos)). Unexpectedly, upon administration, Y-443 induced strong thrombocytopenia through Nectin-2 expressed on Cyno platelets, presumably followed by phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocytic system. To mitigate the adverse safety profile, we mutated the Fc region of Y-443 to reduce the Fc binding activity to Fcγ receptor I, which is the primary receptor for phagocytosis on macrophages. Moreover, we further engineered the Fc through defucosylation to maintain ADCC activity. The resultant Fc engineered antibody, termed Y-634, demonstrated diminished thrombocytopenia in Cyno toxicological studies and maintained anti-tumor activity in a mouse xenograft model. These findings suggest that Y-634 may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of Nectin-2 positive cancers, and moreover, Fc engineering is a potential mitigation strategy to ameliorate safety liabilities in antibody induced thrombocytopenia while maintaining antibody potency."
https://openalex.org/W2800753953,"We addressed how individuals' power influences their judgments regarding corporate transgressions. Based on the Situated Focus Theory of Power, which theorizes that powerful people respond more in accordance to circumstantial factors, we tested the interaction of power and the type of corporate discourse offered by the accused company. Across two studies (overall N = 216), we experimentally primed power (Study 1) and manipulated participants' sense of direct control over the company (Study 2). We consistently found an interaction effect of power and corporate discourse on people's negative attitudes toward the company-particularly on the unwillingness to use the company's products. Particularly, high-power individuals were prone to strongly vary their attitudes based on the mitigative/non-mitigative nature of the discourse, while those low in power were unsusceptible to the type of discourse. The results suggest how the potential rise of consumer power in society may critically influence the consumer-corporate relationships following corporate transgressions."
https://openalex.org/W2802881137,"Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples."
https://openalex.org/W2799971374,"We sought to evaluate the effect of antiplatelet therapy in addition to conventional immunosuppressive therapy for lupus nephritis (LN) patients positive for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) without definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).Patients with biopsy-proven LN class III or IV were retrospectively evaluated. We selected patients positive for anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) or lupus anticoagulant (LA) who did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of APS. The patients were divided into two subgroups according to whether antiplatelet therapy was received. The cumulative complete renal response (CR) rate, relapse-free rate, and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over 3 years after induction therapy were calculated.We identified 17 patients who received antiplatelet therapy and 21 who did not. Baseline clinicopathological characteristics and immunosuppressive therapy did not show a significant difference between the two groups except for a higher incidence of LN class IV in the treatment group (p = 0.03). There was no difference in cumulative CR rate, relapse-free rate, or eGFR change between these subgroups. However, when data on LA-positive patients were assessed, an improvement in eGFR was found (p = 0.04) in patients receiving antiplatelet treatment.Addition of anti-platelet therapy was associated with an improvement of eGFR in LA-positive patients with LN class III or IV."
https://openalex.org/W2802420512,"The fat-tail financial data and cyclical financial market makes it difficult for the fixed structure model based on Gaussian distribution to characterize the dynamics of corporate bonds spreads. Using a flexible structure model based on generalized error distribution, this paper focuses on the impact of macro-level factors on the spreads of corporate bonds in China. It is found that in China's corporate bonds market, macroeconomic conditions have obvious structural transformational effects on bonds spreads, and their structural features remain stable with the downgrade of bonds ratings. The impact of macroeconomic conditions on spreads is significant for different structures, and the differences between the structures increase as ratings decline. For different structures, the persistent characteristics of bonds spreads are obviously stronger than those of recursive ones, which suggest an obvious speculation in bonds market. It is also found that the structure switching of bonds with different ratings is not synchronous, which indicates the shift of investment between different grades of bonds."
