https://openalex.org/W2054692302,"Variations in maternal care affect the development of individual differences in neuroendocrine responses to stress in rats. As adults, the offspring of mothers that exhibited more licking and grooming of pups during the first 10 days of life showed reduced plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone responses to acute stress, increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression, enhanced glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity, and decreased levels of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone messenger RNA. Each measure was significantly correlated with the frequency of maternal licking and grooming (all r 's &gt; −0.6). These findings suggest that maternal behavior serves to “program” hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W1591647183,"Cannabinoid receptors are molecular targets for marijuana and hashish, the widespread drugs of abuse. These receptors are expressed in areas of the central nervous system that contribute in important ways to the control of memory, cognition, movement and pain perception1. Indeed, such functions can be strongly influenced by cannabinoid drugs, with consequences that include euphoria, analgesia, sedation and memory impairment2. Although the pharmacology of cannabinoid drugs is now beginning to be understood, we still lack essential information on the endogenous signalling system(s) by which cannabinoid receptors are normally engaged. An endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors, anandamide, has been described3. Here we report that sn-2 arachidonylglycerol (2-AG), a cannabinoid ligand isolated from intestinal tissue4, is present in brain in amounts 170 times greater than anandamide. 2-AG is produced in hippocampal slices by stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals, an excitatory fibre tract that projects from CA3 to CA1 neurons. Formation of 2-AG is calcium dependent and is mediated by the enzymes phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase. 2-AG activates neuronal cannabinoid receptors as a full agonist, and prevents the induction of long-term potentiation at CA3–CA1 synapses. Our results indicate that 2-AG is a second endogenous cannabinoid ligand in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2127404676,"Dendritic cells have the remarkable property of presenting any incoming antigen. To do so they must not only capture antigens with high efficiency and broad specificity, but must also maximize their capacity to load class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with antigenic peptides in order to present a large array of epitopes from different proteins, each at a sufficient copy number. Here we show that formation of peptide-MHC class II complexes is boosted by inflammatory stimuli that induce maturation of dendritic cells. In immature dendritic cells, class II molecules are rapidly internalized and recycled, turning over with a half-life of about 10 hours. Inflammatory stimuli induce a rapid and transient boost of class II synthesis, while the half-life of class II molecules increases to over 100 hours. These coordinated changes result in the rapid accumulation of a large number of long-lived peptide-loaded MHC class II molecules capable of stimulating T cells even after several days. The capacity of dendritic cells to load many antigenic peptides over a short period of initial exposure to inflammatory stimuli could favour presentation of infectious antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2107208446,"The Hill coefficient is commonly used to estimate the number of ligand molecules that are required to bind to a receptor to produce a functional effect. However, for a receptor with more than one ligand binding site, the Hill equation does not reflect a physically possible reaction scheme; only under the very specific condition of marked positive cooperativity does the Hill coefficient accurately estimate the number of binding sites. The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an “interaction” coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand–receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand–receptor interaction is available.—Weiss, J. N. The Hill equation revisited: uses and misuses. FASEB J. 11, 835–841 (1997)"
https://openalex.org/W1483922594,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have the unique capacity to initiate primary and secondary immune responses1,2,3. They acquire antigens in peripheral tissues and migrate to lymphoid organs where they present processed peptides to T cells. DCs must therefore exist in distinct functional states, an idea that is supported by observations that they downregulate endocytosis and upregulate surface molecules of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) upon maturation4,5,6,7. Here we investigate the features of DC maturation by reconstituting the terminal differentiation of mouse DCs in vitro and in situ. We find that early DCs, corresponding to those found in peripheral tissues, exhibit a phenotype in which most class II molecules are intracellular and localized to lysosomes. Upon maturation, these cells give rise to a new intermediate phenotype in which intracellular class II molecules are found in peripheral non-lysosomal vesicles, similar to the specialized CIIV population seen in B cells. The intermediate cells then differentiate into late DCs which express almost all of their class II molecules on the plasma membrane. These variations in class II compartmentalization are accompanied by dramatic alterations in the intracellular transport of the new class II molecules and in antigen presentation. We found that although early DCs could not present antigen immediately after uptake, efficient presentation of the previously internalized antigen occurred after maturation, 24–48 hours later. By regulating class II transport and compartmentalization, DCs are able to delay antigen display, a property crucial to their role in immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W1523646668,"Lurcher (Lc) is a spontaneous, semidominant mouse neurological mutation1. Heterozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/+) display ataxia as a result of a selective, cell-autonomous and apoptotic death of cerebellar Purkinje cells during postnatal development2,3,4. Homozygous Lurcher mice (Lc/Lc) die shortly after birth because of a massive loss of mid- and hindbrain neurons during late embryogenesis5. We have used positional cloning to identify the mutations responsible for neurodegeneration in two independent Lc alleles as G-to-A transitions that change a highly conserved alanine to a threonine residue in transmembrane domain III of the mouse δ2 glutamate receptor gene (GluRδ2). Lc/+ Purkinje cells have a very high membrane conductance and a depolarized resting potential, indicating the presence of a large, constitutive inward current. Expression of the mutant GluRδ2Lc protein in Xenopus oocytes confirmed these results, demonstrating that Lc is inherited as a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a gain-of-function mutation in a glutamate receptor gene. Thus the activation of apoptotic neuronal death in Lurcher mice may provide a physiologically relevant model for excitotoxic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2119261083,"Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus encodes a chemokine called vMIP-II. This protein displayed a broader spectrum of receptor activities than any mammalian chemokine as it bound with high affinity to a number of both CC and CXC chemokine receptors. Binding of vMIP-II, however, was not associated with the normal, rapid mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores; instead, it blocked calcium mobilization induced by endogenous chemokines. In freshly isolated human monocytes the virally encoded vMIP-II acted as a potent and efficient antagonist of chemotaxis induced by chemokines. Because vMIP-II could inhibit cell entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mediated through CCR3 and CCR5 as well as CXCR4, this protein may serve as a lead for development of broad-spectrum anti-HIV agents."
https://openalex.org/W2160942082,"Gangliosides participate in development and tissue differentiation. Cross-linking of the apoptosis-inducing CD95 protein (also called Fas or APO-1) in lymphoid and myeloid tumor cells triggered GD3 ganglioside synthesis and transient accumulation. CD95-induced GD3 accumulation depended on integral receptor ""death domains"" and on activation of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. Cell-permeating ceramides, which are potent inducers of apoptosis, also triggered GD3 synthesis. GD3 disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), and induced apoptosis, in a caspase-independent fashion. Transient overexpression of the GD3 synthase gene directly triggered apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of GD3 synthesis and exposure to GD3 synthase antisense oligodeoxynucleotides prevented CD95-induced apoptosis. Thus, GD3 ganglioside mediates the propagation of CD95-generated apoptotic signals in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1599762863,"Classical endocrine studies have shown that steroid hormones are required for the maintenance of pregnancy and placental viability. The oestrogen-receptor-related receptor beta (ERR-beta) is an orphan member of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors. Although ERR-beta is homologous to the oestrogen receptor and binds the oestrogen response element, it is not activated by oestrogens. Expression of ERR-beta during embryogenesis defines a subset of extra-embryonic ectoderm that subsequently forms the dome of the chorion, suggesting that ERR-beta may be involved in early placental development. Homozygous mutant embryos generated by targeted disruption of the Estrrb gene have severely impaired placental formation, and die at 10.5 days post-coitum. The mutants display abnormal chorion development associated with an overabundance of trophoblast giant cells and a severe deficiency of diploid trophoblast. The phenotype can be rescued by aggregation of Estrrb mutant embryos with tetraploid wild-type cells, which contribute exclusively to extra-embryonic tissues. Our results indicate that ERR-beta has an important role in early placentation, and suggest that an inductive signal originating from or modified by the chorion is required for normal trophoblast proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1646791064,"The chaperonin GroEL is a double-ring structure with a central cavity in each ring that provides an environment for the efficient folding of proteins when capped by the co-chaperone GroES in the presence of adenine nucleotides. Productive folding of the substrate rhodanese has been observed in cis ternary complexes, where GroES and polypeptide are bound to the same ring, formed with either ATP, ADP or non-hydrolysable ATP analogues, suggesting that the specific requirement for ATP is confined to an action in the trans ring that evicts GroES and polypeptide from the cis side. We show here, however, that for the folding of malate dehydrogenase and Rubisco there is also an absolute requirement for ATP in the cis ring, as ADP and AMP-PNP are unable to promote folding. We investigated the specific roles of binding and hydrolysis of ATP in the cis and trans rings using mutant forms of GroEL that bind ATP but are defective in its hydrolysis. Binding of ATP and GroES in cis initiated productive folding inside a highly stable GroEL-ATP-GroES complex. To discharge GroES and polypeptide, ATP hydrolysis in the cis ring was required to form a GroEL-ADP-GroES complex with decreased stability, priming the cis complex for release by ATP binding (without hydrolysis) in the trans ring. These observations offer an explanation of why GroEL functions as a double-ring complex."
https://openalex.org/W1651559800,"The ability to recognize individual animals has substantially increased our knowledge of the biology and behaviour of many taxa1. However, not all species lend themselves to this approach, either because of insufficient phenotypic variation or because tag attachment is not feasible. The use of genetic markers (‘tags’) represents a viable alternative to traditional methods of individual recognition, as they are permanent and exist in all individuals. We tested the use of genetic markers as the primary means of identifying individuals in a study of humpback whales in the North Atlantic Ocean. Analysis of six microsatellite loci2,3 among 3,060 skin samples collected throughout this ocean allowed the unequivocal identification of individuals. Analysis of 692 ‘recaptures’, identified by their genotype, revealed individual local and migratory movements of up to 10,000 km, limited exchange among summer feeding grounds, and mixing in winter breeding areas, and also allowed the first estimates of animal abundance based solely on genotypic data. Our study demonstrates that genetic tagging is not only feasible, but generates data (for example, on sex) that can be valuable when interpreting the results of tagging experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2065643866,"p53 is a pivotal regulator of apoptosis but its mechanism of action is obscure. We report that the polyproline (PP) region located between p53's transactivation and DNA binding domains is necessary to induce apoptosis but not cell growth arrest. The PP region was dispensable for DNA binding, inhibition of SAOS-2 tumor cell growth, suppression of E1A + RAS cell transformation, and cell cycle inhibition. A temperature-sensitive dominant inhibitory p53 mutant lacking PP (p53ts deltaPP) retained its ability to cooperate with adenovirus E1A in transformation of primary BRK cells. However, while activation of wt p53 induced apoptosis in E1A + p53ts-transformed cells, activation of p53 deltaPP induced cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis in E1A + p53ts deltaPP-transformed cells. Similarly, PP deletion abolished apoptosis in LoVo colon carcinoma cells, which are killed by wt p53 overexpression. Transactivation was largely unaffected by PP deletion. Significantly, BAX induction was intact, indicating that additional events are required for p53 to induce apoptosis. As a recently described site for familial mutation in at least one breast cancer family, the PP region represents a domain that may be altered in human tumors. We concluded that p53's ability to induce apoptosis is dispensable for inhibiting cell growth and transformation and that the PP region plays a crucial role in apoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1599970242,"An increasing number of reports underscore the frequent association of fibrosclerotic diseases of lung, liver, arterial wall, brain, etc., with the accumulation of oxidatively modified lipids and proteins. A cause-and-effect relationship has been proposed between cellular oxidative damage and increased fibrogenesis based on the fact that experimental treatment with antioxidants either prevents or quenches the fibrotic process. With some peculiarities in the different organs, fibrosclerosis is essentially the result of the interaction of macrophages and extracellular matrix-producing cells. The cross-talk is mediated by fibrogenic cytokines, among which the most important appears to be transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). This report describes treatment of different types of macrophage, of both human and murine origin, with 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (HNE) a major aldehyde end product of membrane lipid oxidation found consistently to induce both mRNA expression and synthesis of TGF-beta1. Since increased HNE levels have been demostrated in the cirrhotic liver and in the oxidatively modified low-density human lipoproteins associated with atherosclerosis, the up-regulation of macrophage TGF-beta1 by HNE appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these and similar diseases characterized by fibrosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1516075858,"Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation is important in understanding vascular disease; however, no in vitro model is available. Totipotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used to establish such a model. To test whether the ES cell-derived smooth muscle cells expressed VSMC-specific properties, the differentiated cells were characterized by 1) morphological analysis, 2) gene expression, 3) immunostaining for VSMC-specific proteins, 4) expression of characteristic VSMC ion channels, and 5) formation of [Ca2+]i transients in response to VSMC-specific agonists. Treatment of embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid bodies with retinoic acid and dibutyryl-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP) induced differentiation of spontaneously contracting cell clusters in 67% of embryoid bodies compared with 10% of untreated controls. The highest differentiation rate was observed when retinoic acid and db-cAMP were applied to the embryoid bodies between days 7 and 11 in combination with frequent changes of culture medium. Other protocols with retinoic acid and db-cAMP, as well as single or combined treatment with VEGF, ECGF, bFGF, aFGF, fibronectin, matrigel, or hypoxia did not influence the differentiation rate. Single-cell RT-PCR and sequencing of the PCR products identified myosin heavy chain (MHC) splice variants distinguishing between gut and VSMC isoforms. RT-PCR with VSMC-specific MHC primers and immunostaining confirmed the presence of VSMC transcripts and MHC protein. Furthermore, VSMC expressing MHC had typical ion channels and responded to specific agonists with an increased [Ca2+]i. Here we present a retinoic acid + db-cAMP-inducible embryonic stem cell model of in vitro vasculogenesis. ES cell-derived cells expressing VSMC-specific MHC and functional VSMC properties may be a suitable system to study mechanisms of VSMC differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1665361046,"Although only a subset of protein enzymes depend on the presence of a metal ion for their catalytic function, all naturally occurring RNA enzymes require metal ions to stabilize their structure and for catalytic competence. In the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila, several divalent metals can serve structural roles, but only Mg2+ and Mn2+ promote splice-site cleavage and exon ligation. A study of a ribozyme reaction analogous to 5'-splice-site cleavage by guanosine uncovered the first metal ion with a definitive role in catalysis. Substitution of the 3'-oxygen of the leaving group with sulphur resulted in a metal-specificity switch, indicating an interaction between the leaving group and the metal ion. Here we use 3'-(thioinosylyl)-(3'-->5')-uridine, IspU, as a substrate in a reaction that emulates exon ligation. Activity requires the addition of a thiophilic metal ion (Cd2+ or Mn2+), providing evidence for stabilization of the leaving group by a metal ion in that step of splicing. Based on the principle of microscopic reversibility, this metal ion activates the nucleophilic 3'-hydroxyl of guanosine in the first step of splicing, supporting the model of a two-metal-ion active site."
https://openalex.org/W1587969070,"Chemical separations represent a large portion of the cost of bringing any new pharmaceutical product to the market. Membrane-based separation technologies1,2, in which the target molecule is selectively extracted and transported across a membrane, are potentially more economical and easier to implement than competing separations methods; but membranes with higher transport selectivities are required. Here we describe an approach for preparing highly selective membranes which involves immobilizing apoenzymes within a microporous composite. The apoenzyme selectively recognizes its substrate molecule and transports it across the composite membrane, without effecting the unwanted chemical conversion of the substrate molecule to product. We demonstrate this approach using three different apoenzymes. Most importantly, it can be used to make enantioselective membranes for chiral separations, one of the most challenging and important problems in bioseparations technology. We are able to achieve a fivefold difference between the transport rates of D- and L-amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1660995962,"The removal of intervening sequences from premessenger RNA is essential for the expression of most eukaryotic genes. The spliceosome ribonucleoprotein complex catalyses intron removal by two sequential phosphotransesterification reactions1, but the catalytic mechanisms are unknown. It has been proposed that two divalent metal ions may mediate catalysis of both reaction steps, activating the 2′- or 3′-hydroxyl groups for nucleophilic attack and stabilizing the 3′-oxyanion leaving groups by direct coordination2. Here we show that in splicing reactions with a precursor RNA containing a 3′-sulphur substitution at the 5′ splice site, interaction between metal ion and leaving group is essential for catalysis of the first reaction step. This establishes that the spliceosome is a metalloenzyme and demonstrates a direct parallel with the catalytic strategy used by the self-splicing group I intron from Tetrahymena3. In contrast, 3′-sulphur substitution at the 3′ splice site provides no evidence for a metal ion–leaving group interaction in the second reaction step, suggesting that the two steps of splicing proceed by different catalytic mechanisms and therefore in distinct active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2006705432,"The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST displays remarkable substrate specificity, in vitro and in vivo for p130cas a signalling intermediate implicated in mitogenic signalling, cell-adhesion induced signalling, and in transformation by a variety of oncogenes. We have identified a high affinity interaction between the SH3 domain of p130cas and a proline-rich sequence (P335PPKPPR) within the C-terminal segment of PTP-PEST. Mutation of proline 337 within this sequence to alanine significantly impairs the ability of PTP-PEST to recognise tyrosine phosphorylated p130cas as a substrate, without qualitatively affecting the selectivity of the interaction. Thus the highly specific nature of the interaction between PTP-PEST and p130cas appears to result from a combination of two distinct substrate recognition mechanisms; the catalytic domain of PTP-PEST contributes specificity to the interaction with p130cas, whereas the SH3 domain-mediated association of p130cas and PTP-PEST dramatically increases the efficiency of the interaction. Furthermore, our results indicate that one important function of the p130cas SH3 domain is to associate with PTP-PEST and thereby facilitate the dephosphorylation of p130cas, resulting in the termination of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signalling events downstream of p130cas."
https://openalex.org/W1996988163,"ERM, ER81 and PEA3 are three highly related transcription factors belonging to the ETS family. Together they form the PEA3 group within this family. Little data is yet available regarding the roles of these three genes during embryonic development. A prerequisite to investigations in this field is to obtain an accurate spatio-temporal expression map for the erm, er81 and pea3 genes. To this end, we have used in situ hybridization to compare their expression patterns during critical stages of murine embryogenesis. We report that all three genes are expressed in numerous developing organs coming from different embryonic tissues. The three genes appeared co-expressed in different organs but presented specific sites of expression, so that the resultant expression pattern could in fact reveal several distinct functions depending upon isolated and/or various combinations of the PEA3 member expression. These results suggest that erm, er81 and pea3 genes are differentially regulated, probably to serve important functions as cell proliferation control, tissue interaction mediator or cell differentiation, all over successive steps of the mouse organogenesis."

Exogenously supplied nitric oxide donors such as S-nitrosoglutathione produced equivalent alterations. Preactivation of macrophages with a combination of lipopolysaccharide/interferon γ under conditions of blocked NO synthase—NG-monomethyl-L-arginine addition—or stimulation with a low, nondestructive dose of S-nitrosoglutathione conferred protection against high and thus apoptotic NO concentrations. Here we report that induction of cyclooxygenase-2 during the preactivation period is a critical regulator of macrophage apoptosis. Under resting conditions, macrophages do not express cyclooxygenase-2, whereas lipopolysaccharide/interferon γ/NG-monomethyl-L-arginine prestimulation for 12–15 h caused protein expression. In parallel, preactivation of RAW cells with a low, nontoxic dose of S-nitrosoglutathione promoted protection and cyclooxygenase-2 up-regulation. To prove cyclooxygenase-2 involvement during protection, we stably transfected RAW 264.7 macrophages with a rat cyclooxygenase-2 expression vector. Cyclooxygenase-2 overexpressing macrophages, preactivated with the calcium liberating and thus phopholipase A2-activating agent A23187, revealed protection against exogenously supplied NO. Protection afforded by lipopolysaccharide/interferon γ/NG-monomethyl-L-arginine prestimulation was completely reversed by the addition of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 or in macrophages stably transfected with an antisense cyclooxygenase-2 expression vector.

https://openalex.org/W2325151665,"The carboxy terminus of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit is highly conserved. Seven out of the last nine residues, including two potential in vivo phosphorylation sites, threonine 304 and tyrosine 307, are completely invariant in all known PP2As. Mutational analysis of the carboxy terminus in vivo was facilitated by efficient immunoprecipitation of trimeric PP2A holoenzyme via an epitope-tagged catalytic subunit. The results indicate that the catalytic subunit carboxy terminus is important for complex formation with the PP2A 55 kDa regulatory B subunit, but not with polyomavirus oncogene, middle tumor antigen (MT), a viral B-type regulatory subunit. Replacing catalytic subunit threonine 304 or tyrosine 307 with a negatively charged amino acid abolished binding of the B subunit to the dimeric enzyme core and altered substrate specificity. Certain other amino acid substitutions of different size and/or charge also abolished or greatly reduced B subunit binding. Substitution of alanine at position 304 or phenylalanine at position 307 did not dramatically reduce B subunit binding or phosphatase activity in vitro, yet the latter substitutions are not found in naturally occurring PP2As. Thus, the wild-type residues are important for a yet unknown function in vivo. Additionally, deleting the carboxy terminal nine amino acids inhibited binding of the B subunit to the dimeric enzyme core, indicating a requirement for one or more of these amino acids for complex formation. MT interaction with the dimeric PP2A enzyme core was not inhibited by any of these mutations. Finally, unlike B subunit, MT does not activate the phosphatase activity of the PP2A heterodimer towards cdc2-phosphorylated histone H1."

EμBmi1 transgenic mice, overexpressing the wild type Bmi1 protein showed a perturbed lymphoid development and were highly susceptible to B and T cell lymphomagenesis. Mutational analysis of the Bmi1 protein demonstrated that the conserved N-terminal RING finger and central part of Bmi1 are essential for its oncogenic potential whereas the C-terminal Pro-Ser rich region is not required. We have used provirus tagging in the EμBmi1 mice to identify genes that cooperate with Bmi1 in lymphomagenesis. MoMLV infection in EμBmi1 transgenic mice accelerated lymphoma development. Proviral activation of the Pim and Myc genes but not the Gfi1 gene were frequently observed in these tumors.

https://openalex.org/W2314840537,"Activation of the AP-1 transcription factor and TGF-beta1 growth factor by ionizing radiation was studied both in vivo in pig skin, and in vitro in human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Three and 6 h after irradiation, the Fos and Jun proteins and their binding activity to an AP-1 consensus sequence were strongly induced by high doses of gamma-rays. c-Fos, c-Jun and JunB proteins were found to be present in gel-shift complexes by probing with specific antibodies. Both keratinocytes and fibroblasts exhibited heightened AP-1 activity following irradiation. As we previously found that TGF-beta1 is involved in the development of skin lesions induced by radiation, TGF-beta1 gene expression was also examined. Two and 6 h after irradiation, the levels of TGF-beta1 transcripts were increased in skin. By immunostaining, TGF-beta1 protein levels were found to be increased in fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells. As the TGF-beta1 promoter contains AP-1 binding sites, the relation between AP-1 activity and TGF-beta1 induction was addressed. The -365 TGF-beta1 promoter fragment, which contains a high affinity AP-1 site, exhibited increased binding to Jun and Fos proteins following irradiation. These results suggest that stress-inducible TGF-beta1 expression is mediated by the activation of AP-1 transcription factor."

Both tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and UV light rapidly stimulated Ca2+-independent activity of CaM-KII in the monocytic leukemia, U937. Two mechanistically different inhibitors of CaM-KII blocked activation of CaM-KII and prevented DNA fragmentation and death. Activation of CaM-KII during apoptosis and inhibition of DNA fragmentation by the two CaM-KII inhibitors were reproduced in several other lines including KGla, HL-60, and YAC-1. However, K562, which is relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by either TNF or UV light, did not activate CaM-KII in response to these stimuli. A variant derived from U937 that is resistant to TNF- or UV light-induced apoptosis also lacked a CaM-KII response. Activation of Cam-KII was blocked by two protease inhibitors, VAD-fmk and TPCK, but not by other inhibitors of serine proteases. Both inhibitors of CaM-KII and the protease inhibitors blocked activation of AP24, a serine protease originally isolated from apoptotic cells that induces DNA fragmentation in nuclei. Our evidence supports a model in which proteolytic activity functions upstream of CaM-KII. This kinase then leads to activation of AP24, which transmits signals to the nucleus to initiate DNA fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W1937680110,"The effect of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) on L-type calcium channel currents was studied in cultured rat and human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Barium currents through L-type channels were measured in the perforated patch-clamp technique and identified by using the L-type calcium channel opener Bay K8644 (10(-6) M). Application of the PTK blockers genistein (5 x 10(-6) M) or lavendustin A (5 x 10(-6) M) led to a decrease of L-type currents. The inactive genistein analog daidzein (10(-5) M) showed no effect on calcium channels. Intracellular application of pp60(c-src) (30 U/ml) via the patch-pipette during the conventional whole-cell configuration led to an increase of L-type currents. The protein kinase A and protein kinase G blocker H9 (10(-6) M) showed no effect on L-type currents; genistein reduced the current in the presence of H9. The protein kinase C (PKC) blocker chelerythrine (10(-5) M) reduced the L-type current; additional inhibition of PTK by lavendustin showed an additional reduction of currents. Intracellular application of myristoylated PKC substrate (5 x 10(-5) M) for PKC inhibition led to a fast rundown of L-type current amplitudes. Intracellularly applied myristoylated PKC substrate (10(-4) M) together with pp60(c-src) showed no effect on L-type current. Up-regulation of PKC by 10(-6) M phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) had no effect on the L-type current amplitude. However, genistein in cells pretreated with PMA led to an increase of the L-type currents. Intracellular application of pp60(c-src) in PMA-treated cells led to a reduction of L-type currents. We conclude that in the resting cell, PTK and PKC regulate L-type calcium channels in an additive manner. L-type channels appeared as a site of integration of PTK activation and of PKC-dependent pathways. The activity of PKC determines whether PTK decreases or increases L-type channel activity."

Upregulation of KGF expression was related to hormone insensitive tumours (P<0.05). Tumour grade and stage were not associated with KGF expression. The source of KGF expression was further characterised using an in vitro primary culture model, showing its restriction to the prostatic stroma. The FGFR1IIIb isoform was expressed in all cases of prostate cancer (n = 17), and FGFR1IIIc mRNA was not detected. In the BPH group, FGFR1IIIb transcripts were detected in four out of six cases. FGFR2IIIb expression was detected in five of six cases of BPH and twelve out of seventeen (71%) cases of prostate cancer. In CaP, though not reaching statistical significance, the persistence of FGFR2IIIb expression appeared to be associated with hormone insensitive tumours (P=0.052). FGFR2IIIc expression was present in eleven of seventeen tumours but was absent in all six cases of BPH. Functional assessment of recombinant KGF in a proliferation assay demonstrated a mitogenic effect of up to 100% on cultured prostatic epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551064372,"We have monitored specifically the [Ca2+] in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of intact HeLa cells using an ER-targeted low-Ca2+-affinity aequorin. The steady-state [Ca2+] in the ER was around 600 microM. Histamine induced a concentration-dependent decrease in lumenal [Ca2+], whose rate increased near one order of magnitude and became ""quantal"" when cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) was clamped with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. This effect was not due to decreased Ca2+ pumping because simultaneous addition of a SERCA inhibitor produced only additive effects. Given that inhibition by [Ca2+]c of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated channels requires a [Ca2+]c much higher than that observed in the bulk cytosol after histamine addition, we conclude that local [Ca2+]c microdomains at the site of release strongly inhibit agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization in intact cells. This effect should play a key role in the mechanism controlling cytosolic [Ca2+] oscillations and waves, and therefore in the generation of spatio-temporal Ca2+ patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2034265732,"The teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor-1 (TDGF-1) gene codes for a 188-aminoacid glycoprotein that shares structural homology with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of growth factors. TDGF-1 is highly expressed in the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma stem cell line NTERA2 clone D1 (NT2/D1) and its expression is downregulated in response to differentiating agents such as retinoic acid (RA) and hexamethylen-bisacetamide (HMBA). To assess the role of TDGF-1 in the onset and/or progression of human germ cell tumors, we analysed TDGF-1 expression by Northern blot and immunostaining in a panel of 59 human germ cell tumors of different histological origins. We show that TDGF-1 expression is markedly elevated in a subset of human testicular germ cell tumors as compared to normal testes. TDGF-1 overexpression occurs in about 100% of tumors with non-seminomatous phenotype, such as embryonal carcinomas and malignant undifferentiated teratocarcinomas. To address the questions of how TDGF-1 (previously called CRIPTO) may affect the growth and/or the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells, we have characterized the effects of exogenous recombinant TDGF-1 protein on the proliferation rate and differentiation 'potential of NT2/D1. Exogenous TDGF-1 protein stimulated DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in both undifferentiated and differentiated NT2/D1 cells. However, TDGF-1 protein treatment was unable to block differentiation induced by both RA and HMBA. These results suggest that TDGF-1 growth factor may represent an autocrine growth factor that may be involved in the process of development of testicular neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2333825803,"Loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10 is considered to be associated with the progression of glioblastomas. Two closely related regions have recently been proposed to contain the glioblastoma suppressor locus on chromosome 10q25-26; a 1 cM region between the polymorphic (CA)n-repeat markers D10S587 and D10S216, and an area of 5 cM between the markers D10S221 and D10S209. To confirm and further delineate this region, we analyzed 51 glioblastomas and 11 intermediate and low-grade gliomas for loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 10. 47/62 mostly malignant gliomas displayed complete loss of chromosome 10 and nine tumors were unaltered, whereas four glioblastomas and two low-grade oligodendrogliomas had partial loss on distal 10q. With these six tumors, we constructed a deletion map with increased marker density at 10q25-26 which shows two centromeric breakpoints at the markers D10S587 and D10S216, thus only confirming the distal, but not the proximal candidate glioblastoma suppressor locus. Two out of four low-grade oligodendrogliomas displayed partial deletions on 10q25-26. This suggests that deletion on chromosome 10 is not merely a late event in the progression of glioblastomas, but could play a role earlier in the development of gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2314992740,"Exogenously introduced wild-type and mutant p53 have recently been reported to enhance the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) gene promoter activity in p53-deficient Saos2 osteosarcoma cells. A p53 binding site residing at position −265/−239 in the EGF-R proximal promoter has also been identified. We investigated the p53 regulation of EGF-R core promoter activity in human cell lines with varying endogenour p53 status. Wild-type and mutant p53A1a143 enhanced the EGF-R core promotor activity in cells that were either p53-deficient or contained wild-type or mutant endogenous p53. Upon further characterization of the various deletion fragments of the EGF-R promoter, we identified a wild-type p53 responsive 62 bp region residing at position −167/−105. The −167/−105 segment was responsive only to wild-type p53 but not to mutant p53A1a143 or p53His273. The −167/−105 segment of the EGF-R promotor contains one perfect and several imperfect consensus p53-binding half sites; indeed in gel shift experiments the 62 bp −167/−105 segment as well as the oligonucleotides corresponding to two p53 consensus half-sites within the 62 bp fragment, exhibited binding to p53-containing protein complexes. Thus, we have identified an additional wild-type p53 responsive site in the human EGF-R promoter. This site containing consensus p53-binding sequences resides at position −167/−105 and is proximal to recently identified p53 binding element located at position −265/−239 in the EGF-R promotor."
https://openalex.org/W2312417709,"In human leukemias and lymphomas nonrandom chromosomal rearrangements cause changes in cell growth and/or survival in such a way as to promote malignancy. The detailed study of the biochemical and genetic pathways altered in human cancer requires the identification or development of models to allow the study and manipulation of cancer gene function. Recently, the breakpoint gene TCL1, involved in chromosome translocations observed mostly in mature T-cell proliferations and chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), was isolated and characterized, and showed to be part of a new gene family of proteins involved in these tumors. The murine Tcl1 gene, is similar in sequence to the murine and human MTCP1 gene also involved in T cell leukemias. The murine Tcl1 gene was shown to reside on mouse chromosome 12 in a region syntenic to human chromosome 14. Furthermore, we show that the murine Tcl1 gene is expressed early in mouse embryonic development and demonstrates expression in fetal hematopoietic organs as well as in immature T and B cells. Characterization of the murine Tcl1 gene will help in developing a mouse model of CLL and would provide the best opportunity to study and decipher the role of TCL1 in malignant transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1480682703,"Jurkat T cells express a functional endopeptidase 24.11 that is involved in the regulation of T cell activation. We have analyzed the effect of ectopic CD10 expression in mutant Jurkat cell clones that fail to express CD10 and, unlike wild-type cells, are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of the protein kinase C activator, PMA. No differences in the expression of the mRNA encoding the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta isoforms of PKC were found in parental vs. PMA-resistant Jurkat cells, ruling out the possibility that the defect could be accounted for by an altered expression of one of these isoforms. Phorbol ester-induced growth arrest was not due to apoptosis since PMA failed to trigger DNA fragmentation in parental and mutant Jurkat T cells. CD10 mRNA expression and activity were abrogated in four independent PMA-resistant Jurkat T cell clones compared to parental cells, whereas the activities of several other peptidases were unaffected. Transfection of one mutant clone with a functional endopeptidase 24.11 restored in a significant manner PMA-induced growth arrest in all the clones selected and tested, whereas transfection of an inactive form of endopeptidase 24.11 had no effect, demonstrating that the enzymatic activity of CD10 is critical in the mediation of the PMA growth arrest. The data presented here demonstrate that a functional CD10 is required for PMA-induced growth arrest in Jurkat cells and provide further evidence for a role of endopeptidase 24.11 in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2165164903,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is by far the best-studied unicellular eukaryote. Although yeast cells are very similar to higher eukaryotes in many respects, there is striking evidence that S. cerevisiae is not a perfect model for a eukaryotic cell (cf. 1). Here we report that yeast proteins contain a significantly lower amount of cysteine residues compared to other eukaryotes. Explanations for this phenomenon could not be found in the sulfur metabolism of yeast, which showed no major differences from other organisms (2-4). However, previous examinations could link a defect in sulfate uptake of S. cerevisiae to an increased resistance against toxic substances like selenate and chromate in the environment, which share the same permeases (5-7). This environmental problem might have caused S. cerevisiae to down-regulate its sulfate uptake and therefore lead to a lower amount of available sulfur in the cell, making it necessary to replace all dispensable sulfur amino acids in proteins. We show in two examples that S. cerevisiae proteins contain only such cysteine residues that are structurally or functionally needed. Therefore, we conclude that S. cerevisiae has solved a widespread environmental problem in a specific way which might be unique among eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W1552500927,"Although quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using internal standards may perform reproducibly, the calibration of the normal level is problematic. Three test sequences (171, 213, and 260 base pairs [bp]) from the c-erbB2 oncogene were separately coamplified with a 133 bp control sequence from the single copy gene p53 in differential PCR. Sequence length differences between the oncogene and control sequences influenced the ratio estimates, obviously because of less efficient synthesis of the longer sequence. Increase in primer concentration of the longer oncogene sequences adjusted this imbalance, and the expected ratio of 1.0 could be reached. The primer or target sequence also influenced the ratio estimate, since the 171 bp oncogene sequence was as efficiently synthesized as the 133 bp control sequence but with lower primer concentration. The 260 bp oncogene sequence produced the most stable results, probably because of clear band separation in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A ratio estimate of 1.0 was produced by oncogene and control gene primer concentrations of 3.5 pmol/microl and 0.6 pmol/microl, respectively. Calibrated quantitative PCR methodology is applicable to many areas and offers an excellent tool for screening allele deletions, supernumerary alleles, or chromosomes associated with familial diseases or disease syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2331510768,"The Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (RB1) plays a role in a variety of human cancers. Experimental analyses have indicated that the protein product of the RB1 gene (pRb) plays a role in cell cycle regulation. pRb function is dependent on its ability to bind to cellular factors, which is facilitated by multiple protein binding domains within pRb. Mutations within these domains which eliminate the ability of pRb to bind its targets result in loss of function. Although loss of pRb function may lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, tumorigenesis is not the only response to pRb inactivation. Examination of various tissues from RB1-nullizygous mouse embryos showed problems in differentiation and induction of apoptosis, suggesting that the ultimate response to the loss of pRb is influenced by cellular context. It has previously been demonstrated in RB1-negative Saos-2 cells that co-expression of the C-terminal domain of pRb with wildtype pRb resulted in escape from G1 arrest and continued cell cycling. In this paper we demonstrate that in RB1-positive Mv1Lu cells, expression of the A/B pocket region or the N-terminus (when combined with a nuclear localization signal), but not the C-terminal domain, is able to competitively disrupt the function of the endogenous pRb, and that the result of this disruption is apoptosis."
