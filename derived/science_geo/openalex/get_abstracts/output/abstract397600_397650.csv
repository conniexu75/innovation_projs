https://openalex.org/W2032230795,"Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world. By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers."

https://openalex.org/W2078050686,"Smart materials with an in-built ability to repair damage caused by normal wear and tear could prove useful in a wide range of applications. Most healable polymer-based materials so far developed require heating of the damaged area. But Burnworth et al. have now produced materials — in the form of polymer strands linked through metal complexes — that can be mended through exposure to light. The metal complexes in these materials can absorb ultraviolet light that is then converted into heat, which temporarily unlinks the polymer strands for quick and efficient defect healing. In principle, healing can take place in situ and while under load. Polymers with the ability to repair themselves after sustaining damage could extend the lifetimes of materials used in many applications1. Most approaches to healable materials require heating the damaged area2,3,4. Here we present metallosupramolecular polymers that can be mended through exposure to light. They consist of telechelic, rubbery, low-molecular-mass polymers with ligand end groups that are non-covalently linked through metal-ion binding. On exposure to ultraviolet light, the metal–ligand motifs are electronically excited and the absorbed energy is converted into heat. This causes temporary disengagement of the metal–ligand motifs and a concomitant reversible decrease in the polymers’ molecular mass and viscosity5, thereby allowing quick and efficient defect healing. Light can be applied locally to a damage site, so objects can in principle be healed under load. We anticipate that this approach to healable materials, based on supramolecular polymers and a light–heat conversion step, can be applied to a wide range of supramolecular materials that use different chemistries."

https://openalex.org/W2057040546,"TRIM5 is a RING domain-E3 ubiquitin ligase that restricts infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and other retroviruses immediately following virus invasion of the target cell cytoplasm. Antiviral potency correlates with TRIM5 avidity for the retrovirion capsid lattice and several reports indicate that TRIM5 has a role in signal transduction, but the precise mechanism of restriction is unknown. Here we demonstrate that TRIM5 promotes innate immune signalling and that this activity is amplified by retroviral infection and interaction with the capsid lattice. Acting with the heterodimeric, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A (also known as UBE2N-UBE2V1), TRIM5 catalyses the synthesis of unattached K63-linked ubiquitin chains that activate the TAK1 (also known as MAP3K7) kinase complex and stimulate AP-1 and NFκB signalling. Interaction with the HIV-1 capsid lattice greatly enhances the UBC13-UEV1A-dependent E3 activity of TRIM5 and challenge with retroviruses induces the transcription of AP-1 and NF-κB-dependent factors with a magnitude that tracks with TRIM5 avidity for the invading capsid. Finally, TAK1 and UBC13-UEV1A contribute to capsid-specific restriction by TRIM5. Thus, the retroviral restriction factor TRIM5 has two additional activities that are linked to restriction: it constitutively promotes innate immune signalling and it acts as a pattern recognition receptor specific for the retrovirus capsid lattice."
https://openalex.org/W2017886758,"Cellular messenger RNA levels are achieved by the combinatorial complexity of factors controlling transcription, yet the small number of molecules involved in these pathways fluctuates stochastically. It has not yet been experimentally possible to observe the activity of single polymerases on an endogenous gene to elucidate how these events occur in vivo. Here, we describe a method of fluctuation analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA to measure dynamics of nascent RNA--including initiation, elongation, and termination--at an active yeast locus. We find no transcriptional memory between initiation events, and elongation speed can vary by threefold throughout the cell cycle. By measuring the abundance and intranuclear mobility of an upstream transcription factor, we observe that the gene firing rate is directly determined by trans-activating factor search times."
https://openalex.org/W2055466946,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) is thought to regulate neurodevelopmental processes through maternal-fetal interactions that have long-term mental health implications. It is thought that beyond fetal 5-HT neurons there are significant maternal contributions to fetal 5-HT during pregnancy but this has not been tested empirically. To examine putative central and peripheral sources of embryonic brain 5-HT, we used Pet1(-/-) (also called Fev) mice in which most dorsal raphe neurons lack 5-HT. We detected previously unknown differences in accumulation of 5-HT between the forebrain and hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous source of 5-HT which is not of maternal origin. Using additional genetic strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo and direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, we investigated the nature of this exogenous source. We uncovered a placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor in both mice and humans. This study reveals a new, direct role for placental metabolic pathways in modulating fetal brain development and indicates that maternal-placental-fetal interactions could underlie the pronounced impact of 5-HT on long-lasting mental health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1965493795,"Protein synthesis and autophagic degradation are regulated in an opposite manner by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), whereas under certain conditions it would be beneficial if they occurred in unison to handle rapid protein turnover. We observed a distinct cellular compartment at the trans side of the Golgi apparatus, the TOR-autophagy spatial coupling compartment (TASCC), where (auto)lysosomes and mTOR accumulated during Ras-induced senescence. mTOR recruitment to the TASCC was amino acid- and Rag guanosine triphosphatase-dependent, and disruption of mTOR localization to the TASCC suppressed interleukin-6/8 synthesis. TASCC formation was observed during macrophage differentiation and in glomerular podocytes; both displayed increased protein secretion. The spatial coupling of cells' catabolic and anabolic machinery could augment their respective functions and facilitate the mass synthesis of secretory proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2051011892,"Genetic approaches to manipulating or eradicating disease vectors have been proposed as alternatives to malaria eradication. The success of this approach depends on efficient spread of a genetic modification in field populations. Windbichler et al. show that a synthetic genetic element consisting of mosquito regulatory elements and the homing endonuclease gene I-SceI can spread from a small number of individual Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes into large receptive populations in just a few generations. This is the first demonstration of a synthetic gene drive system in the main human malaria vector — and a similar approach should be applicable to many other pest species. Genetic methods of manipulating or eradicating disease vector populations have long been discussed as an attractive alternative to existing control measures because of their potential advantages in terms of effectiveness and species specificity1,2,3. The development of genetically engineered malaria-resistant mosquitoes has shown, as a proof of principle, the possibility of targeting the mosquito’s ability to serve as a disease vector4,5,6,7. The translation of these achievements into control measures requires an effective technology to spread a genetic modification from laboratory mosquitoes to field populations8. We have suggested previously that homing endonuclease genes (HEGs), a class of simple selfish genetic elements, could be exploited for this purpose9. Here we demonstrate that a synthetic genetic element, consisting of mosquito regulatory regions10 and the homing endonuclease gene I-SceI11,12,13, can substantially increase its transmission to the progeny in transgenic mosquitoes of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. We show that the I-SceI element is able to invade receptive mosquito cage populations rapidly, validating mathematical models for the transmission dynamics of HEGs. Molecular analyses confirm that expression of I-SceI in the male germline induces high rates of site-specific chromosomal cleavage and gene conversion, which results in the gain of the I-SceI gene, and underlies the observed genetic drive. These findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which genetic control measures can be implemented. Our results also show in principle how sequence-specific genetic drive elements like HEGs could be used to take the step from the genetic engineering of individuals to the genetic engineering of populations."

https://openalex.org/W2022884364,"Mountain glaciers and ice caps are contributing significantly to present rates of sea level rise and will continue to do so over the next century and beyond. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, located off the northwestern shore of Greenland, contains one-third of the global volume of land ice outside the ice sheets, but its contribution to sea-level change remains largely unknown. Here we show that the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has recently lost 61 ± 7 gigatonnes per year (Gt yr(-1)) of ice, contributing 0.17 ± 0.02 mm yr(-1) to sea-level rise. Our estimates are of regional mass changes for the ice caps and glaciers of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago referring to the years 2004 to 2009 and are based on three independent approaches: surface mass-budget modelling plus an estimate of ice discharge (SMB+D), repeat satellite laser altimetry (ICESat) and repeat satellite gravimetry (GRACE). All three approaches show consistent and large mass-loss estimates. Between the periods 2004-2006 and 2007-2009, the rate of mass loss sharply increased from 31 ± 8 Gt yr(-1) to 92 ± 12 Gt yr(-1) in direct response to warmer summer temperatures, to which rates of ice loss are highly sensitive (64 ± 14 Gt yr(-1) per 1 K increase). The duration of the study is too short to establish a long-term trend, but for 2007-2009, the increase in the rate of mass loss makes the Canadian Arctic Archipelago the single largest contributor to eustatic sea-level rise outside Greenland and Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W1988744799,"Mitochondria regulate critical components of cellular function via ATP production, reactive oxygen species production, Ca2+ handling and apoptotic signaling. Two classical methods exist to study mitochondrial function of skeletal muscles: isolated mitochondria and permeabilized myofibers. Whereas mitochondrial isolation removes a portion of the mitochondria from their cellular environment, myofiber permeabilization preserves mitochondrial morphology and functional interactions with other intracellular components. Despite this, isolated mitochondria remain the most commonly used method to infer in vivo mitochondrial function. In this study, we directly compared measures of several key aspects of mitochondrial function in both isolated mitochondria and permeabilized myofibers of rat gastrocnemius muscle. Here we show that mitochondrial isolation i) induced fragmented organelle morphology; ii) dramatically sensitized the permeability transition pore sensitivity to a Ca2+ challenge; iii) differentially altered mitochondrial respiration depending upon the respiratory conditions; and iv) dramatically increased H2O2 production. These alterations are qualitatively similar to the changes in mitochondrial structure and function observed in vivo after cellular stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, but are generally of much greater magnitude. Furthermore, mitochondrial isolation markedly altered electron transport chain protein stoichiometry. Collectively, our results demonstrate that isolated mitochondria possess functional characteristics that differ fundamentally from those of intact mitochondria in permeabilized myofibers. Our work and that of others underscores the importance of studying mitochondrial function in tissue preparations where mitochondrial structure is preserved and all mitochondria are represented."

https://openalex.org/W1975050610,"Flaviviruses include the most prevalent and medically challenging viruses. Persistent infection with flaviviruses of epithelial cells and hepatocytes that do not undergo cell death is common. Here, we report that, in epithelial cells, up-regulation of autophagy following flavivirus infection markedly enhances virus replication and that one flavivirus gene, NS4A, uniquely determines the up-regulation of autophagy. Dengue-2 and Modoc (a murine flavivirus) kill primary murine macrophages but protect epithelial cells and fibroblasts against death provoked by several insults. The flavivirus-induced protection derives from the up-regulation of autophagy, as up-regulation of autophagy by starvation or inactivation of mammalian target of rapamycin also protects the cells against insult, whereas inhibition of autophagy via inactivation of PI3K nullifies the protection conferred by flavivirus. Inhibition of autophagy also limits replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc virus in epithelial cells. Expression of flavivirus NS4A is sufficient to induce PI3K-dependent autophagy and to protect cells against death; expression of other viral genes, including NS2A and NS4B, fails to protect cells against several stressors. Flavivirus NS4A protein induces autophagy in epithelial cells and thus protects them from death during infection. As autophagy is vital to flavivirus replication in these cells, NS4A is therefore also identified as a critical determinant of flavivirus replication.

Over 2.5 billion people live in areas at high risk for Dengue and related flavivirus infections (1Halstead S.B. Lancet. 2007; 370: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Dengue hemorrhagic fever, a severe complication present in ∼5% of cases, claims more lives annually than all other hemorrhagic fevers combined (2Morens D.M. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 2009; 28: 635-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); much of the damage is caused by death of infected cells. The fate of infected cells depends on cell type. Although flavivirus induces apoptosis of neurons and macrophages, infected hepatocytes and epithelial cells do not die. We find that flavivirus up-regulates autophagy in MDCK 3The abbreviations used are: MDCKMadin-Darby canine kidney cellm.o.i.multiplicity of infection3-MA3-methyladenineMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastCPTcamptothecinSTSstaurosporineCHXcycloheximideTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateqRTquantitative RTpfuplaque-forming unitERendoplasmic reticulumhpihours post-infection. renal epithelial cells and other cell types and subsequently protects them. We further identify nonstructural protein NS4A of both Dengue-2 and Modoc viruses as the sole viral mediator of autophagy up-regulation and protection against death. Up-regulation of autophagosomes by either live virus infection or NS4A expression depends on PI3K and is important for replication of flavivirus in renal epithelial cells.

Flaviviruses often persist in liver and kidney following the acute phase of infection, suggesting that infected cells evade destruction by the host immune response, likely by flavivirus-induced up-regulation of autophagy in these cells. In vitro infection of hepatocytes and fibroblasts leads to up-regulation in autophagy and protection against death (3Lee Y.R. Lei H.Y. Liu M.T. Wang J.R. Chen S.H. Jiang-Shieh Y.F. Lin Y.S. Yeh T.M. Liu C.C. Liu H.S. Virology. 2008; 374: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 4Lee C.J. Liao C.L. Lin Y.L. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8388-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). More relevant, Dengue-2 viruses replicate within the hepatocyte autophagosomes (5Panyasrivanit M. Khakpoor A. Wikan N. Smith D.R. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; 90: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and inhibition of autophagy attenuates virus replication (3Lee Y.R. Lei H.Y. Liu M.T. Wang J.R. Chen S.H. Jiang-Shieh Y.F. Lin Y.S. Yeh T.M. Liu C.C. Liu H.S. Virology. 2008; 374: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We extend these findings by identifying the nonstructural viral protein NS4A as the virus-encoded protein that up-regulates autophagy and thus protects the host cell against death, providing a well protected host cell for long term replication of virus. The flavivirus genome contains 10 genes encoding an ∼11-kDa polyprotein precursor that binds to the ER membrane after translation at the rough ER as follows: three structural proteins (capsid (core) protein, pre-membrane protein, and envelope glycoprotein) and seven nonstructural genes (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) that mediate viral replication, assembly, and evasion of the host immune system. The active proteins are cleaved from the ER-bound viral polyprotein by cellular proteases signalase and furin and viral protease NS3/2B. NS3 is both a viral protease (with required cofactor NS2B (6Falgout B. Pethel M. Zhang Y.M. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2467-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and a viral ATP-dependent helicase (7Li H. Clum S. You S. Ebner K.E. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3108-3116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takegami T. Sakamuro D. Furukawa T. Virus Genes. 1995; 9: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); NS5 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase (9Zhou Y. Ray D. Zhao Y. Dong H. Ren S. Li Z. Guo Y. Bernard K.A. Shi P.Y. Li H. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3891-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) responsible for virus genome replication, whereas NS1 is possibly a part of the viral replication complex (10Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small hydrophobic flavivirus proteins (NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B) remain the most poorly characterized. NS2A is required for the assembly of new flavivirus virions; NS4A associates with the virus replication complex and induces ER membrane rearrangements (discussed below), and NS4B is an antagonist of interferon. Flavivirus NS4A is an ∼16-kDa membrane-associated protein consisting of four transmembrane helices and an N-terminal cytosolic region. Once the viral genome is translated in the ER, NS4A is cleaved in the cytoplasm by viral NS2B-3 protease complex. The transmembrane domain of NS4A is cleaved by host signalase in the ER lumen (11Lin C. Amberg S.M. Chambers T.J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2327-2335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mature NS4A then promotes membrane rearrangements by inducing curvature of the ER membrane (12Miller S. Kastner S. Krijnse-Locker J. Bühler S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8873-8882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G.

Virol. 2006; 80: 4623-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). NS4A also colocalizes with double-stranded RNA. NS4A and NS1 must interact for viral RNA synthesis to be efficient, suggesting that NS4A is the docking site for the replication complex (12Miller S. Kastner S. Krijnse-Locker J. Bühler S. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8873-8882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 15Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. Wilkinson T. Koch J.O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NS4A also associates with host cell polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to indirectly bind double-stranded RNA (16Jiang L. Yao H. Duan X. Lu X. Liu Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 385: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), stabilizing double-stranded viral genomic intermediates. Although it is clear that NS4A is involved in virus replication, the mechanisms are uncertain. In this study, we identify flavivirus NS4A as the sole mediator of flavivirus-induced protection against cell death, induced by NS4A-mediated up-regulation of autophagy signaling. This up-regulation of autophagosomes can be induced by either whole virus or NS4A, depends on PI3K, and is important for flavivirus replication in renal epithelial cells. MDCK, 293T, Vero, HeLa, and Swiss Webster primary macrophage cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential media (DMEM) with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. C636 mosquito cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media (10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (S8636, Sigma), 1% nonessential amino acids (M7145, Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (25030-081, Invitrogen), 25 units/ml Fungizone (15290-018, Invitrogen), and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin) at 28 °C, 5% CO2. Primary murine macrophages were obtained by peritoneal collection from pathogen-free Swiss Webster mice. Prior to all infections, cells were seeded and allowed to attach overnight in maintenance media. Cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before infecting at an m.o.i. = 10 (unless otherwise stated). Virus stocks were diluted with ice-cold flavivirus diluting media (1× PBS containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin fraction V, pH 8.0). Following application of virus dilutions, cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C (28 °C for C636), 5% CO2. Cells were then washed once with 1× PBS, covered with maintenance media, and incubated at 37 °C (28 °C for C636), 5% CO2 until data collection. Individual Dengue-2 genes (DEN2 E, C, prM, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) were expressed in mammalian cells from a pCAGGS-HA plasmid vector (kindly provided by Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, Mount Sinai Medical School, New York), and individual Modoc genes (NS1, NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B) were expressed in mammalian cells from a TOPO plasmid vector (gift of Dr Stephane Boissinot, Queens College, New York). Cells were plated to ∼85% confluency and allowed to attach overnight in penicillin/streptomycin-free cell type-appropriate culture media supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 system (52887, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Post-transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C for at least 16 h before collection or treatment to allow plasmid expression. Dengue-2 virus was generously provided by Dr. Garcia-Sastre, and Modoc virus (strain M544) was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATTC). For expansion of Dengue-2 stocks, subconfluent C636 mosquito cells were infected with virus and incubated at 28 °C for 6 days. For expansion of Modoc virus stocks, the virus was applied to subconfluent Vero cells and incubated at 37 °C for 7 days. In both cases, the culture media of the infected plates were agitated and collected, then mixed 2:1 with flavivirus freeze media (0.75% bovine serum albumin fraction V in 0.12 m NaCl, 0.05 m H3BO3, pH 9.0), and stored at −80 °C. Viral load of Dengue and Modoc stock solutions was then determined by plaque assay as described by Davis and Hardy (17Davis J. Hardy J. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1973; 26: 344-348Crossref Google Scholar). Cells were infected and exposed to toxins at 24 hpi (hours post-infection), incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C, 5%CO2, collected by trypsin digestion, and stained with 0.4% trypan blue in 1× PBS. We have previously shown a direct correlation between trypan blue exclusion and other viability assays (18Lin L. Ye Y. Zakeri Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Live (white) and dead (blue) cells, were counted on a hemocytometer, with cell viability expressed as percent dead cells above mock. Camptothecin (CPT) (C9911, Sigma) was applied at 50–100 μm final concentration, staurosporine (STS) (S5921, Sigma) at 20 μm, and cycloheximide (CHX) (01811, Sigma) at 150 μm. Influenza A was applied to cells at m.o.i. = 5, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed once with 1× PBS, and covered with maintenance media. When appropriate, autophagy was inhibited using wortmannin, which inhibits both class I and class III PI3Ks, and 3-methyladenine (3MA), which specifically inhibits class III PI3K signaling. Autophagy was up-regulated by starvation in subculture media lacking FBS for 24 h prior to and following infection or rapamycin treatment for 1 h prior to and following infection. In all cases, cells were incubated with toxin for 24 h prior to collection. Reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Fort Washington, PA). MDCK cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106, infected with influenza virus at an of m.o.i. of 5 with or without treatment. After 24 hpi, cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature on the plate. Cells were then scraped off and centrifuged in conical tubes at 1,200 × g for 5 min. After washing in cacodylate buffer, cells were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed again. Cells were then dehydrated through ascending ethanol concentrations (50–100%) for 10 min each and embedded in Agar 100 epoxy resin. Sections were counterstained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. High resolution images were taken with a Philips 208 electron microscope. Cells were infected and treated as described above. At 48 hpi, cells were scraped and washed with ice-cold 1× PBS before whole lysate proteins were collected in RIPA buffer and quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay and an Ultrospec III spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare). Western blot analysis was performed by SDS-PAGE as described by Lin et al. (18Lin L. Ye Y. Zakeri Z. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), using primary antibodies as follows: 1:500 anti-LC3II (L7543, Sigma) and 1:1000 anti-β-tubulin (sc9104, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a loading control. Positive signals were detected using ECL (RPN2132, GE Healthcare) and visualized using hyperfilm ECL photoradiographic film (28906835, GE Healthcare). For immunocytochemical and cytochemical analysis, cells were seeded onto flame-sterilized glass coverslips, allowed to attach overnight, and infected and treated as above. At 48 hpi, cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed with fresh, ice-cold 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed once, and stored in 1× PBS in the dark at 4 °C. Cells were then stained with 1:50 mouse anti-Flavi E antibody (Di-4G2-15) and 1:2,000 phalloidin-TRITC (P1951, Sigma). 1:500 anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor 488 (A11008, Invitrogen) was used as the secondary antibody. Nuclear localization was determined by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (D8417, Sigma). Cells were embedded by Gel Mount (M-01, Biomeda). LC3-GFP-expressing cells were embedded immediately following fixation. Cells were observed by confocal microscopy (Leica, Germany). Cell culture media samples of Modoc- and Dengue-2-infected cells were collected at various times, and total viral RNA was extracted using a viral RNA extraction kit (52904; Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was then generated from extracted viral RNA using a Superscript III first strand synthesis kit (18080-400, Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of cDNA was amplified by qRT-PCR in 20-μl reactions using a LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 kit (03515869001, Roche Applied Science), with primers for Modoc (forward, GATTCAGGATGGCCCAAGAATC, and reverse, AGTAGGAAGGTGGACAGAATGA) and Dengue-2 (forward, TTAGAGGAGACCCCTCCC, and reverse, TCTCCTCTAACCTCTAGTCC), using a LightCycler 2.0 real time PCR machine (Roche Applied Science). Approximate viral titer (pfu/ml) was determined by quantifying viral RNA in serial dilutions of stock virus at a known concentration and generating a standard curve for comparison analysis. Relative RNA release in each cell type was compared with mock − infected cells and presented as (infected − mock). For confirmation of qRT-PCR data, cell culture supernatant was also taken for replication analysis by plaque assay. Confluent baby hamster kidney cells in 12-well plates were infected with serial dilutions of supernatant for 2 h at 37 °C prior to overlay with plaquing media (45%, Eagle's minimal essential media; 5%, FBS; 50%, 2% low melting point-agarose) and incubation at 37 °C for 4 days. Agar was then removed, and cells were stained with crystal violet solution. Plaques were counted and virus titer was determined. Each sample was run in triplicate, and error bars indicate 1 S.D. To examine flavivirus-induced autophagy, LC3 localization during infection was determined as described by Kabeya et al. (19Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto heat-sterilized glass coverslips in 35-mm plates, and LC3-GFP was transiently expressed by transfection with a C2-LC3-GFP construct (provided by Guido Kroemer, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France), using Lipofectamine 2000, and incubated for 16 h to allow LC3-GFP expression. Cells were then infected as described above. At 24 hpi, cells were fixed with ice-cold 3.5% paraformaldehyde (04042, Fisher) for 10 min and rinsed once with 1× PBS. Cells were then embedded by Gel Mount (M-01, Biomed) and observed by confocal microscopy. Generation of a punctate GFP expression pattern is indicative of LC3 translocation and autophagosome formation. Transfection efficiency of at least 50% was confirmed using fluorescence microscopy (data not shown). Mock-infected cells were also analyzed to ensure that LC3-GFP expression alone did not cause autophagy. Autophagy up-regulation was also examined as described above in HeLa cells stably expressing LC3-GFP. The impact of flavivirus on cell fate is specific to cell type; macrophages and neurons die following infection but hepatocytes and fibroblasts survive. Several authors have noted persistent flavivirus infection of the renal epithelium (20Tesh R.B. Siirin M. Guzman H. Travassos da Rosa A.P. Wu X. Duan T. Lei H. Nunes M.R. Xiao S.Y. J. Infect.

Immun. 1974; 10: 328-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that renal epithelial cells also survive infection. To understand the particular virus-host interactions involved in renal flavivirus infection, we chose MDCK renal epithelial cells as our main model for in vitro study. As Modoc virus has been proposed as a research model for flavivirus infection in vivo, we first characterized Modoc-induced cell death of MDCK renal epithelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Modoc virus does not kill MDCK cells (<10% death, even after 288 hpi using undiluted stock virus (m.o.i. = 1190)). We next characterized the ability of Modoc virus to kill several other types of cells (Swiss Webster primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), C57Black primary MEFs, Vero, and MDCK cells) and assayed for death at 24, 48, 96, and 144 hpi to establish that this effect was not specific to MDCK cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, no significant levels of death (<10%) are observed in any of the cell types tested as late as 144 hpi at 10 m.o.i., demonstrating that Modoc virus does not kill epithelial cells or fibroblasts in vitro. To ensure that MDCK cells support Dengue-2 and Modoc virus infection and replication, we evaluated by immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR, the capability of each virus to infect and replicate in MDCK cells. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed at 48 hpi and stained for flavivirus E protein with antibody Di-4G2-4-15 (with AlexaFluor 488) and with phalloidin-TRITC to visualize cell boundaries and were observed with a confocal microscope. At 48 hpi, mock − infected cells show no positive staining for flavivirus protein (Fig. 2A). Both Dengue-2 (Fig. 2B) and Modoc (Fig. 2C) viruses are abundant in vesicles primarily within the perinuclear region of infected cells, a staining pattern consistent with previous findings of localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies of infected cells (27Cardiff R.D. Russ S.B. Brandt W.E. Russell P.K. Infect. Immun. 1973; 7: 809-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following infection with Dengue-2 or Modoc virus, over half the cells within the infected populations are positive for flavivirus E protein (60 and 54%, respectively, data not shown), confirming that these viruses are capable of infecting and replicating in MDCK cells. To quantify flavivirus replication in MDCK cells, supernatant samples from Modoc- and Dengue-2-infected cells were collected at 48-h intervals until 144 hpi. Viral RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to qRT-PCR. For both Dengue-2 and Modoc viruses, primers for the NS4A gene were used, and qRT-PCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2D, robust replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc virus is evident by 48 hpi. A maximum virus titer of 107 pfu/ml is reached by Modoc virus at 144 hpi, whereas the maximum titer generated by Dengue-2 at 144 hpi is 108 pfu/ml. These data confirm that MDCK cells support in vitro infection and replication of both Dengue-2 and Modoc viruses and provide a basis for the use of MDCK. As killing of macrophages by flavivirus has been reported previously (23Pogodina V.V. Frolova M.P. Malenko G.V. Fokina G.I. Levina L.S. Mamonenko L.L. Koreshkova G.V. Ralf N.M. Acta Virol. 1981; 25: 337-343PubMed Google Scholar), we verified in our laboratory the ability of Modoc or Dengue-2 virus to kill or protect macrophages. We obtained primary macrophages by peritoneal perfusion of adult Swiss Webster mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, infection of macrophages with either Dengue-2 or Modoc virus results in ∼22% cell killing (p < 0.001 for both), roughly equal to that caused by exposure to 75 μm CPT. Conversely. Dengue-2 or Modoc virus do not kill primary Swiss Webster mouse embryonic fibroblasts (obtained from embryonic day 10.5 embryos). In fact, Dengue-2 infection caused a 59% decline and Modoc a 70% decline in cell death caused by CPT (Fig. 3B) (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0005, respectively), demonstrating that infection with either virus protects these cells. We also tested several other cells for killing or protection after flavivirus infection as follows: two human cell lines (293T (human kidney fibroblasts) and HeLa (human carcinoma)) and a primate cell line (Vero (green monkey kidney fibroblast)). As shown in Fig. 3C, infection with either Dengue-2 or Modoc virus does not kill 293T cells. Instead, Dengue-2 infection in 293T cells results in a 46% decline in death induced by CPT (p < 0.001), whereas Modoc infection leads to a 42% decline (p < 0.001). Likewise, neither virus kills HeLa cells. In HeLa cells (Fig. 3D), Dengue-2 infection leads to a 32% decline in CPT-induced cell death (p = 0.001), and Modoc infection causes a 45% decline (p = 0.001). Infection in Vero cells (Fig. 3E) by Dengue-2 leads to a 92% decline in cell death caused by CPT (p = 0.04), whereas Modoc infection in these cells causes an 85% decline in death by CPT (p = 0.03). These results demonstrate that cell fate following flavivirus infection depends on cell type and indicate that pro-survival signaling is up-regulated following infection in certain cell types. The fact that Modoc virus does not kill epithelial cells or fibroblasts from several mammalian species, even at high m.o.i. and late hpi, suggests that the virus can activate pro-survival signaling. We therefore tested whether Dengue-2 or Modoc virus could protect cells against agents that would normally activate apoptosis. Cells were infected with either Dengue-2 or Modoc virus and incubated at 37 °C until 24 hpi, at which time cells were exposed to toxin and held a further 24 h prior to collection at 48 hpi and trypan blue exclusion assay. We analyzed whether Dengue-2 or Modoc could protect MDCK cells against CPT (70 μm), STS (20 μm), CHX (150 μm), and influenza A WSN/33 virus infection (m.o.i. = 5). As shown in Fig. 3F, both Dengue-2 and Modoc viruses protect MDCK cells against death by all insults examined. Preinfection with Dengue-2 virus leads to a 39% decline in death induced by CPT (p < 0.001), a 40% decline in that induced by STS (p < 0.002), a 46% decline in death caused by CHX (p < 0.0001), and a 31% decline in that caused by influenza A (p = 0.002) at 48 hpi when deaths are compared with mock − infected cells. Preinfection with Modoc virus results in an 83% decline in CPT-induced cell death (p < 0.002), a 72% decline in STS-induced death (p < 0.001), a 51% decline in CHX-induced cell death (p = 0.004), and a 36% decline in influenza A-induced cell death (p = 0.002) at 48 hpi. Thus, infection with either Dengue-2 or Modoc virus is sufficient to protect MDCK cells against death induced by a variety of insults. The generalized ability of infection to protect against such a wide range of insults suggests activation of a powerful and broad cell process. Up-regulation of autophagy often leads to PI3K-dependent pro-survival signaling (28Tanida I. Waguri S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 648: 193-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Murray K.

We confirmed that both Modoc and Dengue-2 viruses induce autophagy during infection. To this end, we examined LC3-GFP translocation following infection with Dengue-2 and Modoc virus in both HeLa and MDCK cells. LC3 remains in a cytosolic inactive distribution until activated during autophagy up-regulation. This cytosolic distribution results in a diffuse LC3-GFP expression pattern. Upon activation, LC3 is cleaved into LC3-I and LC3-II. LC3-II then translocates to and accumulates at autophagosomal membranes, resulting in a punctate GFP distribution. We first infected HeLa cells stably expressing LC3-GFP with either virus and fixed them at 24 hpi for observation by confocal microscopy. Mock-infected HeLa cells show little LC3-GFP punctation, indicating low levels of autophagy typical of healthy cells (Fig. 4A). Infection with either Dengue-2 (Fig. 4B) or Modoc (Fig. 4C) virus induces a substantial increase in the number of cells containing punctate LC3-GFP, indicating an up-regulation of autophagy following infection with either virus. To confirm these results in our MDCK system, we next transfected MDCK cells with a C2-LC3-GFP plasmid and infected with either virus. At 48 hpi, cells were fixed and mounted for observation by confocal microscopy. At 48 hpi mock − infected cells display only limited LC3-GFP punctation, indicating little activation of autophagy (Fig. 4D), whereas both Modoc (Fig. 4E) and Dengue-2 (Fig. 4F) infection produce pronounced LC3-GFP punctation, indicating up-regulation of autophagosome formation. Although only 17% of mock − infected cells display punctate LC3-GFP (indicating normal housekeeping activity), nearly 70% of both Modoc and Dengue-2 virus-infected cells display LC3-GFP punctation (Fig. 4J), demonstrating that both viruses induce autophagy. Autophagosome formation is completely abolished following treatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin in both Modoc- (Fig. 4H) and Dengue-2 (Fig. 4I)-infected cells, but i"

https://openalex.org/W2027324767,"The speed of circadian clocks in animals is tightly linked to complex phosphorylation programs that drive daily cycles in the levels of PERIOD (PER) proteins. Using Drosophila, we identify a time-delay circuit based on hierarchical phosphorylation that controls the daily downswing in PER abundance. Phosphorylation by the NEMO/NLK kinase at the ""per-short"" domain on PER stimulates phosphorylation by DOUBLETIME (DBT/CK1δ/ɛ) at several nearby sites. This multisite phosphorylation operates in a spatially oriented and graded manner to delay progressive phosphorylation by DBT at other more distal sites on PER, including those required for recognition by the F box protein SLIMB/β-TrCP and proteasomal degradation. Highly phosphorylated PER has a more open structure, suggesting that progressive increases in global phosphorylation contribute to the timing mechanism by slowly increasing PER susceptibility to degradation. Our findings identify NEMO as a clock kinase and demonstrate that long-range interactions between functionally distinct phospho-clusters collaborate to set clock speed."

https://openalex.org/W2095270540,"Many individuals experience traumatic events, but some people seem relatively unaffected whereas others develop post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, work in mice has identified a possible cause for this variation between individuals. During stress, the serine protease neuropsin elicits plasticity in the amygdala by regulating EphB2/NMDA receptor interactions, inducing expression of the fear-related gene Fkbp5v. Mice lacking neuropsin do not exhibit the same dynamic plasticity in response to stress. These results underscore the importance of molecular pathways in the manifestation of complex behaviours such as anxiety, and point to Eph and NMDA receptors as possible therapeutic targets. A minority of individuals experiencing traumatic events develop anxiety disorders. The reason for the lack of correspondence between the prevalence of exposure to psychological trauma and the development of anxiety is unknown. Extracellular proteolysis contributes to fear-associated responses by facilitating neuronal plasticity at the neuron–matrix interface1,2,3,4. Here we show in mice that the serine protease neuropsin is critical for stress-related plasticity in the amygdala by regulating the dynamics of the EphB2–NMDA-receptor interaction, the expression of Fkbp5 and anxiety-like behaviour. Stress results in neuropsin-dependent cleavage of EphB2 in the amygdala causing dissociation of EphB2 from the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and promoting membrane turnover of EphB2 receptors. Dynamic EphB2–NR1 interaction enhances NMDA receptor current, induces Fkbp5 gene expression and enhances behavioural signatures of anxiety. On stress, neuropsin-deficient mice do not show EphB2 cleavage and its dissociation from NR1 resulting in a static EphB2–NR1 interaction, attenuated induction of the Fkbp5 gene and low anxiety. The behavioural response to stress can be restored by intra-amygdala injection of neuropsin into neuropsin-deficient mice and disrupted by the injection of either anti-EphB2 antibodies or silencing the Fkbp5 gene in the amygdala of wild-type mice. Our findings establish a novel neuronal pathway linking stress-induced proteolysis of EphB2 in the amygdala to anxiety."

These polymers can serve as potential nutrient sources, but their high sulfate content usually prevents their degradation. Commensal bacteria such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron possess more predicted sulfatase genes than in the human genome, the physiological functions of which are largely unknown.

In the present study, we have tested the role of this pathway in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron which, in addition to 28 predicted sulfatases, possesses a single predicted anSME. In vitro studies revealed that deletion of the gene encoding its anSME (BT0238) results in loss of sulfatase activity and impaired ability to use sulfated polysaccharides as carbon sources. Co-colonization of formerly germ-free mice with both isogenic strains (i.e. wild-type or ΔanSME), or invasion experiments involving introduction of one followed by the other strain established that anSME activity and the sulfatases activated via this pathway, are important fitness factors for B. thetaiotaomicron, especially when mice are fed a simple sugar diet that requires this saccharolytic bacterium to adaptively forage on host glycans as nutrients. Whole genome transcriptional profiling of wild-type and the anSME mutant in vivo revealed that loss of this enzyme alters expression of genes involved in mucin utilization and that this disrupted ability to access mucosal glycans likely underlies the observed pronounced colonization defect.

If the dynamic operations and the potential to deliberately manipulate the functional properties of this very complex microbial ecosystem are to be fully deciphered, the mechanisms by which bacteria colonize and persist in our digestive systems need to be defined at a molecular level.

Its genome is enriched for carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) involved in metabolic processing of complex carbohydrates, including those present in various glycoproteins that comprise the mucus layer overlying the gut epithelium. The ability to forage for both dietary and host-derived glycans appears to be among the mechanisms by which B. thetaiotaomicron is able to survive in this fiercely competitive ecosystem (8Martens E.C.

Some mucosal glycans are highly sulfated (e.g. colonic mucins and glycosaminoglycans), an observation that suggests that the capacity to produce sulfatases is instrumental in allowing some bacterial species to process host-derived carbohydrates. Furthermore, comparative genomic analyses have shown that sulfatases are prevalent in other commensal Bacteroidetes (10Xu J. Mahowald M.A. Ley R.E. Lozupone C.A. Hamady M. Martens E.C. Henrissat B.

Interestingly, metagenomic sequencing projects have revealed that anSMEs are enriched in the gut microbiomes of humans compared with non-gut microbial communities (18Kurokawa K. Itoh T. Kuwahara T.

We directly test this notion in the present study using B. thetaiotaomicron. Our approach involved a combination of competitive colonization and invasion assays of wild-type and anSME-deficient strains in gnotobiotic mice fed polysaccharide-rich and -deficient diets, whole genome transcriptional profiling of the strains in their distal gut habitat, and in vitro tests of their sulfatase activities and growth under defined nutrient conditions. anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzyme brain-heart infusion minimal medium quantitative PCR polysaccharide utilization loci. Bacterial strains and plasmids are summarized in supplemental Table S1. The B. thetaiotaomicron type strain VPI-5482 was grown on brain-heart infusion (BHI; Beckton Dickinson) agar supplemented with 10% horse blood (Colorado Serum Co.) for genetic experiments. The following antibiotics were added as required: erythromycin (25 μg ml−1), gentamicin (200 μg ml−1), and 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (200 μg ml−1). Minimal medium (MM) consisted of 100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 15 mm NaCl, 8.5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 4 mm l-cysteine, and 10 mg hemin (prepared as a 1000× stock solution in 0.5 m NaOH), 100 μm MgCl2, 1.4 μm FeCl3, and 50 μm CaCl2, 1 μg ml−1 vitamin K3 and 5 ng ml−1 vitamin B12. Heparin, chondroitin sulfate from shark cartilage, and mucin from porcine stomach (type III) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All carbon sources were added to the MM at a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v). Media were filter-sterilized using a Millipore Express filter unit (0.22-μm pore diameter). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber (Bactron IV) under an atmosphere of nitrogen (90%), carbon dioxide (5%), and hydrogen (5%). A B. thetaiotaomicron mutant lacking the single putative anSME gene (BT0238) was constructed using a previously described allelic-exchange method (8Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Cell Host. Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). An inactivation cassette was constructed with the primers listed in supplemental Table S2. Cecal contents were collected after being sacrificed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Transcriptional profiling was performed using custom Affymetrix GeneChip containing probe sets representing >98% of 4,779 predicted protein-coding genes in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome (9Sonnenburg J.L.

GeneChip targets were prepared from total RNA recovered from cecal contents as described previously (19Bjursell M.K. Martens E.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36269-36279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and hybridized to the microarrays according to standard Affymetrix protocol. All GeneChip assays were performed in triplicate. Data were normalized using Microarray Suite 5 software (Affymetrix) by adjusting the average B. thetaiotaomicron transcript signal on each GeneChip to an arbitrary value of 500. Subsequent comparisons of GeneChip datasets were performed using GeneSpringGX software (version 7.3.1, Agilent) and the following workflow: 1) raw intensity values <1.0 were adjusted to 1 prior to calculating fold-differences; 2) genes with average fold differences in expression of ≥2 between isogenic wild-type and ΔanSME strains were identified; and 3) the list of genes exhibiting ≥2-fold changes was restricted to include only those for which the fold difference had a p value < 0.01 (Student's t test), a “present” call in all three GeneChips with elevated expression, and an intensity value in the higher expression state of >100. All of the GeneChip data used in this study are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/) under accession no. GSE25415. All protocols using mice were approved by our Institution's Animal Studies Committee. C57Bl/6J mice were reared in Trexler-type isolators (La Calhène, Vèlizy-Villacoublay, France). Animals were fed ad libitum with a commercial diet sterilized by gamma irradiation (4 kGy) and supplied with sterilized (20 min, 120 °C) tap water. Room temperature was 21 °C, and a photoperiod of 12 h was used. The germ-free status of the animals was verified routinely. Eight-week-old male animals were gavaged once with a suspension of 100 μl of either the wild-type strain, an isogenic mutant strain, or a mixture containing equal proportions of wild-type and mutant cells (bacteria harvested from mid-log phase cells grown in TYG medium; ∼10e8 cfu of each strain gavaged/animal; n = 3 mice/strain/experiment). One group of mice was maintained for 12 days on the chow diet prior to and after gavage. Another group was switched to a diet that contained simple sugars rather than complex carbohydrates 12 days prior to gavage. This diet, obtained from Bio-Serv and sterilized by irradiation before administration, contained 35% (w/w) sucrose, 35% glucose, and 20% protein (see Ref. 9Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar and supplemental Table S3 for other components). Fecal samples were collected from each animal in the days following gavage and immediately frozen after collection at −80 °C until further use. Total DNA was isolated from fecal pellets using bead-beating extraction and was further purified with a GNOME DNA isolation Kit (MP Biomedicals) (20Sokol H. Pigneur B. Watterlot L. Lakhdari O. Bermúdez-Humarán L.G. Gratadoux J.J. Blugeon S. Bridonneau C. Furet J.P. Corthier G. Grangette C. Vasquez N. Pochart P. Trugnan G. Thomas G. Blottière H.M. Doré J. Marteau P. Seksik P. Langella P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16731-16736Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). The representation of each strain in the fecal microbiota was defined by qPCR in 25-μl reactions that contained 200 nm of each primer (see supplemental Table S2), plus 12.5 μl of Master Mix SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and 10 μl of diluted DNA. PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7000 instrument and the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min followed by a dissociation step of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. Purified genomic DNA standards (100–0.01 ng), prepared from each strain, were included in each qPCR run so that a standard curve could be constructed and used to calculate the relative representation of each strain in each fecal sample. Results were expressed in cfu using a calibration curve between cfu and DNA amounts. All qPCR assays were performed in triplicate for each sample at two DNA dilutions. Protein extracts were prepared from B. thetaiotaomicron by centrifuging (10,000 × g for 10 min) 20-ml aliquots of a bacterial culture grown under anaerobic conditions to mid-log phase in the different media investigated. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (pH 7.25), and the mixture was centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min). 500 μl of a buffered solution consisting of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) were added to the bacterial pellets, and the cells were disrupted at 4 °C with an ultrasonic device (VibraCell 72434, Bioblock Scientific). After sonication (30 s), the protein concentration was assayed with the Bradford reagent (Sigma). Sulfatase activity was measured at 25 °C in a 600-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm of the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl sulfate in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.25), and 125 μg of extracted B. thetaiotaomicron proteins. One unit of activity was defined as the release 1 μmol of product per minute per milligram of protein extract (monitored at 405 nm with a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer). All assays were performed in triplicate. Based on the presence of a sulfatase-associated PFAM domain PF00884 and the canonical N-terminal sulfatase signature C/SxP/AxR (21Berteau O. Guillot A. Benjdia A. Rabot S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22464-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we identified 28 putative sulfatase genes in the genome of the human gut-derived B. thetaiotaomicron type strain VPI-5481 (BLASTP E-value <10−30). This number of genes is almost twice the number present in our human genome. Notably, 20 of the predicted sulfatases (71%) have secretion signals, and 21 (75%) are encoded by genes present in 10 different polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 has 88 PULs representing 866 genes (18.1% of its genome) that encode proteins critical for the sensing, binding, import, and degradation of various classes of polysaccharides (see Ref. 6Martens E.C.

In contrast to the numerous sulfatases found in this bacterium, only one gene (BT0238) encoding an anSME was detected based on a search of all known sulfatase-maturating enzymes (anSME or formylglycine-generating enzyme) present in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome (BLASTP E-value <10−10). We recently demonstrated that BT0238 encodes indeed an authentic anSME (14Benjdia A. Leprince J. Guillot A. Vaudry H. Rabot S. Berteau O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 3462-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Benjdia A. Subramanian S. Leprince J. Vaudry H. Johnson M.K. Berteau O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 17815-17826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In other organisms, such as Escherichia coli K12 and Vibrio species, an anSME is commonly present in an operon that also contains a co-expressed sulfatase. The finding that B. thetaiotaomicron contains only one identifiable anSME gene raised the possibility that its activity is broad and sufficient to catalyze the maturation of all of the sulfatases of the organism. We have collected over 200 GeneChip data sets that profile the transcriptome of B. thetaiotaomicron under a variety of in vitro and in vivo conditions; meta-analysis of these data sets revealed that BT0238 is expressed at similar levels in vitro or in vivo independently of the growth conditions surveyed (9Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 22Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L.

Therefore, we postulated that constitutive expression of this anSME would allow it to activate various PUL-associated sulfatases as they are produced in a substrate-dependent manner. First, we constructed a ΔanSME B. thetaiotaomicron strain with previously reported procedures (Fig. 1A) (8Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Cell Host. Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). As shown, in vitro, the growth of the mutated strains was not affected compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1B). To determine whether loss of BT0238 and its corresponding anSME activity alters the ability of B. thetaiotaomicron to compete in the mammalian gut, we introduced the ΔanSME mutant with or without its isogenic wild-type parent into the intestines of 8-week-old germ-free male C57BL/6J mice. Each bacterial strain was inoculated alone with a single gavage, or as a 1:1 mixture of both strains (∼2 × 10e8 cfu total per animal) into mice adapted previously to either a plant glycan-rich diet or a simple sugar diet (8Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Cell Host. Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) where carbohydrates are represented in the form of glucose and sucrose (35% (w/w each)). Our previous work had shown that little dietary carbon reaches the distal gut in mice consuming the latter diet and that B. thetaiotaomicron is forced to rely on host mucosal glycans to sustain itself (8Martens E.C. Chiang H.C. Gordon J.I. Cell Host. Microbe. 2008; 4: 447-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 9Sonnenburg J.L. Xu J. Leip D.D. Chen C.H. Westover B.P. Weatherford J. Buhler J.D. Gordon J.I. Science. 2005; 307: 1955-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). qPCR assays of fecal DNA, targeting the BT0238 gene in the wild-type strain or upstream and downstream regions in the mutated strain (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S2), were used to define the relative fitness of these strains as a function of time after gavage and host diet. When introduced alone into adult germ-free mice, each strain rapidly achieved a stable level of colonization. Moreover, no significant differences in fecal concentrations were noted between these strains regardless of the host diet (Fig. 1, C and D). A different situation arose after mice were gavaged with a 1:1 mixture of both strains. Initially, during the first 5 days after gavage, both strains were present in feces at levels comparable with those documented in mice inoculated with just a single strain (“mono-associated”). This was true for either diet. However, after 5 days, the representation of the ΔanSME strain decreased progressively, with the difference becoming statistically significant after 8 days; by 11 days, the ΔanSME strain represented only 6.8 ± 4% of the total bacterial population in hosts consuming the plant glycan-rich diet and <1.8 ± 0.7% on the simple sugar diet (Fig. 2). When competition experiments were performed in vitro in medium that lacks sulfated glycans, a totally different situation arose; when overnight cultures were subcultured daily into fresh complex BHI medium at a 1:100 dilution, after 11 days, both strains remained at very similar levels (no statistically significant differences; see Fig. 2G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that loss of the radical AdoMet enzyme anSME (15Benjdia A. Leprince J. Sandström C. Vaudry H. Berteau O. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1985520350,"The SLC38 family of transporters has in total 11 members in humans and they encode amino acid transporters called sodium-coupled amino acid transporters (SNAT). To date, five SNATs have been characterized and functionally subdivided into systems A (SLC38A1, SLC38A2, and SLC38A4) and N (SLC38A3 and SLC38A5) showing the highest transport for glutamine and alanine. Here we present identification of a novel glutamine transporter encoded by the Slc38a7 gene, which we propose should be named SNAT7. This transporter has L-glutamine as the preferred substrate but also transports other amino acids with polar side chains, as well as L-histidine and L-alanine. The expression pattern and substrate profile for SLC38A7 shows highest similarity to the known system N transporters. Therefore, we propose that SLC38A7 is a novel member of this system. We used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with a custom-made antibody to show that SLC38A7 is expressed in all neurons, but not in astrocytes, in the mouse brain. SLC38A7 is unique in being the first system N transporter expressed in GABAergic and also other neurons. The preferred substrate and axonal localization of SLC38A7 close to the synaptic cleft indicates that SLC38A7 could have an important function for the reuptake and recycling of glutamate."

The C. albicans-specific gene EED1 plays a crucial role in this extension and maintenance of filamentous growth. eed1Δ cells failed to extend germ tubes into long filaments and switched back to yeast growth after 3 h of incubation during growth on plastic surfaces. Expression of EED1 is regulated by the transcription factor Efg1 and ectopic overexpression of EED1 restored filamentation in efg1Δ. Transcriptional profiling of eed1Δ during infection of oral tissue revealed down-regulation of hyphal associated genes including UME6, encoding another key transcriptional factor. Ectopic overexpression of EED1 or UME6 rescued filamentation and damage potential in eed1Δ. Transcriptional profiling during overexpression of UME6 identified subsets of genes regulated by Eed1 or Ume6.

https://openalex.org/W2007036236,"End-to-end chromosome fusions that occur in the context of telomerase deficiency can trigger genomic duplications. For more than 70 years, these duplications have been attributed solely to breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. To test this hypothesis, we examined end-to-end fusions isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans telomere replication mutants. Genome-level rearrangements revealed fused chromosome ends having interrupted terminal duplications accompanied by template-switching events. These features are very similar to disease-associated duplications of interstitial segments of the human genome. A model termed Fork Stalling and Template Switching has been proposed previously to explain such duplications, where promiscuous replication of large, noncontiguous segments of the genome occurs. Thus, a DNA synthesis-based process may create duplications that seal end-to-end fusions, in the absence of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles."

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are a frequent cause of sudden cardiac death in ischemic and nonischemic heart disease (9Tomaselli G.F. Zipes D.P. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 754-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Despite intense investigation, molecular mechanisms underlying the propensity of diseased myocardium to initiate and propagate lethal arrhythmias are incompletely understood. In recent years, a number of genetically engineered murine models have been developed to explore the pathophysiology of arrhythmogenesis. Although many such mice display increases in the frequency of spontaneous or inducible ventricular ectopy, in almost all cases this activity is self-limited and has not been shown to be the proximate cause of death. Several other mutant mouse models are able to support sustained ventricular arrhythmias (10Jeron A. Mitchell G.F. Zhou J. Murata M. London B. Buckett P. Wiviott S.D. Koren G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1891-H1898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these require provocative stimuli, such as exercise with administration of adrenergic agents. To date, only the heart-specific connexin43 (Cx43) (11Gutstein D.E. Morley G.E. Vaidya D. Liu F. Chen F.L. Stuhlmann H. Fishman G.I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1194-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), vinculin (12Zemljic-Harpf A.E. Miller J.C. Henderson S.A. Wright A.T. Manso A.M. Elsherif L. Dalton N.D. Thor A.K.

Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) knock-out mice have been shown to die prematurely from spontaneous sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Because of the arrhythmic propensity of the N-cad CKO mice and the ease of inducible sustained arrhythmias, it has served as a model for the study of basic mechanisms of arrhythmia. In N-cad CKO myopathic hearts, there is a significant reduction in Cx43-containing gap junctions causing decreased ventricular conduction velocity (8Li J. Patel V.V. Kostetskii I. Xiong Y. Chu A.F. Jacobson J.T. Yu C. Morley G.E. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Abnormal expression of Cx43 (gap junction remodeling) may contribute directly to the arrhythmic substrate. However, the severity of gap junction remodeling, in terms of the extent of connexin mislocalization away from the intercalated disc as well as the overall diminution of expression, can be highly variable. Thus, it remains uncertain whether only the down-regulated Cx43 expression in the N-cad CKO heart relates to the likelihood of arrhythmogenesis. We hypothesized that uncoupling promotes regional ion channel remodeling, thereby increasing electrical heterogeneity and facilitating the development of arrhythmia. Accordingly, to explore this possibility, we studied cardiac excitability and ion channel remodeling in N-cad CKO hearts in which N-cadherin expression decreases progressively throughout the ventricular myocardium post tamoxifen administration. Here we demonstrate that a loss of N-cadherin contributes to the incidence of arrhythmias not only through conduction slowing but also through significant remodeling of the major outward potassium currents. Finally, we show a novel mechanistic link among the cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, the actin-binding scaffold protein, cortactin, and Kv channel remodeling in the heart. The N-cad CKO mice have been described previously (7Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In brief, cardiac-specific Cre recombinase, α-myosin heavy chain-MerCreMer, N-cadherin flox/flox mice were mated with N-cadherin flox/flox mice. N-cadherin floxed mice with or without the Cre transgene (6–10 weeks old) were administered tamoxifen (Tam; Sigma) by intraperitoneal injection once a day for 5 days at a dosage of 80 mg/kg mice. By 5 weeks post Tam, N-cad CKO mice begin to exhibit sudden arrhythmic death (8Li J. Patel V.V. Kostetskii I. Xiong Y. Chu A.F. Jacobson J.T. Yu C. Morley G.E. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, electrophysiological and immunofluorescence experiments were performed on cardiomyocytes isolated from N-cad CKO mice 5–6 weeks post Tam. The N-cad CKO mice were analyzed in a mixed 129Sv/C57Bl/6J genetic background, and littermates were used as controls. All of the animal procedures and experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of Thomas Jefferson University. Cardiomyocytes were isolated from adult hearts as described previously (13Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The whole cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from myocytes isolated from the left ventricles of adult (3–4 month old) WT (n = 12) and N-cad CKO (n = 8) mouse hearts. Electrophysiological experiments were conducted using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), interfaced to a Dell microcomputer with a Digidata 1322A series analog/digital interface (Molecular Devices), using pClamp 8 software (Molecular Devices). Whole cell patch clamp experiments were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C). Recording pipettes contained 135 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 5 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.2; 310 mOsm). The bath solution contained 136 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter CoCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 0.04 mmol/liter tetrodotoxin, and 10 mmol/liter glucose (pH 7.4; 300 mOsm). For current clamp experiments, the tetrodotoxin and CoCl2 were omitted from the bath. Patch electrodes were fabricated and polished by heating. We used pipettes with resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Whole cell membrane capacitances and series resistances were compensated electronically prior to recording voltage clamp currents. Voltage errors resulting from the uncompensated series resistance were always ≤8mV and were not corrected. The experimental data were sampled at 5 kHz; current and voltage signals were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz prior to digitization and storage. For current clamp experiments, a series of 1-ms-long current steps from 10 to 250 pA in 20-pA increments were delivered at 1-Hz frequency to cells in each group. Depolarization-activated outward K+ (Kv) currents were recorded in response to 4.5-s voltage steps to potentials between −40 and +40 mV from a holding potential (HP) of −70 mV; voltage steps were presented in 10-mV increments at 15-s intervals. Inwardly rectifying K+ currents, IK1, were recorded in response to 350-ms voltage steps to test potentials between −40 and −120 mV (in 10-mV increments) from the same HP. For current clamp analyses, the numeric value (action potential threshold, width, etc.) was taken from the first action potential initiated on current injection. Action potential threshold were determined from phase plane plot (14Bean B.P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Resting membrane potentials, action potential amplitudes, and action potential durations at 25% (APD25), 50% (APD50), 75% (APD75), and 90% (APD90) repolarization were measured using Clampfit (Molecular Devices). Voltage clamp data were compiled and analyzed using Clampfit and Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) software. Whole cell membrane capacitances (Cm) were acquired from Clampex (Molecular Devices). Leak currents were always <10 pA and were not corrected. Peak Kv currents at each test potential were defined as the maximal outward K+ current recorded during the 4.5-s voltage steps. The decay phases of the outward K+ currents evoked during 4.5-s depolarizing voltage steps are described by the sum of two exponentials: y(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2) + B, where t is time, τ1 and τ2 are the decay time constants, A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the inactivating current components (Ito,fast or Ito,f and IK,slow), and B is the amplitude of the noninactivating current component, Iss. Fitting residuals and correlation co-efficients were determined to assess the quality of fits; only fits with correlation co-efficients >0.980 were used in this study (supplemental Fig. S1). In all cells, IK1 densities were determined from the amplitudes of the currents measured at the end of 350-ms hyperpolarizing voltage steps (−90 to −120 mV) from a HP of −70 mV. Current amplitudes in each cell were normalized to whole cell membrane capacitances (in the same cell), and current densities (pA/pF) are reported. RNA was extracted from ventricles using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), DNase-cleaned, and reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and PCR was performed with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in the MyiQ single-color real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Results for each sample were normalized to GAPDH and expressed according to the 2−ΔCt method (15Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127479) Google Scholar), as relative mRNA expression compared with GAPDH. The following primers were used for real time PCR (5′ to 3′): Kv1.5, CCTGCGAAGGTCTCTGTATGC (sense) and TGCCTCGATCTCTCTTTACAAATCT (antisense); KCNE2, CACATTAGCCAATTTGACCCAGA (sense) and GAACATGCCGATCATCACCAT (antisense); Kv4.2, GCCGCAGCACCTAGTCGTT (sense) and CACCACGTCGATGATACTCATGA (antisense); and GAPDH, CACTCTTCCACCTTCGATG (sense) andTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA (antisense). To enrich for ion channels, crude ventricular membrane fractions were prepared similar to described previously (16London B. Jeron A. Zhou J. Buckett P. Han X. Mitchell G.F. Koren G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed on fractionated ventricular membrane proteins prepared from adult WT and N-cad CKO hearts. Briefly, the hearts were homogenized in buffer consisting of (in mmol/liter) 25 Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 EDTA, pH 8, 5 EGTA, pH 8. Nuclei and debris were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. This procedure was repeated, and the supernatants from both low speed spins were pooled and centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in the above solution and centrifuged at 80,000 g for another 10 min. The final pellets were sonicated and solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, pH 8, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate for 1 h. Insoluble material was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Solubilized membranes were aliquoted and stored frozen at −80 °C until used. The protein content of each of the solubilized membrane preparations was determined using a protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The proteins were separated on a NuPAGE-Novex 4–12% bis-tris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The membranes were probed with polyclonal anti-kcne2 antibody (Sigma); Kv1.5 and Kv4.2 (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel); Kv2.1, Kv4.3, KChIP2, Kvβ1.1, and Kvβ2 (University of California, Davis NINDS/NIMH NeuroMab Facility, Davis, CA); and transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were visualized with a LI-COR infrared imager (Odyssey). Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using Odyssey version 1.2 infrared imaging software. Double immunofluorescence detection of Kv channel pore forming subunits (Kv4.2, Kv4.3, Kv1.5, Kv1.4, and Kv2.1), auxiliary subunits (kcne2, KChIP2, Kvβ1, and Kvβ2), and actin cytoskeleton or cortactin was performed as described previously (17Li J.

Briefly, freshly isolated myocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and subsequently suspended in PBS for immunostaining. The cells were collected from 3 to 6 animals for each group. The cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and 5% goat serum (Invitrogen) in PBS and then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit Kv1.5 (1:10; Alomone Labs), mouse Kv2.1 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse Kv4.2 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse Kv4.3 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse Kv1.4 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse KChIP2 (1:10; NeuroMab), rabbit kcne2 (1:200; Sigma), mouse Kvβ1 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse Kvβ2 (1:10; NeuroMab), mouse Kir2.1 (1:50; NeuroMab), mouse Kir2.2 (1:50; NeuroMab), sarcomeric α-actinin (1:200, EA-53; Sigma), mouse N-cadherin (1:200; Invitrogen), mouse α-actin (1:200, cardiac clone AC1–20.4.2; Sigma), rabbit actin (1:200, clone SIG2-AC2; Sigma), and mouse cortactin (1:200; Millipore). After washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (Molecular Probes), or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and mounted using ProLong® Gold antifade reagents (Invitrogen). Stained slides were viewed with a Zeiss LMS510 Meta confocal microscope. All of the confocal images represent a single optical slice through the middle of the cell. To quantitatively assess Kv-channel distribution in myocytes, eight Z-scan images were obtained at 0.25-μm intervals from middle of each cell. As described previously (18Choi W.S. Khurana A. Mathur R. Viswanathan V. Steele D.F. Fedida D. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), pixel intensities at the cell periphery of cardiomyocytes from eight optical slices were determined using the histogram function in National Institutes of Health ImageJ software v1.42. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding Kv1.5-eGFP fusion protein (kindly provided by Jeanne Nerbonne, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis, MO) or GFP alone. HEK-293 cells and adult mouse ventricular tissue samples were harvested, quickly frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Cortactin-enriched fractions were prepared for immunoprecipitation, according to a previously described method (19Hattan D. Nesti E. Cachero T.G. Morielli A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38596-38606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were lysed in 1 ml of Triton lysis buffer (100 mm KCl, 1 mm 1,2-Bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, pH 7.4, at 4 °C). The lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 4 min. The supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. The remaining high speed pellet was washed and resuspended in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.4 at 4 °C). Rabbit polyclonal anti-cortactin and monoclonal anti-GFP antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Arp2 (actin-related protein 2) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The human N-cadherin, human Kv1.5, Kv4.2, and rat Kv2.1 clones were kind gifts from Dr. Guiscard Seebohm (Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany). For co-expression experiments, Kv channels and N-cadherin cRNA were diluted into the same concentrations, and oocytes were injected with equal volume of cRNA between Kv channels and N-cadherin. For antisense DNA oligonucleotides, the oocytes were injected with 120 ng of HPLC-purified antisense DNA oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA Technologies) directed against Xenopus cortactin: C*A*G*T*CGTCTGTCTCA*T*C*T*G (where the asterisks indicate phosphorothioated bases) immediately after injection of 1.5 ng of Kv1.5 cRNA 48 h before recording, as previously shown (20Williams M.R.

Scrambled control oligonucleotides were injected as negative control at the same recording condition and on the same batch of oocytes. To harvest oocytes, Xenopus laevis frogs were handled according to a protocol approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Thomas Jefferson University. For expression in oocytes, cRNA was synthesized in vitro as described previously (21Shahidullah M. Harris T. Germann M.W. Covarrubias M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11243-11252Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 1–3 days after the injection of the cRNA into defolliculated oocytes, the two-electrode voltage clamp method was used to record the expressed whole oocyte currents in normal extracellular bath solution (ND96) according to established procedures (22Jerng H.H. Shahidullah M. Covarrubias M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 641-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Details of the voltage clamp protocols are described in the figure legends. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was examined with Student's t test, one-way analysis of variance or chi-squared test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Given the propensity of the cardiac-specific N-cadherin knock-out mice to develop spontaneous lethal ventricular tachycardia (7Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V.

Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that in addition to conduction slowing, the loss of N-cadherin may contribute to arrhythmogenesis by altering ion channel function, thus increasing electrical heterogeneity. To investigate this possibility, ventricular myocytes were isolated from α-myosin heavy chain/MerCreMer, N-cadflox/flox (N-cad CKO), and N-cadflox/flox without Cre (WT) adult mice 5 weeks post Tam. WT myocytes showed their characteristic rod shape and the existence of N-cadherin at ICD (Fig. 1, A and C). However, N-cadherin-deficient cardiomyocytes no longer displayed the characteristic interdigitating or step-like structures at the termini representing the ICD consistent with our previous ultrastructural analysis, demonstrating disassembly of the ICD in N-cad CKO myocardium (7Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The loss of N-cadherin resulted in spindle shaped myocytes (Fig. 1, B and D). To determine whether electrical excitability was altered in the absence of N-cadherin, action potential recordings were conducted on isolated left ventricular myocytes. Current clamp experiments revealed that action potentials recorded from N-cad CKO myocytes were substantially broader than action potentials recorded from cells isolated from WT littermates, with the latter phase of repolarization being particularly affected (Fig. 2A). Measurements of action potential durations at 25, 50, 75, and 90% repolarization (APD25, APD50, APD75, and APD90) revealed that mean action potential durations at 75 and 90% repolarization times were prolonged significantly compared with action potential durations in WT myocytes (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S1). Mean ± S.E. APD75 and APD90 for example, were 9.1 ± 0.5 and 26.5 ± 2.3 ms (n = 12) in WT cells and 17.9 ± 2.8 and 63.5 ± 10.9 ms (n = 11) in N-cad CKO cells (supplemental Table S1). In accordance with the increased arrhythmia susceptibility in N-cad CKO mice (7Kostetskii I. Li J. Xiong Y. Zhou R. Ferrari V.A. Patel V.V. Molkentin J.D. Radice G.L. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), spontaneously triggered activity, presumably resulting from early after depolarizations, was only observed in N-cad CKO ventricular cells (3 of 14 in CKO group versus 0 of 12 in WT (χ2 = 7.69, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). However, the input resistance, threshold currents to evoke action potential of ventricular myocytes from WT and N-cad CKO animals were indistinguishable.FIGURE 2Action potential waveforms in WT and N-cadherin CKO ventricular myocytes were distinguishable.

To determine whether N-cadherin deletion affects repolarizing voltage-gated K+ (Kv) currents, whole cell Kv currents were recorded from ventricular myocytes isolated from N-cad CKO and WT littermates. With voltage-gated Ca2+ and Na+ currents blocked, outward currents were routinely recorded during 4.5-s depolarizing voltage steps to potentials between −40 and +40 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV. Representative outward K+ current waveforms recorded in WT and N-cad CKO adult mouse ventricular myocytes are illustrated in Fig. 3A. In both cell types, the rates of rise and the amplitudes of the currents increase with increasing depolarization; the largest and most rapidly activating current in Fig. 3A was evoked at +40 mV. The currents recorded and analyzed here, therefore, are assumed to reflect only the activation of Ca2+-independent, depolarization-activated K+ channels.

N-Linked glycosylation of RAGE plays an important role in the regulation of ligand binding. Two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, at Asn(25) and Asn(81), are implicated, one of which is potentially influenced by a naturally occurring polymorphism that substitutes Gly(82) with Ser. This G82S polymorphic RAGE variant displays increased ligand binding and downstream signaling. We hypothesized that the G82S polymorphism affects RAGE glycosylation and thereby affects ligand binding. WT or various mutant forms of RAGE protein, including N25Q, N81Q, N25Q/G82S, and N25Q/N81Q, were produced by transfecting HEK293 cells. The glycosylation patterns of expressed proteins were compared. Enzymatic deglycosylation showed that WT RAGE and the G82S polymorphic variant are glycosylated to the same extent. Our data also revealed N-linked glycosylation of N25Q and N81Q mutants, suggesting that both Asn(25) and Asn(81) can be utilized for N-linked glycosylation. Using mass spectrometry analysis, we found that Asn(81) may or may not be glycosylated in WT RAGE, whereas in G82S RAGE, Asn(81) is always glycosylated. Furthermore, RAGE binding to S100B ligand is affected by Asn(81) glycosylation, with consequences for NF-κB activation. Therefore, the G82S polymorphism promotes N-linked glycosylation of Asn(81), which has implications for the structure of the ligand binding region of RAGE and might explain the enhanced function associated with the G82S polymorphic RAGE variant."

Misfolding of specific proteins can lead to the formation of aggregates, which is associated with most neurodegenerative disorders. Protein aggregates are extracellular in Alzheimer's disease, cytosolic in Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, both cytosolic and intranuclear in polyglutamine (polyQ) 3The abbreviations used are: polyQpolyglutamineERendoplasmic reticulumFENIBfamilial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodiesERADendoplasmic reticulum-associated degradationVCPvalosin-containing proteinCHIPC terminus of Hsc70-interacting proteinCHXcycloheximideANOVAanalysis of varianceDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide. diseases, and localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB), which is caused by neuroserpin mutations (1Rubinsztein D.C.

Although the role of the protein aggregates in the pathogenesis of these diseases is still poorly understood, a common feature of these aggregates is that they are all marked by ubiquitin.

Many accumulated proteins that are caused by mutations or ER stress are targeted by a protein quality control system, termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). ERAD is a degradation system in which proteins that are misfolded in the ER are exported to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 11Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). ER-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases, together with the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, are key components of the ERAD machinery. During the ERAD process, selected proteins are ubiquitinated by E3 ubiquitin ligases and then retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol by the VCP-Ufd1-Npl4 complex for degradation (12Ye Y.

The proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132 block neuroserpin degradation in the ER, suggesting that ERAD may be involved in neuroserpin degradation (19Kroeger H. Miranda E. MacLeod I. Pérez J.

However, the mechanism by which neuroserpin is regulated by ERAD and the E3(s) that is/are involved in its degradation are still largely unknown. In this study, we show that the cellular turnover and aggregation of mutant neuroserpin are regulated by ERAD. Our results suggest that central factors in the ERAD machinery, such as AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase, VCP/p97, and the ubiquitin ligases Hrd1 and gp78, are involved in the regulation of mutant neuroserpin aggregation and degradation. Full-length human neuroserpin cDNA was first amplified using PCR from a human fetal brain cDNA library (Clontech) using the primers 5′-GAAGATCTATATGGCTTTCCTTGGAC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTTAAAGTTCTTCGAAATC-3′. The PCR product was subsequently inserted into the pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) vector at the BglII and EcoRI sites. FLAG-neuroserpin was constructed by subcloning the amplified PCR product using the primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGCTTTCCTTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAAAGTTCTTCGAAATC-3′ from the pEGFP-C2-neuroserpin construct and inserting it into the p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV-24 (Sigma) vector at the HindIII and XbaI sites. To create the HA-, EGFP-, and Myc-tagged neuroserpin constructs, we subcloned neuroserpin from p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV-24 into the pKH3-HA vector at the HindIII and XbaI sites or into the pEGFP-N3 or pCS2-MT-Myc vector at the HindIII and BamHI sites. Pathogenic neuroserpin mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the MutanBEST kit (Takara) with the following primers: S49P neuroserpin, 5′-CCTCCATTGAGTATTGCTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGAGAATATTTTCATC-3′; S52R neuroserpin, 5′-TTGCGTATTGCTCTTGCA-3′ and 5′-TGGAGAGAAGAGAATATT-3′; and G392E neuroserpin, 5′-GAACGAGTCATGCATCCTGAA-3′ and 5′-CATGAATAGAATTGTACCAGT-3′. FLAG-tagged parkin was constructed by subcloning full-length parkin cDNA from pGEX-5x-1-parkin and inserting it into p3xFLAG-Myc-CMV-24 at the BamHI and SalI sites. Hrd1, gp78, the FLAG-ubiquitin constructs, pEGFP-Mito, and ER markers were described previously (20Ying Z. Wang H. Fan H. Zhu X. Zhou J. Fei E. Wang G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4268-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). pCMV-VCP-Myc (Myc-tagged VCP/p97) was obtained from Dr. Baoliang Song (Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China), and pcDNA3.1-His-p97 WT and pcDNA3.1-His-p97 QQ (His-tagged VCP/p97) was obtained from Dr. Yihong Ye (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health). Myc-His-CHIP (Myc-tagged CHIP), was obtained from Dr. Nihar Ranjan Jana (National Brain Research Centre, India). Human embryonic kidney 293 (293) cells or mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with either expression vectors or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at ∼50% confluence in DMEM without serum. Double-stranded oligonucleotides against gp78 named si-gp78–1 and si-gp78–2 were described previously (20Ying Z. Wang H. Fan H. Zhu X. Zhou J. Fei E. Wang G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4268-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides designed against nucleotides 175–195 of human Hrd1 cDNA or 883–903 of human VCP cDNA were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China). A non-targeting oligonucleotide was used as a negative control. To establish each stable cell line expressing EGFP-tagged WT, S49P, S52R, or G392E neuroserpin, 293 cells were transfected with the EGFP vector containing the indicated neuroserpin variant, and individual clones stably expressing each of the neuroserpin variants were selected using 200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cycloheximide (CHX), lactacystin, and pepstatin A were purchased from Sigma, and MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. Cells were first lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (Roche), and the proteins were then separated by 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibodies against GFP, HA, Tom20, His, Myc, and ubiquitin, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against GFP and HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse monoclonal GAPDH antibody was from Chemicon. Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, anti-FLAG conjugated with HRP, and anti-tubulin and rabbit polyclonal anti-calnexin antibodies were all from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-gp78 antibodies were described previously (20Ying Z. Wang H. Fan H. Zhu X. Zhou J. Fei E. Wang G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 4268-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Amersham Biosciences) were used. The proteins were visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Transfected 293 cells grown on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 0.5% FBS in PBS, and then incubated with the primary antibody followed by Rho (red)- or FITC (green)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Alexa Fluor 350 (blue)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). Crude cell lysates were sonicated in lysis buffer. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies in 0.1% BSA for 4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein G-Sepharose (Roche) was used for precipitation. The beads were washed with lysis buffer five times, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the 293 cells expressing neuroserpin were treated with 150 μg/ml CHX to inhibit protein synthesis. The cells were harvested at 0, 3, and 6 h after CHX treatment. The same lysate volumes were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. 293 cells stably expressing EGFP-tagged G392E neuroserpin were starved in methionine-free medium and incubated for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. Pulse labeling was terminated by incubating cells in fresh medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine (300 mg/liter), and the cells were harvested at 0, 3, and 6 h. Cells lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and homogenized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.32 mm sucrose, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Lysates were initially centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 10 min. Microsomal and cytosolic fractions were further separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min, and the fractions were further processed for immunoblot analysis. To investigate whether mutant neuroserpin is degraded by the proteasome, we constructed HA-tagged WT, S49P, S52R, and G392E mutant neuroserpins and transfected each into 293 cells. When neuroserpin was expressed in 293 cells, it was reticularly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Although all forms of neuroserpin were mainly diffusively distributed, aggregates were observed in cells transfected with mutant neuroserpins (Fig. 1A). Notably, G392E neuroserpin, which is associated with the most severe form of FENIB (7Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), formed the most aggregates, consistent with previous findings that this mutant easily forms accumulated “polymers” (21Miranda E. MacLeod I. Davies M.J. Pérez J. Römisch K. Crowther D.C. Lomas D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 1527-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The quantitative data are shown in Fig. 1B. We next examined the effects of the proteasome on mutant neuroserpin aggregate formation using the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The number of G392E neuroserpin aggregates in transfected cells was significantly increased after MG132 treatment (Fig. 1, A and C). To further investigate the cellular turnover of neuroserpin, we established 293 cell lines that stably expressed each of the neuroserpin variants. These cells were treated with either proteasome or lysosome inhibitor, and the neuroserpin variant protein levels were examined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, D and E, the levels of S49P, S52R, and G392E neuroserpin increased in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin but not the lysosome inhibitor pepstatin A. However, the WT neuroserpin levels were not affected by either of the inhibitors. CHX chase analysis also showed that lactacystin treatment increased the stability of G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 1, F and G). To further confirm the involvement of the proteasome in neuroserpin degradation, we performed a pulse-chase analysis using the G392E neuroserpin stable cell line. Consistent with the observations in the CHX chase analysis, lactacystin treatment stabilized G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 1H). These data suggest that inhibition of the proteasome results in an abnormal accumulation of mutant neuroserpin. To examine the subcellular localization of neuroserpin, we cotransfected 293 cells with HA-tagged wild-type or mutant neuroserpin and EGFP-ER or EGFP-Mito, the specific organelle markers that labeled ER or mitochondria. WT, S52R, and G392E neuroserpin all colocalized with the ER but not mitochondria (Fig. 2A). ERAD is a well known degradation system for ER-retained proteins (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 11Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether VCP/p97, a crucial component of ER retrotranslocation for proteasomal degradation, is involved in mutant neuroserpin degradation. We cotransfected 293 cells with EGFP-tagged G392E neuroserpin and Myc- or His-tagged VCP/p97. Using immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies, we found that VCP/p97 was coimmunoprecipitated with G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ERAD may be involved in mutant neuroserpin degradation. Moreover, VCP/p97 QQ, a VCP/p97 mutant form that has no function in ERAD because of its deficiency in ATP hydrolysis (22Wang Q. Li L. Ye Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), was recruited to mutant neuroserpin aggregates (C). CHX chase and pulse-chase analysis showed that in the G392E neuroserpin stable cell line transfected with VCP QQ, G392E neuroserpin was stabilized (Fig. 2, D–F), suggesting that the loss of VCP function significantly stabilizes mutant neuroserpin. These data further suggest the involvement of ERAD in mutant neuroserpin degradation. To further confirm whether ERAD is involved in the degradation of neuroserpin, we examined whether ERAD-associated E3s could promote mutant neuroserpin degradation. First, we examined G392E neuroserpin localization using 293 cells that were cotransfected with mutant neuroserpin and the ER-resident E3s Hrd1 and gp78. G392E neuroserpin colocalized with Hrd1 and gp78 (Fig. 3A). Cell fractionation assays also demonstrated that Hrd1, gp78, and G392E neuroserpin were isolated in the ER-containing microsomal membrane fraction (m) (supplemental Fig. S1). Next, we examined whether ER-associated E3s promote mutant neuroserpin degradation. We cotransfected 293 cells with S49P neuroserpin and several mammalian E3s, including parkin and CHIP, two cytoplasmic E3s reported to be associated with ERAD (11Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), and Hrd1 and gp78. The level of S49P neuroserpin was markedly decreased in the presence of Hrd1 or gp78, but it was not changed in the presence of parkin or CHIP (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that Hrd1 and gp78, but not CHIP or parkin, are involved in mutant neuroserpin degradation. To further characterize the effects of Hrd1 and gp78 on mutant neuroserpin degradation, we transfected G392E neuroserpin stable cell lines with different amounts of FLAG, FLAG-tagged gp78, or FLAG-tagged parkin. Increased amounts of FLAG-gp78, but not FLAG or FLAG-parkin, resulted in a greater decrease in S49P neuroserpin (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that gp78 promotes neuroserpin degradation in a dose-dependent manner. As Hrd1 and gp78 are well known E3 ubiquitin ligases, we wondered if they affect neuroserpin ubiquitination. We cotransfected N2a and 293 cells with EGFP-tagged G392E neuroserpin and FLAG, FLAG-tagged Hrd1, gp78, or parkin and performed immunoprecipitation assays using polyclonal GFP antibodies. G392E neuroserpin ubiquitination was strikingly increased in the presence of Hrd1 and gp78 but was not changed in the presence of parkin (Fig. 3, E and F) or CHIP (G). Moreover, Hrd1 and gp78, but not parkin or CHIP, were coimmunoprecipitated with G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 3, E and G). Taken together, these data suggest that the degradation of mutant neuroserpin is specifically driven by the ER-resident E3s Hrd1 and gp78 but not by the non-ER-resident E3s parkin and CHIP. Hrd1 and gp78 both contain a RING finger E3 activity domain, and there is a ubiquitin-binding Cue domain in the C terminus of gp78, but not in Hrd1 (23Chen B. Mariano J. Tsai Y.C. Chan A.H. Cohen M. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Morito D. Hirao K. Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Tokunaga F. Cyr D.M. Tanaka K. Iwai K. Nagata K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1328-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To explore whether E3 activity is responsible for neuroserpin degradation, we generated the following FLAG-tagged gp78 mutants: a deletion mutant (ΔC) that lacked the C terminus, which includes the RING finger and Cue domains; a RING finger deletion mutant (ΔRING); a Cue domain deletion mutant (ΔCue); a RING domain point mutant (Rm); and a Cue domain point mutant (Cm). We cotransfected 293 cells with EGFP-tagged G392E neuroserpin along with each of the above mutants. Gp78 Rm and gp78 ΔC failed to promote the ubiquitination of G392E neuroserpin, whereas wild-type gp78 and gp78 Cm strikingly increased the ubiquitination of G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 4A). Consistent with these observations, gp78 ΔC, ΔRING, and Rm, but not wild-type gp78, ΔCue, or Cm, failed to decrease the levels of G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 4B), further suggesting that the RING finger, which has E3 ligase activity but not the Cue domain of gp78 is necessary for neuroserpin ubiquitination and degradation. We next examined whether inhibition of the proteasome affects neuroserpin degradation and aggregation. In MG132-treated cells, Hrd1- or gp78-driven mutant neuroserpin degradation was completely blocked (Fig. 5A). Using immunocytochemical staining, we found that G392E neuroserpin colocalized with Hrd1 and gp78 in the ER (Fig. 5B) and that MG132 treatment (C) or overexpression of gp78 Rm (D) significantly increased G392E neuroserpin aggregate formation in the ER, suggesting that impairments of proteasome function and ERAD increase mutant neuroserpin aggregation.FIGURE 5Hrd1 and gp78 regulate the degradation and aggregation of mutant neuroserpin in a proteasome-dependent manner. A, EGFP-tagged S49P neuroserpin was cotransfected with FLAG or FLAG-tagged Hrd1 or gp78 into 293 cells. Cells were cultured in medium containing DMSO or MG132 (10 μm) for 16 h, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted for GFP or tubulin. B, 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged G392E neuroserpin and FLAG-tagged Hrd1 or gp78 as well as EGFP-tagged ER marker. Cells were subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with polyclonal HA antibodies (red) and monoclonal FLAG antibody (blue). Scale bar = 10 μm. C, 293 cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged G392E neuroserpin and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Ub) along with EGFP-tagged gp78. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 6 h.

These siRNAs were also transfected into the G392E neuroserpin stable cell line. In gp78-knockdown cells, the G392E neuroserpin level was increased (Fig. 6A). Moreover, G392E neuroserpin ubiquitination was decreased in gp78-knockdown cells (Fig. 6B). In the G392E neuroserpin stable cell line, knockdown of gp78, Hrd1, gp78 plus Hrd1, or VCP increased the mutant neuroserpin level. As a comparison, the level of WT neuroserpin was not increased to the same extent (Fig. 6, C and D). The knockdown effects of Hrd1 and VCP are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. CHX chase as well as pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that knockdown of the above genes stabilized G392E neuroserpin (Fig. 6, E, F, and G). Furthermore, gp78 overexpression decreased the number of G392E neuroserpin aggregates, whereas gp78 knockdown increased its aggregates (Fig. 6H).FIGURE 6Effects of endogenous Hrd1 and gp78 on mutant neuroserpin degradation.

Interestingly, ERAD E3s, such as Hrd1 and gp78, suppress the neurodegeneration mediated by aggregate-prone proteins, including Alzheimer's disease-linked amyloid precursor proteins (27Kaneko M.

In this study, we found that Hrd1 and gp78 are involved in mutant neuroserpin ubiquitination and degradation and that the ERAD pathway contributes to the neuroserpin degradation and aggregation machinery, as indicated by the observations that impairment of ERAD by defective VCP and gp78 significantly increases mutant neuroserpin stability and aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that mutant neuroserpin is targeted by ERAD with the aid of VCP/p97 is polyubiquitinated by the two ER-resident E3s Hrd1 and gp78 and is subsequently degraded by the proteasome. This mechanism is essentially the same as that involved in the quality control of other misfolded and aberrantly synthesized proteins in the ER (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 11Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Because VCP/p97 is an essential regulator in ERAD that facilitates the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated ER proteins to the cytosol for degradation (12Ye Y. Shibata Y. Kikkert M. van Voorden S. Wiertz E. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14132-14138Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), forms a complex with the relevant E3s and functions in classical ERAD (17Zhong X. Shen Y. Ballar P. Apostolou A. Agami R.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14296-14301Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), the activity of VCP/p97 involved in the degradation of mutant neuroserpin strongly suggests that VCP/p97 cooperates with Hrd1 and gp78 for neuroserpin degradation. The N-terminal fragments of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (Nhtt) and ataxin-3 inhibit the function of ERAD and retrotranslocation (33Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Zhong X. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In our observations, we also found that the polyQ-expanded Nhtt or ataxin-3 significantly stimulates mutant neuroserpin aggregation and perturbs its proteasomal degradation (data not shown). As the polyQ-expanded Nhtt and ataxin-3 affect ERAD by influencing the VCP complex (33Duennwald M.L. Lindquist S. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3308-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 34Zhong X. Pittman R.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and VCP deficiency significantly decreases mutant neuroserpin degradation rates (Fig. 2D), these data further suggest that the ERAD machinery is involved in mutant neuroserpin degradation. Interestingly, consistent with previous studies (3Miranda E. Römisch K. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28283-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we observed that MG132 treatment does not significantly up-regulate the WT neuroserpin protein level as much as it does for mutant neuroserpins, suggesting a higher proteasomal turnover for the mutant. These data provide further evidence that mutant neuroserpin is misfolded and targeted by the proteasome. Hrd1 and gp78 are localized in the ER membrane, whereas parkin and CHIP are localized in the cytoplasm (10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 11Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 35Ron I. Rapaport D. Horowitz M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 19: 3771-3781Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, ER-resident Hrd1 and gp78, but not non-ER-resident parkin and CHIP, may directly interact with ER-resident neuroserpin to promote neuroserpin ubiquitination, as indicated by strong Hrd1/gp78 binding to neuroserpin but no interaction between parkin/CHIP and neuroserpin (Figs. 3E and G). In our observations, parkin and CHIP have no effect on neuroserpin degradation, further suggesting that gp78 and Hrd1 are neuroserpin-specific E3s. Hrd1 and gp78 serve divergent ERAD substrate populations (20Ying Z. Wang H. Fan H. Zhu X. Zhou J. Fei E. Wang G. Hum. Mol.

However, studies have also shown that Hrd1 and gp78 share many common substrates, such as the “classic” ERAD substrate T cell antigen receptor CD3δ subunit, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), polyQ-expanded huntingtin and α-1-antitrypsin (AAT)-deficiency disease protein Z variant of α-1-antitrypsin (14Kikkert M.

Overlapping gp78 and Hrd1 substrates in ERAD could be explained by the high identity of the N-terminal and RING finger E3 activity domains of Hrd1 and gp78, which are the most closely related ERAD E3s (14Kikkert M. Doolman R. Dai M. Avner R. Hassink G. van Voorden S. Thanedar S. Roitelman J. Chau V. Wiertz E. J. Biol.

In our study, we show that the RING finger, but not the Cue domain is necessary for mutant neuroserpin ubiquitination (Fig. 4A) and degradation (B), suggesting that the E3 RING finger activity in Hrd1 and gp78 is specifically involved in regulating mutant neuroserpin degradation. In summary, the two ER-associated E3s Hrd1 and gp78 regulate mutant neuroserpin ubiquitination and degradation. The degradation of mutant neuroserpin is controlled by the ERAD machinery in association with VCP. Thus, ERAD may play a role in the regulation of mutant neuroserpin.

Three dosing strategies were used in HIV infected adults (18 to 60 years): two standard doses over 28 days, two double doses over 28 days and a single standard dose of influenza vaccine, administered prior to the 2008 influenza season. A trivalent killed split non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Fluviral™) was used. Serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) activity for the three influenza strains in the vaccine was measured to assess immunogenicity.297 of 298 participants received at least one injection. Baseline CD4 (median 470 cells/µL) and HIV RNA (76% of patients with viral load <50 copies/mL) were similar between groups. 89% were on HAART. The overall immunogenicity of influenza vaccine across time points and the three influenza strains assessed was poor (Range HAI ≥ 40 = 31-58%). Double dose plus double dose booster slightly increased the proportion achieving HAI titre doubling from baseline for A/Brisbane and B/Florida at weeks 4, 8 and 20 compared to standard vaccine dose. Increased immunogenicity with increased antigen dose and booster dosing was most apparent in participants with unsuppressed HIV RNA at baseline. None of 8 serious adverse events were thought to be immunization-related.Even with increased antigen dose and booster dosing, non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine immunogenicity is poor in HIV infected individuals. Alternative influenza vaccines are required in this hyporesponsive population.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00764998."

This is reminiscence of their activity as proto-oncogenes that drives scheduled cell cycle progression under physiological conditions. Working on the cell cycle regulatory activity of proto-oncogene, we observed that c-ETS1 transcriptionally up-regulated both cyclin E and CDK2 genes, the master regulators of G1/S-phase transition. The process was mediated by kinetic coherence of c-ETS1 expression and its recruitment to both promoters during G1/S-phase transition. Furthermore, enforced expression of c-ETS1 helped G0-arrested cells to progress into G1/S-phases apparently due to the activation of cyclin E/CDK2 genes. Physiological induction of c-ETS1 by EGF showed the remodeling of mononucleosomes bound to the c-ETS1 binding site on both promoters during their activation. The exchange of HDAC1 with histone acetyltransferase-p300 was contemporaneous to the chromatin remodeling with consequent increase in histone H3K9 acetylation. Furthermore, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler hBRM1 recruitment was also associated with nucleosome remodeling and promoter occupancy of phospho-Ser5 RNA polymerase II. Intriguingly, the activity of the HBx viral oncoprotein was dependent on c-ETS1 in a hepatotropic manner, which led to the activation of cyclin E/CDK2 genes.

https://openalex.org/W2038250831,"Primary microcephaly is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by marked reduction in human brain size. Microcephalin (MCPH1), one of the genes mutated in primary microcephaly, plays an important role in DNA damage checkpoint control and mitotic entry. Additionally, MCPH1 ensures the proper temporal activation of chromosome condensation during mitosis, by acting as a negative regulator of the condensin II complex. We previously found that deletion of the of the MCPH1 N terminus leads to the premature chromosome condensation (PCC) phenotype. In the present study, we unexpectedly observed that a truncated form of MCPH1 appears to be expressed in MCPH1(S25X/S25X) patient cells. This likely results from utilization of an alternative translational start codon, which would produce a mutant MCPH1 protein with a small deletion of its N-terminal BRCT domain. Furthermore, missense mutations in the MCPH1 cluster at its N terminus, suggesting that intact function of this BRCT protein-interaction domain is required both for coordinating chromosome condensation and human brain development. Subsequently, we identified the SET nuclear oncogene as a direct binding partner of the MCPH1 N-terminal BRCT domain. Cells with SET knockdown exhibited abnormal condensed chromosomes similar to those observed in MCPH1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Condensin II knockdown rescued the abnormal chromosome condensation phenotype in SET-depleted cells. In addition, MCPH1 V50G/I51V missense mutations, impair binding to SET and fail to fully rescue the abnormal chromosome condensation phenotype in Mcph1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Collectively, our findings suggest that SET is an important regulator of chromosome condensation/decondensation and that disruption of the MCPH1-SET interaction might be important for the pathogenesis of primary microcephaly."
https://openalex.org/W1981411343,"Gephyrin is a scaffold protein essential for stabilizing glycine and GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synapses. Here, recombinant intrabodies against gephyrin (scFv-gephyrin) were used to assess whether this protein exerts a transynaptic action on GABA and glutamate release. Pair recordings from interconnected hippocampal cells in culture revealed a reduced probability of GABA release in scFv-gephyrin-transfected neurons compared with controls. This effect was associated with a significant decrease in VGAT, the vesicular GABA transporter, and in neuroligin 2 (NLG2), a protein that, interacting with neurexins, ensures the cross-talk between the post- and presynaptic sites. Interestingly, hampering gephyrin function also produced a significant reduction in VGLUT, the vesicular glutamate transporter, an effect accompanied by a significant decrease in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Overexpressing NLG2 in gephyrin-deprived neurons rescued GABAergic but not glutamatergic innervation, suggesting that the observed changes in the latter were not due to a homeostatic compensatory mechanism. Pulldown experiments demonstrated that gephyrin interacts not only with NLG2 but also with NLG1, the isoform enriched at excitatory synapses. These results suggest a key role of gephyrin in regulating transynaptic signaling at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses."

Recent evidence suggests that phosphorylation-induced inhibition of TTP can be reversed by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through the inactivation of p38 MAPK and MK2 (21Sun L. Stoecklin G. Van Way S.

Despite these studies on TTP phosphorylation, the signaling pathways responsible for the induction of TTP activity are not well known. Casein kinase 2 (CK2), a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase, is a tetramer composed of two catalytic subunits (α and α′) and two regulatory subunits (β) in an α2β2, αα′β2, or α′2β2 configuration (22Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5003-5010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylates a large number of substrates, many of which are involved in gene expression and cell growth (23Ahmed K. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot.

In contrast to the functions of CK2 that favor the neoplastic growth of cells, several investigations have demonstrated an opposing function of this enzyme. Exogenous expression of CK2α deactivates MEK, suppresses cell growth, and inhibits the foci formation induced by activated Ras (33Hériché J.K. Lebrin F. Rabilloud T. Leroy D. Chambaz E.M. Goldberg Y. Science. 1997; 276: 952-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, CK2 phosphorylates p53 (34Meek D.W. Simon S. Kikkawa U. Eckhart W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which enhances the sequence-specific DNA binding function of p53 in vitro (35Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) and ensures the maintenance of G2 arrest and apoptosis following spindle damage (36Sayed M. Pelech S. Wong C. Marotta A. Salh B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6994-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We previously reported that TTP down-regulates the expression of VEGF and inhibits the growth of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (37Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H. Jung S.W. Min Y.J. Park S.E. Lee B.J. Cha H.J. Park J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 126: 1817-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that CK2 increases the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP in human colon cancer cells by protecting the TTP protein from phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation. CK2 decreased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and the effects of CK2 were attenuated either by treatment with an inhibitor of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) or an siRNA against MKP-1, suggesting that CK2 function is mediated by MKP-1, which is known to dephosphorylate p38 MAPK (38Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, we show that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) increases CK2 activity, resulting in an increase in the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP. Finally, TGF-β suppressed the growth of colon cancer cells, and this event was mediated by CK2 and TTP, indicating that TGF-β acts as a tumor suppressor via the activation of CK2 and TTP in Colo320 cells. Collectively, our results show that CK2 increases the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP through activation of MKP-1 and that TGF-β plays a role in the activation of the CK2-MKP-1-TTP signaling pathway. Human colon cancer cells (Colo320) were purchased from Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea). Colo320 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media, supplemented with 10% FBS (heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) (Invitrogen), and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For the MTS cell proliferation assay, cells were plated in RPMI 1640 medium in triplicate at 1.2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates. At the indicated times, CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's protocols, and absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was determined for each well using a Wallac Vector 1420 multilabel counter (EG&G Wallac, Turku, Finland). Five micrograms of DNase I-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Taq polymerase (Sun Genetics, Daejeon, Korea) and the appropriate primers as follows: TTP, 5′-CGCTACAAGACTGAGCTAT-3′ and 5′-GAGGTAGAACTTGTGACAGA-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTC-3′. For RNA kinetic analysis, we used actinomycin D and assessed VEGF mRNA expression using quantitative real time PCR, performed using the ABI Prism 7900 HT to monitor real time increases in the fluorescence of SYBR Green dye (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Specificities of each primer pair were confirmed via melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR primer pairs were as follows: qVEGF, 5′-ATCTTCAAGCCATCCTGTGTGC-3′ and 5′-TGCGCTTGTCACATTTTTTCTTG-3′; qTTP, 5′-CCCCAAATACAAGACGGAACTC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCGCCAGGTCTTC-3′; and qGAPDH, 5′-ACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTC-3′. The pcDNA6/V5-TTP plasmid construct has been described previously (37Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H. Jung S.W. Min Y.J. Park S.E. Lee B.J. Cha H.J. Park J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 126: 1817-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs containing full-length cDNA of human CK2α or human ubiquitin were purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, UK). Full-length cDNA of human CK2α and human ubiquitin were amplified from these plasmids, and full-length cDNA of human MKP-1 was amplified from the cDNA of Colo320 cells using PCR. PCR products were ligated into BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3-HA or pcDNA3.1-FLAG vectors (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3/HA-CK2α, pcDNA3/FLAG-Ub, and pcDNA3/FLAG-MKP-1. Site-directed mutants of TTP with single (S21A, S169A, S279A, or S325A), double (S60A/S186A), or quadruple amino acid substitutions (S21A/S169A/S279A/S325A) and MKP-1 with double amino acid substitutions (S131A/S235A) were generated using pcDNA6/V5-TTP and pcDNA3/FLAG-MKP-1 as a template, respectively, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenic primers used for generation of site-directed mutants of TTP or MKP-1 were as follows: TTP-S21A, 5′-AGTGCCCGTGCCAGCCGACCATGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCCATGGTCGGCTGGCACGGGCACTG-3′; TTP-S60A, 5′-CTGGCCGCTCCACCGCCCTAGTGGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCTCCACTAGGGCGGTGGAGCGGCCAG-3′; TTP-S169A, 5′-CATCCACAACCCTGCCGAAGACCTGGCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGCCAGGTCTTCGGCAGGGTTGTGGATG-3′; TTP-S186A, 5′-CTTCGCCAGAGCATCGCCTTCTCCGGCCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGCCGGAGAAGGCGATGCTCTGGCGAAG-3′; TTP-S279A, 5′-GTACAGTCCCTGGGAGCCGACCCTGATGAATATG-3′ and 5′-CATATTCATCAGGGTCGGCTCCCAGGGACTGTAC-3′;TTP-S325A, 5′-CGCATCTCTGTTGCCGAGCTCGAGTCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGACTCGAGCTCGGCAACAGAGATGCG-3′; MKP-1-S131A, 5′-GAAGCGTTTTCGGCTGCCTGCCCGGAGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTCCGGGCAGGCAGCCGAAAACGCTTC-3′; and MKP-1-S235A, 5′-GGCAGACATCAGCGCCTGGTTCAACGAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGTTGAACCAGGCGCTGATGTCTGCC-3′. Cells were transfected with plasmid constructs using TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent (Fermentas, Hanover, Germany). Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against human CK2α (siCK2α) (sc-38963), human MKP-1 (siMKP-1) (sc-35937), human TTP (siTTP) (sc-36761), and control siRNA (scRNA) (sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Colo320 cells (1.5 or 3 × 105) were transfected with each siRNA using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). VEGF 3′UTR was PCR-amplified from the cDNA of Colo320 cells using Taq polymerase (Solgent, Daejeon, Korea) and the following primers: VEGF-3′UTR, 5′-CTAGAGGTACTTATTTAATAGCCCTTTTTAATTAGAAATTAAAACAGTTAATTTAATTAAAGAGTAGGGTTTTTTCAGTAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATACTGAAAAAACCCTACTCTTTAATTAAATTAACTGTTTTAATTTCTAATTAAAAAGGGCTATTAAATAAGTACCT-3′. PCR products were inserted into the XhoI/NotI sites of a psiCHECK2 Renilla/firefly Dual-Luciferase expression vector (Promega). For luciferase assays, Colo320 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP and psiCHECK2-VEGF 3′UTR or psiCHECK2-Bcl2 3′UTR construct using the TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. Transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (Promega) and mixed with luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and the chemiluminescent signal was measured in a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (EG&G Wallac). The activity of Renilla luciferase was normalized to that of firefly luciferase in each sample. All luciferase assay results reported here represent at least three independent experiments, each consisting of three wells per transfection. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE, transferred onto Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare), and probed with appropriate dilutions of antibodies as follows: rabbit anti-human TTP antibody (ab36558, Abcam); anti-human CK2α antibody (sc-12738, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-p38 MAPK antibody (9212, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers); anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (9215, Cell Signaling); anti-MK2 antibody (3042, Cell Signaling); anti-phospho-MK2 antibody (sc-101729, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-MKP-1 antibody (sc-370, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho-MKP-1 antibody (2857, Cell Signaling Technology); anti-ubiquitin antibody (sc-9133, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-V5 antibody (Genentech, San Francisco); anti-HA antibody (H9658, Sigma); and anti-FLAG antibody (F1804, Sigma). Immunoreactivity was detected using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Films were exposed at multiple time points to ensure that the images were not saturated. The potential for phosphorylation sites in TTP protein was predicted using NetPhos. The amino acid sequences of human TTP protein were obtained from GenBankTM (accession number NP_003398). Inhibitors against the protein kinases CK2 (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) and 1,3,5-tribromobenzene (TBB), Sigma), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (LY294002, Calbiochem), mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin, Calbiochem), MEK1 (PD98059, Calbiochem), PKC (Ro-32-0432, Calbiochem), p38 MAPK (SB203580, Calbiochem), JNK (SP600125, Calbiochem), and MKP-1 (Triptolide, Calbiochem) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and used at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Colo320 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V6-TTP and psiCHECK2-VEGF 3′UTR using the TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with protein kinase inhibitors for 12 h, and the chemiluminescent signal in the cell lysate was measured in a Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter. The activity of Renilla luciferase was normalized to that of firefly luciferase in each sample. All luciferase assays reported here represent at least three independent experiments, each consisting of three wells per transfection. Cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP and pcDNA3/FLAG-Ub using TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 30 μm DRB for 12 h in the presence or absence of 50 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem) and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS). Proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Proteins in the immunoprecipitates were resolved using SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Cells were transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP using TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 30 μm DRB for 12 h in the presence or absence of 50 μm MG-132 (Calbiochem) and were resuspended in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25% aprotinin). Fifty microgram cell lysates were incubated with 20 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in a reaction buffer (500 mm potassium acetate, 200 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody. Colo320 cells were transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP using the TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX, Calbiochem) to stop protein synthesis in the presence or absence of DRB. Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 10 h after addition of CHX, and total cell lysates were analyzed using immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody. Colo320 cells were cotransfected with psiCHECK2-VEGF 3′UTR and pcDNA6/V5-TTP, TTP siRNA, or CK2 siRNA using the TurboFectTM in vitro transfection reagent. After 24 h of incubation, cells were incubated with 2 ng/ml human TGF-β in the presence of or absence of 30 μm DRB for 12 h, and chemiluminescent signals in the cell lysate were measured in a Wallac Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter. The activity of Renilla luciferase was normalized to that of firefly luciferase in each sample. All luciferase assays reported here represent at least three independent experiments, each consisting of three wells per transfection. CK2 activity was assayed using a CK2-sensitive synthetic p53 peptide (RRRDDDSDDD) (Cyclex Co. Ltd., Nagano, Japan), which is phosphorylated at serine 46 by CK2. Briefly, Colo320 cells were incubated with 2 ng/ml human TGF-β in the presence or absence of 30 μm DRB for 12 h. Cell lysates were incubated with the synthetic p53 peptide coated on a 96-well plate with the kinase reaction buffer. The amount of phosphorylated substrate was measured by using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phospho-p53 serine 46-specific antibody. Kinase activity was calculated by subtracting the mean of the background control samples without enzyme from the mean of samples with enzyme. For statistical comparisons, p values were determined using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. TTP has been reported to be phosphorylated by various kinds of protein kinases (39Cao H. Lin R. Protein J. 2008; 27: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TTP by p38 MAPK/MK2 signals inhibits TTP activity (40Sandler H. Stoecklin G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but specific protein kinases that can increase TTP activity are not known. We previously reported that TTP reduced VEGF expression and inhibited the growth of colon cancer cells (37Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H.

Here, we aimed to identify protein kinases that can increase the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP. To screen protein kinases that increase the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP, we studied the effects of several protein kinase inhibitors on the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP. We have successfully used the VEGF ARE-containing reporter mRNA to study VEGF mRNA turnover by TTP in human colon cancer cells (37Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H. Jung S.W. Min Y.J. Park S.E. Lee B.J. Cha H.J. Park J.W. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 126: 1817-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); we used a transient transfection system in which the ARE-dependent turnover of the reporter transcripts and its sensitivity to protein kinase inhibitors could be evaluated. To characterize the effects of protein kinase inhibitors on the VEGF decaying activity of TTP, Colo320 cells were cotransfected with a TTP expression construct (pcDNA/V5-TTP) and a luciferase reporter construct that incorporated the 3′UTR of VEGF mRNA (psiCHECK2-VEGF 3′UTR). Transfected cells were treated with various kinds of protein kinase inhibitors, and luciferase activity was measured at 12 h post-treatment. Consistent with the previous report (41Lee H.H. Vo M.T. Kim H.J. Lee U.H. Kim C.W. Kim H.K. Ko M.S. Lee W.H. Cha S.J. Min Y.J. Choi D.H. Suh H.S. Lee B.J. Park J.W. Cho W.J. J. Biol.

Treatment with SP600125 (Jun N-terminal protein kinase inhibitor), Ro-32-0432 (protein kinase C inhibitor), LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor), PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor), or rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) did not affect the TTP-mediated reduction of luciferase activity (supplemental Fig. 1). However, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) enhanced the TTP inhibitory activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Conversely, treatment with the CK2 inhibitor DRB attenuates the TTP-mediated reduction of luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The effect of SB203580 on TTP activity is consistent with those of previous reports that have suggested that the p38 MAPK/MK-2 pathway inhibits the mRNA decaying activity of TTP (7Mahtani K.R.

It is also possible that SB203580 enhanced TTP activity by inhibiting other kinases than p38 MAPK as SB203580 is not selective and is known to inhibit a number of other kinases, including CK1 (42Godl K.

However, our results showing that the CK2 inhibitor DRB increases luciferase activity suggests that the CK2 signal activates the mRNA decaying activity of TTP. Similar results were obtained by another CK2 inhibitor, TBB (supplemental Fig. 2). To confirm whether inhibition of CK2 increases luciferase activity, we analyzed the effect of siRNA against CK2α (siCK2α) on the reporter mRNA decaying activity of TTP. Cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP, psiCHECK2-VEGF 3′UTR, and siCK2, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. Knockdown of endogenous CK2α by siRNA (Fig. 1B) significantly decreased the TTP inhibitory effect (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that inhibition of CK2 decreases the mRNA decaying activity of TTP. All of these data were obtained by analyzing the expression levels of reporter transcripts containing VEGF 3′UTR. Next, we wished to determine whether CK2 inhibition also affects the TTP inhibitory effects on endogenous VEGF mRNA. Colo320 cells were cotransfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP and siCK2α or control siRNA (scRNA), and the expression level of VEGF mRNA was analyzed using real time PCR. Overexpression of TTP decreased the expression level of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 1D). Although control siRNA treatment did not affect the TTP inhibitory effect, down-regulation of CK2α by siRNA attenuated it. The expression level of endogenous TTP in Colo320 cells was extremely low (37Lee H.H. Son Y.J. Lee W.H. Park Y.W. Chae S.W. Cho W.J. Kim Y.M. Choi H.J. Choi D.H. Jung S.W. Min Y.J. Park S.E. Lee B.J.

Collectively, our results suggest that inhibition of CK2 decreases the VEGF mRNA decaying activity of TTP. Overexpression studies were perfor"

All members of the R7 RGS form trimeric complexes with the atypical G protein β subunit, Gβ5, and membrane anchor R7BP or R9AP. Association with Gβ5 and membrane anchors has been shown to be critical for maintaining proteolytic stability of the R7 RGS proteins. However, despite its functional importance, the mechanism of how R7 RGS forms complexes with Gβ5 and membrane anchors remains poorly understood. Here, we used protein-protein interaction, co-localization, and protein stability assays to show that association of RGS9 with membrane anchors requires Gβ5. We further establish that the recruitment of R7BP to the complex requires an intact interface between the N-terminal lobe of RGS9 and protein interaction surface of Gβ5. Site-directed mutational analysis reveals that distinct molecular determinants in the interface between Gβ5 and N-terminal Dishevelled, EGL-10, Pleckstrin/DEP Helical Extension (DEP/DHEY) domains are differentially involved in R7BP binding and proteolytic stabilization. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that Gβ5 contributes to the formation of the binding site to the membrane anchors and thus is playing a central role in the assembly of the proteolytically stable trimeric complex and its correct localization in the cell.

They limit the duration that heterotrimeric G proteins spend in their active state and thus serve as powerful negative regulators of GPCR signal transmission. Biochemically, RGS proteins function as GTPase-accelerating proteins that facilitate GTP hydrolysis on G protein α subunits (Gα) thereby promoting their inactivation (2Hollinger S. Hepler J.R.

There are more than 30 RGS proteins that are grouped into six families according to the homology and structural features (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev.

Both RGS9 splice isoforms exist as constitutive heterotrimers with two other proteins. In the retina, RGS9-1 is found in the complex with type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) (24Makino E.R. Handy J.W.

Interestingly, reciprocal effects on the stability of RGS9-containing complexes have been also described: elimination of RGS9 in photoreceptors leads to down-regulation in the levels of Gβ5 (14Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and knock-out of Gβ5 compromises the stability of R7BP (29Anderson G.R. Lujan R. Semenov A. Pravetoni M. Posokhova E.N. Song J.H. Uversky V. Chen C.K. Wickman K. Martemyanov K.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14117-14127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Grabowska D.

Furthermore, association of RGS9 with the binding partners and consequently its expression level is modulated by oxygen concentration and neuronal activity, suggesting that reorganization in RGS9 complexes could contribute to the neuronal plasticity mechanisms (37Anderson G.R. Lujan R. Martemyanov K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations lead to a general view that RGS9 forms an obligatory trimeric complex with its bona fide subunits R9AP/R7BP and Gβ5 and that the interactions between the subunits are responsible for setting an appropriate expression level of the complex. However, the mechanisms governing complex assembly and intrasubunit interactions are far from being understood. The recently solved crystal structure of the RGS9-Gβ5 complex reveals tight integration of the Gβ5 subunit, which interacts with multiple domains of RGS9 (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One critical focal contact point is established between the so-called “protein interaction interface” of Gβ5 and the N-terminal segment of RGS9 containing the DEP domain. Interestingly, the same DEP domain of the molecule is also indispensable for the recruitment of R7BP and R9AP membrane anchors to the RGS9-Gβ5 complex (26Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P.

However, the molecular determinants mediating this interaction and mechanisms by which proteolytic stabilization of the trimeric complex is achieved are unknown. In this study we examined assembly of the RGS9-Gβ5-R7BP complex and mechanisms by which interactions between individual subunits regulate its expression and localization. We report an unexpected observation that Gβ5 is required for the interaction of RGS9 with its membrane anchors R7BP and R9AP, which was previously thought to be mediated exclusively by the DEP domain of RGS9. We further established that the binding site for the membrane anchors is formed by the interface between the protein interaction surface of Gβ5 and the N-terminal lobe of RGS9. Based on our site-directed mutagenesis results we propose a model where R7BP acts to remodel the interface that is essential for the stability of the complexes and their membrane recruitment.

HEK293T/17 cells were chosen because of their high transfectability (41Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded into 6-cm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish. After 24 h, expression constructs (0.83 μg/construct, total 2.5 μg/dish) were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine LTX (8 μl/dish) and PLUS (2.5 μl/dish) reagents. Empty vector was used to normalize the amount of transfected DNA. The cells were used for experiments at 48 h after transfection. R7BP stable cell lines were generated by transfecting linearized R7BP in pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO into HEK293T/17 cells. Cells were selected in 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Resistant colonies were expanded, and the expression of R7BP protein was evaluated by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. HEK293T/17 cells in 6-cm plates were transfected with the indicated constructs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% n-dodecanoylsucrose, 300 mm NaCl, and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by sonication on ice. The resultant whole cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rotary agitation to solubilize membrane proteins. After lysis, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rcf for 15 min at 4 °C. A 5 μg/sample of the indicated antibody and 20 μl of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) were added, and the supernatants were tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with 1 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% n-dodecanoylsucrose, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 143 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.08 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol).

Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 1510-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Fluorescent Western blot analysis was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System according to the manufacturer's instructions (LI-COR Biosciences), which is reported to have a 16–250-fold wider quantifiable linear range with increased reproducibility than a chemiluminescence Western blot detection system. For detection, blots were blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1.5-h incubation with specific antibodies diluted in Odyssey Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 45 min with a 1:5,000 dilution of secondary antibodies labeled with IRDye 800CW in Odyssey buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% SDS. Proteins were visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imager, and molecular analysis of band intensities was quantified using the Odyssey Application software by measuring the integrated intensity. The integrated intensity is proportional to the amount of dye-labeled antibodies bound to the blot. HEK293T/17 cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After 24 h, expression constructs (total, 5 μg/well) were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine LTX (μl/well) and PLUS (0.5 μl/well) reagents. The cells were used for immunocytochemistry at 48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized by incubation in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.1% PBS-T) for 1 h and were then incubated with primary antibody in 2% goat serum in 0.1% PBS-T for 90 min. The cells were washed with 0.1% PBS-T, and the antibody was visualized with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody in 2% goat serum in 0.1% PBS-T for 45 min. The coverslips were washed three times with 0.1% PBS-T and twice with PBS and mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount (Sigma). Microscopy was performed with an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. The following concentrations of the antibodies were used: 2.5 μg/ml anti-HA (12CA5), 1.2 μg/ml anti-R7BP, and 1.4 μg/ml anti-Gβ5 antibodies. To begin examining the relationship between subunits in RGS9-Gβ5-R7BP we compared their individual contributions toward establishing a proteolytically stable complex. We have previously determined that expression levels of RGS9 in the cells are limited by its proteolytic degradation rate as measured by the pulse-chase method (34Anderson G.R. Semenov A. Song J.H. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 39Porter M.Y. Xie K. Pozharski E. Koelle M.R. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41100-41112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, proteolytic stability of the complex could be approximated by monitoring changes in protein expression levels. To facilitate these studies we chose RGS9-2 as a model isoform due to its relatively short lifetime in transfected cells and large degree of stabilization by R7BP (34Anderson G.R. Semenov A. Song J.H. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mammalian HEK293 cells were transfected with RGS9-2, Gβ5, and R7BP subunits of the complex in all possible combinations, and the effects of co-expression on modulating protein levels were evaluated by quantitative Western blotting. We found no change in RGS9-2 protein levels when Gβ5 or R7BP was added separately (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, co-expression of RGS9-2 with both Gβ5 and R7BP produced a substantial increase in the amount of RGS9-2 (Fig. 1, A and B). We further found that the levels of Gβ5 increase only upon co-expression with both RGS9-2 and R7BP, and neither of the proteins alone affects Gβ5 expression (Fig. 1, C and D). Similarly, R7BP levels are elevated only when it is expressed together with both Gβ5 and R7BP (Fig. 1, E and F). The degree of the effect on the protein expression level by co-expressing all components was found to be similar for all three subunits. These results indicate that stabilizing effects of the individual proteins in the RGS9-Gβ5-R7BP complex are not additive but rather require synergistic contributions from all three subunits to achieve proteolytic stabilization. RGS9 binds to Gβ5 directly via the Gγ-like domain, and this association was shown not to require contributions from membrane anchors R7BP/R9AP (29Anderson G.R. Lujan R. Semenov A. Pravetoni M. Posokhova E.N. Song J.H. Uversky V. Chen C.K. Wickman K. Martemyanov K.A. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14117-14127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the complex formation of RGS9 with R7BP/R9AP has not been fully characterized. Therefore, we have next analyzed the impact of Gβ5 on the association between RGS9 and R7BP (Fig. 2). In these studies, we used the short splice isoform of RGS9, RGS9-1, as the absence of intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain unique to RGS9-2 makes this isoform more proteolytically stable and therefore less dependent on Gβ5 and R7BP for achieving high expression levels in transfected cells (42Posokhova E. Uversky V. Martemyanov K.A. J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 1510-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed robust expression of RGS9-1 in HEK293 cells line stably transfected with R7BP alone (Fig. 2A). Co-expression with Gβ5 in this cell line had only minimal effect on the stability of RGS9-1 (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that RGS9-1 can form complexes with R7BP only when Gβ5 is present (Fig. 2A). Similar observations were made when cells were transfected with R9AP instead of R7BP (Fig. 2B). Again, R9AP failed to co-precipitate with RGS9-1 in the absence of Gβ5 (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, RGS9-1 expressed without Gβ5 retained its ability to interact with the AlF4−-activated Gαo, arguing that monomeric RGS9-1 retains the ability to associate with its functional partners (Fig. 2C). We further extended these observations and analyzed binding of RGS9 with its subunits in the native striatal tissues derived from mouse knock-out strains lacking individual proteins of the complex (Fig. 2D). We observed that knock-out of R7BP or Gβ5 resulted in the similar reduction in RGS9-2 levels. However, although RGS9-2 effectively co-precipitated with Gβ5 in the absence of R7BP, it failed to pull down R7BP in the absence of Gβ5 (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the interaction between RGS9 and R7BP is dependent on Gβ5, both in transfected cells and in native striatal neurons. At the cellular level, one of the central effects elicited by the association with R7BP is the recruitment of RGS proteins to the plasma membrane which substantially augments their ability to regulate GPCR signaling (27Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Jayaraman M. Buchwalter A.L. Kaltenbronn K.M. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effect of R7BP on the subcellular localization of RGS9 in the absence or presence of Gβ5. In the absence of its binding partners, monomeric RGS9-1 was found to be evenly distributed through the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) as indicated by the presence of a nuclear shadow and the decrease in immunofluorescence toward the cell periphery. Co-expression with Gβ5 did not change this localization pattern, and the dimeric RGS9-1-Gβ5 complex remained mainly cytoplasmic (Fig. 3B). Co-transfection of RGS9-1 with Gβ5 into a R7BP-stable cell line resulted in the marked recruitment of the complex to the plasma membrane, as visualized by the sharp staining in the cell periphery and co-localization with R7BP immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B), as noted before (28Drenan R.M. Doupnik C.A. Boyle M.P. Muglia L.J. Huettner J.E. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 43Song J.H. Waataja J.J. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15361-15369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of Gβ5, RGS9-1 failed to be recruited to the plasma membrane by R7BP and remained mostly cytosolic (Fig. 3A). We therefore conclude that R7BP-driven recruitment of RGS9-1 to the plasma membrane requires Gβ5. These observations support a critical role of Gβ5 in the interaction of RGS9 isoforms with membrane anchors. The observation that RGS9 can bind to R7BP only in the presence of Gβ5 could be explained if Gβ5 binds directly to R7BP. Because this possibility has not been addressed before, we have next investigated potential protein-protein interaction between Gβ5 and R7BP. Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach we did not detect any appreciable interaction of Gβ5 with R7BP in the absence of RGS9-1 (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, when protein localization was studied in the intact cells by immunostaining, Gβ5 failed to be recruited to the plasma membranes by R7BP when RGS9-1 was not present in the cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, addition of RGS9-1 induced Gβ5 binding to R7BP (Fig. 4A) and resulted in its translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that Gβ5 by itself does not have any significant R7BP binding affinity. The association of RGS9-Gβ5 with R7BP has been also shown to require the presence of the intact DEP/DHEX domain of RGS9 (30Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Anderson G.R. Semenov A. Song J.H. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that forms direct contacts with Gβ5 (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 44Narayanan V. Sandiford S.L. Wang Q. Keren-Raifman T. Levay K. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6859-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have next tested whether R7BP could bind to the complex between DEP/DHEX domains and Gβ5 reconstituted in trans. Although the DEP/DHEX domain was able to pull down Gβ5 efficiently upon co-expression in the cells, it failed to recruit R7BP to the complex as evidenced by the immunoprecipitation data (Fig. 4C). Neither did we find evidence for an appreciable interaction between R7BP and the DEP/DHEX domain in the absence of Gβ5. These data indicate that neither Gβ5 nor the N-terminal DEP/DHEX module alone or in combination is sufficient to enable binding of R7BP to the complex. The inability to reconstitute R7BP binding to the complex between the DEP/DHEX domains and Gβ5 suggests that recruitment of R7BP is sensitive to the conformational orientation of the elements involved in the establishment of interface between Gβ5 and DEP/DHEX module. Analysis of the crystal structure of RGS9-1-Gβ5 complex reveals that contacts with Gβ5 mainly mediated by either the DEP domain with helixes α2–α3 contributing the most, and the linker loop connecting α4 helix and short β1 in the DHEX domain (Fig. 5A,B) (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To study the role of these regions in mediating the interaction with R7BP, we have introduced point mutations predicted to disrupt the conformation of the interface between Gβ5 and the N-terminal lobe of RGS9. The F16E/F76E double mutation was introduced to the DEP domain of RGS9 (DEP mutant), and the amino acids 202DYGL205 and 207RVT209 were replaced to alanines in the DHEX linker loop (Linker mutant). We have next examined the effects of these mutations on the proteolytic stability and Gβ5-induced interaction with R7BP. When transfected in cells without Gβ5, both mutants showed expression levels similar to wild-type RGS9-1, indicating that their basal stability is uncompromised (Fig. 5, C and D). However, the ability of Gβ5 to increase the levels of RGS9-1 mutants in R7BP-dependent fashion was markedly compromised (Fig. 5, C and E). Although the R7BP/Gβ5-induced stabilization of the Linker mutant was reduced by ∼70%, the protective effect of Gβ5-R7BP was completely lost in case of the DEP mutant. We next studied the ability of the mutants to interact with Gβ5 and R7BP by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, F–H). Both DEP and Linker mutants showed normal interaction with Gβ5. In contrast, their association with R7BP was substantially compromised. Although both mutants retained some ability to recruit R7BP, the strength of this association was much lower than observed for the wild-type RGS9-1. Interestingly, the DEP mutant was affected half as much as the Linker mutant. These differences did not correlate with the differences seen in the stabilizing effects of R7BP on the expression level of RGS9 mutants. These observations indicate that interaction interface between Gβ5 and the N-terminal lobe of RGS9 controls association of the RGS9-Gβ5 complex with R7BP. Our results also suggest that R7BP recruitment is separate from the proteolytic stabilization effects that likely require additional conformational changes. The main observation of this study is that the formation of the RGS9-Gβ5-R7BP (R9AP) complex occurs sequentially and there is a distinct hierarchy of RGS9 association with its subunits. First, RGS9 forms a complex with Gβ5, and then this dimer recruits membrane-targeting subunit R7BP or R9AP. Interestingly, we find that neither RGS9 nor Gβ5 alone can bind to R7BP(R9AP). Thus, our study for the first time establishes the assembly relationship between the subunits of the trimeric complex and demonstrates that the Gβ5 subunit is required for the interaction of RGS9-containing complex with R7BP or R9AP. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal DEP domain of RGS9 is necessary for the interaction of the RGS9-Gβ5 complex with both R9AP and R7BP (26Martemyanov K.A. Yoo P.J. Skiba N.P.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that it acts synergistically with the DHEX domain to establish the selectivity of R7BP/R9AP binding (34Anderson G.R. Semenov A. Song J.H. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that the N termini of RGS9 homologues, RGS7 and Egl-10, can interact directly with Gβ5 (44Narayanan V. Sandiford S.L. Wang Q. Keren-Raifman T. Levay K. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6859-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Patikoglou G.A. Koelle M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47004-47013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the RGS9-Gβ5 complex confirmed that DEP and DHEX domains form a structurally integrated module that makes direct contacts with the protein interaction interface of Gβ5 (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, to account for the dual requirement for both Gβ5 and the DEP domain we suggest that the binding site for R7BP and R9AP is formed by the interface between the DEP/DHEX module and Gβ5. This model is consistent with our site-directed mutagenesis data showing that substitution of amino acids in RGS9 involved in direct contacts with Gβ5 substantially reduces R7BP recruitment to the complex (39Porter M.Y. Xie K. Pozharski E. Koelle M.R. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41100-41112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that there was no correlation between the ability of the “interface” mutations to disrupt R7BP binding and affect the stability of RGS9-Gβ5 complexes. For example, mutating the linker loop in DHEX domain severely compromises R7BP binding but does not eliminate its effects on the proteolytic stability of the complexes. Conversely, mutations of the DEP domain amino acids involved in contacts with Gβ5 completely eliminate proteolytic stabilization by R7BP but exert less severe effects on R7BP binding compared with the DHEX linker mutant. The latter observation is in line with the report that reciprocal mutations in Gβ5 that disrupt interaction with the DEP domain also completely abolish stabilizing effects of R7BP while preserving its recruitment to the complex (39Porter M.Y. Xie K. Pozharski E. Koelle M.R. Martemyanov K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41100-41112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that even though binding of R7BP leads to the proteolytic stabilization of the complex, these are two mechanistically separate events that are not firmly hardwired together. Furthermore, our data pinpoint the underlying molecular determinants: the contacts of Gβ5 with the DEP domain appear to regulate the proteolytic stability of the complexes, whereas coordination of the DHEX linker region seems to be primarily engaged in R7BP (R9AP) binding. Interestingly, Gβ5 uses distinct clusters on its surface for establishing contacts with the DEP and DHEX linker regions (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B). Although understanding precise details of R7BP interaction with RGS9-Gβ5 would certainly require determination of the RGS9-Gβ5-R7BP complex structure at the atomic level, it is tempting to speculate that R7BP binds to the interdomain cleft between the DHEX and the Gβ5 in the close vicinity to the DHEX loop region. Supporting this model is the observation that RGS7, a close homologue of RGS9 that also binds Gβ5, has a markedly different composition of the DHEX linker region (containing ∼25 additional unique amino acids). This correlates with drastically lower affinity of RGS7 for R7BP binding (37Anderson G.R. Lujan R. Martemyanov K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 3033-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RGS7-Gβ5 complex does not require R7BP binding to achieve proteolytic stabilization (29Anderson G.R. Lujan R. Semenov A. Pravetoni M. Posokhova E.N. Song J.H. Uversky V. Chen C.K.

Chem. 2007; 282: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Gβ5 to the R7 RGS proteins is primarily mediated by the Gγ-like domain of the RGS proteins. This interaction resembles classical stable pairing of the G protein βγ subunits (38Cheever M.L. Snyder J.T. Gershburg S. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and is mediated by the specialized CCT chaperonin complex that permanently locks the subunits together (46Howlett A.C. Gray A.J. Hunter J.M. Willardson B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16386-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the association of the Gβ5 at the opposite interface with the DEP/DHEX module of the RGS proteins appears to be dynamic. Narayanan et al. (44Narayanan V. Sandiford S.L. Wang Q. Keren-Raifman T. Levay K. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6859-6870Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that Gβ5 can bind to the DEP domain of RGS7 and that this interaction is dynamic and is modulated by the R7BP. In addition, the same group has shown that the DEP domain of RGS7 can also bind to the third intracellular loop of M3 receptor and that this interaction is negatively modulated by R7BP (47Sandiford S.L. Slepak V.Z. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2282-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations it was proposed that the interaction of Gβ5 with the DEP/DHEX module is dynamic. Our findings suggest that a similar mechanism modulating the interface between DEP/DHEX and Gβ5 is involved in controlling the proteolytic stability of the R7 RGS complexes. We propose that the opening of the interface at the DEP/Gβ5 site exposes degradation determinants located in the DEP/DHEX module and facilitates proteolysis of the complex. Binding of R7BP in the vicinity of the DHEX linker located on the other side of the interface serves as a “prop” to restrict the dynamics of the interactions and to promote closed conformation, thus resulting in shielding of the degradation determinants and proteolytic stabilization (Fig. 6). In summary, our results indicate that intramolecular interactions between Gβ5 and DEP/DHEX module of RGS9 determine protein expression of the complex and control its localization in cells, revealing a powerful regulatory hot-spot in the R7 RGS proteins.

All genomes encode far less tRNA diversity than is required for all the codons used for translation (1Agris P.F. Vendeix F.A. Graham W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This apparent decoding conundrum is resolved by the inherent base pairing flexibility between the third codon position in mRNA and the first position of the anticodon in tRNA, as originally proposed in Crick's wobble rules (2Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Wobbling permits some nucleotides to form sufficiently stable non-Watson and Crick base pairs providing critical flexibility, without sacrificing translational fidelity (3Murphy 4th, F.V. Ramakrishnan V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1251-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Among the most extreme cases of base-pairing flexibility in protein synthesis is the use of the nucleotide inosine, a guanosine analog that can base pair with A, C, or U (3Murphy 4th, F.V. Ramakrishnan V. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1251-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus in the context of a codon-anticodon interaction, inosine at the first position of the anticodon (I34) effectively allows a single tRNA to decode three different codons for the same amino acid, obviating the need for additional tRNAs to be encoded in genomes. Given the role of I34 in decoding in bacteria and eukarya, it is not surprising that the enzymes responsible for inosine formation are essential for viability (4Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 6Rubio M.A. Pastar I. Gaston K.W. Ragone F.L. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. Papavasiliou F.N. Alfonzo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Inosine formation in tRNAs is not relegated to the anticodon and has been described at various positions in tRNAs from a number of organisms. For example, in eukaryotic tRNAs inosine can also occur at position 37 where it may affect anticodon loop structure (7Gerber A. Grosjean H. Melcher T. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Grosjean H. Auxilien S. Constantinesco F. Simon C. Corda Y. Becker H.F. Foiret D. Morin A. Jin Y.X. Fournier M. Fourrey J.L. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence of the enzyme responsible for synthesis of I37 resembles classic adenosine deaminases, whereas that for I34 has all the sequence signature motifs of cytidine deaminase, perhaps reflecting their different evolutionary paths (see Fig. 1). Regardless of nucleotide position, all inosines in RNA are presumably formed by the zinc-dependent hydrolytic deamination of adenosine, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNAs (ADATs) 4The abbreviations used are: ADATadenosine deaminases acting on tRNAADARadenosine deaminases acting on RNAICPinductively coupled plasma. or adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) for all other RNAs. These enzymes can specifically target a variety of RNA substrates, for example tRNAs, mRNAs, miRNAs, and even rRNA, while excluding free nucleotides (9Habig J.W. Dale T. Bass B.L. Mol.

Currently, the best studied example of inosine in tRNA is that occurring at the first position of the anticodon (I34) where the essential inosine has, as discussed above, a direct bearing on decoding. In bacteria, I34 is generated by bacterial homodimeric ADATa with each monomer coordinating one Zn2+ and containing all the additional amino acids needed for catalysis (13Elias Y. Huang R.H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12057-12065Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Kim J. Malashkevich V. Roday S. Lisbin M. Schramm V.L. Almo S.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inosine has not been described in mitochondria, but a recent report showed that a bacteria-type ADATa enzyme plays key functions in inosine formation and thus translation in chloroplasts (16Karcher D. Bock R. RNA. 2009; 15: 1251-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Delannoy E. Le Ret M. Faivre-Nitschke E. Estavillo G.M. Bergdoll M. Taylor N.L. Pogson B.J. Small I. Imbault P. Gualberto J.M. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2058-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ADATa only targets a single tRNA (tRNAACGArg) and can efficiently catalyze deamination of an anticodon stem loop corresponding to a minimal version of tRNAACGArg (4Wolf J. Gerber A.P. Keller W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3841-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Importantly, RNA recognition was highlighted in the co-crystal structure of the Staphylococcus aureus ADATa with a bound anticodon stem loop, which suggested that all of the key contacts needed for catalysis were maintained even with this shortened substrate (18Losey H.C. Ruthenburg A.J. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA adenosine deaminases acting on RNA inductively coupled plasma. In contrast, the eukaryotic enzymes target seven or eight different tRNAs depending on the organism, raising questions about the evolutionary transition to this broader, multi-substrate specificity. The eukaryotic enzyme, as exemplified by the yeast system, functions as a heterodimer, comprised of two subunits, ADAT2 and ADAT3, that unlike the bacterial enzyme needs a full-length tRNA for activity (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 19Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Currently, however, because of the lack of a crystal structure or detailed kinetic characterization, little is known about how the zinc co-factor is coordinated or what the rules are for substrate recognition among eukaryotic tRNA anticodon deaminases (including yeast). Because of its similarity with other members of the cytidine deaminase superfamily, including bacterial ADATa, it has been suggested that this group of eukaryotic enzymes uses similar metal coordinating motifs, H(C)XE and PCXXC (where X represents any amino acid) (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The conserved histidine and two cysteines coordinate the zinc ion, whereas the fourth ligand is an activated water molecule. A conserved glutamate in ADAT2 then acts as a proton shuttle between the activated water and the exocyclic nitrogen at C-6 of the purine ring. Interestingly, in the equivalent site of Trypanosoma brucei ADAT3, a valine is found in place of the conserved catalytic glutamate (see Fig. 1) (6Rubio M.A. Pastar I. Gaston K.W. Ragone F.L. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. Papavasiliou F.N. Alfonzo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Similarly ADAT3 from yeast also has a valine at this position (Val218) (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), a trend that is seen in ∼60% of all ADAT3s. Isoleucine and threonine are also fairly well conserved in this position (combined total 25% of ADAT3s). Because ADAT3 still has all of the Zn2+-binding residues, it has been suggested that this subunit might only play a structural role, an untested premise (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 6Rubio M.A. Pastar I. Gaston K.W. Ragone F.L. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. Papavasiliou F.N. Alfonzo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the absence of evidence to suggest otherwise, the eukaryotic A34-specific tRNA deaminases are thus presumed to bind two zinc ions (one catalytic and one structural), both essential for activity (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We exploited the intrinsic asymmetry of the heterodimeric ADAT2/3 to explore the general contribution of each subunit to activity, including the role of Zn2+-coordinating residues. We have previously shown that ADAT2/3 from T. brucei (TbADAT2/3) is unusual in that it performs both C to U and A to I deamination reactions (6Rubio M.A. Pastar I. Gaston K.W. Ragone F.L. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. Papavasiliou F.N. Alfonzo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches, we have now examined the steady-state kinetic behavior of TbADAT2/3 and present the first complete kinetic characterization of a eukaryotic tRNA deaminase. We show that this enzyme is mechanistically distinct from other multimeric RNA deaminases in its ability to catalyze the deamination reaction with a single bound Zn2+. Taken together, the findings presented here highlight the possible tight interplay between subunits that generate a functional active site with implications for the specificity and evolution of multimeric editing deaminases. TbADAT2 and TbADAT3 single amino acid substitutions were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) per manufacturer's protocol. E. coli (BL21 DE3) was transformed with expression vector pCDF-Duet, and recombinant protein expression was as described previously (20Moore M.J. Sharp P.A. Science. 1992; 256: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), and lysed by sonication with a Branson sonifier 450 (five times, 30-s intervals with 60 s rest between sonication). The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min, followed by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 100,000 × g for 30 min (S100). The S100 was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, and purification was performed as per manufacturer instructions (Qiagen). Bound proteins were eluted with 500 mm imidazole, and the purified protein peak was dialyzed at 4 °C overnight in storage buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol). Glycerol (final concentration, 20%) was added to the dialyzed protein for storage in aliquots at −80 °C. An A34 site-specifically radioactively labeled tRNAVal substrate was generated and refolded as described previously (20Moore M.J. Sharp P.A. Science. 1992; 256: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of tRNA were incubated with wild type or mutant recombinant enzyme at 27 °C for 45 min (or longer as indicated). The sample was extracted with phenol and ethanol-precipitated. The resulting pellet was suspended in 9 μl of 1× nuclease P1 buffer (as supplied with enzyme; 30 mm NaOAc, pH 5.3) and 1 μl of nuclease P1 (MPBiomedicals) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The samples were dried with heat under vacuum. Dried samples were suspended in 2.5 μl of H2O, and 1 μl was spotted on a TLC cellulose plate (Merck). The reaction products were separated by one-dimensional TLC in solvent C (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8:ammonium sulfate:n-propanol (100:60:2, v/w/v)) and visualized using the Storm imaging system (GE Healthcare). The signals were quantified using ImageQuant software. Steady-state kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot kinetic software (with the enzyme kinetic module) and Lineweaver-Burk plots (supplemental Fig. S1). Gel-purified radiolabeled tRNAVal mimicking the product tRNA (T7-transcript containing G34 instead of A34) was incubated on ice in the presence of reaction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm KCl) with increasing concentrations of protein for 15 min. Glycerol was added to the samples (final concentration, 10%), and the products were separated on a 6.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in 1× NNB (67 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.6 mm EDTA) at 100 volts for 1.5 h at 25 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen; the products were visualized and analyzed using the Storm imaging system and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare), respectively. The binding data were fit to a single ligand-binding curve using SigmaPlot kinetic software. TbADAT2/3 wild type and mutant enzymes were analyzed for zinc content via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectrometry by the University of Georgia Chemical Analysis Laboratory. Wild type and mutant TbADAT2/3 were expressed as above but were extensively dialyzed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 2 mm EDTA to remove loosely bound zinc and other metal ions. The buffer was further exchanged in metal-free Hepes, pH 8.0, and 50 mm KCl to remove excess salt and EDTA. Pure nitric acid was added to 2%. Protein samples and buffer controls were analyzed in 2% nitric acid. Zinc content was determined by ICP using buffer alone as the background control. Wild type enzyme was expressed and purified using the above protocol with the following modifications. First, BL21 DE3 RIL X, a methionine auxotroph cell line was used. At A600 0.6–0.8 cells were harvested (6000 rpm for 5 min) and suspended in M9 minimal medium supplemented with a trace metals mix, 2 mm MgSO4, 100 mm CaCl2, 0.2% glucose, and 100 mm “cold” methionine. The cells were then grown for an additional 30 min at 37 °C before induction. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) and 1 mCi of radiolabel [35S]Met/Cys. Following 15 h of induction (at 25 °C), the cells were harvested and processed as described above. Sequences of T. brucei ADAT2 and ADAT3 were submitted to the GeneSilico protein structure prediction MetaServer (21Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3305-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), which is a gateway for >200 primary methods for predicting various aspects of protein structure and in particular for the detection of remote homology to other proteins with known structure. Expectedly, the metaserver indicated homology between ADAT2 and ADAT3 and a large group of structures from the cytidine deaminase superfamily. As the modeling template, we selected the structure of tRNA adenosine deaminase ADATa (TadA) from S. aureus (Protein Data Bank code 2B3J), because it was one of the top scoring structures, and it has been solved as a complex with the RNA substrate. Three-dimensional models were generated for the heterodimer of TbADAT2/3 based on the ADATa homodimer using the FRankenstein's monster method (22Kosinski J. Cymerman I.A. Feder M. Kurowski M.A. Sasin J.M. Bujnicki J.M. Proteins. 2003; 53: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an alternative “swapped” model was built by exchanging parts of ADAT2 and ADAT3 containing the HXE and CXXC motifs to form hybrid active sites, followed by remodeling of loops connecting the “swapped” elements. Finally, the N-terminal domain of ADAT3 was added by de novo modeling with ROSETTA (23Simons K.T. Kooperberg C. Huang E. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 209-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), in the same orientation with respect to the N terminus of ADAT3 in both initial models, i.e. the regular and the swapped one. The atomic details are only predictions; nonetheless, the models are expected to be accurate on the level of the inter-residue contacts within individual domains and hence can be used to aid in analyzing various types of data in the three-dimensional context and thereby help to interpret the effect of residue substitutions resulting from mutations. Sequence conservation has been calculated with ConSurf (24Armon A. Graur D. Ben-Tal N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), based on multiple sequence alignments of TbADAT2 and TbADAT3 orthologs, respectively, using representative sequences from sequenced eukaryotic genomes, selected from the results of a PSI-BLAST search (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the heterodimeric T. brucei anticodon deaminase (TbADAT2/3) had sufficient catalytic flexibility to perform both adenosine and cytidine deamination reactions, albeit in two different substrates, tRNA and DNA, respectively (6Rubio M.A. Pastar I. Gaston K.W. Ragone F.L. Janzen C.J. Cross G.A. Papavasiliou F.N. Alfonzo J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7821-7826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In light of these observations, we decided to probe further the general contribution of each subunit (TbADAT2 and TbADAT3) to enzymatic activity. Previous studies reported the identification and characterization of the S. cerevisiae ADAT2/3 (ScADAT2/3) enzyme (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This enzyme, like in T. brucei, is heterodimeric, and whereas the ScADAT2 subunit harbors all of the key conserved residues required for deamination, the sequence of ScADAT3 is naturally missing the conserved active site glutamate essential for deaminase activity. ADAT2 was thus proposed to play a catalytic role, whereas ADAT3 plays solely a structural one (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, the general contribution of each subunit of ADAT2/3 to catalysis has not been formally established in any system. We systematically made a number of single-amino acid substitutions in each subunit of the TbADAT2/3, at residues conserved among most deaminases (Fig. 1). In most deaminases, Zn2+ coordination occurs via an amino acid triad composed of one histidine (or cysteine) separated by a spacer region (with a variable number of amino acids) followed by two additional cysteines (the so-called H…CXXC motif) (7Gerber A. Grosjean H. Melcher T. Keller W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Xie K. Sowden M.P. Dance G.S. Torelli A.T. Smith H.C. Wedekind J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8114-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In TbADAT2/3, alanine substitutions of either the conserved histidine (His252) or the cysteines (Cys291 and Cys294) of TbADAT3 produced an inactive enzyme (Table 1 and data not shown). This recombinant enzyme, however, could still form a heterodimer with ADAT2. Two inferences can be drawn. First, the lack of activity of this mutant is due to the inability of TbADAT3 to coordinate Zn2+. Second, Zn2+ coordination by TbADAT3 is not a prerequisite for heterodimerization. These observations are consistent with attributes reported for the yeast counterpart.TABLE 1The effect of amino acid substitutions at evolutionarily conserved residues in TbADAT2 and TbADAT3EnzymeKmaThe values are obtained from at least three independent trials.

Open table in a new tab In the TbADAT3 sequence, a valine is found in place of the key catalytic glutamate (HPV instead of HAE; Val254 in HPV; Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that in the ScADAT2/3 heterodimer replacement of the ADAT3 valine for glutamate (V218E) could not rescue the loss of activity seen in the active site mutant E56A, suggesting that the position of the glutamate on ScADAT2 was crucial for catalysis (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). However, ScADAT3 V218E supported full activity in the context of a wild type ScADAT2 (5Gerber A.P. Keller W. Science. 1999; 286: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Analogous substitutions in TbADAT2/3 caused similar effects with one striking difference, TbADAT3 V254E in the context of a wild type ADAT2 completely inactivated the enzyme (Table 1). However, substitutions of TbADAT3 V254 by leucine, threonine, or serine were tolerated, albeit with a 3–7-fold increase in Km and smaller or insignificant changes in kcat (compared with the wild type). These data reinforce the view that Zn2+ coordination by the HPV region of TbADAT3 serves a structural and/or binding role but does not directly partake in catalysis. However, in light of the fact that changes of nearby residues do affect activity (Table 1, e.g. ADAT3 V254E), we conclude that minor perturbations of residues proximal to His252 of TbADAT3 can have drastic effects on enzyme function. Similarly, substitutions in the conserved HAE motif region in TbADAT2 showed that, like in all other deaminases, the key catalytic glutamate (Glu92) in TbADAT2 was essential for activity, but in contrast to the equivalent position in ADAT3, other amino acid substitutions at Glu92 were always deleterious (data not shown), highlighting the essential role of the conserved glutamate in catalysis. To further assess the specific contributions of TbADAT2 and TbADAT3 to catalysis, we mutated the other conserved active site domain, the PCXXC domain, in each subunit (Fig. 1). We made individual alanine substitutions in TbADAT2 and TbADAT3, so that one subunit was bearing the mutation in the context of the second subunit remaining wild type (Table 1). As expected, substitutions of cysteine 139 (the second cysteine in CXXC) to alanine in TbADAT2 abrogated enzymatic activity, indicating the essential role of this residue for activity, likely because of its ability to participate in Zn2+ coordination (data not shown). Unexpectedly, however, replacing the first cysteine in TbADAT2 (C136A) (Fig. 1) still generated an active enzyme (Fig. 2 and Table 1). This recombinant variant showed only a 4-fold reduction in kcat and a 12.5-fold reduction in kcat/Km compared with the wild type. The larger decrease in catalytic efficiency was partly due to a 2-fold increase in the Km, suggesting that the modest change in kcat was either partly structural or was due to small effects on substrate binding. This is in stark contrast with similar mutations in the cytidine deaminase from Escherichia coli, which led to either no detectable activity or a >100,000-fold decrease in specific activity (27Smith A.A. Carlow D.C. Wolfenden R. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6468-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our observation suggests that although both cysteines in the CXXC motif of TbADAT2 play a role in optimal enzyme function, there is a first among equals: Zn2+ coordination via the first cysteine is not essential for catalysis. Taken together, the results in Table 1 suggest marked differences in the functional significance of residues within conserved motifs between TbADAT2/3 and other nucleotide deaminases. These observations also reveal that all of the key Zn2+-coordinating residues of TbADAT3 are essential, but one of the three zinc-coordinating residues in TbADAT2 is dispensable for activity. Two possibilities could account for the above results: 1) the TbADAT2 C136A mutant might somehow coordinate a loosely bound catalytic Zn2+ or 2) a single Zn2+ is sufficient for catalysis. To rule out the first possibility and test the idea that chelation of a potentially loose bound zinc ion would effectively inactivate the enzyme, we performed deamination reactions with the TbADAT2 C136A mutant in the presence of increasing concentrations of EDTA (Fig. 3A). However, no significant effect on the enzyme activity of the mutant was observed even in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, which corresponds to a >650-fold molar excess compared with the enzyme (1.5 μm in these reactions). Similar mutations in a number of deaminases can be partially rescued by increasing Zn2+ concentration (27Smith A.A. Carlow D.C. Wolfenden R. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6468-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We found that exogenous Zn2+ addition failed to rescue any of the inactive mutants; importantly, the C136A mutant had comparable activity as in the absence of added Zn2+ (Fig. 3B). In fact, as in the case of wild type, this mutant was inhibited by ZnCl2 concentrations exceeding 50 μm. The lack of rescue by the addition of Zn2+ may be related to the observation that only after co-expression of both subunits in E. coli were we able to generate an active enzyme, and perhaps Zn2+ has already been incorporated into the enzyme during de novo assembly of the recombinant heterodimer. We then explored the second possibility and determined the Zn2+ content of the wild type and C136A mutant TbADAT2/3 heterodimers by ICP emission spectrometry (28Fassel V.A. Science. 1978; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We purified recombinant wild type and/or mutant enzyme by Ni2+-chelate chromatography followed by extensive dialysis in the presence of EDTA to remove any loosely bound metals and to also rule out the possibility of metals binding via the His tag. These samples were then subjected to ICP, which revealed that, as expected, the wild type enzyme contained an average of 1.99 ± 0.12 zinc ions/heterodimer. Interestingly, the TbADAT2 mutant C136A contained an average of 0.78 ± 0.22 pmol of zinc bound per pmol of heterodimeric enzyme (Fig. 3C). It is possible that a different metal is still coordinated by residues other than the conserved HCC triad and that this second metal is the one catalyzing the deamination reaction in the C136A mutant. Replacement of zinc by cobalt in other deaminases can still yield an active enzyme, albeit with a reduced catalytic rate (29Betts L. Xiang S. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Carter J"

C. glabrata met15Δ strains, organic sulfur auxotrophs, were observed to utilize cystine as a sulfur source, and this phenotype was exploited in the discovery of CgCYN1. Heterologous expression of CgCYN1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae met15Δ strains conferred the ability of S. cerevisiae strains to grow on cystine. Deletion of the CgCYN1 ORF (CAGL0M00154g) in C. glabrata met15Δ strains caused abrogation of growth on cystine with growth being restored when CgCYN1 was reintroduced. The CgCYN1 protein belongs to the amino acid permease family of transporters, with no similarity to known plasma membrane cystine transporters of bacteria and humans, or lysosomal cystine transporters of humans/yeast. Kinetic studies revealed a Km of 18 ± 5 μm for cystine. Cystine uptake was inhibited by cystine, but not by other amino acids, including cysteine. The structurally similar cystathionine, lanthionine, and selenocystine alone inhibited transport, confirming that the transporter was specific for cystine. CgCYN1 localized to the plasma membrane and transport was energy-dependent. Functional orthologues could be demonstrated from other pathogenic yeast like Candida albicans and Histoplasma capsulatum, but were absent in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae.

Heterologous expression of CgCYN1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae met15Δ strains conferred the ability of S. cerevisiae strains to grow on cystine. Deletion of the CgCYN1 ORF (CAGL0M00154g) in C. glabrata met15Δ strains caused abrogation of growth on cystine with growth being restored when CgCYN1 was reintroduced. The CgCYN1 protein belongs to the amino acid permease family of transporters, with no similarity to known plasma membrane cystine transporters of bacteria and humans, or lysosomal cystine transporters of humans/yeast. Kinetic studies revealed a Km of 18 ± 5 μm for cystine. Cystine uptake was inhibited by cystine, but not by other amino acids, including cysteine. The structurally similar cystathionine, lanthionine, and selenocystine alone inhibited transport, confirming that the transporter was specific for cystine. CgCYN1 localized to the plasma membrane and transport was energy-dependent. Functional orthologues could be demonstrated from other pathogenic yeast like Candida albicans and Histoplasma capsulatum, but were absent in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae. Candida glabrata and Candida albicans are the two most prominent yeast causing bloodstream infections in humans (1Kaur R. Domergue R. Zupancic M.L. Cormack B.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Of these, C. glabrata represents an intriguing evolutionary example of a pathogen where it is found to be more closely related to its nonpathogenic counterpart Saccharomyces cerevisiae than to C. albicans and in terms of genome size is found to have a significantly trimmer genome than S. cerevisiae (1Kaur R. Domergue R. Zupancic M.L. Cormack B.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Dujon B. Sherman D. Fischer G. Durrens P. Casaregola S. Lafontaine I.

Thus, despite a significantly smaller genome size it has evolved the ability to survive within the human host, and any new proteins acquired by this yeast can be considered likely to play a very significant role in pathogenesis within the human host. Like all living forms, yeast pathogens require essential nutrients for their survival. Sulfur is one of the essential requirements being a part of two important amino acids cysteine and methionine, as well as several other essential sulfur-containing compounds including glutathione and coenzyme A. Yeast pathogens must fulfill this requirement of sulfur by retrieving them from their human host. C. glabrata, like many yeast, can use both inorganic and organic forms of sulfur and have been demonstrated to have both forward and reverse transsulfuration pathways for the conversion of cysteine to methionine and also from methionine to cysteine (3Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the sulfur assimilatory pathways were found to be very similar to that of S. cerevisiae, one important difference was found in the utilization of glutathione where C. glabrata was found to lack the ability to transport glutathione because of the absence of a high affinity glutathione transporter thus relying solely on the endogenous biosynthesis of glutathione for its survival (3Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when one looks at the presence of sulfur compounds in the human blood plasma, glutathione is found in negligible amounts, whereas the most predominant organic sulfur form found in blood plasma is cystine (the oxidized form of cysteine) (4Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The preponderance of cystine in human plasma suggests that sulfur requirements in pathogenic yeast might involve their utilization of cystine. Interestingly, in a study done four decades ago, in another important yeast pathogen, Histoplasma capsulatum, cystine uptake was demonstrated in the yeast phase of this dimorphic yeast. However, the gene responsible for the phenotype was never discovered (5Gilbert B.E. Howard D.H. Infect. Immun. 1970; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), despite plasma membrane cystine transporters having being described in both humans (6Rajan D.P. Kekuda R. Huang W. Wang H. Devoe L.D.

Further, its haploid nature makes it much easier to manipute than C. albicans. We therefore investigated the ability of C. glabrata to utilize cystine and exploited the met15Δ strains that are organic sulfur auxotrophs. We describe here the identification and characterization of a high affinity, plasma membrane cystine-specific transporter CgCYN1 that confers the ability of this yeast to utilize cystine. The transporter was demonstrated to have functional orthologues in the pathogenic yeast C. albicans and H. capslatum, but was absent in the nonpathogenic yeast S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. All chemicals and reagents were of analytical reagent grade and were procured from different commercial sources. Medium components were purchased from BD (Difco). Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized from Sigma-Genosys (see supplemental Table 1). Restriction enzymes, DNA polymerases, and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Gel extraction kits and plasmid miniprep columns were obtained from Qiagen. [35S]Cysteine was obtained from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and [35S]cystine was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ARC). 3The abbreviations used are: ARC, American Radiolabeled Chemicals; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; TEF, translation elongation factor. Cys-Cys dipeptide was custom synthesized from an in-house peptide synthesizer. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as a cloning host. S. cerevisiae, C. glabrata, C. albicans, S. pombe strains used in the study are described in Table 1. S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and C. glabrata strains were regularly maintained on yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose medium (YPD) whereas S. pombe was maintained on YES medium. Synthetic defined minimal medium contained yeast nitrogen base, ammonium sulfate, dextrose supplemented with methionine, cysteine, cystine, cystathionine, histidine, leucine, lysine (as per requirement), and uracil at 50 mg/liter. Yeast transformations were carried out using the modified lithium acetate method as described for C. glabrata (13Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) an for C. albicans using SAT1 flipper as disruption cassette (14Reuss O. Vik A. Kolter R. Morschhäuser J.

For hemagglutinin (HA) tagging CYN1 gene pGRB2.2-CgCYN1 was taken as the template for PCR and HA tag was introduced just before the end codon of CgCYN1 using the PCR where the reverse primer had the HA tag (CgCYN1HAR) to yield plasmid pGRB2.2-CgCYN1HA. A putative orthologue of CgCYN1 in C. albicans (ORF Ca019.9873) was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of C. albicans with primers CaCYN1F and CaCYN1R and cloned in the EcoRI and XhoI sites of p416TEF to obtain plasmid p416TEF-CaCYN1. A putative orthologue of CgCYN1 in H. capsulatum, HCAG_06385, had two introns. Its cDNA was custom synthesized by Genescript which was then cloned in the BamHI and XhoI sites of p416TEF to obtain p416TEF-HcCYN1. S. pombe ORF SPCPB1C11.02 was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of S. pombe using primers SpC11.02F and SpC11.02R and cloned in to the XbaI and SmaI sites of p416TEF to obtain plasmid p416TEF-Sp11.02. Plasmid p416TEF-CgCYN1 prepared from a dam −dcm− E. coli strain was digested with BclI and a HisG-Ura3-HisG cassette inserted in this site. This cassette was released from plasmid PHUKH2M (derived from pHUKH2 (15Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Gene. 1996; 169: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and lacks the BamHI and XhoI sites), and the resulting ligation yielded p416TEF-CgCYN1M:HisG-Ura3-HisG. The disruption cassette was released from plasmid p416TEF-CgCYN1M:HisG-Ura3-HisG by BamHI-XhoI digestion and transformed into C. glabrata met15Δura3Δ (ABG 2370). Transformants were selected on minimal medium lacking uracil with methionine as the sulfur source. The disruption was confirmed by diagnostic PCR. To remove the URA3 marker from the disruptant 5-fluoroorotic acid selection was performed using 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid and selecting the transformants on minimal medium with uracil (1.2 mg/100 ml) and methionine. To delete both the alleles of CaCYN1 (ORF Ca019.9873) in C. albicans we employed the nourseothricin disruption cassette and the SAT1 flipper strategy (using primers CaCYN1DF1, CaCYN1DF2, CaCYN1DR1, and CaCYN1DR2). The absence of a third allele for CaCYN1 was confirmed by the absence of a PCR product with primers CaCYN1 + 450F (anneals in the region which is removed in the two disrupted alleles) and CaCYN1R. For dilution spotting assays, the different transformants were grown overnight in minimal medium with supplements but without uracil and reinoculated in fresh medium to an A600 of 0.1 and grown for 6 h. The exponential phase cells were harvested washed with water and resuspend in water to an A600 of 0.2. These were serially diluted to 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. Of these cell suspensions, 10 μl of the each dilution was spotted on the desired plates. Plates were incubated for 2 days, and photographs were taken. For the localization studies Cgmet15ΔCYN1Δ was transformed with the HA-tagged CgCYN1, and the transformants were used for the indirect immunofluorescence as described earlier (16Kaur J. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23872-23884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The protein sequence of C. glabrata CYN1 was used as a query sequence in BLAST to retrieve a current list of homologues of CgCYN1 in the fungal taxa. The protein sequences were then retrieved and aligned using ClustalW (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method (18Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) using MEGA4 (19Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25632) Google Scholar). S. cerevisae met15Δyct1Δ strain (ABC 1904) was transformed with C. glabrata CYN1 gene under the TEF promoter in plasmid p416TEF and with the vector control p416TEF. The transformants were grown in minimal medium containing methionine and other supplements overnight. Overnight cultures were reinoculated in the same fresh medium at an A600 of 0.1 and were allowed to grow until the cells reached the exponential phase, after which they were harvested, washed with ice-cold MES buffer, and then resuspended in the same MES buffer containing 2% glucose. After a 5-min preincubation of cells at 30 °C the transport experiment was initiated by adding radioactive cystine supplied by ARC, having a specific activity of 850 mCi/mmol) in MES buffer at a final concentration of 20 μm, and transport was monitored for 11 min. At selected time points (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 min) cells were harvested on a glass fiber prefilter (Advanced Microdevices, Ambala, India) and washed with excess cold water by vacuum filtration. The cells were then immersed in 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Sigma Flour Universal LSC mixture), and radioactivity was measured on a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Microbeta, 1450 LSC and luminescence counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the results were expressed as nmol of cystine/mg of protein/min. Total protein was measured as previously described (16Kaur J. Bachhawat A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 23872-23884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For saturation kinetics, the initial rate of cystine uptake was measured at different concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 160 μm (160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 μm), with specific activity being kept constant at each concentration. The initial rate of cystine uptake was determined by measuring the radioactive cystine accumulated in the cells up to 2 min. For inhibition studies done with different sulfur compounds, amino acids, and structural analogues of cystine, the inhibitors were added at 20-fold excess along with the assay medium, and initial rates of cystine uptake were measured. For the studies done with the metabolic inhibitors cells were preincubated with the metabolic inhibitors for 15 min at 30 °C before measuring the initial rate of cystine uptake. C. glabrata met15Δ strains, like S. cerevisiae met15Δ strains, are organic sulfur auxotrophs and have been previously shown to utilize both cysteine and methionine as a sulfur source suggesting the existence of both forward and reverse transsulfuration pathways in C. glabrata (3Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We used this C. glabrata met15Δ strain to test for the growth on cystine. Interestingly, we observed that C. glabrata met15Δ could utilize cystine as a sulfur source whereas S. cerevisiae met15Δ failed to do so (Fig. 1A). To identify the gene(s) in C. glabrata that were conferring the ability to grow on cystine, we complemented the S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain with a genomic library of C. glabrata made in a S. cerevisiae-specific vector YEp24. Transformants were selected on minimal medium with cystine as the sole organic sulfur source. A total of 20 transformants were obtained. These transformants were replica-patched on ammonium sulfate, and 16 transformants were found to grow on ammonium sulfate. These were not followed further because they were likely to contain the CgMET15 gene complementing in the Scmet15Δ strain. Plasmids were isolated from those transformants that could grow only on cystine and not on ammonium sulfate and reconfirmed for their phenotype following retransformation in S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain. Sequencing of the inserts using YEp24-specific primers (YEp24F and YEp24R) in these four plasmids revealed a common ORF, CAGL0M00154g. The ORF CAGL0M00154g was amplified from the genome of C. glabrata and cloned into the yeast expression vector p416TEF. Heterologous expression of CAGL0M00154g conferred the capability of S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain to grow on cystine (supplemental Fig. 1). To further ascertain that ORF CAGL0M00154g was indeed the ORF of C. glabrata that was conferring the ability of C. glabrata to grow on cystine, we deleted the ORF in a C. glabrata met15Δ strain. A complete growth defect was seen on cystine which could be restored by reintroducing ORF CAGL0M00154g expressed from the constitutive PGK promoter in C. glabrata-specific vector pGRB2.2 (Fig. 1B). The sequence analysis of ORF CAGL0M00154g revealed that it encoded a protein of 550 amino acids having 12 predicted transmembrane domains (see Fig. 8A) and belongs to the amino acid permease family of proteins. Based on the phenotypes, it appeared that it was likely to be a cystine transporter. Uptake experiments were performed using 35S-labeled cystine to examine this possibility in C. glabrata. However, our initial experiments were complicated by the observation of the presence of radioactive cysteine that was apparent in the radioactive cystine supplied by ARC. This was confirmed by a variety of transport experiments (data not shown) exploiting the S. cerevisiae yct1Δmet15Δ strain background. YCT1 is a high affinity cysteine-specific transporter that does not transport cystine as described previously (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Briefly, TEF-YCT1 transformed into S. cerevisiae yct1Δmet15Δ also revealed radioactive uptake using the ARC-supplied radioactive cystine (blocked by cold cysteine, but not cystine). In contrast, TEF-CgCYN1-transformed strains also showed uptake (but blocked by cold cystine, not cysteine). Furthermore, TEF-YCT1 (but not TEF-CgCYN1) transformants could take up [35S]cysteine (from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre). The presence of specific cysteine (and now cystine) transporters has allowed us to develop this is as a simple bioassay for the presence of cysteine and cystine in these radioactive samples. 4A. K. Yadav and A. K. Bachhawat, unpublished data. Because of the presence of contaminating radioactive cysteine, the kinetic parameters for the C. glabrata ORF was determined in the S. cerevisiae yct1Δ met15Δ strains thus eliminating any interference from the contaminating cysteine in the radioactive cystine supplied by ARC. We thus could get rid of the background given by the radioactive cysteine. Thus, when yct1Δmet15Δ strain was transformed with TEF-CgCYN1 a clear difference could be seen between the experimental transformant (yct1Δmet15Δ/TEF-CgCYN1) as opposed to the control transformant (yct1Δmet15Δ/TEF) (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2CgCYN1 expressed in S. cerevisiae met15Δyct1Δ strain leads to uptake of [35S]cystine. A, Sc met15Δyct1Δ strain was transformed with TEF-CgCYN1 (■) and with the corresponding vector control p416TEF (●). Transformants were grown in simple defined medium (1.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 20 g/liter glucose, 5 g/liter ammonium sulfate, and amino acid supplements at 70 mg/liter) containing 200 μm methionine, and log phase-grown cells were then harvested and used for the transport experiment as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data shown are the mean of three experiments, with each experiment done in duplicate. B, Michaelis-Menten curve for the cystine uptake mediated by CgCYN1 is shown. Sc met15Δyct1Δ strain was transformed with TEF-CgCYN1 and with the corresponding vector control p416TEF. Transformants were then grown in simple defined medium containing 200 μm methionine followed by harvesting log phase cells. The initial rate of cystine uptake was then measured at concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 160 μm (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μm) by harvesting cells after their incubation at different concentrations of cystine at two time points (1 and 2 min). Data are representative of three experiments. Kinetic parameters and statistical analysis were done by nonlinear regression analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots using Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the Km and the Vmax values for CgCYN1, S. cerevisiae yct1Δmet15Δ strain was again transformed with the cystine transporter CgCYN1 under the TEF promoter in S. cerevisiae yct1Δmet15Δ strain along with the vector control p416TEF. Substrate concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 160 μm were used for determining the kinetic parameters. The Km value of 18 ± 5 μm and a Vmax of 14 ± 4 nmol of cystine/mg of protein/min were found for the newly found cystine transporter. A Km value of 18 ± 5 μm suggests that the newly found cystine transporter is a high affinity cystine transporter (Fig. 2B). We have accordingly named ORF CAGL0M00154g as CYN1. To examine the substrate specificity of CgCYN1, the rate of uptake of cystine was measured in S. cerevisiae yct1Δmet15Δ strain transformed with CgCYN1 in the presence of different amino acids, cystine analogues, and various sulfur compounds. These inhibitors were added at >20-fold excess over the labeled substrate. The cells were harvested at 1- and 2-min intervals, and the results were normalized to the rate of uptake measured in the absence of any inhibitor. Among the various amino acids like glycine, glutamic acid, cysteine, homocysteine, methionine, leucine, proline, valine, phenylalanine, serine, glutamine, and lysine, none could inhibit the transport for cystine thus showing the specificity of CYN1 for cystine (Fig. 3A). Among the sulfur-containing compounds such as cysteamine hydrochloride, cystic acid, glutathione, cystathionine, and Cys-Cys dipeptide, only cystine and cystathionine could inhibit the transport (Fig. 3B). When one looks at the structure of these two compounds the structures are very similar and differ only in that the cystathionine has a single sulfur atom instead of two in cystine (Fig. 3E). Seeing the significant transport inhibition by cystathionine, the growth of Cgmet15Δcyn1Δ was checked on cystathionine, and we observed that Cgmet15Δ strain could utilize cystathionine as a sole source of sulfur in a CYN1-dependent manner (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4C. glabrata requires CgCYN1 to utilize cystathionine as a sole source of sulfur. Growth of C. glabrata met15Δcyn1Δ strain transformed with CgCYN1 under the PGK promoter of C. glabrata-specific vector pGRB2.2 (Cgmet15Δcyn1Δ/CgCYN1) and with the corresponding vector control plasmid pGRB2.2 (Cgmet15Δcyn1Δ/Vector) on 200 μm cystathionine and 200 μm methionine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the structural homologues to cystine, various compounds like 2,6-diamino pimelic acid, methionine sulfoxide, cystine dimethyl ester dihydrochloride, lanthionine, and selenocystine were taken for the competitive experiments at a 20-fold molar excess over the substrate, and it was found that only lanthionine and selenocystine could inhibit the transport by CgCYN1 (Fig. 3C). Structurally, selenocystine is like cystine where the sulfur atoms of cystine have been replaced with selenium in selenocystine, and lanthionine is more similar to cystathionine and differs in that it lacks one carbon atom compared with cystathionine (Fig. 3E). To determine whether the uptake of cystine by CgCYN1 is energy-dependent, metabolic inhibitors like sodium azide and carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone were used at 50 and 100 μm concentrations. A 15-min preincubation of these inhibitors with the transformants expressing the cystine transporter (Scyct1Δmet15Δ/TEF-CgCYN1) resulted in a considerable loss in the cystine uptake thus suggesting that cystine transport by CgCYN1 is energy mediated (Fig. 3D). The ability of CgCYN1 to take up cystine with high affinity from whole cells suggested that it was a plasma membrane transporter. To confirm this, CgCYN1 was tagged with a nine-amino acid HA tag at the C terminus and expressed from the constitutive PGK promoter in the C. glabrata vector pGRB2.2. The tagged protein was functional as seen by complementation in the Cgmet15Δcyn1Δ strain (supplemental Fig. 2). Indirect immunofluorescence was done using confocal microscopy as described under “Materials and Methods.” We observed a signal only on the plasma membrane (Fig. 5). No intracellular signal was seen in all cells. This confirmed that CgCYN1 is exclusively localized to the plasma membrane. We examined for the presence of CgCYN1 orthologues in the pathogenic yeast, H. capsulatum and C. albicans. In C. albicans ORF Ca019.9873 (similarity of 74% and identity of 57%) appeared as the putative orthologue. This ORF was cloned, and transformed in an S. cerevisiae met15Δ background. We observed that Ca019.9873 (CaCYN1) could complement in S. cerevisiae very effectively for growth on cystine (Fig. 6A). To further validate the role of C. albicans ORF Ca019.9873 in cystine transport we deleted this ORF in a met15Δ background of C. albicans and found that the deletion caused abrogation of growth on cystine. The residual growth seen on cystine plates is the result of only partial organic sulfur auxotrophy seen in C. albicans met15Δ strain (20Viaene J. Tiels P. Logghe M. Dewaele S. Martinet W. Contreras R. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1205-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and not a consequence of growth on cystine. This clearly indicated that ORF Ca019.9873 encodes for a functional cystine transporter in C. albicans (Fig. 6C). H. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus where cystine uptake has been seen in the yeast phase (4Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In H. capsulatum ORF HCAG_06385 appeared to be the orthologue of the C. glabrata CYN1 protein (identity of 56% and similarity of 73%). ORF HCAG_06385 contained two introns, so we custom synthesized the cDNA and expressed it downstream of the TEF promoter in p416TEF followed by transforming it in S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain. We observed that the ORF complemented for growth on cystine in S. cerevisiae, indicating that ORF HCAG_06385 of H. capsulatum is also a cystine transporter (Fig. 6B). Thus, it can be concluded that CgCYN1 has functional homologues in C. albicans and H. capsulatum (multiple sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 8B). S. cerevisiae lacks the ability to grow on cystine as described earlier and was thus likely to lack an orthologue of CgCYN1. The closest homologue of CgCYN1 in S. cerevisiae is LYP1 which is a lysine transporter (identity 37%). LYP1 is also a member of the AAP family whose orthologue exists in C. glabrata (CAGL0J08162g). When seeking the orthologue of CYN1 in the S. pombe genome, ORF SPCPB1C11.02 was picked up (having a identity of 41% and similarity of 62%). This also appeared to be the orthologue from reverse BLAST analysis. S. pombe also has a distinct lysine permease distinct from this ORF. To examine whether ORF SPCPB1C11.02 functioned as a cystine transporter we cloned and expressed this in S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain to see whether it could enable S. cerevisiae to utilize cystine. However, even when SPCPB1C11.02 was overexpressed under the TEF promoter and transformed in S. cerevisiae met15Δ strain, it could not confer growth on cystine (supplemental Fig. 3A). To eliminate the possibility that it might be a problem of heterologous expression, we examined the cys1aΔ strain of S. pombe which is a cysteine auxotroph (21Fujita Y. Takegawa K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for growth on cystine. We found that it could not grow on cystine even at high concentrations of cystine (600 μm), further confirming that S. pombe lacked a cystine transporter (supplemental Fig. 3B). The presence of cystine transporters in three pathogenic yeast species, and its absence among S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, prompted us to do a phylogenetic analysis of these transporters in different yeast and fungi. The lysine permease, LYP1 of S. cerevisiae, was the closest homologue of CgCYN1 in S. cerevisiae (37% identity, 57% similarity), and C. glabrata also contained a separate LYP1 orthologue. We therefore extracted the close homologues of CgCYN1 in different yeast and fungi, while also extracting the lysine permease homologues of these different species. When we look at the phylogenetic tree there seems to be clear distinction between the lysine transporters and the cystine transporters clusters (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the CgCYN1 orthologues appeared to be present among many Aspergillus species. These organism, like C. glabrata, also contained orthologues of the S. cerevisiae lysine permease, LYP1. S. pombe contained a LYP1 orthologue, but also contained an ORF SPCPB1C11.02 lying somewhere between these two clusters. However, this ORF did not appear to function as a cystine transporter as described above (Fig. 8). The work presented here describes a novel plasma membrane cystine transporter of yeast. The transporter belongs to a distinctly different family from that previously reported for cystine transporters of humans and bacteria. Humans have the heterodimeric Na+-independent cystine/glutamate transporter (system xc−) that mediates the uptake the cystine against the exchange of glutamate (22Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a second b0+ transporter that takes up cystine (or dibasic amino acids) against the efflux of neutral amino acids (23Feliubadaló L. Font M. Purroy J. Rousaud F. Estivill X. Nunes V. Golomb E. Centola M. Aksentijevich I. Kreiss Y. Goldman B. Pras M. Kastner D.L. Pras E. Gasparini P. Bisceglia L. Beccia E. Gallucci M. de Sanctis L.

Lloberas J. Zorzano A. Palacín M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The lysosomal cystine transporter of mammals, CTNS, which has functional homologues in the yeast vacuoles (ERS1) (24Gao X.D. Wang J. Keppler-Ross S. Dean N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2497-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is involved in H+-driven efflux of cystine from these organelles, also belongs to a separate family of transporters (LCT). Bacteria have both high and low affinity transporters of cystine, and most of them belong to the ABC uptake system. However, in Bacillus subtilis, out of three transporters transporting cystine (TcyP, TcyJKLMN, and TcyABC) TcyP belongs to the dicarboxylate amino acid cation symporter family. The existence of a pathway for cystine utilization in pathogenic yeast was not unexpected, considering that cystine is the most abundant sulfur compound in blood plasma. Cystine transport has been described in H. capsulatum 4 decades ago (4Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), but the gene was never identified. Cystine utilization has also been documented in dermatophytes like Microsporum gypseum (25Stahl W.H. McQue B. Arch. Biochem. 1949; 20: 422-432PubMed Google Scholar) which secrete sulfite that reduces the cystine in keratin (present in abundance in their ecological niche) to cysteine and S-sulfocysteine, which are then subsequently taken up following proteolysis (26Kunert J. Experientia. 1972; 28: 1025-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Kunert J. Z. Allg. Mikrobiol. 1976; 16: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Which of these or other pathways might operate in C. glabrata was not clear. The findings described here have revealed that a novel transporter was mediating the utilization in not only C. glabrata but also in C. albicans and H. capsulatum. The discovery thus also takes to a satisfying conclusion the observations made with H. capsulatum 40 years ago. There are two possible reasons that might have delayed the discovery of the identity of this transporter. The first is that much of the work on sulfur and amino acid transporters has focused on S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, and the transporter is lacking in these yeast species. A second reason might be due to the observation made in this work that the radioactive cystine had substantial levels of radioactive cysteine. It is possible that samples of radioactive cystine may sometimes carry this contamination with cysteine. However, as yeast species also carry transporters of cysteine, the identification of a cystine transporter can be masked or complicated in such a situation. In the present study we were greatly assisted in our studies by our use of the S. cerevisiae strain defective in high affinity cysteine uptake (yct1Δ). Using this strain has eliminated background cysteine uptake and has been a powerful aid to uncovering this cystine transporter from C. glabrata. Cystathionine, an intermediate in cysteine biosynthesis in yeast, was found to be a potent inhibitor of transport along with cystine, and when one looks at the structure of these two compounds the structures are very similar except that the cystathionine has a single sulfur atom instead of two in cystine (Fig. 3E). Cystathionine is also present at low levels in blood plasma (3Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, we observed that cystathionine could also be used efficiently as a sulfur source in this yeast. The only other two inhibitors were known cystine analogues, lanthionine and selenocystine, which indicates the high specificity of the transporter for cystine. No other amino acid, including cysteine or even lysine, could inhibit cysteine transport through this transporter. The Km of CgCYN1 for cystine was found to be 18 μm, a value very close to the value of 30 μm described for H. capsulatum many years ago (5Gilbert B.E. Howard D.H. Infect. Immun. 1970; 2: 139-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and close to the reported concentrations of cystine (50 μm) in the blood plasma (4Jones D.P. Carlson J.L. Mody V.C. Cai J. Lynn M.J. Sternberg P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Although bacterial cystine transporters have been reported of still higher affinity, the affinity of CgCYN1 is also reasonably high considering the fact that it is in the micromolar range and thus it would be adequate for this transporter to be effective in vivo. Because C. glabrata lacks a glutathione transporter and relies solely on the endogenous production of glutathione for its survival (3Yadav A.K. Desai P.R. Rai M.N. Kaur R. Ganesan K. Bachhawat A.K. Microbiology. 2011; 157: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) the presence of a cystine transporter would be important for the cell not only for meeting the cysteine requirements, but also to meet the glutathione requirements, because cysteine is rate-limiting for glutathione synthesis in vivo. Increased glutathione requirements become very crucial under the conditions of stress as survival in the host is in itself a stress for the pathogen. CYN1 orthologues were absent in S. cerevisiae, and despite an apparent orthologue in S. pombe, there was no cystine transporter in the fission yeast as well. In contrast, cystine transporters seem to have been acquired by a large number of pathogenic yeast, with orthologues also appearing to be present in many aspergilli. Whether the presence of this gene actually leads to a defect in virulence in these organisms, however, remains to be established. Nevertheless, the acquisition of a new gene (CYN1) in an otherwise slimmer C. glabrata genome (C. glabrata has 398 membrane proteins whereas S. cerevisiae has 502 membrane proteins) (28De Hertogh B. Hancy F. Goffeau A. Baret P.V. Genetics. 2006; 172: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the prevalence of this transporter among pathogenic yeast and fungi seem to suggest that it may play an important role in their in vivo survival.
