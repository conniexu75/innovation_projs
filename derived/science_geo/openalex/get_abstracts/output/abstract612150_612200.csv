https://openalex.org/W2805712258,"Although plasma proteins have important roles in biological processes and are the direct targets of many drugs, the genetic factors that control inter-individual variation in plasma protein levels are not well understood. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome in healthy blood donors from the INTERVAL study. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a fourfold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand the consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we apply an integrated approach that links genetic variation with biological pathway, disease, and drug databases. We show that protein quantitative trait loci overlap with gene expression quantitative trait loci, as well as with disease-associated loci, and find evidence that protein biomarkers have causal roles in disease using Mendelian randomization analysis. By linking genetic factors to diseases via specific proteins, our analyses highlight potential therapeutic targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development. A genetic atlas of the human plasma proteome, comprising 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, identifies causes of disease and potential drug targets."

https://openalex.org/W2806741586,"Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) are ubiquitous, are formed in many inflammatory tissues, including atherosclerotic lesions, and frequently mediate proinflammatory changes 1 . Because OxPL are mostly the products of non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation, mechanisms to specifically neutralize them are unavailable and their roles in vivo are largely unknown. We previously cloned the IgM natural antibody E06, which binds to the phosphocholine headgroup of OxPL, and blocks the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) by macrophages and inhibits the proinflammatory properties of OxPL2-4. Here, to determine the role of OxPL in vivo in the context of atherogenesis, we generated transgenic mice in the Ldlr-/- background that expressed a single-chain variable fragment of E06 (E06-scFv) using the Apoe promoter. E06-scFv was secreted into the plasma from the liver and macrophages, and achieved sufficient plasma levels to inhibit in vivo macrophage uptake of OxLDL and to prevent OxPL-induced inflammatory signalling. Compared to Ldlr-/- mice, Ldlr -/- E06-scFv mice had 57-28% less atherosclerosis after 4, 7 and even 12 months of 1% high-cholesterol diet. Echocardiographic and histologic evaluation of the aortic valves demonstrated that E06-scFv ameliorated the development of aortic valve gradients and decreased aortic valve calcification. Both cholesterol accumulation and in vivo uptake of OxLDL were decreased in peritoneal macrophages, and both peritoneal and aortic macrophages had a decreased inflammatory phenotype. Serum amyloid A was decreased by 32%, indicating decreased systemic inflammation, and hepatic steatosis and inflammation were also decreased. Finally, the E06-scFv prolonged life as measured over 15 months. Because the E06-scFv lacks the functional effects of an intact antibody other than the ability to bind OxPL and inhibit OxLDL uptake in macrophages, these data support a major proatherogenic role of OxLDL and demonstrate that OxPL are proinflammatory and proatherogenic, which E06 counteracts in vivo. These studies suggest that therapies inactivating OxPL may be beneficial for reducing generalized inflammation, including the progression of atherosclerosis, aortic stenosis and hepatic steatosis."

https://openalex.org/W2805753824,"During our daily life, we depend on memories of past experiences to plan future behaviour. These memories are represented by the activity of specific neuronal groups or 'engrams'1,2. Neuronal engrams are assembled during learning by synaptic modification, and engram reactivation represents the memorized experience 1 . Engrams of conscious memories are initially stored in the hippocampus for several days and then transferred to cortical areas 2 . In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, granule cells transform rich inputs from the entorhinal cortex into a sparse output, which is forwarded to the highly interconnected pyramidal cell network in hippocampal area CA3 3 . This process is thought to support pattern separation 4 (but see refs. 5,6). CA3 pyramidal neurons project to CA1, the hippocampal output region. Consistent with the idea of transient memory storage in the hippocampus, engrams in CA1 and CA2 do not stabilize over time7-10. Nevertheless, reactivation of engrams in the dentate gyrus can induce recall of artificial memories even after weeks 2 . Reconciliation of this apparent paradox will require recordings from dentate gyrus granule cells throughout learning, which has so far not been performed for more than a single day6,11,12. Here, we use chronic two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice performing a multiple-day spatial memory task in a virtual environment to record neuronal activity in all major hippocampal subfields. Whereas pyramidal neurons in CA1-CA3 show precise and highly context-specific, but continuously changing, representations of the learned spatial sceneries in our behavioural paradigm, granule cells in the dentate gyrus have a spatial code that is stable over many days, with low place- or context-specificity. Our results suggest that synaptic weights along the hippocampal trisynaptic loop are constantly reassigned to support the formation of dynamic representations in downstream hippocampal areas based on a stable code provided by the dentate gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W2805201605,"Explaining the large-scale diversity of soil organisms that drive biogeochemical processes—and their responses to environmental change—is critical. However, identifying consistent drivers of belowground diversity and abundance for some soil organisms at large spatial scales remains problematic. Here we investigate a major guild, the ectomycorrhizal fungi, across European forests at a spatial scale and resolution that is—to our knowledge—unprecedented, to explore key biotic and abiotic predictors of ectomycorrhizal diversity and to identify dominant responses and thresholds for change across complex environmental gradients. We show the effect of 38 host, environment, climate and geographical variables on ectomycorrhizal diversity, and define thresholds of community change for key variables. We quantify host specificity and reveal plasticity in functional traits involved in soil foraging across gradients. We conclude that environmental and host factors explain most of the variation in ectomycorrhizal diversity, that the environmental thresholds used as major ecosystem assessment tools need adjustment and that the importance of belowground specificity and plasticity has previously been underappreciated. Analyses of data from 137 forest plots across 20 European countries show that ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity is strongly influenced by environmental and host species factors and provide thresholds to inform ecosystem assessment tools"

https://openalex.org/W2805565876,"Adaptation of organisms to environmental niches is a hallmark of evolution. One prevalent example is that of thermal adaptation, in which two descendants evolve at different temperature extremes1,2. Underlying the physiological differences between such organisms are changes in enzymes that catalyse essential reactions 3 , with orthologues from each organism undergoing adaptive mutations that preserve similar catalytic rates at their respective physiological temperatures4,5. The sequence changes responsible for these adaptive differences, however, are often at surface-exposed sites distant from the substrate-binding site, leaving the active site of the enzyme structurally unperturbed6,7. How such changes are allosterically propagated to the active site, to modulate activity, is not known. Here we show that entropy-tuning changes can be engineered into distal sites of Escherichia coli adenylate kinase, allowing us to quantitatively assess the role of dynamics in determining affinity, turnover and the role in driving adaptation. The results not only reveal a dynamics-based allosteric tuning mechanism, but also uncover a spatial separation of the control of key enzymatic parameters. Fluctuations in one mobile domain (the LID) control substrate affinity, whereas dynamic attenuation in the other domain (the AMP-binding domain) affects rate-limiting conformational changes that govern enzyme turnover. Dynamics-based regulation may thus represent an elegant, widespread and previously unrealized evolutionary adaptation mechanism that fine-tunes biological function without altering the ground state structure. Furthermore, because rigid-body conformational changes in both domains were thought to be rate limiting for turnover8,9, these adaptation studies reveal a new model for understanding the relationship between dynamics and turnover in adenylate kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2805831922,"Patients with metastatic cancer experience a severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function known as cachexia. Cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and accelerated death in patients with cancer, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the metal-ion transporter ZRT- and IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14) as a critical mediator of cancer-induced cachexia. ZIP14 is upregulated in cachectic muscles of mice and in patients with metastatic cancer and can be induced by TNF-α and TGF-β cytokines. Strikingly, germline ablation or muscle-specific depletion of Zip14 markedly reduces muscle atrophy in metastatic cancer models. We find that ZIP14-mediated zinc uptake in muscle progenitor cells represses the expression of MyoD and Mef2c and blocks muscle-cell differentiation. Importantly, ZIP14-mediated zinc accumulation in differentiated muscle cells induces myosin heavy chain loss. These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for altered zinc homeostasis in metastatic cancer-induced muscle wasting and implicate ZIP14 as a therapeutic target for its treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2806810493,"The United Nations’ Paris Agreement includes the aim of pursuing efforts to limit global warming to only 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. However, it is not clear what the resulting climate would look like across the globe and over time. Here we show that trajectories towards a ‘1.5 °C warmer world’ may result in vastly different outcomes at regional scales, owing to variations in the pace and location of climate change and their interactions with society’s mitigation, adaptation and vulnerabilities to climate change. Pursuing policies that are considered to be consistent with the 1.5 °C aim will not completely remove the risk of global temperatures being much higher or of some regional extremes reaching dangerous levels for ecosystems and societies over the coming decades. The results of efforts to limit global mean warming to below 1.5 °C may include many possible future world climates."
https://openalex.org/W2807674850,"Mammalian cells integrate mitogen and stress signalling before the end of G1 phase to determine whether or not they enter the cell cycle1–4. Before cells can replicate their DNA in S phase, they have to activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), induce an E2F transcription program and inactivate the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/CCDH1, also known as the cyclosome), which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains the co-activator CDH1 (also known as FZR, encoded by FZR1). It was recently shown that stress can return cells to quiescence after CDK2 activation and E2F induction but not after inactivation of APC/CCDH1, which suggests that APC/CCDH1 inactivation is the point of no return for cell-cycle entry 3 . Rapid inactivation of APC/CCDH1 requires early mitotic inhibitor 1 (EMI1)3,5, but the molecular mechanism that controls this cell-cycle commitment step is unknown. Here we show using human cell models that cell-cycle commitment is mediated by an EMI1–APC/CCDH1 dual-negative feedback switch, in which EMI1 is both a substrate and an inhibitor of APC/CCDH1. The inactivation switch triggers a transition between a state with low EMI1 levels and high APC/CCDH1 activity during G1 and a state with high EMI1 levels and low APC/CCDH1 activity during S and G2. Cell-based analysis, in vitro reconstitution and modelling data show that the underlying dual-negative feedback is bistable and represents a robust irreversible switch. Our study suggests that mammalian cells commit to the cell cycle by increasing CDK2 activity and EMI1 mRNA expression to trigger a one-way APC/CCDH1 inactivation switch that is mediated by EMI1 transitioning from acting as a substrate of APC/CCDH1 to being an inhibitor of APC/CCDH1. The transition between early mitotic inhibitor 1 acting as a substrate of the APC/C and as an inhibitor of the same complex results in an irreversible switch that mediates human cell-cycle commitment."
https://openalex.org/W2805888792,"The antiviral cGMP–AMP (cGAMP)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is well characterized in mammalian cells. However, whether this pathway also plays a role in insect antiviral immunity is unknown. In this study, we found that cGAMP is produced in silkworm (Bombyx mori) cells infected with nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). In searches for STING-related sequences, we identified BmSTING, a potential cGAMP sensor in B. mori. We observed that BmSTING overexpression effectively inhibits NPV replication in silkworm larvae, whereas dsRNA-mediated BmSTING knockdown resulted in higher viral load. Cleavage and nuclear translocation of BmRelish, a NF-κB–related transcription factor, was also observed when BmSTING was overexpressed and was enhanced by cGAMP stimulation or viral infection of B. mori larvae. Moreover, we identified a caspase-8–like protein (BmCasp8L) as a BmSTING-interacting molecule and as a suppressor of BmSTING-mediated BmRelish activation. Interestingly, cGAMP stimulation decreased BmCasp8L binding to BmSTING and increased BmRelish activity. Of note, an interaction between death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like caspase (BmDredd) and BmSTING promoted BmRelish cleavage for efficient antiviral signaling and protection of insect cells from viral infection. Our findings have uncovered BmSTING as a critical mediator of antiviral immunity in the model insect B. mori and have identified several BmSTING-interacting proteins that control antiviral defenses."

https://openalex.org/W2805437817,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established primary treatment for newly diagnosed brain metastases with high local control rates. However, data about local re-irradiation in case of local failure after SRS (re-SRS) are rare. We evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and patient selection characteristics in treating locally recurrent metastases with a second course of SRS.We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases treated with re-SRS for local tumor progression between 2011 and 2017. Patient and treatment characteristics as well as rates of tumor control, survival and toxicity were analyzed.Overall, 32 locally recurrent brain metastases in 31 patients were irradiated with re-SRS. Median age at re-SRS was 64.9 years. The primary histology was breast cancer and non-small-cellular lung cancer (NSCLC) in respectively 10 cases (31.3%), in 5 cases malignant melanoma (15.6%). In the first SRS-course 19 metastases (59.4%) and in the re-SRS-course 29 metastases (90.6%) were treated with CyberKnife® and the others with Gamma Knife. Median planning target volume (PTV) for re-SRS was 2.5 cm3 (range, 0.1-37.5 cm3) and median dose prescribed to the PTV was 19 Gy (range, 12-28 Gy) in 1-5 fractions to the median 69% isodose (range, 53-80%). The 1-year overall survival rate was 61.7% and the 1-year local control rate was 79.5%. The overall rate of radiological radio-necrosis was 16.1% and four patients (12.9%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicities.A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases after prior local SRS appears to be feasible with acceptable toxicity and can be considered as salvage treatment option for selected patients with high performance status. Furthermore, this is the first study utilizing robotic radiosurgery for this indication, as an additional option for frameless fractionated treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2807097573,"Most language users agree that some words sound harsh (e.g. grotesque) whereas others sound soft and pleasing (e.g. lagoon). While this prominent feature of human language has always been creatively deployed in art and poetry, it is still largely unknown whether the sound of a word in itself makes any contribution to the word's meaning as perceived and interpreted by the listener. In a large-scale lexicon analysis, we focused on the affective substrates of words' meaning (i.e. affective meaning) and words' sound (i.e. affective sound); both being measured on a two-dimensional space of valence (ranging from pleasant to unpleasant) and arousal (ranging from calm to excited). We tested the hypothesis that the sound of a word possesses affective iconic characteristics that can implicitly influence listeners when evaluating the affective meaning of that word. The results show that a significant portion of the variance in affective meaning ratings of printed words depends on a number of spectral and temporal acoustic features extracted from these words after converting them to their spoken form (study1). In order to test the affective nature of this effect, we independently assessed the affective sound of these words using two different methods: through direct rating (study2a), and through acoustic models that we implemented based on pseudoword materials (study2b). In line with our hypothesis, the estimated contribution of words' sound to ratings of words' affective meaning was indeed associated with the affective sound of these words; with a stronger effect for arousal than for valence. Further analyses revealed crucial phonetic features potentially causing the effect of sound on meaning: For instance, words with short vowels, voiceless consonants, and hissing sibilants (as in 'piss') feel more arousing and negative. Our findings suggest that the process of meaning making is not solely determined by arbitrary mappings between formal aspects of words and concepts they refer to. Rather, even in silent reading, words' acoustic profiles provide affective perceptual cues that language users may implicitly use to construct words' overall meaning."
https://openalex.org/W2807037447,"Identification of risk factors of treatment resistance may be useful to guide treatment selection, avoid inefficient trial-and-error, and improve major depressive disorder (MDD) care. We extended the work in predictive modeling of treatment resistant depression (TRD) via partition of the data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) cohort into a training and a testing dataset. We also included data from a small yet completely independent cohort RIS-INT-93 as an external test dataset. We used features from enrollment and level 1 treatment (up to week 2 response only) of STAR*D to explore the feature space comprehensively and applied machine learning methods to model TRD outcome at level 2. For TRD defined using QIDS-C16 remission criteria, multiple machine learning models were internally cross-validated in the STAR*D training dataset and externally validated in both the STAR*D testing dataset and RIS-INT-93 independent dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70-0.78 and 0.72-0.77, respectively. The upper bound for the AUC achievable with the full set of features could be as high as 0.78 in the STAR*D testing dataset. Model developed using top 30 features identified using feature selection technique (k-means clustering followed by χ2 test) achieved an AUC of 0.77 in the STAR*D testing dataset. In addition, the model developed using overlapping features between STAR*D and RIS-INT-93, achieved an AUC of > 0.70 in both the STAR*D testing and RIS-INT-93 datasets. Among all the features explored in STAR*D and RIS-INT-93 datasets, the most important feature was early or initial treatment response or symptom severity at week 2. These results indicate that prediction of TRD prior to undergoing a second round of antidepressant treatment could be feasible even in the absence of biomarker data."
https://openalex.org/W2806332444,"The role of the subthalamic nucleus in human locomotion is unclear although relevant, given the troublesome management of gait disturbances with subthalamic deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. We investigated the subthalamic activity and inter-hemispheric connectivity during walking in eight freely-moving subjects with Parkinson's disease and bilateral deep brain stimulation. In particular, we compared the subthalamic power spectral densities and coherence, amplitude cross-correlation and phase locking value between resting state, upright standing, and steady forward walking. We observed a phase locking value drop in the β-frequency band (≈13-35Hz) during walking with respect to resting and standing. This modulation was not accompanied by specific changes in subthalamic power spectral densities, which was not related to gait phases or to striatal dopamine loss measured with [123I]N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane and single-photon computed tomography. We speculate that the subthalamic inter-hemispheric desynchronization in the β-frequency band reflects the information processing of each body side separately, which may support linear walking. This study also suggests that in some cases (i.e. gait) the brain signal, which could allow feedback-controlled stimulation, might derive from network activity."
https://openalex.org/W2950587369,"High-resolution (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) enables researchers to study how anatomical and functional properties change within the cortical ribbon, along surfaces and across cortical depths. These studies require an accurate delineation of the gray matter ribbon, which often suffers from inclusion of blood vessels, dura mater and other non-brain tissue. Residual segmentation errors are commonly corrected by browsing the data slice-by-slice and manually changing labels. This task becomes increasingly laborious and prone to error at higher resolutions since both work and error scale with the number of voxels. Here we show that many mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations as an additional post-processing step aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations openly available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data."
https://openalex.org/W2806667179,"The aim of this study is to investigate livestock husbandry and its relationship to the mobilization of domestic animals for slaughter at large communal feasting events, in Late Neolithic Makriyalos, northern Greece. A multi-isotope approach is built that integrates analysis of: δ13C and δ15N values of human and animal bone collagen for understanding long-term dietary behavior, Incremental δ13C and δ18O values of domestic animal tooth enamel carbonate for assessing seasonal patterns in grazing habits and mobility, and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of cattle tooth enamel for examining the possibility that some of the animals consumed at the site were born outside the local environment. The findings indicate that cattle had isotopically more variable diets than sheep, which may reflect grazing over a wider catchment area in the local landscape. Cattle products did not make a significant contribution to the long-term dietary protein intake of the humans, which may indicate that they were primarily consumed during episodic feasting events. There is no indication that pasturing of livestock was pre-determined by their eventual context of slaughter (i.e. large-scale feasting vs. more routine consumption events). Two non-local cattle identified among those deposited in a feasting context may have been brought to the site as contributions to these feasts. The evidence presented provides a more detailed insight into local land use and into the role of livestock and feasting in forging social relationships within the regional human population."

We evaluated the effect of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on prognosis according to post-operative recurrence imaging patterns. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 42 cHCC-CC and 59 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-control) patients at the Asan Medical Center. We classified recurrent cHCC-CC according to enhancement pattern (globally enhancing: GE cHCC-CC, peripherally enhancing: PE cHCC-CC) and evaluated tumor response, time-to-local progression (TTPlocal), and overall survival (OS). Results The GE cHCC-CC group had a significantly higher best objective response rate (complete remission + partial response) than the PE cHCC-CC group (36% vs 0%, P = 0.005), and it was comparable to that of the HCC-control group (35.6%, P = 0.97). TTPlocal in the GE cHCC-CC group was significantly shorter than in the HCC-control group (6.6 vs 27.1 months, P < 0.001), and was not significantly different from that in the PE cHCC-CC group (5.3 months, P = 0.12). OS was 12.4 months, 52.8 months, and 67.5 months in the PE cHCC-CC, GE cHCC-CC, and HCC-control groups, respectively (Ps < 0.05). The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for TTPlocal and OS revealed an independent association with enhancement pattern of recurrent cHCC-CC (TTPlocal: HR 2.46; 95% CI 1.10–5.46; P = 0.03; OS: HR 5.97; 95% CI 2.38–14.96; P < 0.001). Conclusions The GE cHCC-CC group showed better response and prognosis after TACE than the PE cHCC-CC group, but poorer response and prognosis than the HCC-control group. Enhancement patterns at recurrence were crucially associated with tumor response and overall survival."

Air monitoring samples from indoor and outdoor environments were collected from January to December in 2007. Statistical analyses of indoor and outdoor VOCs and HCHO levels in three rooms (a bedroom, living, and dining rooms) of each ECC were performed, and these were compared to identify environmental factors associated with an increase of indoor pollution levels. Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) levels were significantly (p<0.05) different between indoor (230.7±1.7 μg/m3) and outdoor (137.8±1.9 μg/m3) environments, with an I/O ratio of 1.67. The indoor HCHO level (20.1±1.6 μg/m3) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than the outdoor level (8.1±1.9 μg/m3), with an I/O ratio of 2.48. Indoor VOCs and HCHO levels in the bedrooms were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those in the living and dining rooms. Furthermore, indoor levels of VOCs and HCHO at ECCs were significantly (p<0.05) different depending on environmental factors such as the use of carpet, paint, and wooden furniture. In multiple regression analysis, indoor VOCs and HCHO levels at ECCs were significantly (p<0.05) correlated with two micro-environmental factors: the use of carpet and paint. This study confirmed that indoor VOCs and HCHO levels were significantly higher than those in outdoor environments. These air pollutants were mainly emitted from indoor sources, such as carpet, paint, and construction materials at the ECCs in Korea."
https://openalex.org/W2806681314,"While the impacts of extreme and rising mean temperatures are well documented, increased thermal variability associated with climate change may also threaten ectotherm fitness and survival, but remains poorly explored. Using three wild collected coprophagic species Copris elphenor, Metacatharsius opacus and Scarabaeus zambezianus, we explored the effects of thermal amplitude around the mean on thermal tolerance. Using standardized protocols, we measured traits of high- (critical thermal maxima [CTmax] and heat knockdown time [HKDT]) and -low temperature tolerance (critical thermal minima [CTmin], chill coma recovery time [CCRT] and supercooling points [SCPs]) following variable temperature pulses (δ0, δ3, δ6 and δ9°C) around the mean (27°C). Our results show that increased temperature variability may offset basal and plastic responses to temperature and differs across species and metrics tested. Furthermore, we also show differential effects of body mass, body water content (BWC) and body lipid content (BLC) on traits of thermal tolerance. For example, body mass significantly influenced C. elphenor and S. zambezianus CTmax and S. zambezianus HKDT but not CTmin and CCRT. BWC significantly affected M. opacus and C. elphenor CTmax and in only M. opacus HKDT, CTmin and CCRT. Similarly, BLC only had a significant effect for M opacus CTmin. These results suggest differential and species dependent effects of climate variability of thermal fitness traits. It is therefore likely that the ecological services provided by these species may be constrained in the face of climate change. This implies that, to develop more realistic predictions for the effects of climate change on insect biodiversity and ecosystem function, thermal variability is a significant determinant."

https://openalex.org/W2805307820,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of cysts, leading to a decline in function and renal failure that cannot be prevented by current treatments. Mutations in pkd1 and pkd2, encoding the polycystin 1 and 2 proteins, induce growth-related pathways, including heat shock proteins, as occurs in some cancers, raising the prospect that pharmacological interventions that target these pathways might alleviate or prevent ADPKD. Here, we demonstrate a role for VX-809, a corrector of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), conventionally used to manage cystic fibrosis in reducing renal cyst growth. VX-809 reduced cyst growth in Pkd1-knockout mice and in proximal, tubule-derived, cultured Pkd1 knockout cells. VX-809 reduced both basal and forskolin-activated cAMP levels and also decreased the expression of the adenylyl cyclase AC3 but not of AC6. VX-809 also decreased resting levels of intracellular Ca2+ but did not affect ATP-stimulated Ca2+ release. Notably, VX-809 dramatically decreased thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). VX-809 also reduced the levels of heat shock proteins Hsp27, Hsp70, and Hsp90 in mice cystic kidneys, consistent with the restoration of cellular proteostasis. Moreover, VX-809 strongly decreased an ER stress marker, the GADD153 protein, and cell proliferation but had only a small effect on apoptosis. Given that administration of VX-809 is safe, this drug potentially offers a new way to treat patients with ADPKD. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with progressive enlargement of cysts, leading to a decline in function and renal failure that cannot be prevented by current treatments. Mutations in pkd1 and pkd2, encoding the polycystin 1 and 2 proteins, induce growth-related pathways, including heat shock proteins, as occurs in some cancers, raising the prospect that pharmacological interventions that target these pathways might alleviate or prevent ADPKD. Here, we demonstrate a role for VX-809, a corrector of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), conventionally used to manage cystic fibrosis in reducing renal cyst growth. VX-809 reduced cyst growth in Pkd1-knockout mice and in proximal, tubule-derived, cultured Pkd1 knockout cells. VX-809 reduced both basal and forskolin-activated cAMP levels and also decreased the expression of the adenylyl cyclase AC3 but not of AC6. VX-809 also decreased resting levels of intracellular Ca2+ but did not affect ATP-stimulated Ca2+ release. Notably, VX-809 dramatically decreased thapsigargin-induced release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

https://openalex.org/W2806874206,"Muscle loss at high altitude (HA) is attributable to energy deficit and a potential dysregulation of anabolic signaling. Exercise and protein ingestion can attenuate the effects of energy deficit on muscle at sea level (SL). Whether these effects are observed when energy deficit occurs at HA is unknown. To address this, muscle obtained from lowlanders (n = 8 males) at SL, acute HA (3 h, 4300 m), and chronic HA (21 d, -1766 kcal/d energy balance) before [baseline (Base)] and after 80 min of aerobic exercise followed by a 2-mile time trial [postexercise (Post)] and 3 h into recovery (Rec) after ingesting whey protein (25 g) were analyzed using standard molecular techniques. At SL, Post, and REC, p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)Ser2448, p-p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K)Ser424/421, and p-ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6)Ser235/236 were similar and higher (P < 0.05) than Base. At acute HA, Post p-mTORSer2448 and Post and REC p-p70S6KSer424/421 were not different from Base and lower than SL (P < 0.05). At chronic HA, Post and Rec p-mTORSer2448 and p-p70S6KSer424/421 were not different from Base and lower than SL, and, independent of time, p-rpS6Ser235/236 was lower than SL (P < 0.05). Post proteasome activity was lower (P < 0.05) than Base and Rec, independent of phase. Our findings suggest that HA exposure induces muscle anabolic resistance that is exacerbated by energy deficit during acclimatization, with no change in proteolysis.—Margolis, L. M., Carbone, J.

https://openalex.org/W2807164010,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can non-invasively assess muscle anatomy, exercise effects and pathologies with different underlying causes such as neuromuscular diseases (NMD). Quantitative MRI including fat fraction mapping using chemical shift encoding-based water-fat MRI has emerged for reliable determination of muscle volume and fat composition. The data analysis of water-fat images requires segmentation of the different muscles which has been mainly performed manually in the past and is a very time consuming process, currently limiting the clinical applicability. An automatization of the segmentation process would lead to a more time-efficient analysis. In the present work, the manually segmented thigh magnetic resonance imaging database MyoSegmenTUM is presented. It hosts water-fat MR images of both thighs of 15 healthy subjects and 4 patients with NMD with a voxel size of 3.2x2x4 mm3 with the corresponding segmentation masks for four functional muscle groups: quadriceps femoris, sartorius, gracilis, hamstrings. The database is freely accessible online at https://osf.io/svwa7/?view_only=c2c980c17b3a40fca35d088a3cdd83e2. The database is mainly meant as ground truth which can be used as training and test dataset for automatic muscle segmentation algorithms. The segmentation allows extraction of muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and volume. Proton density fat fraction (PDFF) of the defined muscle groups from the corresponding images and quadriceps muscle strength measurements/neurological muscle strength rating can be used for benchmarking purposes."

It was hypothesized that CTLA-4 blockade may enhance immune response to HIV-1 and result in better control of viremia. This open-label, multiple ascending dose study (NCT03407105)—the first to examine ipilimumab in participants with HIV-1 infection—assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab, as well as whether ipilimumab enhanced immune response to HIV-1 and improved control of viremia. Twenty-four participants received 2 or 4 doses of ipilimumab (0.1, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg) every 28 days. No serious adverse events (AEs) or dose-limiting toxicities were reported; one participant discontinued ipilimumab for an AE of grade 2 facial palsy. Twenty participants (83.3%) had ≥1 AE; all but 1 were grade 1 or 2. Eight participants (33.3%) had potentially immune-related AEs (7 had grade 1 diarrhea not requiring corticosteroids; 1 who had diarrhea also had transient antinuclear antibody positivity; 1 had grade 2 facial palsy requiring corticosteroids). Two participants (8.3%), one each in the 0.1- and 1-mg/kg dose groups, had a decrease from baseline HIV-1 RNA of 0.85 and 1.36 log10 copies/mL. Fourteen participants (58.3%) had an increase from baseline HIV-1 RNA (mean, 0.87 log10 copies/mL; range, 0.59–1.29). Of these 14 participants, all but 1 were in the higher ipilimumab dose groups (3 or 5 mg/kg). No pattern was noted regarding change from baseline in CD4 or CD8 T cells; ex vivo assessments of immune response were precluded because of inadequate cell viability. Serum concentration data for ipilimumab showed biphasic disposition, with steady state reached by dose 3. Ipilimumab treatment was well tolerated and was associated with variations in HIV-1 RNA in excess of expected repeat measures in most participants, but these were not related to combination antiretroviral therapy status or CD4 counts. The mechanism(s) underlying the increased variation in HIV-1 RNA is unclear and needs further study."
https://openalex.org/W2805086140,"The smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena, is a cosmopolitan semipelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic oceanic fisheries, especially pelagic longlines targeting swordfish and/or tunas. From 2012 to 2016, eight smooth hammerheads were tagged with Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags in the inter-tropical region of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, with successful transmissions received from seven tags (total of 319 tracking days). Results confirmed the smooth hammerhead is a highly mobile species, as the longest migration ever documented for this species (> 6600 km) was recorded. An absence of a diel vertical movement behavior was noted, with the sharks spending most of their time at surface waters (0-50 m) above 23°C. The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders, and the overlap with the species vertical distribution was calculated. The overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles (~40% of overlap time). The novel information presented can now be used to contribute to the provision of sustainable management tools and serve as input for Ecological Risk Assessments for smooth hammerheads caught in Atlantic pelagic longline fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2805928765,"Genetic variants at three quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fetal haemoglobin (HbF), BCL11A, HBS1L-MYB and the β-globin gene cluster, have attracted interest as potential targets of therapeutic strategies for HbF reactivation in sickle cell anaemia (SCA). We carried out the first systematic evaluation of critical single nucleotide polymorphisms at these disease modifier loci in Nigerian patients with SCA. Common variants for BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB were strongly associated with HbF levels. At both loci, secondary association signals were detected, illustrating the mapping resolution attainable in this population. For BCL11A, the two independent sites of association were represented by rs1427407 (primary site, p = 7.0 x 10(-10)) and rs6545816 (secondary site, conditioned on rs1427407: p = 0.02) and for HBS1L-MYB by rs9402686 (HMIP-2B, p = 1.23 x 10(-4)) and rs66650371 (HMIP-2A, p = 0.002). Haplotype analysis revealed similarities in the genetic architecture of BCL11A and HBS1L-MYB in Nigerian patients. Variants at both loci also alleviated anaemia. The variant allele for the γ globin gene promoter polymorphism XmnI-HBG2 was too infrequent in our patients to be evaluated in this relatively small study. Studying the large and diverse SCA patient populations in African countries such as Nigeria will be key for a clearer understanding of how these loci work and for the discovery of new disease modifier genes."
https://openalex.org/W2806710143,"Introduction Despite remarkable progress in maternal and neonatal health over past two decades, maternal and neonatal mortality in Bangladesh remain high, which is partially attributable to low use of skilled maternal and newborn health (MNH) services. Birth preparedness and complications readiness (BCPR) is recommended by the World Health Organization and by the Government of Bangladesh as a key intervention to increasing appropriate MNH services. This study aims to explore the status of BPCR in a hard-to-reach area of rural Bangladesh and to demonstrate how BPCR practices is associated with birth in the presence of a skilled birth attendant. Methods Data was collected using multistage cluster sampling-based household survey in two sub-districts of Netrokona, Bangladesh in 2014. Interviews were conducted among women with a recent birth history in 12-months and their husbands. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable analysis using Stata 14.0 were performed from 317 couples. Results Mean age of respondents was 26.1 (SD ± 5.3) years. There was a significant difference in BPCR practice between women and couples for identification of the place of birth (84% vs. 75%), identification of a birth attendant (89% vs.72%), arranging transport for birth or emergencies (20% vs. 13%), and identification of a blood donor (15% vs. 8%). In multivariable analysis, odds of giving birth in presence of a skilled birth attendant consistently increased with higher completeness of preparedness (OR 3.3 for 3–5 BPCR components, OR 5.5 for 4–5 BPCR components, OR 10.4 for all 5 BPCR components). For different levels of completeness of BPCR practice, the adjusted odds ratios were higher for couple preparedness comparatively. Conclusions BPCR is associated with birth in the presence of a skilled attendant and this effect is magnified when planning is carried out by the couple. Interventions aiming to increase BPCR practices should not focus on women only, as involving the couple is most likely lead to positive care-seeking practices."
https://openalex.org/W2806824946,"Rotavirus (RV) causes significant morbidity and mortality in developing countries, where children and infants are highly susceptible to severe disease symptoms. While live attenuated vaccines are available, reduced vaccine efficacy in developing countries illustrates the need for highly immunogenic alternative vaccines. Here, we studied the possible inactivation of RV using gamma(γ)-irradiation, and assessed the sterility and immunogenicity of γ-irradiated RV (γ-RV) as a novel vaccine candidate. Interestingly, the inactivation curve of RV did not show a log-linear regression following exposure to increased doses of γ-rays, and consequently the radiation dose required to achieve the internationally accepted Sterility Assurance Level could not be calculated. Nonetheless, we performed sterility testing based on serial passages of γ-RV, and our data clearly illustrate the lack of infectivity of γ-RV preparations irradiated with 50 kGy. In addition, we tested the immunogenicity of 50 kGy γ-RV in mice and our data illustrate the induction of strong RV-specific neutralising antibody responses following administration of γ-RV without using adjuvant. Therefore, whilst γ-RV may not constitute a replacement for current RV vaccines, this study represents a proof-of-concept that γ-irradiation can be applied to inactivate RV for vaccine purposes. Further investigation will be required to address whether γ-irradiation can be applied to improve safety and efficacy of existing live attenuated vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2805114969,"Intrinsic and acquired resistance to current HER2 targeted therapies remains a challenge in clinics. We have developed a therapeutic HER2 siRNA delivered using mesoporous silica nanoparticles modified with polymers and conjugated with HER2 targeting antibodies. Our previous studies have shown that our HER2 siRNA nanoparticles could overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to trastuzumab and lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancers. In this study, we investigated the effect of long-term (7 months) treatment using our therapeutic HER2 siRNA. Even after the removal of HER2 siRNA, the long-term treated cells grew much slower (67% increase in doubling time) than cells that have not received any treatment. The treated cells did not undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition or showed enrichment of tumor initiating cells. Unlike trastuzumab and lapatinib, which induced resistance in BT474 cells after 6 months of treatment, HER2 siRNA did not induce resistance to HER2 siRNA, trastuzumab, or lapatinib. HER2 ablation with HER2 siRNA prevented reactivation of HER2 signaling that was observed in cells resistant to lapatinib. Altogether, our results indicate that a HER2 siRNA based therapeutic provides a more durable inhibition of HER2 signaling in vitro and can potentially be more effective than the existing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2806250856,"Background Medical care of cancer patients at the end-of-life is costly. This study aims to describe the monthly trends of EOL medical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy costs per patient with cancer in the last year of life in the inpatients vs. outpatient setting for the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea. Methods Using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database, we identified the patients who had been treated for the primary diagnoses of one of the 13 most prevalent cancers in Korea and died between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. We calculated the mean monthly costs of medical care, drug therapy, and chemotherapy per patient in the last year of life by cancer site and patient setting (inpatient vs. outpatient). Results For most cancers, the monthly inpatient costs per patient remain stable or increased gradually from 12 months to 3 months prior to death and then increased steeply from 2 months prior to death. The mean monthly inpatient costs per patient were highest for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) throughout the last year of life; all solid tumors had similar trends of monthly inpatient costs. The mean monthly inpatient costs for AML increased from $5,465 (SD, $5,248) in 12 months prior to death to $15,033 (SD, $11,864) in the last month. The monthly outpatient costs per patient showed similar, gradually decreasing trends for most cancers. The mean outpatient costs were highest for kidney cancer; the costs sharply decreased from $954 (SD, $1,346) in 12 months prior to death to $424 (SD, $736) in the last month. The proportion of inpatients receiving chemotherapy in the last month of life was highest for AML (77%), followed by liver cancer (67%) and breast cancer (56%). Conclusion The monthly inpatient medical care costs per patient with cancer increased as the patient approached death, while the monthly outpatient costs decreased. A considerable proportion of inpatient received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Efforts are needed to optimize EOL care for cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2807639239,"The purpose of this research is to explore the link between plasma amylase and insulin levels in growing pigs. Blood was obtained from piglets ranging in age from preterm (8 days to full gestation period), up to postnatal day 90 (2 months post-weaning) that underwent either duodenal-jejunal bariatric interposition surgery or a sham-operation. Plasma amylase activities in preterm and full-term neonates ranged between 500-600 U/L and were decreased by 50% two months post-weaning. Preprandial insulin and C-peptide levels in neonate piglets were not detectable, however they rose gradually after weaning. An increase in plasma amylase activity was observed in the young pigs that underwent duodenal-jejunum bypass (metabolic) surgery. The increase in blood pancreatic amylase activity after an intravenous amylase infusion lowered the subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin/C-peptide release. We suggest a role for blood amylase in the regulation of glucose homeostasis after observing high blood amylase levels in neonate pigs, in pigs that underwent metabolic surgery, and as a result of the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin response following intravenous amylase administration. Blood amylase level is a dynamic physiological parameter, which is not merely a consequence of exocrine pancreatic digestive enzyme production, but rather a regulated factor involved in glucose assimilation and prandial insulin regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2806849217,"Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust, causes significant losses in wheat yield and quality each year worldwide. During leaf rust infection, the host plant recognizes numerous molecules, some of which trigger host defenses. Although P. triticina reproduces clonally, there is still variation within the population due to a high mutation frequency, host specificity, and environmental adaptation. This study explores how wheat responds on a gene expression level to different P. triticina races. Six P. triticina races were inoculated onto a susceptible wheat variety and samples were taken at six days post inoculation, just prior to pustule eruption. RNA sequence data identified 63 wheat genes differentially expressed between the six races. A time course, conducted over the first seven days post inoculation, was used to examine the expression pattern of 63 genes during infection. Forty-seven wheat genes were verified to have differential expression. Three common expression patterns were identified. In addition, two genes were associated with race specific gene expression. Differential expression of an ER molecular chaperone gene was associated with races from two different P. triticina lineages. Also, differential expression in an alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase gene was associated with races with virulence shifts for leaf rust resistance genes."

Twenty-four college students completed a cognitive test battery while sitting, standing, walking on an active workstation with a self-selected speed (mean = 2.3 km/h) and a faster speed (mean = 3.5 km/h). The three components of executive function (Inhibition, Updating, and Shifting) were assessed by Stroop task, N-back task, More-odd shifting task, respectively. Performance of each task was determined by the response time and accuracy. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted with workstation condition and trial type as within-subjects factors. There were no significant main effects for workstation condition and no interaction between workstation condition × trial type in Stroop task and More-odd shifting task. There was a significant main effect for workstation condition (F (3, 69) = 4.029, p = 0.011) and interaction effect between workstation condition × trial type (F (6, 138) = 9.371, p < 0.001) in N-back task. Decomposition of the interaction showed that accuracy of 2-back task in self-paced walking was significantly lower than that in sitting condition (p = 0.017) and in standing condition (p < .001). But there was no difference in accuracy of 2-back task between self-paced walking condition and faster walking condition (p = 0.517). Our results suggest that using an active workstation may have a selective impact on three components of executive function, in which the Updating may be impaired to a certain extent while the Inhibition and Shifting remain unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W2805457543,"Developmental dyslexia is presumed to arise from phonological impairments. Accordingly, people with dyslexia show speech perception deficits taken as indication of impoverished phonological representations. However, the nature of speech perception deficits in those with dyslexia remains elusive. Specifically, there is no agreement as to whether speech perception deficits arise from speech-specific processing impairments, or from general auditory impairments that might be either specific to temporal processing or more general. Recent studies show that general auditory referents such as Long Term Average Spectrum (LTAS, the distribution of acoustic energy across the duration of a sound sequence) affect speech perception. Here we examine the impact of preceding target sounds’ LTAS on phoneme categorization to assess the nature of putative general auditory impairments associated with dyslexia. Dyslexic and typical listeners categorized speech targets varying perceptually from /ga/-/da/ preceded by speech and nonspeech tone contexts varying. Results revealed a spectrally contrastive influence of the preceding context LTAS on speech categorization, with a larger magnitude effect for nonspeech compared to speech precursors. Importantly, there was no difference in the presence or magnitude of the effects across dyslexia and control groups. These results demonstrate an aspect of general auditory processing that is spared in dyslexia, available to support phonemic processing when speech is presented in context."
https://openalex.org/W2806339325,"Written communication plays a crucial role in the history of modern civilizations as manuscripts do not only exist contemporarily, but are passed on to subsequent generations. Besides a document’s content, information is stored in the materials used for its production. Analyses of the composition allow, for example, identifying the biological origins of materials, dating, and help to understand degradation patterns. A combination of microscopic and DNA approaches was applied in order to analyze various plant derived writing sheets. Given their diversity and abundance in museum collections, plant based writing supports are yet an underexplored target for DNA studies. DNA retrieval of paper is low compared to raw paper plant material, which is likely due to the loss of organic components during paper production. Optimizing DNA extraction for each respective material drastically increased DNA recovery. Finally, we present a non-invasive DNA sampling method that utilizes nylon membranes, commonly used for bacterial DNA sampling and that is applicable to delicate material. Although bacterial infestation was visible on one sample, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy, endogenous DNA was retrieved. The results presented here are promising as they extend the scope of sources for DNA analyses by demonstrating that DNA molecules can be retrieved from a variety of plant derived writing supports. In future, such analyses can help to explore the biological diversity not only of plants and of additives utilized for producing writing supports, but also of the plenty products made from paper."
https://openalex.org/W2805491474,"Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate the components of day-to-day variability of repeated phase contrast mapping (PCM) magnetic resonance imaging measurements of global cerebral blood flow (gCBF). Materials and methods Two dataset were analyzed. In Dataset 1 duplicated PCM measurements of total brain flow were performed in 11 healthy young volunteers on two separate days applying a strictly standardized setup. For comparison PCM measurements obtained from a previously published study (Dataset 2) were analyzed in order to assess long-term variability in an aged population in a less strictly controlled setup. Global CBF was calculated by normalizing total brain flow to brain volume. On each day measurements of hemoglobin, caffeine and glucose were obtained. Linear mixed models were applied to estimate coefficients of variation (CV) of total (CVt), between-subject (CVb), within-subject day-to-day (CVw), and intra-session residual variability (CVr). Results In Dataset 1 CVt, CVb, CVw and CVr were estimated to be 11%, 9.4%, 4% and 4.2%, respectively, and to 8.8%, 7.2%, 2.7% and 4.3%, respectively, when adjusting for hemoglobin and plasma caffeine. In Dataset 2 CVt, CVb and CVw were estimated to be 25.4%, 19.2%, and 15.0%, respectively, and decreased to 16.6%, 8.2% and 12.5%, respectively, when adjusting for the same covariates. Discussion Our results suggest that short-term day-to-day variability of gCBF is relatively low compared to between-subject variability when studied in standardized conditions, whereas long-term variability in an aged population appears to be much larger when studied in less a standardized setup. The results further showed that from 20% to 35% of the total variability in gCBF can be attributed to the effects of hemoglobin and caffeine."
https://openalex.org/W2805309233,"Neural wiring and activity are essential for proper brain function and behavioral outputs and rely on mechanisms that guide the formation, elimination, and remodeling of synapses. During development, it is therefore vital that synaptic densities and architecture are tightly regulated to allow for appropriate neural circuit formation and function. δ-Catenin, a component of the cadherin–catenin cell adhesion complex, has been demonstrated to be a critical regulator of synaptic density and function in the developing central neurons. In this study, we identified forms of δ-catenin that include only the N-terminal (DcatNT) or the C-terminal (DcatCT) regions. We found that these δ-catenin forms are differentially expressed in different regions of the male mouse brain. Our results also indicated that in rat primary cortical culture, these forms are generated in an activity-dependent manner by Ca2+-dependent and calpain-mediated cleavage of δ-catenin or in an activity-independent but lysosome-dependent manner. Functionally, loss of the domain containing the calpain-cleavage sites allowing for generation of DcatCT and DcatNT perturbed the density of a subpopulation of dendritic protrusions in rat hippocampal neurons. This subpopulation likely included protrusions that are either in transition toward becoming mature mushroom spines or in the process of being eliminated. By influencing this subpopulation of spines, proteolytic processing of δ-catenin can likely regulate the balance between mature and immature dendritic protrusions in coordination with neural activity. We conclude that by undergoing cleavage, δ-catenin differentially regulates the densities of subpopulations of dendritic spines and contributes to proper neural circuit wiring in the developing brain."
https://openalex.org/W2805553931,"Aiming to solve the safety problems of high-speed railway operation and management, one new method is urgently needed to construct on the basis of the rough set theory and the uncertainty measurement theory. The method should carefully consider every factor of high-speed railway operation that realizes the measurement indexes of its safety operation. After analyzing the factors that influence high-speed railway safety operation in detail, a rough measurement model is finally constructed to describe the operation process. Based on the above considerations, this paper redistricts the safety influence factors of high-speed railway operation as 16 measurement indexes which include staff index, vehicle index, equipment index and environment. And the paper also provides another reasonable and effective theoretical method to solve the safety problems of multiple attribute measurement in high-speed railway operation. As while as analyzing the operation data of 10 pivotal railway lines in China, this paper respectively uses the rough set-based measurement model and value function model (one model for calculating the safety value) for calculating the operation safety value. The calculation result shows that the curve of safety value with the proposed method has smaller error and greater stability than the value function method's, which verifies the feasibility and effectiveness."

We employed chi-squared tests to examine and compare abortion providers' characteristics, and fitted separate multivariate logistic regression models for provision of surgical, medical, and any abortion services, respectively, adjusting for potential confounders to identify factors associated with abortion service provision at the two survey time points.Of providers interviewed in 2004 and 2012/2013, 63.7% and 84.5%, respectively, offered abortion services. Among abortion providers, 21.1% offered surgical and 10.7% offered medical abortions in 2004; 15.8% and 94.1% did so, respectively, in 2012/2013. Private providers were more likely than public providers to offer abortion services at both time points. Compared to female providers, male providers were significantly less likely to provide both surgical and medical abortions in 2004, and significantly less likely to provide surgical abortions in 2012/2013. Pharmacists and community health workers played increasingly important roles in abortion service provision, especially medical abortion, during the period.This study documents important changes in abortion provision in the two Indian states during 2004-2013."

Prior to the main stage of DNSIYC, pilot work was undertaken to determine the impact of using graduated utensils to estimate portion sizes. The aims were to assess whether the provision of graduated utensils altered either the foods given to infants or the amount consumed by comparing estimated intakes to weighed intakes. Parents completed two 4-day food diaries over a two week period; an estimated diary using graduated utensils and a weighed diary. Two estimated diary formats were tested; half the participants completed estimated diaries in which they recorded the amount of food/drink served and the amount left over, and the other half recorded the amount of food/drink consumed only. Median daily food intake for the estimated and the weighed method were similar; 980g and 928g respectively. There was a small (6.6%) but statistically significant difference in energy intake reported by the estimated and the weighed method; 3189kJ and 2978kJ respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between estimated intakes from the served and left over diaries and weighed intakes (p>0.05). Estimated intakes from the amount consumed diaries were significantly different to weighed intakes (food weight (g) p = 0.02; energy (kJ) p = 0.01). There were no differences in intakes of amorphous (foods which take the shape of the container, e.g. pureed foods, porridge) and discrete food items (individual pieces of food e.g. biscuits, rice cakes) between the two methods. The results suggest that the household measures approach to reporting portion size, with the combined use of the graduated utensils, and recording the amount served and the amount left over in the food diaries, may provide a feasible alternative to weighed intakes."
