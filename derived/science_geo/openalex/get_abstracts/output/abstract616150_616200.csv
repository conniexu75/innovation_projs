https://openalex.org/W2885830024,"The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea in a sample of Spanish university students, and to describe their menstrual characteristics, lifestyle habits and associated risk factors. This cross-sectional study was conducted with a total of 258 young female university students recruited from the Ciudad Real Faculty of Nursing, with a mean age of 20.63± 3.32 years. An anonymous self-report questionnaire was used to collect data from students. This included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, gynecological personal history and the severity of pain using the visual analogue scale. The statistical analysis of the data included calculation of the mean, percentages, chi-square analysis of the data and logistic regression. The prevalence of dysmenorrhea was of 74.8% (n = 193) with a mean pain severity of 6.88 (±1.71). Our results show that 38.3% of students described their menstrual pain as severe and 58% as moderate. The bivariate analysis showed statistically significant differences between students with and without dysmenorrhea: a higher proportion of women with dysmenorrhea had a greater duration of the menstruation flow (p = .003), a longer duration of the menstrual cycle (p = .046), were not using the oral contraceptive pill (p = .026) and had a family history of dysmenorrhea (p = .001). Backward step-wise binary logistic regression analysis using all the significant bivariate variables including lifestyle variables revealed the following risk factors: drinking cola drinks, duration of the menstrual flow, eating meat and having a first-degree relative affected by dysmenorrhea."
https://openalex.org/W2885930552,"Leveraging the conserved cancer genomes across mammals has the potential to transform driver gene discovery in orphan cancers. Here, we combine cross-species genomics with validation across human-dog-mouse systems to uncover a new bone tumor suppressor gene. Comparative genomics of spontaneous human and dog osteosarcomas (OS) expose Disks Large Homolog 2 (DLG2) as a tumor suppressor candidate. DLG2 copy number loss occurs in 42% of human and 56% of canine OS. Functional validation through pertinent human and canine OS DLG2-deficient cell lines identifies a regulatory role of DLG2 in cell division, migration and tumorigenesis. Moreover, osteoblast-specific deletion of Dlg2 in a clinically relevant genetically engineered mouse model leads to acceleration of OS development, establishing DLG2 as a critical determinant of OS. This widely applicable cross-species approach serves as a platform to expedite the search of cancer drivers in rare human malignancies, offering new targets for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2885191318,"This study’s objective was to describe long-term trends and patterns in first cigarette use (cigarette initiation) and daily cigarette use (daily initiation) among youth and young adults in the U.S. We used cross-sectional survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2002–2015, to estimate annual incidence of first cigarette use (N = 270,556) and first daily cigarette use (N = 373,464) for each year by age groups, race/ethnicity and gender, examining trends over time and the average annual change in initiation for each group. Several clear patterns emerged: 1) cigarette initiation and daily initiation significantly decreased over time among those aged 12–14 and 15–17 and these trends were consistent among nearly all racial/ethnic and gender subgroups; 2) among 18–21 year olds, cigarette initiation sharply increased through 2009, surpassing rates among 15–17 year olds, and sharply declined through 2015 while remaining higher than rates among the younger group, and this trend was consistent for almost all racial/ethnic subgroups; 3) daily initiation for those aged 18–21 significantly declined, and this was significant among most subgroups 4) there was no change in cigarette initiation and daily initiation for 22–25 year olds overall and most subgroups; 5) there was a significant increase in cigarette initiation for 22–25 year old Hispanics males and daily initiation for 22–25 year old males. This study provides a comprehensive look at trends in cigarette and daily initiation among U.S. youth and young adults. Despite notable declines in smoking initiation among youth and young adult populations over the last two decades, targeted prevention and policy efforts are needed for subgroups at higher risk, including young adults and Hispanic males."
https://openalex.org/W2885267573,"Background Sedentary behavior (SB) is associated with adverse health outcomes independent of levels of physical activity. However, data on its correlates are scarce from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Thus, we assessed the correlates of SB in six LMICs (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa) using nationally representative data. Methods Cross-sectional, community-based data on 42,469 individuals aged ≥18 years from the World Health Organization’s Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. Self-reported time spent sedentary per day was the outcome. High SB was defined as ≥8 hours of SB per day. The correlates (sociodemographic and health-related) of high SB were estimated by multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results The overall prevalence (95%CI) of high SB was 8.3% (7.1–9.7%). In the overall sample, the most important sociodemographic correlates of high SB were unemployment and urban residence. Physical inactivity, morbid obesity (BMI≥30.0 kg/m2), higher number of chronic conditions, poor self-reported health, higher disability levels, and worse health status in terms of mobility, pain/discomfort, affect, sleep/energy and cognition were associated with high SB. Several between-country differences were found. Conclusion The current data provides important guidance for future interventions across LMICs to assist sedentary people to reduce their SB levels."
https://openalex.org/W2886363577,"Rice provides energy and nutrition to more than half of the world's population. Breeding rice varieties with the increased levels of bioavailable micronutrients is one of the most sustainable approaches to tackle micronutrient malnutrition. So, high zinc and iron content in the grain are primary targets in rice biofortification breeding. In this study, we conducted QTL mapping using doubled haploid (DH) populations, PSBRc82 x Joryeongbyeo and PSBRc82 x IR69428, phenotyped for agronomic traits and micronutrients during two growing seasons and using genotypic information from analysis with the 6K SNP chip. A number of DH lines were identified as having high grain Zn and Fe content in polished rice. Importantly, we identified 20 QTLs for agronomic traits and 59 QTLs for a number of biofortification traits. Of the 79 QTLs, 12 were large-effect QTLs (>25% PVE), nine QTLs were consistent across seasons in either population, and one QTL was identified in both populations. Moreover, at least two QTLs were clustered in defined regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9. Eight epistatic interactions were detected for Cu, Mg, Na, and Zn in population 1. Furthermore, we identified several candidate genes near QTLs for grain Zn (OsNRAMP, OsNAS, OsZIP, OsYSL, OsFER, and OsZIFL family) and grain yield (OsSPL14 and OsSPL16). These new QTLs and candidate genes help to further elucidate the genetic basis for grain micronutrient concentration, and may prove useful for marker assisted breeding for this important trait."
https://openalex.org/W2886631017,"We recently reported that epicatechin, a bioactive compound that occurs naturally in various common foods, promoted general health and survival of obese diabetic mice. It remains to be determined whether epicatechin extends health span and delays the process of aging. In the present study, epicatechin or its analogue epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (0.25% w/v in drinking water) was administered to 20-mo-old male C57BL mice fed a standard chow. The goal was to determine the antiaging effect. The results showed that supplementation with epicatechin for 37 wk strikingly increased the survival rate from 39 to 69%, whereas EGCG had no significant effect. Consistently, epicatechin improved physical activity, delayed degeneration of skeletal muscle (quadriceps), and shifted the profiles of the serum metabolites and skeletal muscle general mRNA expressions in aging mice toward the profiles observed in young mice. In particular, we found that dietary epicatechin significantly reversed age-altered mRNA and protein expressions of extracellular matrix and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor pathways in skeletal muscle, and reversed the age-induced declines of the nicotinate and nicotinamide pathway both in serum and skeletal muscle. The present study provides evidence that epicatechin supplementation can exert an antiaging effect, including an increase in survival, an attenuation of the aging-related deterioration of skeletal muscles, and a protection against the aging-related decline in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.—Si, H., Wang, X., Zhang, L., Parnell, L.

https://openalex.org/W2887834286,"Background HPTN071(PopART) is a 3-arm community-randomised study in 21 peri-urban/urban communities in Zambia and the Western Cape of South Africa, with high HIV prevalence and high mobility especially among young adults. In Arm A communities, from November 2013 community HIV care providers (CHiPs) have delivered the “PopART” universal-test-and-treat (UTT) package in annual rounds, during which they visit all households and offer HIV testing. CHiPs refer HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals to routine HIV clinic services, where universal ART (irrespective of CD4 count) is offered, with re-visits to support linkage to care. The overall goal is to reduce population-level adult HIV incidence, through achieving high HIV testing and treatment coverage. Methods and findings The second annual round was June 2015-October 2016. Included in analysis are all individuals aged ≥15 years who consented to participate, with extrapolation to the total population. Our three main outcomes are (1) knowledge of HIV+ status (2) ART coverage, by the end of Round 2 (R2) and compared with the start of R2, and (3) retention on ART on the day of consenting to participate in R2. We used “time-to-event” methods to estimate the median time to start ART after referral to care. CHiPs visited 45,631 households during R2, ~98% of the estimated total across the four communities, and for 94% (43,022/45,631) consent was given for all household members to be listed on the CHiPs’ electronic register; 120,272 individuals aged ≥15 years were listed, among whom 64% of men (37,265/57,901) and 86% (53,516/62,371) of women consented to participate in R2. We estimated there were 6,521 HIV+ men and 10,690 HIV+ women in the total population of visited households; and that ~80% and ~90% of HIV+ men and women respectively knew their HIV+ status by the end of R2, fairly similar across age groups but lower among those who did not participate in Round 1 (R1). Among those who knew their HIV+ status, ~80% of both men and women were on ART by the end of R2, close to 90% among men aged ≥45 and women aged ≥35 years, but lower among younger adults, those who were resident in R1 but did not participate in R1, and those who were newly resident in the area of the community in which they were living in R2. Overall ART coverage was ~65% among HIV+ men and ~75% among HIV+ women, compared with the cumulative 90–90 target of 81%. Among those who reported ever taking ART, 93% of men and 95% of women self-reported they were on ART and missed 0 pills in the last 3 days. The median time to start ART after referral to care was ~6 months in R2, similar across the age range 25–54 years, compared with ~9.5 months in R1. The two main limitations to our findings were that a comparison with control-arm communities cannot be made until the end of the study; and that to extrapolate to the total population, assumptions were required about individuals who were resident, but did not participate, in R2. Conclusions Overall coverage against the 90–90 targets was high after two years of intervention, but was lower among men, individuals aged 18–34 years, and those who did not participate in R1. Our findings reflect the relative difficulties for CHiPs to contact men at home, compared with women, and that it is challenging to reach high levels of testing and treatment coverage in communities with substantial mobility and in-migration. The shortened time to start ART after referral to care in R2, compared with R1, was likely attributable to multiple factors including an increased focus of the CHiPs on linkage to care; increasing community acceptance and understanding of the CHiPs, and of ART and UTT, with time; increased coordination with the clinics to facilitate linkage; and clinic improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2887359464,"Multiple myeloma (MM), a malignant plasma cell disorder, is still an incurable disease. Thus, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is of utmost importance. Here, we evaluated the peripheral blood-based metabolic profile of patients with MM.Peripheral blood plasma levels of 188 endogenous metabolites, including amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and hexoses were determined in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a precursor stage of MM (MGUS, n = 15), newly diagnosed MM, (NDMM, n = 32), relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM, n = 19) and in 25 healthy controls by mass spectrometry.Patients with NDMM, RRMM and MGUS have a substantially different metabolomic profile than healthy controls. The amount of eight plasma metabolites significantly differs between the NDMM and MGUS group: free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, glutamate, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and four phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. In addition, the levels of octadecanoylcarnitine, ADMA and six PCs were significantly different between RRMM and MGUS patients. 13 different concentrations of metabolites were found between RRMM and NDMM patients (free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, creatinine, five LysoPCs and PCs). Pathway analyses revealed a distinct metabolic profile with significant alterations in amino acid, lipid, and energy metabolism in healthy volunteers compared to MGUS/MM patients.We identified different metabolic profiles in MGUS und MM patients in comparison to healthy controls. Thus, different metabolic processes, potentially the immunoregulation by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO), which is involved in cancer development and progression supporting inflammatory processes in the tumor microenvironment and glutaminolysis, can serve as novel promising therapeutic targets in MM."
https://openalex.org/W2886623208,"Cross-sectional evidence suggests that pornography use is related to lower mental well-being among adolescents but it remains unclear if changes in well-being are related to the dynamics of pornography use within this population. We examined the relationship between pornography use, subjective well-being, symptoms of depressions and anxiety, and self-esteem in two independent panel samples (N = 455; N = 858) of Croatian adolescents using cross-lagged path analysis and lagged linear mixed models. After controlling for impulsiveness and family environment-factors that are unlikely to be influenced by pornography use-earlier levels of pornography use were not significantly associated with subsequent decreases in subjective well-being across gender and panel. However, pornography use was associated with increases in both self-esteem and symptoms of depression and anxiety, albeit only among adolescent women in one of the two panels. In addition, low subjective well-being was associated with a subsequent increase in pornography use, but only in female adolescents in one panel. This study's results are not consistent with concerns about pornography use negatively contributing to male adolescents' psychological well-being, but suggest potential antagonistic links between pornography use and specific facets of mental well-being in adolescent women. Such links should be considered tentative until verified with further research."
https://openalex.org/W2886704965,"Introduction The understanding of survival in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) is limited, as well as the impact of these diagnoses in an ageing co-morbid population. Methods A retrospective study of 177 patients who received a DLB or PDD diagnosis between 1997–2014 at the Memory Clinic in Malmö, Sweden. Relative survival was evaluated by adjusting all-cause survival for expected survival, estimated from population life-tables, matched by sex, age and calendar year. Predictors of relative survival were investigated using multivariate regression modelling. Results At follow-up, 143 (81%) patients were deceased with a median survival of 4.1 years (IQR 2.6–6.0). After 10-years follow-up, the standardized mortality ratio was 3.44 (95% CI 2.92–4.04). Relative survival was worse with younger age at diagnosis (excess hazard ratio [eHR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.88–0.94 per year of age), female sex (eHR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01–2.09) and lower mini-mental state examination (eHR 0.93, 95% CI 0.90–0.96). Subgroup analysis (n = 141) showed higher mortality in DLB patients who were positive for APOE ɛ4 (eHR 2.00, 95% CI 1.35–2.97). Conclusion The mortality is over three-times higher in patients diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia during a ten-year follow-up, compared to persons in the general population. Excess mortality is found primarily in younger patients, females and carriers of APOE ε4. Further research is needed regarding survival and possible interventions, including disease-modifying treatments, to improve care for this patient group."
https://openalex.org/W2886304544,"Recently, based on functional differences, we subdivided neurons juxtaposed to the facial nucleus into two distinct populations, the parafacial ventral and lateral regions, i.e., pFV and pFL. Little is known about the composition of these regions, i.e., are they homogenous or heterogeneous populations? Here, we manipulated their excitability in spontaneously breathing vagotomized urethane anesthetized adult rats to further characterize their role in breathing. In the pFL, disinhibition or excitation decreased breathing frequency (f) with a concomitant increase of tidal volume (VT), and induced active expiration; in contrast, reducing excitation had no effect. This result is congruent with pFL neurons constituting a conditional expiratory oscillator comprised of a functionally homogeneous set of excitatory neurons that are tonically suppressed at rest. In the pFV, disinhibition increased f with a presumptive reflexive decrease in VT; excitation increased f, VT and sigh rate; reducing excitation decreased VT with a presumptive reflexive increase in f. Therefore, the pFV, has multiple functional roles that require further parcellation. Interestingly, while hyperpolarization of the pFV reduces ongoing expiratory activity, no perturbation of pFV excitability induced active expiration. Thus, while the pFV can affect ongoing expiratory activity, presumably generated by the pFL, it does not appear capable of directly inducing active expiration. We conclude that the pFL contains neurons that can initiate, modulate, and sustain active expiration, whereas the pFV contains subpopulations of neurons that differentially affect various aspects of breathing pattern, including but not limited to modulation of ongoing expiratory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2887000113,"To assess the prevalence of depression in the general population of Beijing and its association with ocular diseases.The population-based Beijing Eye Study was conducted in a rural and an urban region of Greater Beijing. The study participants underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination and an interview including questions on the socioeconomic background. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using a Chinese depression scale adapted from Zung´s self-rated depression scale. The total score of depression symptoms was 80. Depression was defined as having a depression score >44.Out of 3468 study participants, 3267 (94.2%) individuals (1419 men) with an age of 64.5±9.7 years (range: 50-93 years) participated in the interview and answered all questions on depression. The mean depression score was 25.0±5.9 (median: 23.3; range:20-64). Depression (depression score >44) was present in 66 individuals (2.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 2.5), and 5 individuals (0.2%; 95%CI: 0.02,0.3) had a depression score ≥59. In multivariate regression, analysis, a higher depression score was associated (regression coefficient r2: 0.22) with a higher number of days with dry eye feeling (P<0.001; standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.09; non-standardized regression coefficient B: 0.20; 95%CI: 0.12,0.29) and shorter corneal curvature radius (P = 0.03;beta:-0.04; B:1.01; 95%CI: -1.90,-0.12), after adjusting for age, gender, region of habitation, body mass index, cognitive function score, life quality score and blood concentration of triglycerides. Adding age-related macular degeneration (P = 0.10), glaucoma (P = 0.77), diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.77), nuclear cataract (P = 0.35), cortical cataract (P = 0.58) or posterior subcapsular cataract (P = 0.28) as single parameters to the model revealed no significant correlation with the depression score. Lower best corrected visual acuity showed a marginal significant association (P = 0.05; beta: 0.04; B: 1.56; 95%CI: -0.01, 3.13).Dry eye feeling was the only common ocular disorder associated with an increased depression score, while the occurrence of age-related macular degeneration, any type of glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, any type of cataract and keratoconus were not significantly associated with an increased depression score. Lower visual acuity was marginally associated. The prevalence of depression in the population aged 50+ years in Greater Beijing was 2.0% (96%CI: 1.5, 2.5)."
https://openalex.org/W2886611572,"Blood vessels composed of endothelial cells (ECs) contact with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in different tissues, suggesting possible interaction between these 2 types of cells. We hypothesized that endothelin-1 (ET1), a secreted paracrine factor of ECs, can differentially direct the lineages of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow–derived MSCs (BMSCs). Predifferentiated ASCs and BMSCs were treated with ET1 for 2 cell passages and then induced for multilineage differentiation. Our results showed that adipogenesis of ET1-pretreated ASCs and osteogenesis of ET1-pretreated BMSCs were increased compared to those of control cells. The effect of ET1 on enhancing adipogenesis of ASCs and osteogenesis of BMSCs was attenuated by blocking endothelin receptor type A (ETAR) and/or endothelin receptor type B (ETBR). Western blot analysis indicated that regulation by ET1 was mediated through activation of the protein kinase B and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. We analyzed subpopulations of ASCs and BMSCs with or without ETAR and/or ETBR, and we found that ETAR+/ETBR− and ETAR−/ETBR+ subpopulations of ASCs and those of BMSCs pretreated with ET1 were prone to turning into adipocytes and osteoblasts, respectively, after differentiation induction. Our findings provide insight into the differential regulation of MSC specification by ET1, which may help develop viable approaches for tissue regeneration.—Lee, M.-S., Wang, J., Yuan, H., Jiao, H., Tsai, T.-L., Squire, M.

https://openalex.org/W2885608760,"The redox state of the cell can be affected by many cellular conditions. In this study we show that detectable reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also generated in response to DNA damage by the chromatin remodeling factor and monoamine oxidase LSD1/KDM1A. This raised the possibility that the localized generation of hydrogen peroxide produced by LSD1 may affect the function of proximally located DNA repair proteins. The two major pathways for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Cells were exposed to low levels of ectopic H2O2, DNA breaks generated by laser light, and recruitment kinetics of NHEJ protein Ku80 to DNA damage sites determined. Ku80 recruitment to damage sites was significantly decreased in cells pretreated with H2O2 while HR end binding protein Nbs1 was increased. This suggests that the DNA repair pathway choice has the potential to be modulated by the local redox state. This has implications for chemotherapeutic approaches involving generating DNA damage to target actively dividing cancer cells, which may be more or less effective dependent on the redox state of the targeted cells and the predominant repair pathway required to repair the type of DNA damage generated."
https://openalex.org/W2887981443,"Background Substantial concern exists about the high risk of sexually transmitted HIV to adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ages 15–24) in Eastern and Southern Africa. Yet limited research has been conducted with AGYW’s male sexual partners regarding their perspectives on relationships and strategies for mitigating HIV risk. We sought to fill this gap in order to inform the DREAMS Partnership and similar HIV prevention programs in Uganda. Methods We conducted 94 in-depth interviews, from April-June 2017, with male partners of AGYW in three districts: Gulu, Mukono, and Sembabule. Men were recruited at community venues identified as potential transmission areas, and via female partners enrolled in DREAMS. Analyses focused on men’s current and recent partnerships and HIV service use. Results Most respondents (80%) were married and 28 years old on average. Men saw partner concurrency as pervasive, and half described their own current multiple partners. Having married in their early 20s, over time most men continued to seek out AGYW as new partners, regardless of their own age. Relationships were highly fluid, with casual short-term partnerships becoming more formalized, and more formalized partnerships characterized by periods of separation and outside partnerships. Nearly all men reported recent HIV testing and described testing at distinct relationship points (e.g., when deciding to continue a relationship/get married, or when reuniting with a partner after a separation). Testing often stemmed from distrust of partner behavior, and an HIV-negative status served to validate respondents’ current relationship practices. Conclusions Across the three regions in Uganda, findings with partners of AGYW confirm earlier reports in Uganda of multiple concurrent partnerships, and demonstrate substantial HIV testing. Yet they also unearth the degree to which these partnerships are fluid (switching between casual and/or more long-term partnerships), which complicates potential HIV prevention strategies. Context-specific findings around these partnerships and risk are critical to further tailor HIV prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2886125675,"The prevalence of diverse animal models as surrogates for human vascular pathologies necessitate a comprehensive understanding of the differences that exist between species. Comparative passive mechanics are presented here for the common carotid arteries taken from bovine, porcine, ovine, leporine, murine-rat, and murine-mouse specimens. Data is generated using a scalable biaxial mechanical testing device following consistent circumferential (pressure-diameter) and axial (force-length) testing protocols. The structural mechanical response of carotids under equivalent loading, quantified by the deformed inner radius, deformed wall thickness, lumen area compliance and axial force, varies significantly among species but generally follows allometric scaling. Conversely, descriptors of the local mechanical response within the deformed arterial wall, including mean circumferential stress, mid-wall circumferential stretch, and mean axial stress, are relatively consistent across species. Unlike the larger animals studied, the diameter distensibility curves of murine specimens are non-monotonic and have a significantly higher value at 100 mmHg. Taken together, our results provide baseline structural and mechanical information for carotid arteries across a broad range of common animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2885363368,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes the chronic inflammation of the joints. Intercellular communication containing synovial fibroblasts seems to play a major role in RA pathogenesis. In this study, to better understand intercellular communication related to RA pathogenesis, we identified exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from synovial fibroblasts. Exosomes were collected from an RA synovial fibroblast (RASF) cell line, namely, MH7A, with or without stimulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We used small RNA sequencing to analyze the profile of small RNAs, including miRNAs, in MH7A exosomes and cells. By using differential expression analysis, we identified four miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-323a-5p, and miR-1307-3p) that are upregulated in exosomes with TNF-α stimulation. The identification of miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p which have been reported in RA patients demonstrated the validity of our experimental model. Other two miRNAs were newly identified. miR-323a-5p was predicted to target the protein encoding gene CD6, which attenuates T-cell activation signals, and miR-1307-3p was predicted to target the protein encoding gene N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2), which inhibits osteoclast-related gene expression. The results suggested that these miRNAs might be involved in RA pathogenesis. We hope our results will help us understand the role of RASF exosomes in RA pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2886004237,"The aim was to explore contraceptive uptake, associated factors and satisfaction among post abortion-care (PAC) seeking women in Kenya. Due to unsafe abortions, almost 120 000 Kenyan women received PAC in 2012, and of these women, 70% did not use contraception before pregnancy.This study was nested in a larger randomised controlled trial, where 859 women sought PAC at two public hospitals in Kisumu, in June 2013-May 2016. The women were randomly assigned to a midwife or a physician for PAC, including contraceptive counselling, and followed up at 7-10 days and three months. Associated factors for contraceptive uptake were analysed with binary logistic regression, and contraceptive method choice, adherence and satisfaction level were examined by descriptive statistics, using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0.Out of the 810 PAC-seeking women, 76% (n = 609) accepted the use of contraception. Age groups of 21-25 (OR: 2.35; p < 0.029) and 26-30 (OR: 2.22; p < 0.038), and previous experience of 1-2 gravidities (OR 1.939; p = 0.018) were independent factors associated with the up-take. Methods used: injections 39% (n = 236); pills 27% (n = 166); condoms 25% (n = 151); implant 7% (n = 45) and intrauterine device (IUD) 1% (n = 8). At 3-month follow-up of the women (470/609; 77%), 354 (75%) women still used contraception, and most (n = 332; 94%) were satisfied with the method. Reasons for discontinuation were side-effects (n = 44; 39%), partner refusal (n = 27; 24%), planned pregnancy (n = 27; 24%) and lack of resupplies (n = 15; 13%).PAC-seeking women seem highly motivated to use contraceptives, yet a quarter decline the use, and at 3-month follow-up a further quarter among the users had discontinued. Implant, IUD and permanent method are rarely used. Strategies to improve contraceptive counselling, particularly to adolescent girls, and to increase access to a wide range of methods, as well as provider training and supervision may help to improve contraceptive acceptance and compliance among PAC-seeking women in Kisumu, Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W2886289985,"Although health provider racial/ethnic bias has the potential to influence health outcomes and inequities, research within health education and training contexts remains limited. This paper reports findings from an anonymous web-based study examining racial/ethnic bias amongst final year medical students in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Data from 302 students (34% of all eligible final year medical students) were collected in two waves in 2014 and 2015 as part of the Bias and Decision Making in Medicine (BDMM) study. Two chronic disease vignettes, two implicit bias measures, and measures of explicit bias were used to assess racial/ethnic bias towards New Zealand European and Māori (indigenous) peoples. Medical students demonstrated implicit pro-New Zealand European racial/ethnic bias on average, and bias towards viewing New Zealand European patients as more compliant relative to Māori. Explicit pro-New Zealand European racial/ethnic bias was less evident, but apparent for measures of ethnic preference, relative warmth, and beliefs about the compliance and competence of Māori patients relative to New Zealand European patients. In addition, racial/ethnic bias appeared to be associated with some measures of medical student beliefs about individual patients by ethnicity when responding to a mental health vignette. Patterning of racial/ethnic bias by student characteristics was not consistent, with the exception of some associations between student ethnicity, socioeconomic background, and racial/ethnic bias. This is the first study of its kind with a health professional population in Aotearoa/New Zealand, representing an important contribution to further understanding and addressing current health inequities between Māori and New Zealand European populations."
https://openalex.org/W2887196719,"Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits prostaglandin (PG) synthesis by transfer of its acetyl group to a serine residue in the cyclooxygenase (COX) active site. Acetylation of Ser530 inhibits catalysis by preventing access of arachidonic acid substrate in the COX-1 isoenzyme. Acetylated COX-2, in contrast, gains a new catalytic activity and forms 15R hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15R-HETE) as alternate product. Here we show that acetylated COX-2 also retains COX activity, forming predominantly 15R-configuration PGs (70 or 62% 15R, respectively, determined using radiolabeled substrate or LC-MS analysis). Although the Km of arachidonic acid for acetylated COX-2 was ~3-fold lower than for uninhibited COX-2, the catalytic efficiency for PG formation by the acetylated enzyme was reduced 10-fold due to a concomitant decrease in Vmax. Aspirin increased 15R-PGD2 but not 15R-PGE2 in isolated human leukocytes activated with LPS to induce COX-2.15R-PGD2 inhibited human platelet aggregation induced by the thromboxane receptor agonist U46,619, and this effect was abrogated by an antagonist of the DPI prostanoid receptor. We conclude that acetylation of Ser530 in COX-2 not only triggers formation of 15R-HETE but also allows oxygenation and cyclization of arachidonic acid to a 15R-PG endoperoxide. 15R-PGs are novel products of aspirin therapy via acetylation of COX-2 and may contribute to its antiplatelet and other pharmacologic effects.—Giménez-Bastida, J.

https://openalex.org/W2886924776,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in low and middle-income countries. Early detection and enrolment of TB cases is a challenge for National TB Programs. Objective To understand the performance and feasibility for scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the TB diagnosis in Nepal. Design Implementation research employed mixed-method sequential explanatory design. The results of Xpert MTB/RIF assay were analysed in 26 TB diagnostic centres where Xpert machines had been installed before 2015. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with stakeholders, purposively selected to represent experiences in centres that were functioning well, poorly or not functioning. Results During a one-year period in 2015/16, 23,075 Xpert MTB/RIF assays were performed in 21 diagnostic centres with 22,288 people also tested by sputum microscopy. Among these, 77% had concordant (positive or negative) results, demonstrating fair agreement (Kappa score, 0.3) between test results. Test failure and positivity rates in diagnostic centres ranged from 2.6% to 13.4% and 6.5% to 49%, respectively. The number of cartridges per positive result varied from 2.3 to 10.2. Xpert assay was positive in 3314 (15% of all cases) sputum smear microscopy negative cases. Of 4280 bacteriologically confirmed cases by Xpert assay, 355 (8%) were rifampicin resistant. Xpert machines were no longer functioning regularly throughout the year in 5 diagnostic centres. The main barriers for effective implementation of Xpert in Nepal were the lack of: timely supply of cartridges; replacement of damaged modules; maintenance of Xpert machines; and stock verification for timely procurement of cartridges. Inadequate laboratory infrastructure for maintaining functional Xpert equipment further challenges implementation and scale-up. Conclusion The implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF assay has increased case-finding of TB and MDR-TB in Nepal. However, there is a need to improve laboratory performance and strengthen laboratory infrastructure for optimal utilisation and scale-up of Xpert."
https://openalex.org/W2887919538,"Introduction Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem across sub-Saharan Africa. Sierra Leone has no national hepatitis B strategy plan or high quality estimates of prevalence. Healthcare workers are perceived as an at-risk group for hepatitis B. We assessed the prevalence of hepatitis B among healthcare workers at two hospital sites in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Methods In October 2017, healthcare workers were offered voluntary testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe) using rapid lateral flow assay for all samples, followed by Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay to confirm positive results. Participants completed a questionnaire about knowledge, attitudes and practices concerning hepatitis B. HBsAg positive participants were invited to a clinic for further assessment. Results Overall, 447 participants were tested for hepatitis B. Most (90.6%, 405/447) participants were nurses, 72.3% (323/447) were female and 71.6% (320/447) were 30 years or older. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg positivity) was 8.7% (39 / 447, 95% CI 6.3–11.7%). There was no significant difference in prevalence by sex, age group, site of work or type of job. None of the 66.7% (26 / 39) of participants with chronic hepatitis B who attended the clinic met the 2015 WHO criteria to start treatment for hepatitis B on the basis of cirrhosis. Most participants (96.9% 432 / 446) stated that they were worried about their risk of hepatitis B at work. Conclusions Hepatitis B is highly prevalent among healthcare workers in Sierra Leone. It is unclear whether this reflects high community prevalence or is due to occupational risk. No participants with chronic hepatitis B needed to start treatment. In order to achieve the WHO target of elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030, introduction of birth dose vaccine for infants and catch-up vaccines for healthcare workers and healthcare students, together with a national hepatitis B screen and treat programme is advisable for Sierra Leone."
https://openalex.org/W2885524985,"Campylobacter coli is a bacterial species that is a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide, and Campylobacter spp. are among the top 5 foodborne pathogens in the United States. During food production organic acids (OAs) are often used to remove bacteria from animal carcasses. The interactions of six OAs with 111 C. coli strains obtained from swine and retail pork chops were studied by determining the molar minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICMs) of the C. coli strains, and the pH at the MICMs. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation was used to calculate the concentrations of the undissociated and dissociated OAs at the MICMs of the C. coli strains. The results for the 111 different C. coli strains obtained from different locations were treated as a single group for each OA since many of the C. coli strains behaved similarly to each different OA. Inhibition of C. coli was not dependent on pH or on the undissociated OA species, but C. coli inhibition correlated with the dissociated OA species. Therefore, if the concentration of the dissociated OAs decreases from optimum, one may then expect that C. coli bacteria would escape disinfection. The concentration of the dissociated OA should be carefully controlled in a carcass wash. We suggest maintaining a concentration of the dissociated acetic, butyric, citric, formic, lactic and propionic acids at 29, 23, 11, 35, 22 and 25 mM, respectively, when using a carcass wash with these OAs to remove C. coli bacteria. However, due to C. coli utilization of acetate, formate, lactate and propionate, these four OAs may not be the best choice to use for a carcass wash to remove C. coli contamination. Of the six OAs, citric acid was the most efficient at inhibiting C. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2886677011,"Tardigrades represent an invertebrate phylum with no circulatory or respiratory system. Their body cavity is filled with free storage cells of the coelomocyte-type, which are responsible for important physiological functions. We report a study comparing the ultrastructure of storage cells in anhydrobiotic and hydrated specimens of the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer. We also analysed the effect of temperature stress on storage cell structure. Firstly, we verified two types of ultrastructurally different storage cells, which differ in cellular organelle complexity, amount and content of reserve material and connection to oogenetic stage. Type I cells were found to differ ultrastructurally depending on the oogenetic stage of the animal. The main function of these cells is energy storage. Storage cells of Type I were also observed in the single male that was found among the analysed specimens. The second cell type, Type II, found only in females, represents young undifferentiated cells, possibly stem cells. The two types of cells also differ with respect to the presence of nucleolar vacuoles, which are related to oogenetic stages and to changes in nucleolic activity during oogenesis. Secondly, this study revealed that storage cells are not ultrastructurally affected by six months of desiccation or by heating following this desiccation period. However, heating of the desiccated animals (tuns) tended to reduce animal survival, indicating that long-term desiccation makes these animals more vulnerable to heat stress. We confirmed the degradative pathways during the rehydration process after desiccation and heat stress. Our study is the first to document two ultrastructurally different types of storage cells in tardigrades and reveals new perspectives for further studies of tardigrade storage cells."
https://openalex.org/W2886721608,"Mechanisms regulating differences in cortisol responsiveness between low (LR) and high response (HR) individuals have been poorly studied. In this context, we aimed to study key regulatory processes in cortisol dynamics at the head kidneys of LR and HR European sea bass. To do so, resting plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations were quantified in these fish. Additionally, the head kidneys of these individuals were superfused through an in vitro superfusion system and stimulated with the same amount of ACTH to assess their cortisol biosynthetic capacity. Moreover, the expression of important genes in cortisol regulation was assessed. Results showed that LR fish had lower resting cortisol concentrations than HR, although no differences existed in the circulating levels of ACTH. Additionally, the biosynthetic capacity of HR was higher than that of LR fish when in vitro stimulated with ACTH. At the molecular level, a statistically significant 3.4-fold higher expression of the ACTH receptor, mc2r, and a 2.3-fold, though not significant, higher expression of 11β-hydroxylase (cyp11b1), an enzyme involved in cortisol biosynthesis, was observed in the HR fish. Finally, a statistically significant 1.3-fold lower expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (hsd11b2), an enzyme involved in cortisol inactivation, was observed in HR when compared to LR fish. Therefore, it was for the first time indicated that cortisol dynamics can also be regulated at the post-production level in the head kidney. Collectively, our results highlight the crucial role of the interrenal tissue in the regulation of differences in cortisol response between LR and HR sea bass individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2885540135,"Depredation in marine ecosystems is defined as the damage or removal of fish or bait from fishing gear by predators. Depredation raises concerns about the conservation of species involved, fisheries yield and profitability, and reference points based on stock assessment of depredated species. Therefore, the development of accurate indicators to assess the impact of depredation is needed. Both the Reunion Island and the Seychelles archipelago pelagic longline fisheries targeting swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and tuna (Thunnus spp.) are affected by depredation from toothed whales and pelagic sharks. In this study, we used fishery data collected between 2004 and 2015 to propose depredation indicators and to assess depredation levels in both fisheries. For both fisheries, the interaction rate (depredation occurrence) was significantly higher for shark compared to toothed whale depredation. However, when depredation occurred, toothed whale depredation impact was significantly higher than shark depredation impact, with higher depredation per unit effort (number of fish depredated per 1000 hooks) and damage rate (proportion of fish depredated per depredated set). The gross depredation rate in the Seychelles was 18.3%. A slight increase of the gross depredation rate was observed for the Reunion Island longline fleet from 2011 (4.1% in 2007–2010 and 4.4% in 2011–2015). Economic losses due to depredation were estimated by using these indicators and published official statistics. A loss of 0.09 EUR/hook due to depredation was estimated for the Reunion Island longline fleet, and 0.86 EUR/hook for the Seychelles. These results suggest a southward decreasing toothed whale and shark depredation gradient in the southwest Indian Ocean. Seychelles depredation levels are among the highest observed in the world revealing this area as a “hotspot” of interaction between pelagic longline fisheries and toothed whales. This study also highlights the need for a set of depredation indicators to allow for a global comparison of depredation rates among various fishing grounds worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2885834288,"Elucidating the cold tolerance mechanism of Paeonia lactiflora, which is one of the most valuable ornamental and medicinal plants in Asia, fundamentally impacts its breeding and production. The glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) gene plays a pivotal role in cold resistance in a variety of plant species. Here, we cloned the P. lactiflora GPAT gene, determined its expression pattern, and tested its role in cold resistance. We obtained the full-length P. lactiflora GPAT gene using tissue-cultured seedlings and real-time polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends analyses. We named this gene PlGPAT in P. lactiflora. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the PlGPAT gene is closely related with the GPAT genes in core eudicots. The phylogenetic tree containing 31 angiosperm species based on GPAT protein sequences is largely consistent with the known phylogeny in flowering plants. We conducted a time-course PlGPAT expression analysis and demonstrated that PlGPAT expression is correlated with low-temperature stress. Our results suggest that the PlGPAT gene plays an important role in regulating cold resistance in P. lactiflora."
https://openalex.org/W2885174363,"The goal of our research is to identify strengths and weaknesses of high school level science fair and improvements that might enhance learning outcomes based on empirical assessment of student experiences. We use the web-based data collection program REDCap to implement anonymous and voluntary surveys about science fair experiences with two independent groups-high school students who recently competed in the Dallas Regional Science and Engineering Fair and post high school students (undergraduates, 1st year medical students, and 1st year biomedical graduate students) on STEM education tracks doing research at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Herein, we report quantitative and qualitative data showing student opinions about the value of science fair. Few students in any group thought that competitive science fair (C-SF) should be required. The most common reasons given for not requiring C-SF were no enjoyment and no interest in competing. On the other hand, student attitudes towards requiring non-competitive science fair (NC-SF) were nuanced and ranged as high as 91%, increasing with student maturation, science fair experience, and STEM track. The most common reasons given for requiring NC-SF were learning scientific thinking skills and research skills. Students opposed to requiring NC-SF most frequently mentioned no enjoyment and no interest in science. Several student comments critical of the fairness of science fair led us to determine possible differences in science fair experiences depending on whether or not students received help from scientists. Those who received help from scientists had an easier time getting their research idea, more access to articles in books and magazines, and less difficulty getting resources. We discuss the idea that two different types of science fairs-competitive science fair with a performance goal orientation and non-competitive science fair with a mastery goal orientation-might be required to promote the broad goal of educating all students about science and engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2885508338,"Biotic stresses induced by herbivores result in diverse physiological changes in plants. In the interaction between the Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and the herbivore Spodoptera littoralis, the earliest event induced by feeding on leaves is the depolarization of the plasma membrane potential (Vm), which is the results of both mechanical damage and insect oral secretions (OS). Although this herbivore-induced Vm depolarization depends on a calcium-dependent opening of potassium channels, the attacked leaf remains depolarized for an extended period, which cannot be explained by the sole action of potassium channels. Here we show that the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of P. lunatus leaves is strongly inhibited by S. littoralis OS. Inhibition of the H+-ATPase was also found in plasma membranes purified from leaf sections located distally from the application zone of OS, thus suggesting a long-distance transport of a signaling molecule(s). S. littoralis’ OS did not influence the amount of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, whereas the levels of membrane-bound 14-3-3 proteins were significantly decreased in membranes purified from treated leaves. Furthermore, OS strongly reduced the in vitro interaction between P. lunatus H+-ATPase and 14-3-3 proteins. The results of this work demonstrate that inhibition of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase is a key component of the S. littoralis OS mechanism leading to an enduring Vm depolarization in P. lunatus wounded leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2887170718,"Drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a target for new antimicrobial technologies. Far-UVC technology is an emerging disinfection method that directly kills microorganisms using light. In contrast with conventional UV sterilization, far-UVC light has antimicrobial capabilities without apparent harm to mammalian cells. This study examines the application of 224 nm far-UVC light delivered from a laser using an optical diffuser towards the goal of protecting against bacterial invasion around skin penetrating devices. Delivery of far-UVC using a laser and optical fibers enables exposure to unique geometries that would otherwise be shielded when using a lamp. Testing of the bactericidal potential of diffusing the far-UVC laser output over a large area was tested and yielded qualitative area killing results. The killing of MRSA using this method was also examined using an in vitro survival assay. Results followed a classic log-linear disinfection model with a rate constant of k = 0.51 cm2/mJ, which corresponds to an inactivation cross section of D90 = 4.5 mJ/cm2. This study establishes far-UVC delivered from a laser through an optical diffuser as a viable solution for disinfection of susceptible regions such as around catheters, drivelines, or other skin penetrating medical devices."
https://openalex.org/W2887236513,"Background In 2009, a nationwide sentinel surveillance for hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina (HA) with neurologic complications was initiated in South Korea. We used this surveillance system to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with either HFMD or HA with neurologic complications, with the aim of determining risk factors for severe neurologic complications. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was conducted on all cases of HFMD and HA with neurologic complications that were reported in the national system between April 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014. A severe case was defined as having HFMD or HA with encephalitis, polio-like syndrome, or cardiopulmonary failure, and less-severe cases were defined as having HFMD or HA with aseptic meningitis. Results A total of 138 cases (less-severe: 90/138, 65.2%; severe: 48/138, 24.8%) were included from 28 hospitals; 28 ineligible cases were excluded. Of 48 severe cases, 27 (56.2%) had encephalitis; 14 (29.2%) had polio-like syndrome; and seven (14.6%) had cardiopulmonary syndrome. The median patient age was 36 months (IQR: 18–60) and 63 (45.7%) patients were female. Most patients completely recovered, except for seven cases that were fatal or resulted in long-term symptoms (5.1%, 3 patients with neurologic sequelae and 4 deaths). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, lethargy (OR = 4.67, 95% CI: 1.37–15.96, P = 0.014), female sex (OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 1.17–10.50, P = 0.025), and enterovirus A71 (OR = 3.55, 95% CI: 1.09–11.57, P = 0.035) were significantly associated with severe neurologic complications in HFMD and HA patients. Conclusion In patients with HFMD and HA, lethargy, female, and enterovirus A71 may predict severe neurologic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2887400094,"Neurofeedback (NF) is a form of behavioral therapy used to treat e.g. attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Briefly, subjects are fed-back a putatively dysfunctional parameter of their brain activity in real time and must learn to control it in a suggested direction. NF protocols for ADHD have been used in practice for decades, though no clear standards on NF design have been implemented. Furthermore, studies often present only data from the general outcome of the NF treatment and do not look at how exactly the NF paradigm affects brain functionality, or what exactly the NF is training. The current study is two-fold: firstly, we look at how the functional connectivity (FC) patterns within key networks associated with ADHD differ between rests, feedback trials, success and failure in a complete functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based NF experiment on adults with ADHD. Secondly, due to methodological concerns discovered during the analysis of our data, we address important considerations in the design of NF that are often ignored in protocols being used widely in therapy and research today. In particular, we examine the common average reference and its impact on network activity as well as the importance of balancing the randomization in a design. Finally, we discuss how these methodological considerations may have influenced our FC results."
https://openalex.org/W2887532547,"Extinction thresholds have been predicted to be critical values of habitat loss in which an abrupt reduction in populations occurs through the interaction between reduced habitat and increased isolation in the landscape. In communities, extinction thresholds are referred to as 'biodiversity thresholds'. The biodiversity threshold values documented so far occur between 30% and 50% of habitat cover in landscapes. However, the assessment of biodiversity thresholds has mainly focused on vertebrate and plant communities. Here, we evaluated the occurrence of biodiversity thresholds in dung beetle communities by sampling ten 3,600 ha Atlantic Forest landscapes with forest cover ranging from 5% to 55%. We analysed the response patterns (abundance, gamma and mean alpha diversity) of community subgroups with different levels of forest dependency (forest species, generalist species, and open-area species) using model selection, comparing null, linear, bell-shaped and logistic models. The response of the community of forest species equally fits both linear and logistic models predicting a biodiversity threshold at 25% forest cover. Generalist species showed peak abundance at 20% forest cover although this result reflects a very poor generalist assembly. Open-area specialists did not respond to the amount of forest. The two most plausible models for forest species suggest two different biodiversity management options. Since the biodiversity threshold model represents a more dramatic scenario for the loss of biodiversity in Atlantic forest landscapes, we suggest, based on precautionary principle, that our results should strength guidelines that consider minimum values of forest cover in management strategies to avoid abrupt biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem services."

However, the process of optimizing science cafés is under-studied. We describe the pilot evaluation of a series of Science Cafés, called Garden Cafés (n = 9), conducted from September 2015 through April 2016 in Olmsted County, MN and Duval County, FL to connect Mayo Clinic researchers and local service providers with the community. Selection of discussion topics was guided by a county health needs assessment, which identified community priorities. Before leaving the events, community participants completed a brief anonymous survey assessing sociodemographics and their knowledge of research benefits, readiness to participate as a partner in health research, and health and science literacy confidence. Of the 112 attendees who responded, 51% were female and 51% were Black. Respondents reported that participating in the event significantly improved (all at p<0.001) their understanding on all three measures. Preliminary findings suggest that Garden Cafés are an effective forum to increase community understanding and disposition to collaborate in health research, especially in members from diverse backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W2885121903,"No large studies have examined the prevalence of enuresis, its various forms and risk factors in children with sickle cell anaemia (SCA) in Sub-Saharan Africa using standardised definitions. We determined age and gender-specific prevalence of enuresis and compared the nature of enuresis in children with and without SCA. We also identified predictors of enuresis in children with SCA.Caregivers of children with SCA attending a tertiary centre haematology clinic in Nigeria were interviewed using a questionnaire. In addition, a separate questionnaire was completed for every sibling aged 5-17 years whose haemoglobin genotype was known. Enuresis and its various forms were defined using the definitions of the International Children's Continence Society.The study involved 243 children with SCA and 243 controls matched for age and sex. The mean age of the study cohort was 9.9 (3.4). Females made up 45.7% of the cohorts. The prevalence of enuresis was 49.4% and 29.6% in children with and without SCA, respectively (p = 0.009). In both groups, the prevalence of enuresis declined with age but remained five times higher at 25% in children with SCA aged 14-17 years compared with controls. Also, children with SCA and enuresis were older, more likely to have non-monosymptomatic enuresis and wet at least three nights per week than controls. Independent predictors of enuresis in children with SCA were a family history of enuresis and young age.Children with SCA had more frequent and more severe enuresis which persisted to late adolescence than age and sex-matched controls. These features indicate a subset of enuresis that is difficult to treat in the general population. Young age and enuresis in a family member define a subset of children with SCA more likely to have enuresis. Healthcare workers need to discuss enuresis with parents of children with SCA and offer referral to continence services."
https://openalex.org/W2885549873,"Background To date, little information exists on the costs of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) within maternal and child health (MCH) clinics in Kenya. The main objective of this analysis was to estimate the annual incremental cost of providing ART within a MCH clinic for adult women initiated on ART during pregnancy over the first one and two years on treatment. The study site was the District Hospital in Kericho, Kenya. Methods A micro-costing approach from the provider’s perspective, based on a retrospective review of patient medical records, was used to evaluate incremental costs of care (2012 USD). Cost per patient in two cohorts were evaluated: the MCH clinic group comprised of adult women who initiated ART at the site’s MCH clinic during pregnancy between 2008–2011; and for comparison, the ART clinic group comprised of adult, non-pregnant women who initiated ART at the site’s ART clinic during 2008–2011. The two groups were matched on age and baseline CD4 count at initiation. Retention at year one/two on ART was defined as having completed a clinic visit at 365/730 days on ART +/- 90 days. Results For patients defined as retained in care at year one, average incremental costs per patient were $234 for the MCH clinic group (median: 215; IQR: 186, 282) and $292 in the ART clinic group (median: 227; IQR: 178, 357). ARV and laboratory costs were less on average for the MCH clinic group compared to the ART clinic group (due to lower cost regimens and fewer tests), while personnel costs were higher for the MCH clinic group. Conclusions The annual incremental cost per patient of providing ART were similar in the two clinic settings in 2012. With shifts in recommended ARV regimens and lab monitoring over time, annual costs of care (using 2016 USD unit costs) have remained relatively constant in nominal terms for the MCH clinic group but have fallen substantially for the ART clinic group (from nominal $292 in 2012 to nominal $227 in 2016)."
https://openalex.org/W2887318855,"Species with large geographic distributions often exhibit complex patterns of diversity that can be further complicated by human activities. Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) are one of the most widely distributed freshwater fish species in western North America exhibiting substantial phenotypic and genetic variability; however, fish stocking practices have translocated populations outside of their native range and may have obscured intraspecific boundaries. This study focuses on cutthroat trout populations representing three distinct evolutionary clades that are found intermixed within a contact zone between the Bonneville and upper Snake River watersheds in the western United States. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite genetic data, as well as historical stocking records, to evaluate whether populations of cutthroat trout in the contact zone are native or are introduced. We found significant genetic differentiation and fine-scale genetic population structure that was organized primarily by watershed boundaries. While we detected increased genetic diversity in some areas in close proximity to the greatest number of stocking events, the highly organized population structure both within and between areas of the contact zone indicates that the populations are native to the watersheds. Intermixing of distinct evolutionary lineages of cutthroat trout appears to be the result of historical connections between paleodrainages. Our analyses provide a context for understanding how genetic data can be used to assess the status of populations as native or introduced."
https://openalex.org/W2886532736,"Mitochondrial disorders associated with genetic defects of the ATP synthase are among the most deleterious diseases of the neuromuscular system that primarily manifest in newborns. Nevertheless, the number of established animal models for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind such pathologies is limited. In this paper, we target the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding for the ATP synthase subunit c, ATPsynC, in order to create a fruit fly model for investigating defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics and to better understand the comprehensive pathological spectrum associated with mitochondrial ATP synthase dysfunctions. Using P-element and EMS mutagenesis, we isolated a set of mutations showing a wide range of effects, from larval lethality to complex pleiotropic phenotypes encompassing developmental delay, early adult lethality, hypoactivity, sterility, hypofertility, aberrant male courtship behavior, locomotor defects and aberrant gonadogenesis. ATPsynC mutations impair ATP synthesis and mitochondrial morphology, and represent a powerful toolkit for the screening of genetic modifiers that can lead to potential therapeutic solutions. Furthermore, the molecular characterization of ATPsynC mutations allowed us to better understand the genetics of the ATPsynC locus and to define three broad pathological consequences of mutations affecting the mitochondrial ATP synthase functionality in Drosophila: i) pre-adult lethality; ii) multi-trait pathology accompanied by early adult lethality; iii) multi-trait adult pathology. We finally predict plausible parallelisms with genetic defects of mitochondrial ATP synthase in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2887044047,"Compared with other subgroups of breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is considered to be the one with the greatest invasiveness and metastatic mobility, and the highest recurrence rate. Considering the lack of predictive markers for TNBC, we aimed to examine the contribution of excision repair cross complementing-group 1 (ERCC1) genotypes to TNBC. The rs11615 and rs3212986 of ERCC1 were investigated and evaluated for their associations with susceptibility to breast cancer, especially TNBC, in Taiwan. In this study, 1,232 breast cancer patients (104 were TNBC) and 1,232 healthy controls were recruited and their genotypes at ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986 were revealed by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Our results indicated that genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 (Ptrend = 2.2*10E-9), but not rs3212986 (Ptrend = 0.6181), were associated with breast cancer risk. In the allelic frequency distribution analysis, breast cancer patients carried the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 a higher rate than the control subjects, further supporting the idea that ERCC1 rs11615 TT genotype is positively associated with breast cancer susceptibility. More importantly, the frequency of the ERCC1 rs11615 TT genotype was even higher among TNBC patients than among other subtypes of breast cancer patients (P = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-2.63). The genotypes of ERCC1 rs11615 were not associated with Ki67 status. Our findings firstly show that the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 can serve as a predictive biomarker for breast cancer and TNBC. We believe that ERCC1 could serve as a target for personalized treatment of breast cancer, especially for TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2887853808,"Biological membranes contain a large variety of lipids species compartmentalized in different domains heterogeneous in size, composition and dynamics. Cholesterol induces membrane ordered domains thanks to its affinity for saturated lipids. Membrane domains had been studied with fluorescent probes either linked to phospholipids and proteins or as individual fluorophore. However, no efficient formulation of a cholesterol probe has been available so far. Herein, we described a cholesterol-pyrene probe behaviour in heterogeneous membranes. We characterised the pyrene fluorescence spectra in liquid-ordered (Lo) and liquid-disordered (Ld) membranes. Using statistical multivariate analysis, we found out the most appropriate wavelengths for membrane domains studies. 373 nm and 379 nm were the most discriminant wavelengths to follow the liquid-ordered and the liquid-disordered environments. Cholesterol clustering behaviour was quantified by the modulation of the cholesterol-pyrene excimers peak (474 nm). In liquid-ordered membranes at low temperature, cholesterol-pyrene was found as multimers and as monomers. At high temperature, the liquid-ordered status of the membrane decreases and cholesterol-pyrene tends to cluster. In liquid-disordered membranes, cholesterol-pyrene was present mostly as monomers and the small quantity of excimers increased with temperature. Cholesterol-pyrene was used to test the ceramide effect on membranes, and presented a behaviour in agreement with the cholesterol behaviour reported in the literature. Overall, the presented data show that cholesterol-pyrene is an efficient sensor to study liquid ordered and liquid disordered organisation in membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2886610897,"There are clinical trial data on risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI) with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in patients at increased cardiovascular (CV) risk requiring chronic daily treatment. This study investigated whether risks of acute MI with real-world prescription NSAIDs, such as low-dose or intermittent use, vary according to an individual's CV profile.Nested case-control analyses were carried out on an administrative health cohort from Quebec, Canada by randomly selecting 10 controls per case matched on age ± 1 year, sex, and month and year of cohort entry. We measured the additive joint effects on acute MI of current NSAID use and presence of hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), history of previous MI, or concomitant use of cardioprotective aspirin. The endpoint was the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). To verify the robustness of interaction findings, we performed sensitivity analyses with varying specifications of NSAID exposure-related variables.The cohort consisted of 233 816 elderly individuals, including 21 256 acute MI cases. For hypertension, CHD, and previous MI, we identified additive interactions on MI risk with some but not all NSAIDs, which also depended on the definition of NSAID exposure. Hypertension was sub-additive with naproxen but not with the other NSAIDs. Celecoxib and CHD were sub-additive in the primary analysis only (modelling NSAID dose on index date or up to 7 days before-best-fitting base model) whereas celecoxib and rofecoxib were super-additive with a history of previous MI in the secondary analysis only (modelling NSAID use on index date). For cardioprotective aspirin we found no evidence for an additive interaction with any of the NSAIDs.Alternative specifications of NSAID exposure concurred in finding that concomitant use of cardioprotective aspirin does not attenuate the risks of acute MI with NSAIDs. However we were unable to demonstrate consistent interactions between an individual's cardiovascular comorbidities and NSAID-associated acute MI. Our study highlights challenges of studying additive interactions in a healthcare database and underscores the need for sensitivity analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2887113742,"To assess changes and equity in antiretroviral therapy (ART) use in Kenya and South Africa.We analysed national population-based household surveys conducted in Kenya and South Africa between 2007 and 2012 for factors associated with lack of ART use among people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged 15-64 years. We considered ART use to be inequitable if significant differences in use were found between groups of PLHIV (e.g. by sex).ART use among PLHIV increased from 29.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.8-35.8) to 42.5% (95%CI: 37.4-47.7) from 2007 to 2012 in Kenya and 17.4% (95%CI: 14.2-20.9) to 30.3% (95%CI: 27.2-33.6) from 2008 to 2012 in South Africa. In 2012, factors independently associated with lack of ART use among adult Kenyan PLHIV were rural residency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.98, 95%CI: 1.23-3.18), younger age (15-24 years: aOR 4.25, 95%CI: 1.7-10.63, and 25-34 years: aOR 5.16, 95%CI: 2.73-9.74 versus 50-64 years), nondisclosure of HIV status to most recent sex partner (aOR 2.41, 95%CI: 1.27-4.57) and recent recreational drug use (aOR 2.50, 95%CI: 1.09-5.77). Among South African PLHIV in 2012, lack of ART use was significantly associated with younger age (15-24 years: aOR 4.23, 95%CI: 2.56-6.70, and 25-34 years: aOR 2.84, 95%CI: 1.73-4.67, versus 50-64 years), employment status (aOR 1.61, 95%CI: 1.16-2.23 in students versus unemployed), and recent recreational drug use (aOR 4.56, 95%CI: 1.79-11.57).Although we found substantial increases in ART use in both countries over time, we identified areas needing improvement including among rural Kenyans, students in South Africa, and among young people and drug users in both countries."
https://openalex.org/W2887137284,"Insect pests are one of the factors that most impact plant yield. The magnitude of the losses and the spatiotemporal pest distribution in crops is a result of their interactions with the environment. Therefore, the understanding of the causes of production losses and the pest spatial patterns is important for the development of suitable sampling plans and pest management programs. Thus, this study aimed to quantify grain losses caused by insects and to determine the spatial distribution pattern of arthropod pest species in Bt and non-Bt corn. The prevailing insect pests in the corn ears were the earworm and fall armyworm caterpillars (Helicoverpa spp. and Spodoptera frugiperda), the cornsilk fly (Euxesta spp.), the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais), and the square-necked grain beetle (Cathartus quadricollis). The non-Bt corn was more attacked by the caterpillars and the weevil, while Bt corn was more affected by the cornsilk fly Euxesta spp. Spatial dependence was significant for the damage caused by the caterpillars, the grain beetle and the maize weevil in both the Bt and non-Bt corn genotypes. The range of the damage caused by the insects was between 9.0–9.7 m for the caterpillars, 6.9–12.20 m for the cornsilk fly, 10.7–80.4 m for the square-necked grain beetle, and 51.9–170.7 m for the maize weevil. The pattern of the spatial distribution of pest damage in both corn genotypes (i.e., Bt and non-Bt corn) was similar with a prevalence of moderate to strong spatial dependence and aggregate damage distribution. The plants near to the sampling points exhibited injury and infestation levels similar to those of the sampled plants."
https://openalex.org/W2886420535,"For the development of efficient trawls to minimize catch loss, escape mortality and potential negative ecosystem impacts from the fishery, the understanding about trawl selectivity processes are crucial. Small crustaceans are regarded as being less motile than most fish species. Crustaceans also display low levels of active avoidance from trawl netting, which in turn may cause direct contact with netting on multiple occasions on their passage towards the codend increasing the probability for escapement. Full-scaled experiments to estimate gear selectivity are highly resource demanding and are highly technically challenging for several types of fisheries. In this study, we developed and tested a trawl-independent towed-rig construction designed to investigate size selectivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The results indicate that valid selectivity estimates can be obtained using this method, but due to the small sample size, results are inconclusive. However, the findings of the current study show a potential for developing easier and more cost-effective ways of investigating and estimating size selectivity of Antarctic krill and other small crustacean species in trawls."
https://openalex.org/W2886957002,"Background Cyanobacteria are one of the target groups of organisms explored for production of free fatty acids (FFAs) as biofuel precursors. Experimental evaluation of cyanobacterial potential for FFA production is costly and time consuming. Thus, computational approaches for comparing and ranking cyanobacterial strains for their potential to produce biofuel based on the characteristics of their predicted proteomes can be of great importance. Results To enable such comparison and ranking, and to assist biotechnology developers and researchers in selecting strains more likely to be successfully engineered for the FFA production, we developed the Biofuel Producer Screen (BioPS) platform (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/biops). BioPS relies on the estimation of the predicted proteome makeup of cyanobacterial strains to produce and secrete FFAs, based on the analysis of well-studied cyanobacterial strains with known FFA production profiles. The system links results back to various external repositories such as KEGG, UniProt and GOLD, making it easier for users to explore additional related information. Conclusion To our knowledge, BioPS is the first tool that screens and evaluates cyanobacterial strains for their potential to produce and secrete FFAs based on strain’s predicted proteome characteristics, and rank strains based on that assessment. We believe that the availability of such a platform (comprising both a prediction tool and a repository of pre-evaluated stains) would be of interest to biofuel researchers. The BioPS system will be updated annually with information obtained from newly sequenced cyanobacterial genomes as they become available, as well as with new genes that impact FFA production or secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2885173183,"Objectives To investigate associations between perceived autonomy support from health-care professionals, autonomy-driven motivation, diabetes self-perceived competence and self-esteem in adults (age 18–55 yrs) with suboptimally regulated type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with at least one HbA1c≥8.0% (≥64 mmol/mol) during the past year, and whether these factors could predict decrease in self-esteem over time. Methods A cross-sectional population-based survey was performed, and 9 months follow-up data were collected. Data collection comprised clinical and socio-demographic variables, blood sampling (HbA1c) and self-report questionnaires; the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (HCCQ), Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ), the Perceived Competence in Diabetes Scale (PCDS), and the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES). We fitted block-wise linear regression models to assess associations between RSES and variables of interest (HCCQ, TSRQ, PCDS, HbA1c, clinical and socio-demographic variables) and linear regression models to assess predictors of change over time. Findings In this study sample, aged 36.7 (±10.7) mean HbA1c 9.3% (±1.1), 31.5% had long-term complications and 42.7% had experienced severe hypoglycemia within the previous 12 months. In the final regression model the association between PCDS and RSES was strongly significant (B = 1.99, p<0.001) and the associations between HCCQ, TSRQ and RSES were reduced to non-significance. All predictor variables combined explained 42% of the variability of RSES (adjusted R2 = 0.423) with PCDS contributing 18% to explained variance (R-square change = 0.184, p<0.001). The strongest predictors of change in RSES over time were long-term complications (B = 2.76, p<0.001), specifically foot-related problems, and being female (B = -2.16, p = 0.002). Conclusions Perceived autonomy support, autonomy-driven motivation and diabetes self-perceived competence play a significant role in explaining self-esteem among adults with suboptimally regulated T1DM. Healthcare professionals should acknowledge self-esteem as a valuable factor in understanding the multifaceted health choices people with T1DM make.

https://openalex.org/W2885152243,"True oceanic islands typically host reduced species diversity together with high levels of endemism, which make these environmental set-ups ideal for the exploration of species diversification drivers. In the present study, we used black fly species (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Reunion Island as a model to highlight the main drivers of insect species diversification in this young and remote volcanic island located in the Southwestern Indian Ocean. Using local and regional (Comoros and Seychelles archipelagos) samples as well as specimens from continental Africa, we tested the likelihood of two distinct scenarios, i.e. multiple colonizations vs. in-situ diversification. For this, posterior odds were used to test whether species from Reunion did form a monophyletic group and we estimated divergence times between species. Three out of the four previously described Reunion black fly species could be sampled, namely Simulium ruficorne, Simulium borbonense and Simulium triplex. The phylogenies based on nuclear and mitochondrial markers showed that S. ruficorne and S. borbonense are the most closely related species. Interestingly, we report a probable mitochondrial introgression between these two species although they diverged almost six million years ago. Finally, we showed that the three Reunion species did not form a monophyletic group, and, combined with the molecular datation, the results indicated that Reunion black fly diversity resulted from multiple colonization events. Thus, multiple colonizations, rather than in-situ diversification, are likely responsible for an important part of black fly diversity found on this young Darwinian island."
https://openalex.org/W2885289769,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is considered a sentinel marker for poor general men's health status. Severe ED has been associated with poor response to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) therapy. We sought to assess the association of multiple PDE5Is prescription with the overall patients' health status. Socio-demographic and clinical variables from 939 consecutive white-European, heterosexual, sexually-active men seeking medical help for ED at same tertiary-referral academic outpatient clinic were analyzed. Health-significant comorbidities were scored with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Patients have been stratified into naïve and non-naïve according to their history of previous prescriptions of any PDE5I. Every patient completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Logistic regression models tested the association between patients' baseline characteristics (thus including previous PDE5Is prescriptions) and the overall health status. Overall, 328 (35%) patients were non-naïve for PDE5Is. Of them, 172 (52%), 99 (30%), and 57 (17%) had been prescribed with 1, 2 or 3 different PDE5Is, respectively. Naïve and non-naïve patients did not differ in terms of age, BMI, baseline ED severity; conversely, non-naïve patients had a higher CCI score. At logistic MVA, the number of PDE5Is prescriptions emerged as an independent predictor of a higher burden of comorbidities regardless of ED severity; the higher the number of PDE5Is prescriptions, the higher the CCI score (OR 1.69, 2.49, and 2.90 for 1, 2 or 3 previous PDE5Is, respectively), after accounting for age, BMI, baseline ED severity and cigarette smoking. More than a third of patients seeking medical help for ED at a single tertiary-referral center were non-naïve for PDE5Is. The increasing number of previous prescriptions of PDE5Is emerged as a worrisome marker of a poorer overall men's health status regardless of ED severity."
