https://openalex.org/W1994994441,"Circadian rhythms govern a large array of metabolic and physiological functions. The central clock protein CLOCK has HAT properties. It directs acetylation of histone H3 and of its dimerization partner BMAL1 at Lys537, an event essential for circadian function. We show that the HDAC activity of the NAD(+)-dependent SIRT1 enzyme is regulated in a circadian manner, correlating with rhythmic acetylation of BMAL1 and H3 Lys9/Lys14 at circadian promoters. SIRT1 associates with CLOCK and is recruited to the CLOCK:BMAL1 chromatin complex at circadian promoters. Genetic ablation of the Sirt1 gene or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 activity lead to disturbances in the circadian cycle and in the acetylation of H3 and BMAL1. Finally, using liver-specific SIRT1 mutant mice we show that SIRT1 contributes to circadian control in vivo. We propose that SIRT1 functions as an enzymatic rheostat of circadian function, transducing signals originated by cellular metabolites to the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2042500733,"<h2>Summary</h2> The mammalian circadian timing system is composed of a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain that synchronizes countless subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues. The rhythm-generating mechanism is thought to rely on a feedback loop involving positively and negatively acting transcription factors. BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the expression of <i>Period</i> (<i>Per</i>) and <i>Cryptochrome</i> (<i>Cry</i>) genes, and once PER and CRY proteins accumulate to a critical level they form complexes with BMAL1-CLOCK heterodimers and thereby repress the transcription of their own genes. Here, we show that SIRT1, an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, is required for high-magnitude circadian transcription of several core clock genes, including <i>Bmal1</i>, <i>Rorγ</i>, <i>Per2</i>, and <i>Cry1</i>. SIRT1 binds CLOCK-BMAL1 in a circadian manner and promotes the deacetylation and degradation of PER2. Given the NAD<sup>+</sup> dependence of SIRT1 deacetylase activity, it is likely that SIRT1 connects cellular metabolism to the circadian core clockwork circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2156095709,"Plant-parasitic nematodes are major agricultural pests worldwide and novel approaches to control them are sorely needed. We report the draft genome sequence of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, a biotrophic parasite of many crops, including tomato, cotton and coffee. Most of the assembled sequence of this asexually reproducing nematode, totaling 86 Mb, exists in pairs of homologous but divergent segments. This suggests that ancient allelic regions in M. incognita are evolving toward effective haploidy, permitting new mechanisms of adaptation. The number and diversity of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes in M. incognita is unprecedented in any animal for which a genome sequence is available, and may derive from multiple horizontal gene transfers from bacterial sources. Our results provide insights into the adaptations required by metazoans to successfully parasitize immunocompetent plants, and open the way for discovering new antiparasitic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2039790548,"Strikingly consistent correlations between rates of coding-sequence evolution and gene expression levels are apparent across taxa, but the biological causes behind the selective pressures on coding-sequence evolution remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate conserved patterns of simple covariation between sequence evolution, codon usage, and mRNA level in E. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human that suggest that all observed trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease."

High levels of ROS can trigger cell death, whereas lower levels drive diverse and important cellular functions. We show here by employing a newly developed mitochondrial matrix-targeted superoxide indicator, that individual mitochondria undergo spontaneous bursts of superoxide generation, termed “superoxide flashes.” Superoxide flashes occur randomly in space and time, exhibit all-or-none properties, and provide a vital source of superoxide production across many different cell types. Individual flashes are triggered by transient openings of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore stimulating superoxide production by the ETC. Furthermore, we observe a flurry of superoxide flash activity during reoxygenation of cardiomyocytes after hypoxia, which is inhibited by the cardioprotective compound adenosine.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a class of radical or non-radical oxygen-containing molecules that display high reactivity with lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Depending on concentration, location and context, ROS can be either “friends” or “foes.” Excessive ROS generation leads to apoptotic and necrotic cell death (Brookes et al., 2004Brookes P.S. Yoon Y.

However, increasing evidence indicates that homeostatic and physiological levels of ROS are indispensable in regulating diverse cellular processes including ion channel/transporter function (Zima and Blatter, 2006Zima A.V.

Free radicals in the physiological control of cell function.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95PubMed Google Scholar). The emerging view is that ROS contribute to multiple essential intracellular signaling processes ranging from cell metabolism to ischemic preconditioning (Droege, 2002Droege W.

In quiescent cells, ROS are primarily produced as byproducts of mitochondrial respiration when electrons leak from the electron transfer chain (ETC) (Wallace, 2001aWallace D.C.

Superoxide anion (O2•−) is the primary ROS generated by the ETC and is dismutated to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) either spontaneously or by superoxide dismutase (SOD). Recent studies have demonstrated massive increases in localized ROS production during metabolic stress (Romashko et al., 1998Romashko D.N. Marban E. O'Rourke B.

Rep. 1997; 17: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) that ultimately contribute to necrotic or apoptotic cell death. The present study reports the surprising discovery of a quantal mode of mitochondrial ROS production under resting conditions in diverse cell types. The development of a highly sensitive superoxide indicator with high-contrast and reversible kinetics enables real-time imaging of superoxide production at the level of single mitochondria, and uncovers individual, ∼10 s long superoxide-producing events within the mitochondrial matrix. Such quantal mitochondrial ROS production events are controlled by a novel functional coupling between the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the complexes of ETC. Moreover, we demonstrate that superoxide flash events contribute to increased oxidative stress during cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury and represent a target of pharmacological preconditioning. ROS exist in many different interconvertable forms (e.g., H2O2, O2•−, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite, etc). The paucity of species-specific and reversible probes for ROS detection in living cells has seriously limited molecular investigations of ROS signaling dynamics. By serendipity, we found that a circularly permuted yellow fluorescent protein (cpYFP), previously used as the core structure for the Ca2+ indicator pericam (Nagai et al., 2001Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Circularly permuted green fluorescent proteins engineered to sense Ca2+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), is a novel biosensor for O2•−, the primal ROS generated by the ETC. The fluorescence emission (at 515 nm) of purified cpYFP when excited at 488 nm is five times brighter under strong oxidizing conditions (1 mM aldrithiol) compared to strong reducing conditions (10 mM reduced DTT, Figure 1A), indicative of a large dynamic range. Extensive in vitro experiments revealed the superoxide selectivity of cpYFP over other physiologically relevant oxidants and metabolites (Figures 1 and S1 available online). Compared to the fully reduced state, cpYFP fluorescence displays a 250% increase by oxygenation and a full 420% increase by O2•− (generated by 2 mM xanthine and 20 mU xanthine oxidase under aerobic conditions, Figure 1B). The O2•− associated increase in cpYFP fluorescence is completely reversed by subsequent addition of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD, 600 U/ml) or prevented by prior addition of SOD (Figures 1B and S1A). By contrast, cpYFP emission is unchanged by H2O2 (0.1–10 mM, Figure 1C) and peroxynitrite (Figure S1B), and is decreased by hydroxyl radical (Figure 1C) and nitric oxide (Figure S1C). Other metabolites tested, including physiological levels of Ca2+, ATP, ADP, NAD(P)+, and NAD(P)H, all exert negligible or only marginal effects (Figures 1D, 1E, S1D, and S1E). Unlike GFP-based redox biosensors (Hanson et al., 2004Hanson G.T. Aggeler R. Oglesbee D. Cannon M. Capaldi R.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J. Investigating mitochondrial redox potential with redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein indicators.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13044-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, Ostergaard et al., 2001Ostergaard H. Henriksen A. Hansen F.G. Winther J.R. Shedding light on disulfide bond formation: engineering a redox switch in green fluorescent protein.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5853-5862Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the fluorescence emission of cpYFP is unaltered when the redox potential varies between −319 mV and −7.5 mV (produced by differential mixing of reduced and oxidized DTT, Figure 1F). As would be expected of a fluorescent protein-based indicator (Belousov et al., 2006Belousov V.V. Fradkov A.F. Lukyanov K.A. Staroverov D.B. Shakhbazov K.S. Terskikh A.V. Lukyanov S.

Miyawaki A. Circularly permuted green fluorescent proteins engineered to sense Ca2+.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), cpYFP emission is brighter in an alkaline environment, such as that within the mitochondrial matrix (pH ∼8.0, Figure S1F). These results indicate that cpYFP can be judiciously used as a genetically encoded biosensor of superoxide anions. Compared to mito-SOX, an ethidium bromide (EB) derivative that reacts with O2•− and then fluoresces upon irreversible binding to mitochondrial DNA, a major advantage of cpYFP is its reversibility that permits real-time measurements of dynamic changes in superoxide levels in living cells (see below). We employed adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to express cpYFP in the mitochondrial matrix of cultured adult cardiac myocytes using the cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) targeting sequence (mt-cpYFP). Confocal imaging revealed that mt-cpYFP stains bundle-like subcellular structures punctuated at Z-lines of the sarcomere (Figure 2A), in agreement with the known spatial organization of cardiac mitochondria (Ramesh et al., 1998Ramesh V. Sharma V.K. Sheu S.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Structural proximity of mitochondria to calcium release units in rat ventricular myocardium may suggest a role in Ca2+ sequestration.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 341-344Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Strikingly, localized and transient “flashes” of mt-cpYFP fluorescence occur stochastically amidst a quiescent background in resting cardiomyocytes (Figures 2A and 2B and Movie S1). A typical flash rises abruptly, peaks in 3.5 ± 0.1 s, and dissipates with a half time of 8.6 ± 0.2 s (n = 409 flashes from 53 cells, Figures 2B, 2H, and 2I). The average fractional peak increase of mt-cpYFP fluorescence (ΔF/F0) during a flash is 0.41 ± 0.02 (Figure 2G); the top 10% brightest events display a ΔF/F0 of 1.0 ± 0.1 (n = 41), which most likely reflects the true amplitude without out-of-focus blurring. While mitochondrial flashes occur randomly in space and time, individual events are sharply confined to tiny elliptical areas each spanning 0.94 ± 0.01 μm laterally and 1.68 ± 0.03 μm longitudinally (n = 409). These results indicate that a flash arises from a single or pair of functionally coupled mitochondria. The quiescence of adjacent mitochondria during a flash (Figure 2A) indicates that mitochondrial flashes do not propagate under normal experimental conditions. Because a 5-fold increase in scanning laser intensity did not elevate the rate of flash production (Figure S2), spontaneous mitochondrial flashes are not due to phototoxicity. Moreover, experiments using a mitochondrial-targeted EYFP as a pH biosensor (Takahashi et al., 2001Takahashi A. Zhang Y. Centonze E. Herman B. Measurement of mitochondrial pH in situ.Biotechniques. 2001; 30: 804-808, 810, 812 passimCrossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) fail to detect transient events of mitochondrial alkalinization with a similar frequency and time course as that of mt-cpYFP flashes (Figure S3), excluding the possibility that flashes reflect transient alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix. Rather, several lines of evidence indicate that flashes reflect bursts of O2•−-producing events, named “superoxide flashes.” First, application of MnTMPyP (50 μM), a SOD mimetic, decreases flash frequency by 83% and amplitude by 50% (ΔF/F0 = 0.18 ± 0.02, n = 12; p < 0.01 versus control; Figures 2C and 2D). Second, tiron (1 mM), a superoxide scavenger, similarly diminishes flash frequency and amplitude (Figures 2C and 2D), supporting the O2•− origin of mt-cpYFP flashes. Further, while mild uncoupling by 50 nM FCCP increases flavoprotein and decreases NADH autofluoresence due to their oxidation, it does not alter mt-cpYFP fluorescence (Figure S4). These results confirm that mt-cpYFP is not a nonspecific redox sensor. Finally, substituting the only two cysteine residues in mt-cpYFP with either alanine (C171A/C193A) or methionine (C171M/C193M) decreases basal probe fluorescence and renders the cysteine-free mt-cpYFP mutants insensitive to aldrithiol (Figure S5). Moreover, mitochondrial flash activity is not observed in cardiac cells expressing either mt-cpYFP double mutant (n = 15 cells), indicating that C171 and C193 contribute to a reactive center for O2•− sensing. Collectively, evidence presented thus far demonstrates the presence of quantal events of mitochondrial O2•− production in cultured cardiomyocytes. Superoxide flashes are not limited to cardiac cells, but are also observed in a wide range of cell types including neurons, neuroendocrine cells, skeletal myotubes, and non-excitable fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells (Figures 2E–2I). Figure 2E illustrates representative superoxide flashes in spaghetti-shaped mitochondria recorded from primary cultured hippocampal neurons, indicating the reversibility of the flash-generating mechanism within individual mitochondria. Interestingly, superoxide flash frequency varies considerably between cell types. Flash frequency is 3.8 ± 0.5 (n = 53 cells) in adult cardiac myocytes, 31 ± 4 (n = 24 cells) in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, and 63 ± 6 (events per 1000 μm2 cell area per 100 s, n = 37 cells) in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Figure 2F), suggesting cell type-specific regulation of quantal mitochondrial superoxide production. Despite variations in flash incidence and mitochondrial morphology among different cell types, superoxide flashes exhibit comparable properties (Figures 2G–2I), consistent with a common mechanism underlying superoxide flash genesis in all cells. Thus, real-time superoxide imaging uncovers intermittent, quantal bursts of O2•− production within the mitochondrial matrix of all cell types tested. To confirm that mitochondrial superoxide flash activity is not an artifact of cell culture and viral transfection, we generated cardiac-specific mt-cpYFP transgenic mice (Figures 3A and 3B). Superoxide flashes of similar characteristics are detected in cardiac myocytes freshly isolated from these mice (Figure 3C). Furthermore, mitochondrial superoxide flash events are also visualized by high-resolution ex vivo imaging of mitochondria in the myocardium of intact, Langendorff-perfused and beating hearts (Figure 3D). We next explored the mechanism underlying mitochondrial superoxide flash genesis. Clues from superoxide flash characteristics are indicative of a sudden, all-or-none excitation of mitochondrial O2•−-producing machinery. In isolated mitochondria, increased electron flow may cause dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and reduce ROS generation (Brand et al., 2004Brand M.D. Affourtit C. Esteves T.C.

Med. 2004; 37: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence in intact cells indicates that brief openings of the mPTP by metabolic stress (Romashko et al., 1998Romashko D.N. Marban E. O'Rourke B.

USA. 1998; 95: 1618-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), photostimulation (Zorov et al., 2000Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R. Klotz L.O. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J.

The mitochondrial permeability transition pore and its role in cell death.Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). While sustained mPTP activation is associated with cell injury and death due to its involvement in cytochrome c release and mitochondrial swelling (Crompton, 1999Crompton M. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore and its role in cell death.Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar), several reports indicate that transient, sub-conductance mPTP openings also occur under physiological conditions (Ichas et al., 1997Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Mitochondria are excitable organelles capable of generating and conveying electrical and calcium signals.Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, Petronilli et al., 1999Petronilli V. Miotto G. Canton M. Brini M. Colonna R. Bernardi P. Di Lisa F.

J. 1999; 76: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Therefore, stochastic openings of the mPTP in quiescent cells may trigger superoxide flash genesis. To test this hypothesis, we labeled mt-cpYFP expressing myocytes with TMRM, a ΔΨm indicator whose fluorescence signal is spectrally separable from that of mt-cpYFP (Figure 4A). Simultaneous measurement of TMRM and mt-cpYFP signals reveals that every superoxide flash coincides with a transient decrease in ΔΨm (n = 89 events from 19 cells, a representative trace is shown in Figure 4B). On the other hand, not every transient depolarization is accompanied by a superoxide flash (n = 40 events from 5 cells, a representative trace is shown in Figure 4C). Further, superoxide flashes always coincide with a rapid and irreversible reduction in mitochondrial-entrapped rhod-2 fluorescence (752 Da, commonly used as a Ca2+ indicator, n = 8, Figure 4D), suggesting that a fraction of rhod-2 leaks out of the matrix through the mPTP during a superoxide flash. If transient mPTP openings trigger superoxide flashes, then manipulation of mPTP activity should alter superoxide flash frequency. Indeed, bongkrekic acid (BA, 100 μM), an inhibitor of the adenine nucleotide translocator that causes a conformation-dependent inhibition of the mPTP, attenuates the incidence of superoxide flashes to 33% of control while also decreasing their amplitude and abbreviating their kinetics (Figure 4E). Similar results are observed with cyclosporine A (1 μM, Figure 4E), a mPTP inhibitor that binds to cyclophilin D and also inhibits calcineurin (Bernardi, 1996Bernardi P.

Conversely, mPTP activation by atractyloside (20 μM) significantly augments superoxide flash frequency (Figure 4E). Given significant limitations inherent in pharmacological manipulation of mPTP activity, we also determined the effect of RNA interference (siRNA) knockdown of cyclophilin D, a critical component of the mPTP (Baines et al., 2005Baines C.P.

USA. 2005; 102: 12005-12010Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Knockdown of cyclophilin D (70.0 ± 1.3% of control, n = 4, p < 0.05, Figure 4F) by two sets of siRNA constructs causes a similar diminution in superoxide flash activity (75% of control, n = 53-57, p < 0.05, Figure 4F). Taken together, we conclude that mPTP openings are both necessary and sufficient for triggering superoxide flashes in quiescent cells. In this regard, superoxide flash activity provides a powerful means for tracking transient mPTP activity in living cells. The brief, highly localized and quantal nature of mitochondrial superoxide flash activity is analogous to another elementary intracellular signaling event - Ca2+ sparks, which arise from openings of an array of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum (Cheng et al., 1993Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Cannell M.B. Calcium sparks: elementary events underlying excitation-contraction coupling in heart muscle.Science. 1993; 262: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that mitochondria adjacent to local sites of Ca2+ release are able to sequester a fraction of the Ca2+ released during a Ca2+ spark (Ramesh et al., 1998Ramesh V. Sharma V.K. Sheu S.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Structural proximity of mitochondria to calcium release units in rat ventricular myocardium may suggest a role in Ca2+ sequestration.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 341-344Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Since an increase in matrix Ca2+ activates the mPTP (Duchen, 2000Duchen M.R. Mitochondria and Ca2+ in cell physiology and pathophysiology.Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we explored the relationship between Ca2+ sparks and mitochondrial superoxide flashes. In adult cardiac myocytes, the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks outnumbers that of spontaneous superoxide flashes by two orders of magnitude (Figure S6). More importantly, superoxide flash frequency is unaltered by either a 2-fold increase (caffeine 1 mM) or an abolition of Ca2+ sparks (ryanodine and thapsigargin both at 10 μM for 15 min, Figure S6). These results exclude Ca2+ sparks as an obligatory trigger for superoxide flash production. We next determined the molecular mechanism of mPTP-mediated ROS generation. Previous studies have suggested that brief mPTP openings trigger massive electron leakage from the ETC due to altered membrane fluidity or rigidity (Mannella, 2006Mannella C.A. Structure and dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane cristae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Zorov et al., 2000Zorov D.B. Filburn C.R.

Med. 2000; 192: 1001-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) and conformational changes in proteins of the ETC (Batandier et al., 2004Batandier C. Leverve X. Fontaine E. Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore induces reactive oxygen species production at the level of the respiratory chain complex I.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17197-17204Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that ETC activity represents the source of mPTP-triggered superoxide flash production. To test this hypothesis, we used ρ° 143B TK− human osteosarcoma cells that are devoid of mitochondrial DNA. In this cell model, mitochondrial respiration is abrogated altogether due to the absence of mitochondrial DNA-encoded ETC proteins (King and Attardi, 1989King M.P. Attardi G. Human cells lacking mtDNA: repopulation with exogenous mitochondria by complementation.Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). In wild-type 143B cells, robust superoxide flash activity is observed at a rate of 25 ± 4 events per 1000 μm2 cell area per 100 s (n = 21 cells, Figures 5A and 5C). However, superoxide flashes are completely absent in ρ° cells (n = 20, Figures 5B and 5D) and are not revived by the mPTP activator atractyloside (Figures 5E and 5F). These results are consistent with superoxide flash production requiring ETC activity. We also created an ETC defective (ρ−) cell model through inhibiting mitochondrial DNA replication in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells by incubation with EB (200 ng/ml) for up to 60 days (Biswas et al., 1999Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G.

EB-induced partial deprivation of mitochondrial DNA in ρ− PC12 cells results in a parallel decrease in both cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COX-1) expression (30% of control) and superoxide flash frequency (40% of control, from 63 ± 6 to 23 ± 3 events per 1000 μm2 cell area per 100 s, n = 37-46 cells, Figure 5G). Finally, superoxide flash activity in cardiac myocytes and PC12 cells is abolished following blockade of electron flow at complex I, III and IV by rotenone"

The SILAC-mouse approach is a versatile tool by which to quantitatively compare proteomes from knockout mice and thereby determine protein functions under complex in vivo conditions. The administration of radioactive or stable isotope tracers to animals is a well established technique by which to investigate the rate of protein synthesis and protein degradation. (Wolfe and Chinkes, 2005Wolfe R.R. Chinkes D.L. Isotope tracers in metabolic research. Wiley-LISS, New Jersey2005Google Scholar). This technology has been used for many decades (Schoenheimer and Rittenberg, 1935Schoenheimer R. Rittenberg D. Deuterium as an indicator in the study of intermediary metabolism.Science. 1935; 82: 156-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The infusion of stable isotopes (13C or 15N) as tracers combined with measurements of 13CO2 or 15N in urinary urea or ammonia is a broadly used technique by which to explore the amino acid flux in metabolic pathways (Bier, 1997Bier D.M.

Extensive incorporation of 13C or 15N stable isotopes does not result in discernable health effects of the treated animals (Doherty and Beynon, 2006Doherty M.K. Beynon R.J.

In addition, nonsaturated labeling of a chicken, by using the essential amino acid valine, allows for the MS-based analysis of protein turnover rates in vivo (Doherty et al., 2005Doherty M.K.

Proteome dynamics in complex organisms: using stable isotopes to monitor individual protein turnover rates.Proteomics. 2005; 5: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has previously described stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Mann, 2006Mann M. Functional and quantitative proteomics using SILAC.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Ong et al., 2002Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M.

Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (4315) Google Scholar), which has unique advantages for quantitative and functional proteomics because of its inherent accuracy of quantitation and the ease of interpretation of MS results (Blagoev et al., 2004Blagoev B.

Mechanism of divergent growth factor effects in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.Science. 2005; 308: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In a SILAC experiment, two cell populations are generated: one in a medium that contains the natural amino acid (i.e., 12C6-lysine), and the other in a medium that contains the heavy isotope-substituted version (i.e., 13C6-lysine). This allows for direct comparison of protein expression levels by mixing the nonlabeled “light” and the labeled “heavy” cell populations (Cox and Mann, 2007Cox J. Mann M. Is proteomics the new genomics?.Cell. 2007; 130: 395-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Each peptide appears as a pair in MS analysis with a difference in mass of 6 Da, and the relative peak intensities reflect the abundance ratios. To date, SILAC labeling has been limited to cell culture or microorganisms. To extend this powerful technique to higher organisms, Oda and coworkers have SILAC labeled the Neuro 2A cell line to serve as an internal standard for quantitation of a subset of peptides of the mouse brain proteome (Ishihama et al., 2005Ishihama Y. Sato T. Tabata T. Miyamoto N. Sagane K. Nagasu T. Oda Y. Quantitative mouse brain proteomics using culture-derived isotope tags as internal standards.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report the development of a mouse SILAC diet that leads to complete labeling of the F2 generation. We used in vivo SILAC quantitation to analyze newly synthesized proteins from plasma and tissue samples in vivo. Furthermore, we validated our in vivo quantitation system by comparing the proteomes from platelets, heart, and erythrocytes from β1 integrin-, β-Parvin-, and Kindlin-3-deficient mice, respectively. Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, consist of α and β subunits, are ubiquitously expressed, and perform cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion functions. Association of the corresponding α and β subunits is required for their stability and transport to the plasma membrane, as single subunits are not stable and are rapidly degraded. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion triggers intracellular signaling pathways (outside-in signaling) that control migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells. Prior to ligand binding, integrins require an energy-dependent activation step, which is triggered within the cell (inside-out signaling) and is characterized by a profound conformational change in both integrin subunits. Although the mechanism(s) underlying integrin activation are far from understood, it is believed that the binding of the FERM-domain-containing adaptor proteins talin and Kindlin to the integrin β cytoplasmic domains represents the last step in the activation pathway (Calderwood, 2004Calderwood D.A. Integrin activation.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, Moser et al., 2008Moser M. Nieswandt B. Ussar S. Pozgajova M. Fässler R. Kindlin-3 is essential for integrin activation and platelet aggregation.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (Published online February 17, 2008): 325-330https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Upon activation and ligand binding, integrins recruit and assemble a multiprotein complex at the site of cell adhesion that fulfils two major tasks: it connects the extracellular matrix with the actin cytoskeleton, and it alters the fluxes of many intracellular signaling pathways. A preformed complex consisting of the three proteins, ILK, PINCH, and Parvin, represents an important component of the integrin adhesion complex (Legate et al., 2006Legate K.R. Montanez E. Kudlacek O. Fassler R. ILK, PINCH and parvin: the tIPP of integrin signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 20-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Parvins comprise a family of three proteins, α-, β- and γ-Parvin, that directly bind to ILK, F-actin, and other actin-associated proteins, thereby linking the adhesion complex to the actin cytoskeleton and controlling actin dynamics. Kindlins have recently been identified within the integrin-mediated cell adhesion complex and represent an additional family of ILK-binding proteins (Montanez et al., 2007Montanez E. Piwko-Czuchra A. Bauer M. Li S. Yurchenco P. Fassler R. Analysis of integrin functions in peri-implantation embryos, hematopoietic system, and skin.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 426: 239-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). They consist of three members (Kindlin-1–3) and are named after the gene mutated in Kindler syndrome, an autosomal recessive skin blister disease in humans. Kindlin-3 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, and the highest levels are in megakaryocytes (Ussar et al., 2006Ussar S. Wang H.V. Linder S. Fassler R. Moser M. The Kindlins: subcellular localization and expression during murine development.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3142-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Kindlin-3 gene in mice results in severe anemia, which is thought to be due to a bleeding defect caused by impaired activation of platelet integrins, defects in platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation (Moser et al., 2008Moser M. Nieswandt B. Ussar S. Pozgajova M. Fässler R. Kindlin-3 is essential for integrin activation and platelet aggregation.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (Published online February 17, 2008): 325-330https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To screen for potential defects in other cellular compartments of the hematopoietic system in Kindlin-3-deficient mice, we compared their proteome with those from control mice. During the course of these studies, we discovered a deficit of structural proteins in the plasma membrane of Kindlin-3-deficient erythrocytes, which contributes to the severe anemia seen in Kindlin-3-deficient mice. We prepared a SILAC diet by mixing 13C6-lysine or 12C6-lysine into a customized lysine-free mouse diet to a final concentration of 1% (Figure 1A) according to standard mouse nutritional requirements (Benevenga et al., 1995Benevenga N.J. Calvert C. Eckhert C.D. Fahey G.C. Greger J.L. Keen C.L. Knapka J.J. Magalhaes H. Oftedal O.T. Nutrient requirements of the mouse.in: Overton J. Nutrient Requirements of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 192Google Scholar). The amino acid content was subsequently checked by hydrolysis and cation exchange chromatography (Figure S1 available online). We first tested whether the diet permits normal weight gain by feeding mice with a regular diet or the SILAC diet (with 12C6-lysine or 13C6-lysine). During an observation period of 4 weeks, all animals showed the same food consumption and a similar increase in body weight of about 17% (Figures S2A and S2B), normal fertility, and motor activity irrespective of the diet consumed. Furthermore, we SILAC labeled mice over four generations (see below), indicating that the labeling is compatible with normal development and physiology. Thus, we conclude that SILAC labeling with a 13C6-substituted essential amino acid diet does not lead to obvious discernable health effects in mice (Figure 1B). To track 13C6-lysine incorporation into the proteome over time, we sampled blood each week for 4 weeks. Serum proteins were separated on 1D gels in triplicate, in-gel digested, and analyzed by high-resolution MS. The average relative standard deviation of all quantified proteins was ∼20% (Figure 1C), an accuracy similar to what was seen in previous SILAC quantitation experiments (Blagoev et al., 2004Blagoev B. Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Temporal analysis of phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling networks by quantitative proteomics.Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, Ong et al., 2003Ong S.E. Kratchmarova I. Mann M. Properties of 13C-substituted arginine in stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC).J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As an example of different incorporation levels, SILAC peptide pairs of three serum proteins and one red blood cell protein are shown in Figure 1C. For serum albumin, we observed a SILAC ratio of 1:3.2, indicating that at least 74% of the protein had been newly synthesized during the first week of feeding. Because proteins can be synthesized from dietary amino acids as well as from amino acids derived by protein catabolism, this value is a lower limit for the true turnover (Beynon and Pratt, 2005Beynon R.J. Pratt J.M. Metabolic labeling of proteins for proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After 4 weeks, the three serum proteins were labeled to 90%. In contrast, hemoglobin was only labeled to 57% after 4 weeks (Figure 1C), due to the 60-day half-life of mouse erythrocytes (Berlin et al., 1959Berlin N.I. Waldmann T.A. Weissman S.M. Life span of red blood cell.Physiol. Rev. 1959; 39: 577-616PubMed Google Scholar). Additional profiles of blood proteins are listed in Table S1. Next, we measured the labeling efficiencies of a number of organs after 4 weeks of feeding with the SILAC diet. Proteins from heart showed an average protein ratio of 1:4.4 (Figure 2A; Table S2), much lower than the serum proteins. Furthermore, the distribution of SILAC ratios was relatively broad, reflecting the different incorporation rates of individual cell types and the “contamination” of serum proteins in nonperfused samples. For example, serum albumin has a similarly high incorporation rate in blood (ratio 9) and heart (ratio 10) (Figures 1C and 2A). In contrast to heart tissue, in which most cells are quiescent, the intestinal epithelium regenerates within a few days (Radtke and Clevers, 2005Radtke F. Clevers H. Self-renewal and cancer of the gut: two sides of a coin.Science. 2005; 307: 1904-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Disaggregating the epithelium from the digestive tube resulted in a more homogeneous cell pool consisting of only a few cell types. As a consequence, we observed a high SILAC ratio of 1:9.1 ± 2.1 reflecting a labeling efficiency of more than 90% (Figure 2B), which is fully consistent with the high proliferation rate of this tissue. For example, villin-1, a marker for epithelial cells from the digestive system, showed a SILAC ratio of 1:10. Liver has a number of different physiological roles, including carrying out metabolic functions and producing major blood proteins. Accordingly, we observed a wide distribution of SILAC-incorporation ratios among liver proteins. Hepatocytes are the predominant liver cell type, and they are very rich in mitochondria. To demonstrate that in vivo SILAC ratios can be measured with subcellular resolution, we isolated mitochondria from liver cells (Forner et al., 2006Forner F. Foster L.J. Campanaro S. Valle G. Mann M. Quantitative proteomic comparison of rat mitochondria from muscle, heart, and liver.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 608-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and compared their labeling ratios to whole-cell lysates from the same sample (Figure 2C, black bars). Interestingly, proteins from mitochondria showed an average SILAC ratio of 1:8.6 ± 2.4. This shows that the incorporation rates of an organelle are more narrowly distributed and distinguishable from that of a whole tissue. We next investigated several cell types of the hematopoietic system. Platelets are cell fragments that are constantly released by megakaryocytes into the blood stream. They have a half-life of ∼7–9 days. We isolated platelets from a SILAC mouse after 4 weeks of labeling and measured incorporation levels of 86% from 241 quantified proteins (Figure 2D). In contrast, serum albumin, which was also measured within the platelet sample due to serum contamination, has a much higher incorporation level compared to platelet proteins. Analysis of the red blood cell proteome revealed a significantly lower 13C6-lysine incorporation of 75% (Figure 2E). Thus, consideration of SILAC-incorporation rates could aid in the determination of the origin of the same proteins from different cellular pools via their different dynamic incorporation rates. To combine SILAC-mouse analysis with cell sorting to obtain an accurately defined cell population, we separated CD45R-positive B lymphocytes from spleen by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures 2F and S3). An in-solution protein digest was performed from lysates of 1 × 106 spleen cells (Table S2F). The distribution of measured ratios was 1:5.4 ± 1.3, demonstrating that FACS-sorted populations of interest can readily be investigated in the SILAC mouse. Taken together, our results indicate that feeding mice with a SILAC diet is a suitable approach to label proteins in vivo and to follow their metabolic incorporation in any organ. Although the label efficiency was relatively high in many tissues, we found that extending the labeling time did not lead to complete labeling. This is likely due to the recycling of internal amino acid sources (Doherty et al., 2005Doherty M.K. Whitehead C. McCormack H. Gaskell S.J. Beynon R.J. Proteome dynamics in complex organisms: using stable isotopes to monitor individual protein turnover rates.Proteomics. 2005; 5: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Since labeling rates above 95% are required to perform comparative and quantitative proteomics by MS, we started feeding our mice over several generations with the heavy diet. Importantly, the consumption of the heavy diet did not affect litter size (Figure S2). The F1–F4 offspring developed normally, gained weight within the normal weight-gain chart (Figure S2), and showed normal mating behavior. Furthermore, newborn animals of the F1 generation were almost completely labeled, reaching ∼93% in blood, brain, and liver (Figures 3 and S4). To obtain fully labeled animals to serve as internal standards and to investigate if SILAC labeling could be performed for many generations, we bred F2, F3, and F4 mice. These mice contained virtually no unlabeled peptides (Figures 3B, 3C, and 5A; Table S3). For validation of our in vivo quantitative proteomics approach, we analyzed and compared protein lysates from β1 integrin-deficient and control platelets (Nieswandt et al., 2001Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. Glycoprotein VI but not α2β1 integrin is essential for platelet interaction with collagen.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We generated β1 integrin-deficient platelets by intercrossing β1 floxed mice (β1fl/fl) with a transgenic mouse expressing an Mx1 promoter-driven, interferon-inducible Cre (Mx1-Cre) (Brakebusch et al., 2000Brakebusch C. Grose R. Quondamatteo F. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. Pirro A. Svensson M. Herken R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. et al.Skin and hair follicle integrity is crucially dependent on β 1 integrin expression on keratinocytes.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). We treated β1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre mice with synthetic double-stranded RNA (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, pI-pC), which triggers endogenous interferon production and subsequent Mx1-Cre activity. This leads to deletion of the β1 integrin gene in all hematopoietic cells, including megakaryocytes. To monitor the knockout efficiency of β1 integrin, we compared platelets from labeled wild-type animals with platelet populations from three groups of mice: (1) nonlabeled wild-type platelets; (2) platelets from nonlabeled, non-pI-pC-induced β1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre mice; and (3) platelets from nonlabeled, pI-pC-induced β1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre mice (Figure 4). All mice were backcrossed on a C57BL/6 background to reduce genetic variability. We quantified ∼645 proteins in these platelets, and, as expected, protein ratios of labeled and nonlabeled wild-type platelets were tightly distributed, with an overall ratio of 1:1. The quantitative MS analysis revealed complete loss of β1 integrin in platelets from pI-pC-induced β1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre mice (Figure 4F). The proteins with the next highest ratios were the dimerization partners of the β1 integrin subunit, strikingly confirming the sensitivity and reliability of our SILAC-mouse labeling system (Figure 4I). In a boxplot analysis, β1, α2, and α6 integrins were all more than ten interquartile ranges away from the median (Figure S5A; Table S4).The complete loss of both α subunits can be explained by the formation of a stable integrin heterodimer during the synthesis and transport of the complexed integrin subunits to the plasma membrane. Without the correct β integrin subunit, the α subunit is rapidly degraded (Hynes, 2002Hynes R.O. Integrins: bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6369) Google Scholar). In contrast, the loss of β1 integrin has no impact on the expression of other integrins, such as the major platelet integrin αIIbβ3. In addition, several other proteins in β1 integrin-deficient platelets were outliers in the boxplot (Figure S5A; Table S4). However, a second independent experiment did not verify these proteins as being significantly downregulated. (Figure S5C). In contrast, the β1 integrin dimerization partners α2 and α6 integrins were again strongly reduced (Figure S5). Interestingly, the analysis of platelets from noninduced β1fl/fl; Mx1-Cre mice also revealed a slight downregulation of the β1, α2, and α6 integrin levels compared to labeled wild-type platelets (Figure 4J). This effect is due to the natural, endogenous α/β interferon production in the bone marrow causing a low Mx1 promoter activity (Kuhn et al., 1995Kuhn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Inducible gene targeting in mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The detection of this “leak” impressively underscores the sensitivity of our quantitative proteomics approach. We next wanted to confirm the applicability of our in vivo SILAC approach to analyze the proteomes from knockout mice in a solid organ. To this end, we compared the proteomes from hearts of β-Parvin-deficient mice with those of control littermates. As a heavy standard, we used heart lysates from 2-week-old mice of the F4 generation, which showed an overall 97.7% incorporation of 13C-lysine (Figure 5A). To test our quantitation system, we mixed “heavy” and “light” protein lysates from wild-type hearts in ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4. As shown in (Figure 5B), mixing of protein lysates from different heart samples gave rise to SILAC ratios that accurately reflected the lysate mixture. β-Parvin represents the dominant Parvin isoform of the heart, since α-Parvin is only weakly present and γ-Parvin is absent from heart tissue. β-Parvin-deficient mice were generated by homologous recombination of a targeting vector in embryonic stem (ES) cells, which lacks exons 2 and 3 of the β-Parvin gene (I.T. and R.F., unpublished data). β-Parvin-deficient mice were viable and fertile and did not show any overt phenotype, indicating that β-Parvin is not essential for mouse development and organ formation. Mass spectrometric measurements of whole protein lysates from β-Parvin-deficient and control hearts of 2-week-old animals showed a complete absence of β-Parvin in knockout animals (Figures 5C and 5D). Out of 1205 proteins, only 4 proteins showed a two-fold decrease in their abundance compared to wild-type hearts (Table S5). Interestingly, lack of β-Parvin had no dramatic consequence on the level of ILK and PINCH-1, which are the two other components of the ILK/Pinch/Parvin complex. The two-fold increase of α-Parvin in β-Parvin-deficient hearts suggests that the absence of an obvious phenotype is due to compensatory upregulation of α-Parvin (Figure 5C). Kindlin-3-deficient mice die at birth and suffer from severe bleeding, anemia, and pale skin color (Figures 7A and 7B; Moser et al., 2008Moser M. Nieswandt B. Ussar S. Pozgajova M. Fässler R. Kindlin-3 is essential for integrin activation and platelet aggregation.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (Published online February 17, 2008): 325-330https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To further validate the power of in vivo SILAC and to obtain novel insights into Kindlin-3 function, we performed quantitative proteomics of platelets and erythrocytes from Kindlin-3−/− mice. Platelet analysis identified Kindlin-3 as the protein with the highest fold change of more than 1200 platelet proteins (Figure S6A; Table S6). Interestingly, the levels of integrin αIIb and β3 subunits were normal, suggesting that the reduced surface levels found by FACS (Moser et al., 2008Moser M. Nieswandt B. Ussar S. Pozgajova M. Fässler R. Kindlin-3 is essential for integrin activation and platelet aggregation.Nat. Med. 2008; 14 (Published online February 17, 2008): 325-330https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) were due to an impaired integrin trafficking in the absence of Kindlin-3 (Figure S6B). We have previously reported that Kindlin-3 (also known as “unc-related protein 2”) is present in red blood cells (Pasini et al., 2006Pasini E.M. Kirkegaard M. Mortensen P. Lutz H.U. Thomas A.W. Mann M. In-depth analysis of the membrane and cytosolic proteome of red blood cells.Blood. 2006; 108: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by different SILAC-incorporation levels in platelets (incorporation rate of 1:6.0) compared to erythrocytes (incorporation rate of 1:2.1), measured after the initial 4-week labeling period (Figures 2, S7A, and S7B). Furthermore, Kindlin-3 gene activity in Ter119-positive Kindlin-3-heterozygous erythroblasts was further corroborated by measuring Kindlin-3 promoter-driven β-galactosidase reporter gene activity with FACS (Figure S7C). To investigate whether loss of Kindlin-3 affects erythroid cells, we determined and quantitatively compared the proteomes from wild-type, Kindlin-3+/−, and Kindlin-3−/− erythrocytes (Figure 6; Table S7). MS confirmed a 50% reduction of Kindlin-3 in heterozygous and a complete absence of Kindlin-3 in Kindlin-3−/− erythrocytes (Figure 6A). Out of 881 proteins identified in all 3 proteomes, more than 50 were two-fold increased in Kindlin-3−/− erythrocytes, and only a few revealed a more than two-fold reduction. Interestingly, a large proportion of the upregulated proteins was annotated to be nuclear (Table S7). Blood smears from Kindlin-3−/− embryos and P3 animals showed a strong reduction of c"

We generated whole-genome sequences for 19 Typhi isolates using 454 (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina) technologies. Isolates, including the previously sequenced CT18 and Ty2 isolates, were selected to represent major nodes in the phylogenetic tree. Comparative analysis showed little evidence of purifying selection, antigenic variation or recombination between isolates. Rather, evolution in the Typhi population seems to be characterized by ongoing loss of gene function, consistent with a small effective population size. The lack of evidence for antigenic variation driven by immune selection is in contrast to strong adaptive selection for mutations conferring antibiotic resistance in Typhi. The observed patterns of genetic isolation and drift are consistent with the proposed key role of asymptomatic carriers of Typhi as the main reservoir of this pathogen, highlighting the need for identification and treatment of carriers."
https://openalex.org/W2074747030,"Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 5% of pregnancies and remains a leading cause of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity in the United States and the world. The clinical hallmarks of this maternal disorder include hypertension, proteinuria, endothelial dysfunction and placental defects. Advanced-stage clinical symptoms include cerebral hemorrhage, renal failure and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome. An effective treatment of pre-eclampsia is unavailable owing to the poor understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. Numerous recent studies have shown that women with pre-eclampsia possess autoantibodies, termed AT(1)-AAs, that bind and activate the angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT(1) receptor). We show here that key features of pre-eclampsia, including hypertension, proteinuria, glomerular endotheliosis (a classical renal lesion of pre-eclampsia), placental abnormalities and small fetus size appeared in pregnant mice after injection with either total IgG or affinity-purified AT(1)-AAs from women with pre-eclampsia. These features were prevented by co-injection with losartan, an AT(1) receptor antagonist, or by an antibody neutralizing seven-amino-acid epitope peptide. Thus, our studies indicate that pre-eclampsia may be a pregnancy-induced autoimmune disease in which key features of the disease result from autoantibody-induced angiotensin receptor activation. This hypothesis has obvious implications regarding pre-eclampsia screening, diagnosis and therapy."

In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is packaged into chromatin, a highly organized complex of DNA and proteins that encodes epigenetic information governing gene expression, cell identity, and genome integrity (Luger, 2006Luger K. Dynamic nucleosomes.Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome core particle that consists of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer containing two molecules of each of four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. During DNA replication, eukaryotic cells must temporarily disrupt nucleosomes to facilitate progression of the DNA replication machinery through chromatin (Falbo and Shen, 2006Falbo K.B. Shen X. Chromatin remodeling in DNA replication.J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the passage of the replication fork, newly synthesized histones as well as parental histones are deposited onto the nascent sister chromatids to ensure propagation of epigenetic information to daughter cells as well as maintenance of genome integrity (Groth et al., 2007bGroth A. Rocha W. Verreault A. Almouzni G. Chromatin challenges during DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2007; 128: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). While significant advances have been made to understand the duplication of genetic information, much less is known regarding inheritance of epigenetic information during S phase of the cell cycle (Goldberg et al., 2007Goldberg A.D. Allis C.D. Bernstein E. Epigenetics: a landscape takes shape.Cell. 2007; 128: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway is important for inheritance of epigenetic information during DNA replication and repair (Groth et al., 2007bGroth A. Rocha W. Verreault A.

Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), a conserved three subunit protein complex, deposits newly synthesized H3 and H4 onto replicating DNA to form nucleosomes (Groth et al., 2007bGroth A. Rocha W. Verreault A. Almouzni G. Chromatin challenges during DNA replication and repair.Cell. 2007; 128: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, Stillman, 1986Stillman B. Chromatin assembly during SV40 DNA replication in vitro.Cell. 1986; 45: 555-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). CAF-1-mediated histone deposition onto DNA is assisted by Asf1 and Rtt106, two other H3-H4 histone chaperones that bind to CAF-1 (Huang et al., 2005Huang S. Zhou H. Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z. Rtt106p is a histone chaperone involved in heterochromatin-mediated silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13410-13415Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Tyler et al., 2001Tyler J.K. Collins K.A. Prasad-Sinha J. Amiott E. Bulger M. Harte P.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Interaction between the Drosophila CAF-1 and ASF1 chromatin assembly factors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the actions of these three histone chaperones are coordinated to achieve rapid deposition of histones onto nascent DNA during S phase of the cell cycle. Newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are acetylated before they are assembled into nucleosomes. For instance, new H4 molecules are acetylated at lysine residues 5 and 12, and this acetylation pattern is conserved from yeast to humans (Sobel et al., 1995Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Conservation of deposition-related acetylation sites in newly synthesized histones H3 and H4.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that acetylation of these two lysine residues may facilitate their assembly into nucleosomes. Supporting this idea, mutation of lysine residues 5, 8, and 12 of H4 in combination with a deletion of the N-terminal tail of H3 compromises cell viability and nucleosome assembly in the yeast S. cerevisiae (Ma et al., 1998Ma X.J. Wu J. Altheim B.A. Schultz M.C. Grunstein M. Deposition-related sites K5/K12 in histone H4 are not required for nucleosome deposition in yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 6693-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, in vitro human CAF-1 can assemble H3-H4 lacking their N termini onto replicating DNA as efficiently as intact H3-H4 (Shibahara et al., 2000Shibahara K. Verreault A. Stillman B. The N-terminal domains of histones H3 and H4 are not necessary for chromatin assembly factor-1-mediated nucleosome assembly onto replicated DNA in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7766-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results argue that acetylation of lysine residues at the N termini of H3 and H4 is not essential for CAF-1 activity and may therefore have other functions in nucleosome assembly. Acetylation of H3 lysine 56 (H3K56Ac) was recently described as a mark of newly synthesized H3 molecules (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). While some studies have indicated that H3K56Ac is involved in transcription (Rufiange et al., 2007Rufiange A. Jacques P.E. Bhat W. Robert F. Nourani A.

First, H3K56Ac increases during S phase progression and largely disappears during G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A.

Second, in addition to genotoxic agent sensitivity, cells lacking the H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109 (KAT11) (Allis et al., 2007Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T.

Shiekhattar R. et al.New nomenclature for chromatin-modifying enzymes.Cell. 2007; 131: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) or cells expressing H3 with lysine 56 mutated to arginine (H3K56R) exhibit an increased frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks (Driscoll et al., 2007Driscoll R.

Third, mutations in RTT109 exhibit synthetic lethal/slow growth phenotypes with mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA replication and double-strand break repair (Collins et al., 2007Collins S.R. Miller K.M. Maas N.L. Roguev A. Fillingham J. Chu C.S. Schuldiner M. Gebbia M. Recht J.

Together, these results support the notion that H3K56Ac functions during DNA replication to maintain genome stability. However, the exact process in which H3K56Ac is involved during passage through S phase is not known. Here we show that H3K56 acetylation increases the binding affinity of H3 toward CAF-1 and Rtt106 both in vivo and in vitro and promotes nucleosome assembly during S phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrate that H3K56Ac binds to a region of Rtt106 that is homologous to the unusual pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Pob3, a subunit of the FACT chromatin assembly and disassembly complex (Reinberg and Sims, 2006Reinberg D. Sims 3rd, R.J. de FACTo nucleosome dynamics.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23297-23301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, VanDemark et al., 2006VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A.

Cell. 2006; 22: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results identify another acetyl-lysine binding motif and establish a molecular mechanism of action for H3K56Ac. Recent studies have shown that acetylation of the N-terminal lysine residues of newly synthesized H3 and H4 regulates efficient nuclear import of H3 and H4 (Blackwell et al., 2007Blackwell Jr., J.S. Wilkinson S.T. Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Mutational analysis of H3 and H4 N termini reveals distinct roles in nuclear import.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20142-20150Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since H3K56Ac occurs in new H3 molecules (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), we first asked whether it modulates the nuclear localization of new H3 molecules. Mutations that abolish H3K56Ac (H3K56R or rtt109Δ) had no apparent effect on the nuclear localization of H3-GFP expressed from a galactose-inducible promoter (Figures 1A and S1 available online), suggesting that H3K56Ac is not essential for nuclear import of H3. We then compared the phenotypes of cells lacking H3K56Ac to those lacking acetylation at lysine residues at the N termini of H3 and H4. Mutations that eliminate H3K56Ac confer more severe sensitivity to genotoxic agents than mutations that abolish acetylation sites of either the H3 or H4 N terminus (Figures 1B and 1C). Moreover, combining mutations that eliminate H3K56Ac with either lysine-to-arginine mutations in the N termini of H3 or of H4 or a truncation of the N terminus of H3 (H3 Δ3-29) resulted in slow growth and DNA damage sensitivity far more pronounced than those observed in either rtt109Δ or H3K56R single mutants (Figures 1B, 1C, and S2). These results imply that H3K56Ac acts through a molecular mechanism that is genetically distinct from acetylation of the N termini of H3 and H4. In yeast cells, H3 molecules associated with CAF-1 are acetylated at lysine 56 (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou H. Madden B.J. Muddiman D.C. Zhang Z. Chromatin assembly factor 1 interacts with histone h3 methylated at lysine 79 in the processes of epigenetic silencing and DNA repair.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether H3K56Ac was present in H3 molecules that copurified with Asf1 and Rtt106, two other histone chaperones that bind CAF-1 and are involved in nucleosome assembly (Huang et al., 2005Huang S. Zhou H. Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z. Rtt106p is a histone chaperone involved in heterochromatin-mediated silencing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13410-13415Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Tyler et al., 1999Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. The RCAF complex mediates chromatin assembly during DNA replication and repair.Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Cac2- (a subunit of CAF-1), Rtt106-, and Asf1-containing complexes were purified from yeast cells by tandem affinity purification (TAP). Copurified proteins were detected by silver staining (Figure 2A) and by western blotting with antibodies against unmodified H3 or H3K56Ac (Figure 2B). While distinct proteins copurified with Cac2, Asf1, and Rtt106 (Figure 2A), all three histone chaperones were associated with H3 molecules acetylated at K56 (Figures 2B and 2C). Lower amounts of H3 were copurified with Cac2-TAP than with Asf1 or Rtt106 (Figure 2B). This was due to the lower amounts of CAF-1 than Asf1 or Rtt106 purified from the same amounts of yeast cells (Figure 2C). Moreover, little Asf1 and Rtt106 were copurified with Cac2 under these conditions (Figure 2C). Thus, all three histone chaperones bind H3K56Ac. In yeast cells, CAF-1 binding to H3 as well as H3K56Ac increase during passage through S phase (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou H. Madden B.J.

Chromatin assembly factor 1 interacts with histone h3 methylated at lysine 79 in the processes of epigenetic silencing and DNA repair.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We asked whether the association of Rtt106 with H3 was similarly regulated during cell-cycle progression. As previously reported, H3K56Ac progressively increased during S phase, reaching a maximum in either late S phase or G2 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 2D, middle panel) (Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, Zhou et al., 2006Zhou H. Madden B.J.

Chromatin assembly factor 1 interacts with histone h3 methylated at lysine 79 in the processes of epigenetic silencing and DNA repair.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the levels of Rtt106-TAP were constant from G1 through G2, the association of Rtt106 with H3 increased with the same kinetics as the accumulation of H3K56Ac (Figure 2D). In G1 or G2, Rtt106 was associated with much lower levels of H3. Thus, the amount of H3 bound to Rtt106 increases as cells progress through S phase. Because both CAF-1 and Rtt106 bind H3 predominantly during S phase when H3K56Ac is abundant, we determined whether H3K56Ac regulates the association of CAF-1, Rtt106, and Asf1 with histones. For this purpose, Cac2-, Rtt106-, and Asf1-TAP were purified from wild-type or H3K56R mutant cells and H3 associated with each chaperone were detected by western blotting. The amounts of H3 bound to CAF-1 and Rtt106 were significantly reduced in H3K56R mutant cells compared with wild-type cells (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, mutation of lysine 79 in H3, another lysine residue in the globular domain of H3, did not affect the binding of CAF-1 or Rtt106-TAP to H3 to a detectable degree (Figures 3B, S3A, and S3B). Interestingly, the H3K56R mutation had no detectable effect on the ability of Asf1-TAP to bind H3 in yeast cells (Figure 3C). This result is consistent with the fact that Asf1 binds H3 through its C-terminal region that does not contain K56 (English et al., 2006English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Structural basis for the histone chaperone activity of Asf1.Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and implies that the binding of CAF-1 and Rtt106 to histones is enhanced by H3K56Ac, whereas Asf1 binding to histones is independent of H3K56Ac. In S. cerevisiae, H3K56Ac is catalyzed by Rtt109 and dependent upon Asf1 (Celic et al., 2006Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A.

USA. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). If H3K56Ac promotes the association of CAF-1 and Rtt106 with histones in yeast cells, this association should be compromised in rtt109Δ and asf1Δ mutant cells that lack H3K56Ac. Indeed, the amounts of H3 copurified with CAF-1 and Rtt106 were dramatically reduced in asf1Δ and rtt109Δ mutant cells when compared with wild-type cells (Figures 3D and 3E). These results strongly support the conclusion that H3K56Ac enhances the association of CAF-1 and Rtt106 with H3 in vivo. H3K56Ac increases the transcription of histone genes (Xu et al., 2005Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Acetylation in histone H3 globular domain regulates gene expression in yeast.Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and cells lacking Asf1 or Rtt109 grow slower than wild-type cells. It was therefore possible that the reduced binding of H3 to CAF-1 and Rtt106 in asf1Δ or rtt109Δ mutant cells was due either to reduced histone levels and/or altered cell-cycle progression. However, we could not detect any significant change in the total levels of H3 in cells lacking H3K56Ac compared with wild-type cells (Figure 3). Moreover, the interaction between CAF-1 and H3K56Ac was not decreased in cells lacking SPT10 (Figure S3C), which grow much more slowly than the rtt109Δ or asf1Δ mutant cells (data not shown). Spt10 is a transcriptional activator of histone genes and has been implicated in acetylation of H3 lysine 56 at histone gene promoters (Xu et al., 2005Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Acetylation in histone H3 globular domain regulates gene expression in yeast.Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These results argue that the reduced amounts of H3 bound to CAF-1 and Rtt106 in cells lacking H3K56Ac are not an indirect consequence of defects in histone gene expression or cell-cycle progression. Instead, H3K56Ac may directly promote the interactions of CAF-1 and Rtt106 with H3. To address this idea, we purified recombinant CAF-1 and GST-Rtt106 and tested how these proteins bound to H3-H4 acetylated in vitro by the Rtt109-Vps75 complex. As shown in Figures 4A and 4B, CAF-1 bound more H3 acetylated by Rtt109-Vps75 than unacetylated H3. In addition, Cac1, the large subunit of CAF-1, but not Cac2 or Cac3 bound to H3 and H3K56Ac in vitro under the same conditions tested (Figure S4). This result suggests that Cac1 mediates the interaction of CAF-1 with H3K56Ac. We also detected that GST-Rtt106 bound better to H3 acetylated at lysine 56 than to unmodified H3 (Figures 4C and 4D). These results indicate that H3K56Ac increases the binding affinity of CAF-1 and Rtt106 for H3 in vitro. Some protein domains can “read” specific modifications of histones (Kouzarides, 2007Kouzarides T. Chromatin modifications and their function.Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar). The bromodomain is the only domain thus far characterized that recognizes acetylated lysine residues. CAF-1 and Rtt106 do not contain classical bromodomains. We noticed, however, that Rtt106 contains a region (residues 195–301) that is related to the middle domain of Pob3 (Pob3-M) (Figure 5A). Structure determination of Pob3-M has identified two domains structurally related to a unique class of PH domains (VanDemark et al., 2006VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A. Hill C.P. Formosa T. The structure of the yFACT Pob3-M domain, its interaction with the DNA replication factor RPA, and a potential role in nucleosome deposition.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Hence we will refer to this region of Rtt106 as a PH-like domain or simply Rtt106-PH. Because Pob3 is a subunit of FACT, a complex that promotes both nucleosome assembly and disassembly during transcription and DNA replication (Reinberg and Sims, 2006Reinberg D. Sims 3rd, R.J. de FACTo nucleosome dynamics.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23297-23301Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, VanDemark et al., 2006VanDemark A.P. Blanksma M. Ferris E. Heroux A.

Cell. 2006; 22: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we tested whether Rtt106-PH mediates interactions between Rtt106 and histones. Deletion of amino acids 195–301 of Rtt106 had no major effect on protein stability but largely abolished the interaction between Rtt106 and H3 in yeast cells (Figure 5B). Thus, Rtt106-PH is required for Rtt106 to bind H3 in vivo. Next, we tested whether Rtt106-PH is sufficient to bind H3K56Ac in vitro using histone octamers purified from yeast cells containing mutations in Hst3 and Hst4 or mutations in Rtt109 (Figure 5C). Hst3 and Hst4 are two H3K56Ac deacetylases, and in their absence, over 90% of H3 is K56 acetylated (Celic et al., 2006Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A. The sirtuins hst3 and hst4p preserve genome integrity by controlling histone h3 lysine 56 deacetylation.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Rtt106-PH bound more H3 purified from hst3Δ hst4Δ mutant cells than H3 isolated from the rtt109Δ mutant cells (Figure 5D). These results indicate that the Rtt106-PH domain is both necessary and sufficient to bind H3K56Ac. Cells lacking H3K56Ac are sensitive to genotoxic agents (Han et al., 2007aHan J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Rtt109 acetylates histone H3 lysine 56 and functions in DNA replication.Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, Masumoto et al., 2005Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. A role for cell-cycle-regulated histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation in the DNA damage response.Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) (Figures 1B and 1C). To assess the role of histone chaperones in DNA damage resistance, we compared the sensitivity to genotoxic agents of cells lacking Rtt109 to those lacking Rtt106 or Cac1, the large subunit of CAF-1. The cac1Δ or rtt106Δ single mutant cells are generally much less sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (CPT, HU, and MMS) than asf1Δ or rtt109Δ mutant lacking H3K56Ac (Figures 5E and S5). However, the cac1Δ rtt106Δ double mutant cells were considerably more sensitive to these DNA-damaging agents than either cac1Δ or rt106Δ single mutants (Figures 5E and S5). Moreover, the sensitivity of rtt109Δ mutant cells to DNA-damaging agents (CPT, MMS, and HU) was not dramatically greater than that of cac1Δ rtt106Δ cells (Figures 5E and S5). These results support the notion that CAF-1 and Rtt106 are two important effectors that bind H3K56Ac. We also tested the genotoxic agent sensitivity of cells expressing three rtt106-PH domain mutants. In the absence of Cac1, these three rtt106 mutants conferred a very similar degree of DNA-damage sensitivity to that observed in cac1Δ rtt106Δ cells (Figure 5F). Thus, in the absence of CAF-1, the association of Rtt106 with H3 acetylated at lysine 56 is important for cellular resistance to DNA-damaging agents. CAF-1 and Rtt106 mediate the deposition of histones onto DNA to form nucleosomes (Huang et al., 2005Huang S. Zhou H. Katzmann D. Hochstrasser M. Atanasova E. Zhang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2145929363,"DNA damage causes checkpoint activation leading to cell cycle arrest and repair, during which the chromatin structure is disrupted. The mechanisms whereby chromatin structure and cell cycle progression are restored after DNA repair are largely unknown. We show that chromatin reassembly following double-strand break (DSB) repair requires the histone chaperone Asf1 and that absence of Asf1 causes cell death, as cells are unable to recover from the DNA damage checkpoint. We find that Asf1 contributes toward chromatin assembly after DSB repair by promoting acetylation of free histone H3 on lysine 56 (K56) via the histone acetyl transferase Rtt109. Mimicking acetylation of K56 bypasses the requirement for Asf1 for chromatin reassembly and checkpoint recovery, whereas mutations that prevent K56 acetylation block chromatin reassembly after repair. These results indicate that restoration of the chromatin following DSB repair is driven by acetylated H3 K56 and that this is a signal for the completion of repair."
https://openalex.org/W1963937857,"In response to DNA damage in G2, mammalian cells must avoid entry into mitosis and instead initiate DNA repair. Here, we show that, in response to genotoxic stress in G2, the phosphatase Cdc14B translocates from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and induces the activation of the ubiquitin ligase APC/CCdh1, with the consequent degradation of Plk1, a prominent mitotic kinase. This process induces the stabilization of Claspin, an activator of the DNA-damage checkpoint, and Wee1, an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression, and allows an efficient G2 checkpoint. As a by-product of APC/CCdh1 reactivation in DNA-damaged G2 cells, Claspin, which we show to be an APC/CCdh1 substrate in G1, is targeted for degradation. However, this process is counteracted by the deubiquitylating enzyme Usp28 to permit Claspin-mediated activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage. These findings define a novel pathway that is crucial for the G2 DNA-damage-response checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2072808488,"The precision with which motor neurons innervate target muscles depends on a regulatory network of Hox transcription factors that translates neuronal identity into patterns of connectivity. We show that a single transcription factor, FoxP1, coordinates motor neuron subtype identity and connectivity through its activity as a Hox accessory factor. FoxP1 is expressed in Hox-sensitive motor columns and acts as a dose-dependent determinant of columnar fate. Inactivation of Foxp1 abolishes the output of the motor neuron Hox network, reverting the spinal motor system to an ancestral state. The loss of FoxP1 also changes the pattern of motor neuron connectivity, and in the limb motor axons appear to select their trajectories and muscle targets at random. Our findings show that FoxP1 is a crucial determinant of motor neuron diversification and connectivity, and clarify how this Hox regulatory network controls the formation of a topographic neural map."

Expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increases during normal aging, and both of these GATA factors repress expression of elt-3, which shows a corresponding decrease in expression in old worms. elt-3 regulates a large number of downstream genes that change expression in old age, including ugt-9, col-144, and sod-3. elt-5(RNAi) and elt-6(RNAi) worms have extended longevity, indicating that elt-3, elt-5, and elt-6 play an important functional role in the aging process.

https://openalex.org/W2004279025,"Suppression of annexin A1 (ANXA1), a mediator of apoptosis and inhibitor of cell proliferation, is well documented in various cancers but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We investigated whether decreased ANXA1 expression was mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Using Sanger miRBase, we identified miR-584, miR-196a and miR-196b as potential miRNAs targeting ANXA1. Only miRNA-196a showed significant inverse correlation with ANXA1 mRNA levels in 12 cancer cell lines of esophageal, breast and endometrial origin (Pearson's correlation −0.66, P=0.019), identifying this as the candidate miRNA targeting ANXA1. Inverse correlation was also observed in 10 esophageal adenocarcinomas (Pearson's correlation −0.64, P=0.047). Analysis of paired normal/tumor tissues from additional 10 patients revealed an increase in miR-196a in the cancers (P=0.003), accompanied by a decrease in ANXA1 mRNA (P=0.004). Increasing miR-196a levels in cells by miR-196a mimics resulted in decreased ANXA1 mRNA and protein. In addition, miR-196a mimics inhibited luciferase expression in luciferase plasmid reporter that included predicted miR-196a recognition sequence from ANXA1 3′-untranslated region confirming that miR-196a directly targets ANXA1. miR-196a promoted cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and suppressed apoptosis, suggesting its oncogenic potential. This study demonstrated a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of ANXA1 expression and identified miR-196a as a marker of esophageal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2067246673,"Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) are conjugated to their targets by specific cascades involving three classes of enzymes, E1, E2, and E3. Each E1 adenylates the C terminus of its cognate Ubl, forms a E1∼Ubl thioester intermediate, and ultimately generates a thioester-linked E2∼Ubl product. We have determined the crystal structure of yeast Uba1, revealing a modular architecture with individual domains primarily mediating these specific activities. The negatively charged C-terminal ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) is primed for binding of E2s and recognizes their positively charged first α helix via electrostatic interactions. In addition, a mobile loop from the domain harboring the E1 catalytic cysteine contributes to E2 binding. Significant, experimentally observed motions in the UFD around a hinge in the linker connecting this domain to the rest of the enzyme suggest a conformation-dependent mechanism for the transthioesterification function of Uba1; however, this mechanism clearly differs from that of other E1 enzymes.

The covalent attachment of the small, highly conserved protein ubiquitin (Ub) to target proteins is an essential mechanism for modulating the function of these proteins in eukaryotes, and its defective regulation has been shown to cause pathological conditions that range from developmental abnormalities and cancer to autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). Ub is covalently conjugated via its C terminus to its cellular target proteins by a conserved biochemical pathway that involves the sequential actions of Ub-activating (E1), Ub-conjugating (E2), and Ub-protein ligase (E3) enzymes (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6471) Google Scholar). The E1 activity represents an essential step during Ub and ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) conjugation, and the general mechanism of the E1-catalyzed reaction is well established, on the basis of early work with the Ub-E1 (Haas and Rose, 1982Haas A.L.

Each Ubl has a dedicated E1 that initiates its conjugation cascade. First, E1 associates with the Ubl and catalyzes the adenylation of the Ubl C terminus in an ATP-dependent process. Second, E1 forms a thioester between a conserved catalytic cysteine and the Ubl. Next, E1 is loaded with a second Ubl molecule, followed by its C-terminal adenylation. Finally, the ternary E1∼Ubl thioester complex recruits an E2 to facilitate transfer of the thioester-linked Ubl to a conserved E2 cysteine (transthioesterification). The energy stored in the E2∼Ubl thioester is utilized to conjugate Ubl to target lysine ɛ-amino groups, either directly or through complexes mediated by E3s. The E1 for Ub is a 110–120 kDa monomeric protein, whereas the E1s for the Ubls NEDD8 and SUMO are heterodimeric complexes with comparable overall molecular weights. All eukaryotic E1s contain a two-fold repeat of a domain that is derived from the bacterial MoeB and ThiF proteins (Johnson et al., 1997Johnson E.S. Schwienhorst I. Dohmen R.J. Blobel G.

Despite the central role of the E1 enzyme in the Ub conjugation cascade, a structure of an intact Ub-activating enzyme has not been available so far. Here, we present the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ub-activating enzyme, known as Uba1, bound to yeast Ub, and on the basis of structural and biochemical data advance our understanding of the function and mechanism of the Ub-specific E1. The S. cerevisiae Uba1-Ub complex was crystallized, and its structure was determined by domain-wise molecular replacement with several search models (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online). The structure was refined to an R/Rfree of 0.194/0.247 at 2.7 Å resolution (Table 1). Although the crystals only diffracted to 2.7 Å, virtually all residues are clearly defined (Figure S1), and there is no significant disorder in the protein itself. There are two molecules of the 120 kDa Uba1-Ub complex in the asymmetric unit, and they exhibit almost identical conformations except for the C-terminal UFD. Without the UFD, the two Uba1 molecules can be superimposed with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 1.08 Å over 933 (out of a total of 1024) aligned Cα atoms. The UFDs can be separately superimposed, resulting in a rmsd of 0.60 Å over 96 aligned Cα atoms, indicating a rigid body displacement of the UFD between the two complexes, whereas the Ub molecules (residues 1–76) can be superimposed with a rmsd of 0.35 Å.Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsData Collection StatisticsSpace groupP212121Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 115.36, b = 118.56, c = 207.57Complexes per asymmetric unit2X-ray sourceNSLS, beamline X29Wavelength (Å)1.1Resolution limits (Å)50−2.7Number of observations503,923Number of unique observations77,706Completeness (%)98.5 (86.9)RmergeaRmerge = ∑hkl∑k|I(k) − [I]|/∑hkl∑kI(k), where I(k) is the value of the kth measurement of the intensity of a reflection, [I] is the mean value of the intensity of that reflection, and the summation is over all the measurements.

Open table in a new tab The Uba1 structure consists of a complex arrangement of six structural domains referred to as IAD, AAD, FCCH, SCCH, 4HB, and UFD as introduced earlier with overall dimensions of 85 Å × 90 Å × 60 Å (Figure 1). In the structure, four domains, AAD, FCCH, SCCH, and UFD, pack together to generate a large central canyon (∼40 Å wide), which at one end (near FCCH) snugly recruits a Ub molecule. The large size of the canyon in Uba1 suggests that it may function to accommodate an E2, as well. The UFD, FCCH, and SCCH domains are connected to their respective adjacent domains by three flexible linkers: (1) UFD is attached to AAD by an 18 residue loop forming a β-hairpin at the end of the AAD. This stretch will be referred to as the UFD linker. (2) FCCH is connected to IAD by two long antiparallel β strands. (3) Finally, SCCH is linked to AAD by an extended 18 residue linker that traverses 40 Å from one side of the molecule to the other. This crossover loop divides the canyon into two clefts that are continuous both below and above the loop. As in the previous E1 structures (Lois and Lima, 2005Lois L.M. Lima C.D.

The structural features described above suggest that Uba1 may undergo large-scale conformational changes during the course of its functional cycle, an idea that is supported by other structural details and biochemical studies that will be described later. E1 enzymes from various organisms including yeast Uba1 share extensive sequence homology (Figure S2); for example, Uba1 and its human ortholog (Ube1) display an overall sequence identity of 50%, with all structural domains being highly conserved. Furthermore, yeast and human Ub share 96% sequence identity. Taken together, these data indicate that Ube1 will adopt the same architecture as Uba1 and activate as well as transfer Ub in a similar fashion. Besides their essential role in initiating Ubl conjugation cascades, E1s select the correct Ubl for their respective pathways. Each Ubl has a dedicated E1, which displays remarkable specificity. For example, despite the fact that Ub and NEDD8 share 57% sequence identity and have markedly similar structures, they are distinguished by their respective E1s (Whitby et al., 1998Whitby F.G. Xia G. Pickart C.M. Hill C.P. Crystal structure of the human ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 and interactions with ubiquitin pathway enzymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34983-34991Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This specificity is crucial because the E1 also transfers the activated Ubl to its cognate E2, thereby coupling the Ubl to its correct downstream pathway. The structure of the Uba1-Ub complex suggests the basis for part of the preference of E1s for their particular Ubls. Residue 72 is the only known determinant of selectivity in Ubls for their E1s (Bohnsack and Haas, 2003Bohnsack R.N. Haas A.L.

The Uba1-Ub interactions result in the burial of ∼3200 Å2 of exposed surface area, corresponding to 33% of Ub's total surface area. A similar value was observed in the case of the NEDD8-E1, which buries ∼3350 Å2 of total surface area with NEDD8 (34% of NEDD8) (Walden et al., 2003aWalden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor Jr., D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. The structure of the APPBP1–UBA3-NEDD8-ATP complex reveals the basis for selective ubiquitin-like protein activation by an E1.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast, the SUMO-E1-SUMO interface buries only ∼1650 Å2 (20% of SUMO) (Lois and Lima, 2005Lois L.M. Lima C.D. Structures of the SUMO E1 provide mechanistic insights into SUMO activation and E2 recruitment to E1.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Most of the interactions involving Ub binding are localized to the four-stranded β sheet (β21–β24) preceding the UFD and the crossover loop (Figure 2). The details of the interface between Uba1 and Ub are described by dividing it into three areas: (1) the hydrophobic interface between the “canonical” hydrophobic patch of Ub and the conserved AAD of Uba1 (Interface I), (2) the interactions between Ub's C-terminal tail and the AAD as well as the crossover loop (Interface II), and (3) the polar interface between Ub and the FCCH (Interface III). The three interfaces are shown in Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C, respectively. Interface I is defined by extensive hydrophobic contacts between a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the AAD (β23 and β24), involving Phe898, Leu903, and Phe905, and a hydrophobic patch that is absolutely conserved between Ub and NEDD8 centered around Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 (Figure 2A), which are all essential for viability in yeast (Sloper-Mould et al., 2001Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.C. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. Distinct functional surface regions on ubiquitin.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition to these hydrophobic contacts, this interaction is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Uba1's Asn900 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ub's Leu8. Phe283 and Ala284, which are located in the turn between the first and the second α helix (α6 and α7) of the 4HB, interact with Ala46 and Gly47 present in the turn between the third and fourth β strand (β3 and β4) of Ub and support it from underneath. Interface II involves Ub's C-terminal tail, which extends away from the hydrophobic patch and sits in a shallow groove in the AAD, below the crossover loop, where it adopts a highly similar conformation to that of NEDD8 and SUMO in complex with their cognate E1s, as well as the bacterial MoaD in complex with its activator MoeB. The Arg72 side chain of Ub binds into a negatively charged pocket created by residues from the crossover loop (Figure 2B). The Arg72 guanidinium group forms a network of charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Gln576 and Asp591 and with the backbone carbonyl groups of Tyr586 and Ser589, in a partially buried environment. In contrast, in the NEDD8-E1 complex, UBA3's hydrophobic Leu206 and Tyr207 interact with Ala72 of NEDD8 (Walden et al., 2003aWalden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor Jr., D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. The structure of the APPBP1–UBA3-NEDD8-ATP complex reveals the basis for selective ubiquitin-like protein activation by an E1.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and in SUMO-E1, Sae2's Arg119 and Tyr159 contact Glu93 of SUMO-1 (Lois and Lima, 2005Lois L.M. Lima C.D. Structures of the SUMO E1 provide mechanistic insights into SUMO activation and E2 recruitment to E1.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), indicating together that each Ubl makes distinct and favorable interactions with the crossover loop of its E1. In this region, the guanidinium group of Ub's Arg42 also forms a hydrogen bond network with the hydroxyl group of Ser589, the backbone carbonyl group of Arg590, and the side chain of Asp591, providing a rationale for the observation that mutation of Ub's Arg42 to leucine reduces E1's affinity for the Ub∼adenylate by three orders of magnitude (Burch and Haas, 1994Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Site-directed mutagenesis of ubiquitin. Differential roles for arginine in the interaction with ubiquitin-activating enzyme.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An additional salt bridge is found between Uba1's Glu594 and Ub's Arg74, which has also been shown to play a critical role in Ub activation; mutation of Arg74 to leucine reduces the rate of ATP:PPi exchange (Burch and Haas, 1994Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Site-directed mutagenesis of ubiquitin. Differential roles for arginine in the interaction with ubiquitin-activating enzyme.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Alignment of seven Uba1 orthologs shows that the surface that interacts with Ub's C-terminal tail is strictly conserved and that the residues contacting Arg42, Arg72, and Arg74 are invariant (Figure S2). A superposition with the ATP-bound structure of the MoaD-MoeB complex and the MoaD-adenylate (Lake et al., 2001Lake M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Mechanism of ubiquitin activation revealed by the structure of a bacterial MoeB-MoaD complex.Nature. 2001; 414: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) reveals that the catalytically important residues Asp544, Arg481 (from AAD), and Arg21 (from IAD) in the adenylation active site adopt similar conformations with their counterparts. Finally, one face of Ub's globular domain interacts with the FCCH (Figure 2C). In this region (Interface III), Ub contacts the subdomain comprised of Uba1's residues 175–265 that forms one wall of the broad, deep groove in the Uba1 structure. This portion of the interface is unique to eukaryotic E1s and is not found in distant bacterial ancestors such as MoeB and ThiF. The nature of this interface is predominantly polar, with four residues (Lys11, Thr12, Gln31, and Asp32) of Ub forming hydrogen bonds with three Uba1 residues (Arg202, Gly204, and Glu206), and the interface buries ∼560 Å2 of surface area. In case of NEDD8-E1, this polar interface is more extensive, involving the whole acidic face of helix α1 and the subsequent loop in NEDD8 (Walden et al., 2003aWalden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor Jr., D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. The structure of the APPBP1–UBA3-NEDD8-ATP complex reveals the basis for selective ubiquitin-like protein activation by an E1.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas this interface appears to be absent in the SUMO-E1 complex (Lois and Lima, 2005Lois L.M. Lima C.D. Structures of the SUMO E1 provide mechanistic insights into SUMO activation and E2 recruitment to E1.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The SCCH contains the E1 catalytic cysteine that forms a thioester with the C terminus of Ub and promotes transfer of Ub to its E2. Formation of the thioester complex between Uba1 and Ub proceeds through a nucleophilic attack on the Ub∼adenylate by the E1 active site cysteine. This reaction presumably involves deprotonation of E1's active site cysteine by a general base catalyst. The basic residue that is closest (less than 5 Å) to the active site cysteine in yeast Uba1 is Arg603, which is conserved as a lysine among Ub-E1s from different species. However, Arg603 is unlikely to act as a general base, both chemically and structurally. Asp782 is conserved as a negatively charged residue in all Ub-E1s (Figure S2), and its potential role as a general base was analyzed. Mutation of Asp782 to alanine or asparagine has little effect on the Uba1∼Ub thioester formation, rendering such a model improbable (data not shown). However, the apparent lack of a convincing general base residue near the active site cysteine does not preclude a possible realignment of additional residues through a conformational change during the reaction, or substrate-assisted catalysis via an E2-derived residue. Another requirement for E1∼Ub thioester formation is that the active site cysteine needs to be in close proximity to the Ub C terminus. In the crystal structure, the thiol of Cys600 is ∼35 Å away from the adenylation active site, similar to the structures of both the NEDD8-E1 and SUMO-E1, thus strongly suggesting that significant conformational changes in the complex would be required for the juxtaposition of the bound Ub∼adenylate and the active site cysteine thiol. The gap can be reduced by the movement of Ub's flexible C-terminal tail, a change in the relative orientations of the AAD, SCCH, and FCCH domains via hinge motions in the extended loops linking the domains, and a potential local conformational change around the catalytic cysteine in the SCCH as proposed by Walden et al., 2003aWalden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T. Miller D.W. Howard R.J. Minor Jr., D.L. Holton J.M. Schulman B.A. The structure of the APPBP1–UBA3-NEDD8-ATP complex reveals the basis for selective ubiquitin-like protein activation by an E1.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1427-1437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar. Additionally, the catalytic cysteine must retract with the nascent Ub thioester after the formation of the thioester linkage to allow the adenylation of a second Ub molecule. However, the nature of these hypothetical conformational changes is still unclear. The ultimate function of E1 is to coordinate the transfer of its activated Ubl to the cognate E2 enzyme. This involves E1 interacting noncovalently with one of the cognate E2 enzymes and a subsequent transthioesterification reaction in which the Ubl is transferred from E1's catalytic cysteine to that of the E2. In the Ub pathway, a single E1 enzyme (in yeast) sits at the top of the cascade, transferring Ub to many different E2s, one at a time. The fully loaded E1 has a high affinity for E2s, with dissociation constants (Kd) in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range depending on the E2 (Haas et al., 1988Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. Functional diversity among putative E2 isozymes in the mechanism of ubiquitin-histone ligation.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the Ub-E1 only displays a low affinity for E2s in the absence of Ub and ATP, because E1 readily separates from the E2s during purification without ATP (Hershko et al., 1983Hershko A.

Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low affinity of the free E1 for E2s might expedite the rapid cycling of E1, so that it can charge Ub's various E2s (Hershko et al., 1983Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A.

We identified homologs of 29 components of the meiotic recombination machinery, as well as the synaptonemal and meiotic sister chromatid cohesion complexes. T. vaginalis has orthologs of 27 of 29 meiotic genes, including eight of nine genes that encode meiosis-specific proteins in model organisms. Although meiosis has not been observed in T. vaginalis, our findings suggest it is either currently sexual or a recent asexual, consistent with observed, albeit unusual, sexual cycles in their distant parabasalid relatives, the hypermastigotes. T. vaginalis may use meiotic gene homologs to mediate homologous recombination and genetic exchange. Overall, this expanded inventory of meiotic genes forms a useful ""meiosis detection toolkit"". Our analyses indicate that these meiotic genes arose, or were already present, early in eukaryotic evolution; thus, the eukaryotic cenancestor contained most or all components of this set and was likely capable of performing meiotic recombination using near-universal meiotic machinery."

As glioblastomas are characterized by high expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, we studied the effects of the novel Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-737, on malignant glioma cells. ABT-737 treatment released the pro-apoptotic Bax protein from its binding partner Bcl-2 and potently induced apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. The local administration of ABT-737 prolonged the survival in an intracranial glioma xenograft model. Downregulation of Mcl-1 and overexpression of Bcl-2 sensitized the cells to ABT-737-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, ABT-737 potentiated the cytotoxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and etoposide, and of the death ligand TRAIL. As glioma stem cells may play a crucial role for the tumor progression and the resistance to treatment in glioblastomas, we investigated the effects of ABT-737 on the subpopulation of glioma cells exhibiting stem cell characteristics. Inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by ABT-737 were less efficient in glioma stem cells than in non-stem cell-like glioma cells. As the resistance of glioma stem cells was associated with high Mcl-1 expression levels, ABT-737 treatment combined with downregulation of Mcl-1 could represent a promising novel approach in glioblastoma treatment."

As suggested by the location analysis, deletion of Foxa2 in hepatocytes in mice using the Cre-lox system leads to decreased transcription of genes encoding bile acid transporters on both the basolateral and canalicular membranes, resulting in intrahepatic cholestasis. Foxa2-deficient mice are strikingly sensitive to a diet containing cholic acid, which results in toxic accumulation of hepatic bile salts, ER stress and liver injury. In addition, we show that expression of FOXA2 is markedly decreased in liver samples from individuals with different cholestatic syndromes, suggesting that reduced FOXA2 abundance could exacerbate the injury."

Glycerol 3-phosphate (G-3-P) and fatty acyl-CoAs are the substrates for the synthesis of triglycerides. G-3-P can be formed by phosphorylation of glycerol via glycerol kinase or by the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate via G-3-P dehydrogenase. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be derived from either glucose or pyruvate. Glycerol kinase, although highly active in the liver, is present at low activity in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (3Robinson J. Newsholme E.A. Biochem.

Hanson R.W. Leveille G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2746-2750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Reshef L. Niv J. Shapiro B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 688-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK-C) (EC 4.1.1.32), which catalyzes the GTP-dependent decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to form phosphoenolpyruvate, is a key regulatory enzyme in glyceroneogenesis. Ablation of PEPCK-C expression in adipose tissue resulted in mice that have a reduced fat mass, with some of the animals displaying lipodystrophy (7Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); conversely, mice overexpressing PEPCK-C in their adipose tissue became obese (8Franckhauser S. Munoz S. Pujol A. Casellas A. Riu E. Otaegui P. Su B. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and were markedly insulin-resistant when fed a high fat diet (9Franckhauser S. Munoz S. Elias I. Ferre T. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because fasting causes an increase in pyruvate incorporation into G-3-P as well as an increase in PEPCK-C activity, glyceroneogenesis has been implicated in the enhanced TG-FA cycling associated with fasting. Furthermore, a diet high in carbohydrate decreases the activity of PEPCK-C in white adipose tissue (10Chaves V.E. Frasson D. Martins-Santos M.E. Boschini R.P. Garofalo M.A. Festuccia W.T. Kettelhut I.C. Migliorini R.H. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 2475-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); these changes are largely due to alterations in gene transcription (11Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that after 48 h fast PEPCK-C activity would be increased, resulting in enhanced glyceroneogenesis in the adipose tissue, whereas a high carbohydrate, lipogenic diet would decrease PEPCK-C activity and lower flux over this pathway. Considerable triglyceride is present in skeletal muscle as lipid droplets deposited within the muscle fibers. Increases in the intramyocellular triglyceride pool have been observed in response to endurance training as well as in insulin-resistant states (12Goodpaster B.H. He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Krssak M. Falk P.K. Dresner A. DiPietro L. Vogel S.M. Rothman D.L. Roden M. Shulman G.I. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). PEPCK-C is also expressed in low quantities in skeletal muscle, although its metabolic role in this tissue is not clear. Overexpression of PEPCK-C in the skeletal muscle of the mouse resulted in a marked increase in intramyocellular triglyceride levels (14Hakimi P. Yang J. Casadesus G. Massillon D. Tolentino-Silva F. Nye C.K. Cabrera M.E. Hagen D.R. Utter C.B. Baghdy Y. Johnson D.H. Wilson D.L. Kirwan J.P. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23702-23706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that, whereas glucose and glycerol contributed equally to triglyceride glycerol synthesis in the gastrocnemius of 24-h-fasted rats, the majority of G-3-P was derived from what they termed the “indirect pathway,” which originated from reactions further down the glycolytic pathway. In the liver the pathways of gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis share a common set of reactions (16Owen O.E. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30409-30412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), so that these pathways cannot be functionally separated. Data from in vivo studies in humans fasted overnight (17Kalhan S.C. Mahajan S. Burkett E. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12928-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and from human subjects with type 2 diabetes (18Kalhan S.C. Bugianesi E. McCullough A.J. Hanson R.W. Kelley D.E. Metabolism. 2008; 57: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicated that glyceroneogenesis and not glucose metabolism via glycolysis was the predominant source of the triglyceride glycerol in the circulation. However, the extent of hepatic glyceroneogenesis during an extended fast and in lipogenic conditions has not been examined in vivo. In the present study we have quantified the relative contribution of glyceroneogenesis and glycolysis to the synthesis of triglyceride glycerol in vivo in white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and in the liver of rats over a range of physiological perturbations, i.e. controls, a 48-h fast, and in a lipogenic state induced by dietary sucrose supplementation. We have also examined glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue in response to enhanced TG-FA cycling induced by the infusion of epinephrine. Animals—Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼250–275 g with indwelling carotid artery and jugular vein catheters were obtained from Zivic-Miller Laboratories (Zelienople, PA). 3–4 days before transfer of animals to our institution, PE50 catheters were inserted in the right jugular vein and left carotid artery under sterile conditions and under anesthesia. The catheters were tunneled subcutaneously, and the distal end of each catheter was sutured to the dorsum of the neck. The catheters were filled with an anticoagulant solution, capped, and secured on the top of the neck. Post-operatively the animals were given analgesics for pain (0.2 ml of Ketosen, 10 mg/ml) and were placed on ad libitum rat chow and water. The animals were housed in the Animal Resource Facility of Case Western Reserve University under controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) and light (on at 0600 h, off at 1800 h). All procedures involving the rats used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Guidelines. The animals were fed rat chow (Purina Mills Prolab RMH 1800; 21% protein, 14% fat, 65% carbohydrate) and water ad libitum and were provided with environmental enrichment (chew squares). After entry into the facility, the rats were allowed a minimum of 4 days to acclimate to the new surroundings before the study. Glyceroneogenesis was quantified in four groups of animals: 1) controls (food was removed at 7 a.m. on the morning of the tracer isotope study; water was provided ad libitum), 2) fasting (food was removed 48 h before the tracer study; water was provided ad libitum), 3) high carbohydrate diet (in addition to rat chow, the animals were given sucrose water (20% w/v) for 5 days); food was removed at 7 a.m., sucrose water was discontinued, and animals received glucose intravenously (15 mg/kg/min, as a 10% solution) throughout the tracer study to maintain the lipogenic state), and 4) response to epinephrine infusion (food was removed at 7 a.m. on the day of the tracer study; water was provided ad libitum, and epinephrine (Hospira, Inc.; Lake Forest, IL) was infused (500 ng/kg/min) via the jugular vein catheter for 3 h). Tracer Study Protocol (Fig. 1)—Rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mCi of [3H2]O (1.0 mCi/ml). This was followed immediately by [U-14C]glucose tracer in an isotonic saline solution as a prime constant rate infusion (prime = 9 μCi/kg, constant rate infusion = 9 μCi/kg/h) via the jugular vein catheter for 7 h. The animals were unrestrained, awake, and moved freely in the cage during the experiment. Blood samples (0.2 ml) were drawn from the carotid artery at 6, 6.5, and 7 h, and plasma was separated. At 7 h, the rats were given an anesthetic dose of sodium pentobarbital (Abbott Laboratories) via the carotid artery catheter, and the tissues of interest (epididymal and mesenteric fat, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles) were harvested while the tracer infusion was continued. Plasma and tissues were stored at -80 °C until further analyses. Triglyceride Extraction and the Isolation of Glycerol and Fatty Acids—Triglycerides were extracted from the tissues and plasma using a modification of the method of Folch et al. (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adipose tissue was homogenized in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol, whereas the muscle was homogenized in saline using an IKA-ULTRA-TURRAX T 25 basic tissue blender. Plasma samples and tissue homogenates were incubated in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol for 48 h at 4 °C, then 4 mm MgCl2 was added, and the solution was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 h. The aqueous supernatant was removed, taken to dryness, and further processed as described below. The organic infranatant containing the triglycerides was dried and saponified by the addition of ethanolic KOH (0.5 n) followed by incubation at 70 °C for 1 h. To convert the carboxylate salts to the free acids, the samples were acidified by the addition of 6 n HCl. Fatty acids were extracted with hexane (Fluka) and dried. The aqueous layer containing glycerol was dried and reconstituted in a fixed volume, and the concentration of glycerol was determined fluorometrically (20Wieland, O. (1974) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Academic Press, Inc., London, 1404–1409Google Scholar). Isolation of Plasma Metabolites—Plasma glucose, glycerol, and lactate were separated by ion-exchange chromatography (Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 hydrogen resin; AG 50W-X8 formate resin) (18Kalhan S.C. Bugianesi E. McCullough A.J. Hanson R.W. Kelley D.E. Metabolism. 2008; 57: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Glucose and glycerol, eluted in the neutral fraction, were further separated by liquid chromatography (Hewlett Packard Agilent 1100 Series HPLC with Agilent ChemStation software; Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87P Carbohydrate Analysis Column, 300 × 7.8 mm; mobile phase 100% water, flow rate 0.6 ml/min, column temperature 80 °C). The eluates were dried and reconstituted in a fixed volume. The glucose concentration was determined enzymatically using the Beckman Glucose Analyzer by the glucose oxidase method. The concentrations of glycerol and lactate were determined enzymatically using a fluorometric assay (20Wieland, O. (1974) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Academic Press, Inc., London, 1404–1409Google Scholar, 21Gutmann, I., and Wahlefeld, A. W. (1974) Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Academic Press, Inc., London, 1464–1472Google Scholar). Measurements of Radioactivity—The radioactivity of 3Hina 20-μl aliquot of plasma was measured to determine the specific activity (SA) of body water. An aliquot of glucose, glycerol, and lactate, isolated from plasma samples (see above), was used to measure the total 3H and 14C radioactivity of each metabolite. The 3H and 14C radioactivity present in fatty acids and glycerol isolated (from triglycerides) in plasma and tissues was also measured. Radioactivity of C-1 and (C-1 + C-3)—The 14C and 3H radioactivity of the C-1 and (C-1 + C-3) triglyceride glycerol carbons was determined after dimedon derivatization according to the method of Reeves (22Reeves R.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1941; 63: 1476-1477Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, glycerol samples were subjected to periodate oxidation, and the formaldehyde formed was precipitated as a dimedon derivative. Each glycerol sample was divided in half; one aliquot was taken directly through the dimedon derivatization procedure, and the other aliquot was phosphorylated using glycerol kinase, as described by Bederman et al. (23Bederman I.R. Dufner D.A. Alexander J.C. Previs S.F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: E1048-E1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), to form G-3-P before the derivatization. Incubation of glycerol (or G-3-P) with periodic acid results in cleavage of vicinal diols. Phosphorylation of glycerol to form G-3-P prevents the cleavage of C-3 by periodate. Thus, radioactivity on (C-1 + C-3) and C-1-only can be determined from the same sample of triglyceride glycerol. Activity of PEPCK-C—The activity of PEPCK-C was determined by the method of Ballard and Hanson (24Ballard F.J. Hanson R.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 866-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) using adipose tissue isolated from 48-h fasted and sucrose-fed animals. The tissues were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cytosolic fraction, prepared by centrifuging the homogenate at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, was used to assay for PEPCK-C activity. Calculations—The rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose in the blood was calculated during the isotopic steady state using the tracer dilution technique (25Steele R. Wall J.S. De Bodo R.C. Altszuler N. Am. J. Physiol. 1956; 187: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar): Ra (μmol/kg/min) = I/SA, where I is the rate of infusion of [U-14C]glucose tracer (dpm/kg/min), and SA = specific activity of glucose (dpm/μmol). The SA of pyruvate was calculated from that of plasma water assuming complete equilibrium between the hydrogens on plasma water and the hydrogens on C-3 of pyruvate (Fig. 2). Therefore, the SA of pyruvate = 3 × SA of body water, assuming all three hydrogens on C-3 of pyruvate are in complete equilibrium with body water (26Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Katz J. Eur. J Biochem. 1974; 47: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Postle A.D. Bloxham D.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SA of body water = 1.11 × SA of plasma. The measured SA of plasma was multiplied by 1.11 because water constitutes 90% of plasma. The rate of gluconeogenesis was calculated by dividing the 3H SA of glucose with the estimated SA of the triose phosphate pool. The SA of the triose phosphate pool = 4 × SA of body water, as there are four hydrogens on each molecule of triose phosphate (dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P) in equilibrium with body water (Fig. 2). It was assumed that all the hydrogens on the triose phosphate molecules are labeled to the same extent as body water (26Rognstad R. Clark D.G. Katz J. Eur. J Biochem. 1974; 47: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Postle A.D. Bloxham D.P. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The rate of glyceroneogenesis in the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle was calculated as follows: glyceroneogenesis (nmol/g/h) = (3H in triglyceride glycerol (dpm/g/h) × 2/5)/(pyruvate SA (dpm/μmol) × 2/3). The 3H radioactivity of triglyceride glycerol was multiplied by 2/5 as only two hydrogens in the glycerol moiety are derived from pyruvate (Fig. 2). The SA of pyruvate was multiplied by 2/3 since only two hydrogens on C-3 of pyruvate are incorporated into triglyceride glycerol. The SA of 3H on C-1 and C-2 of triglyceride glycerol will be the same as that of body water because of complete equilibrium in the triose phosphate pool. In contrast, 3H on C-3 of triglyceride glycerol is derived from pyruvate. The “total” (direct plus indirect via lactate) rate of the glycolytic contribution to triglyceride glycerol in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle was calculated as follows: total (direct plus indirect) incorporation of glucose into triglyceride glycerol (nmol/g/h) = 2 × (14C radioactivity in triglyceride glycerol (dpm/g/h))/(14C SA of glucose (dpm/μmol)). The data are expressed as 3 carbon eq by multiplying the results by 2. The “direct” contribution of glucose carbon to triglyceride glycerol was calculated by subtracting the contribution of lactate (glyceroneogenesis) from the total glucose carbon incorporated into triglyceride glycerol. The contribution of lactate was calculated by multiplying the 14C SA of lactate with the estimated glyceroneogenic flux from pyruvate (corrected for the loss of 14C in the citric acid cycle; dilution factor 2.2) (28Hetenyi Jr., G. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 104-109PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies using four animals showed that the SA of the [14C]lactate pool reached steady state within 1 h of the start of the [14C]glucose infusion (data not shown). Plasma triglyceride glycerol from glyceroneogenesis (%) = (3H SA plasma triglyceride glycerol (dpm/μmol) × 2/5)/(SA of pyruvate (dpm/μmol) × 2/3). Both the SA of triglyceride glycerol and pyruvate were adjusted, as only two hydrogens on C-3 of pyruvate are incorporated into the glycerol moiety. Plasma triglyceride glycerol from glucose (%) = 100 × (14C SA plasma triglyceride glycerol (dpm/μmol) × 2)/(14C SA glucose (dpm/μmol)). The SA of triglyceride glycerol was multiplied by 2 since two 3-carbon eq are formed from one molecule of glucose. The rate of lipogenesis was calculated as described by Katz and Rognstad (29Katz J. Rognstad R. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3600-3610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to examine the differences between the three dietary groups. Two-tailed Student's t test (assuming unequal variance) was used to assess differences between two dietary groups for each tissue and within the same dietary group between two adipose tissue depots (or two types of skeletal muscle). Glucose Kinetics, Gluconeogenesis, and the Source of Plasma Triglyceride Glycerol—The mean plasma glucose concentration of control and 48-h-fasted animals was 8.6 and 6.3 mm, respectively (Table 1). The mean plasma glucose concentration (9.8 mm) of the rats supplemented with sucrose was not significantly different when compared with controls. The glucose Ra was significantly lower in 48-h-fasted animals (17.7 μmol/kg/min) when compared with controls (35.6 μmol/kg/min) (Table 1). In the sucrose-supplemented group, intravenous glucose infusion resulted in complete suppression of endogenous glucose production. The fractional contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose Ra, estimated from the incorporation of 3H of body water into glucose, was significantly higher in 48-h-fasted animals (58.6%) compared with the control group (28.5%) (Table 1). The contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose Ra in the sucrose-supplemented group could not be calculated, because endogenous glucose production was completely suppressed.TABLE 1Glucose kinetics, gluconeogenesis, and source of plasma triglyceride glycerol Values are the mean ± S.E.

The fraction of plasma triglyceride glycerol derived from glyceroneogenesis was ∼60% and not different among the three groups (Table 1). Approximately 15% of triglyceride glycerol was derived from glucose in the control group (Table 1). The contribution of glucose was lower in 48-h fasted rats (∼11%) and was higher in sucrose-supplemented animals (∼28%). Although sucrose supplementation resulted in a higher contribution of glucose to plasma triglyceride glycerol when compared with controls, the contribution of glucose was less than that of glyceroneogenesis (Table 1). However, the estimated contribution of glucose includes both the direct and indirect (via lactate) pathways. Therefore, the reported contribution of glucose to plasma triglyceride glycerol also includes the 14C incorporated into plasma triglycerides via glyceroneogenesis (from [14C]lactate). Glyceroneogenesis and Glycolysis as a Source of Triglyceride Glycerol in Adipose Tissue—There was no significant (p = ns) difference in the triglyceride concentration in the adipose tissue of controls and 48-h-fasted animals. In the sucrose-supplemented animals, the concentration of triglyceride was significantly higher than controls (Table 2).TABLE 2The contribution of glyceroneogenesis and glycolysis to triglyceride glycerol synthesis in adipose tissue Values are the mean ± S.E.; range is indicated in parentheses.

The rate of glyceroneogenesis in the control animals was ∼600 nmol/g/h in the epididymal adipose depot and ∼800 nmol/g/h in the mesenteric depot (Table 2). Glyceroneogenesis did not change in response to fasting for 48 h. In contrast, sucrose-supplementation resulted in a significant increase in this pathway in both adipose tissue depots. Glyceroneogenesis was higher in mesenteric adipose tissue as compared with epididymal adipose tissue in all groups; however, a statistically significant difference was only observed in the sucrose-supplemented group (Table 2). Total and direct glucose carbon incorporated into triglyceride glycerol are displayed in Table 2. 48-h fast caused a significantly lower incorporation of total glucose carbon into triglyceride glycerol as compared with controls. In contrast, sucrose supplementation resulted in a higher total contribution of glucose carbon to triglyceride glycerol (Table 2). The direct contribution of glucose to triglyceride glycerol was ∼80 nmol/g/h in control animals in both adipose depots (Table 2). In the 48-h-fasted animals the direct contribution of glucose via glycolysis was negligible. In contrast, sucrose supplementation resulted in a doubling of the direct contribution of glucose to triglyceride glycerol in both adipose tissue depots. We confirmed the predominance of glyceroneogenesis, as compared with glycolysis, by examining the 14C/3H ratio on C-1 and (C-1 + C-3) of triglyceride glycerol. C-1 and (C-1 + C-3) of glycerol were cleaved by periodate oxidation, and the radioactivity of the dimedon derivative was measured. We examined the mesenteric adipose tissue of sucrose supplemented rats because glyceroneogenesis was highest in the adipose tissue of this group. As shown in Table 3, the 14C/3H ratio was high on (C-1 + C-3) as compared with C-1 of triglyceride glycerol. A high 14C/3H ratio on C-3 (or C-1 + C-3) suggests a greater contribution of glyceroneogenesis relative to the direct contributi"

Here we show that NEIL1 interacts with flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), an essential component of the DNA replication. FEN-1 is present in the NEIL1 immunocomplex isolated from human cell extracts, and the two proteins colocalize in the nucleus. FEN-1 stimulates the activity of NEIL1 in vitro in excising 5-hydroxyuracil from duplex, bubble, forked, and single-stranded DNA substrates by up to 5-fold. The disordered region near the C terminus of NEIL1, which is dispensable for activity, is necessary and sufficient for high affinity binding to FEN-1 (KD ≅ 0.2 μm). The interacting interface of FEN-1 is localized in its disordered C-terminal region uniquely present in mammalian orthologs. Fine structure mapping identified several Lys and Arg residues in this region that form salt bridges with Asp and Glu residues in NEIL1. NEIL1 was previously shown to initiate single nucleotide excision repair, which does not require FEN-1 or PCNA. The present study shows that NEIL1 could also participate in strand displacement repair synthesis (long patch repair (LP-BER)) mediated by FEN-1 and stimulated by PCNA.

Reactive oxygen species are the most pervasive genotoxic agents in mammals (and other aerobic organisms), because they are continuously generated in vivo as by-products of respiration. Reactive oxygen species are also produced during various pathophysiologic states and oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics (1.Cadet J.L. Brannock C. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 32: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 2.Breen A.P. Murphy J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 1033-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 3.Grisham M.B. Hernandez L.A. Granger D.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: G567-G574PubMed Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the etiology of cancer and various diseases and also in aging (4.Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5417) Google Scholar); these induce a plethora of oxidatively modified bases in DNA, together with strand breaks via oxidation of the deoxyribose (5.Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rodriguez H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1102-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Many oxidized bases and abasic (AP) 2The abbreviations used are: AP, abasic; 5-OHU, 5-hydroxyuracil; FEN-1, flap endonuclease 1; PNK, polynucleotide kinase; Polδ, DNA polymerase δ; Polβ, DNA polymerase β; RFC, replication factor C; BER, base excision repair; SN- and LP-BER, single nucleotide and long patch base excision repair, respectively; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; WT, wild-type; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; nt, nucleotide. sites generated by enzymatic removal of these damaged bases are mutagenic and likely to be responsible for sporadic mutations leading to cancer and other diseases (4.Ames B.N.

For example, 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU; an abundant DNA lesion generated by oxidative deamination of C) behaves like T, and its replication would lead to a G:C → A:T mutation. 5-OHU is excised from DNA by all mammalian glycosylases to varying degrees. Oxidized bases (and single-stranded breaks) in DNA are primarily repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway, a highly conserved process that is initiated with excision of the damaged base by a DNA glycosylase. Four oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases, namely OGG1 (8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1), NTH1 (endonuclease III homolog), and NEIL1 and -2 (endonuclease VIII-like 1 and 2), have so far been characterized in mammalian cells and are responsible for repair of more than a few dozen oxidatively damaged bases. Based on structure and reaction mechanism, OGG1 and NTH1 belong to one family, whose prototype is Escherichia coli Nth (7.Radicella J.P. Dherin C. Desmaze C. Fox M.S. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases are bifunctional, with intrinsic AP lyase activity that cleaves the sugar phosphate bond of the AP site after base excision, leading to a DNA strand break at the damage site. The Nei-type enzymes NEIL1 and NEIL2 carry out successive βδ lyase reaction to cleave the deoxyribose from the AP site and produce 3′-phosphate and 5′-phosphate termini (14.Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B.

In contrast, OGG1 and NTH1 generate 5′-phosphate and 3′-phosphodeoxyribose (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde) via a β-lyase reaction at the AP site. We have recently established that NEIL-dependent BER in mammalian cells utilizes polynucleotide kinase (PNK) rather than the mammalian AP endonuclease, APE1 (14.Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P.

We have recently shown that NEIL1 is activated by WRN (Werner syndrome protein), a member of the Rec Q family of helicases whose deficiency is associated with the aging phenotype and cancer predisposition (17.Das A. Boldogh I. Lee J.W. Harrigan J.A. Hegde M.L. Piotrowski J. de Souza Pinto N. Ramos W. Greenberg M.M. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Additionally, in collaboration with us, Lu's group recently showed that the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex, a DNA damage-activated alternative sliding clamp, also stably interacts with and stimulates NEIL1 (19.Guan X. Bai H. Shi G. Theriot C.A. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2463-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our earlier data showing binary interaction between NEIL1 and DNA polymerase β (Polβ), DNA ligase IIIα, or XRCC1 suggested the presence of a BER complex in vivo that is likely to be formed after infliction of genomic damage (14.Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Karimi-Busheri F. Rasouli-Nia A. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Izumi T. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we showed that such a complex can be isolated from cell extracts that is competent to carry out complete repair of an oxidized base and whose level is enhanced after oxidative stress (16.Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several other non-BER proteins have also been shown to be involved in NEIL-initiated BER; however, their precise in vivo role in repair is yet to be understood. For example, NEIL2 interacts with YB-1, a Y-box-binding protein, and we suggested that YB-1 may be required for the fine tuning of repair (20.Das S. Chattopadhyay R. Bhakat K.K. Boldogh I. Kohno K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28474-28484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells have two distinct BER subpathways defined by the repair patch size (21.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Dogliotti E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3575-3580Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol.

Our repair studies with NEIL1 and NEIL2 so far suggested that NEIL-initiated repair involves Polβ that results in short patch or single nucleotide excision repair (SN-BER). However, based on our initial observation that among the four oxidized base-specific DNA glycosylases only NEIL1 expression is S-phase-dependent, we suspected that NEIL1 may be preferentially involved in repair of base damage in the replicative genome and thus utilizes replication DNA polymerases δ/ϵ (Polδ/ϵ) (9.Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The unique ability of NEILs to excise base lesions from single-stranded regions of DNA further supported this hypothesis (23.Dou H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49679-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Our more recent studies showing stable interaction between NEIL1 and PCNA provided additional support for NEIL1 involvement in long patch (LP)-BER (18.Dou H. Theriot C.A. Das A. Hegde M.L.

LP-BER was discovered during repair studies of reduced AP sites whose cleavage by APE1 generates a 5′-blocking reduced AP group that could not be removed by the 5′-lyase activity of Polβ and requires the 5′-endo/exonuclease activity of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) (22.Matsumoto Y.

In that case, 2–6 nucleotides are removed in addition to the 5′ reduced deoxyribose phosphate by the 5′-endo/exonuclease activity of FEN-1 (26.Lieber M.R.

The resulting gap is subsequently filled in by Polδ/ϵ or Polβ (22.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Hurwitz J. Gary R. Levin D.S. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. J. Biol.

We show in this report that NEIL1 stably interacts with and is stimulated by FEN-1 and provide the first evidence for NEIL1-initiated LP-BER. Oligonucleotide Substrates and Labeling—A 51-mer oligonucleotide containing 5-OHU at position 26 from the 5′-end and the complementary oligonucleotide containing G opposite the lesion and oligonucleotides for producing bubble and fork oligonucleotides (Table 1) were purchased from Invitrogen. Annealing was carried out by heating complementary oligonucleotides at 95 °C for 3–5 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. To produce 5′-32P-labeled substrates, the single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare) using T4 PNK before annealing. To generate bubble or fork substrates, appropriate oligonucleotide pairs were annealed (Table 1). The labeled substrates were purified to remove unincorporated label by size exclusion on a Sephadex G25 column.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide substrates used in this study and their designations X, the oxidized base, 5-OHU. Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant, untagged wild-type (WT) NEIL1 and its C-terminal deletion mutants were purified to homogeneity from E. coli as described previously (9.Hazra T.K.

The GST-fused NEIL1 domains, 312–349 and 312–389, and GST-fused FEN-1 C-terminal fragment (residues 328–380) were expressed in E. coli and purified from the cell extracts via affinity chromatography and eluting the bound proteins with 10 mm reduced glutathione. The proteins were digested with thrombin to cleave the GST tag, followed by removal of GST by chromatography on SP-Sepharose. Human WT FEN-1, its C-terminal deletion polypeptides with residues 1–336, 1–344, 1–355, and 1–367, as well as point mutants were purified as described previously (29.Liu R. Qiu J. Finger L.D.

Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of NEIL1 and FEN-1—The point mutant constructs for NEIL1 were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Mutagenesis reactions were performed using pET22(b) vector harboring NEIL1 cDNA using appropriate primers. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. After expressing in E. coli transformed with the plasmid, the recombinant His tag proteins were purified according to the protocol used for WT NEIL1. Cell Culture and Co-immunoprecipitation—The human colororectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 was grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). The cell cultures were individually transfected with C-terminally FLAG-tagged mammalian expression constructs for NEIL1 and empty FLAG vector (1 μg each) (31.Bhakat K.K. Mokkapati S.K. Boldogh I. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed at 48 h after transfection by sonication (15% output, 10 s) in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody cross-linked to agarose beads (Sigma) and analyzed for the presence of FEN-1 in the FLAG-NEIL1 immunocomplex by immunoblotting with FEN-1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories). Far Western Analysis—For far Western analysis, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, treated with 6 m guanidine HCl, and then renatured with successive dilutions of guanidine HCl in PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol (32.Jayaraman L. Moorthy N.C. Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Bustin M. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with interacting partner proteins in the blocking buffer for 3 h at 4°C before immunoblot analysis with appropriate antibodies. In Vitro Affinity Pull-down (Co-elution) Assay—His tag WT or truncated FEN-1 mutants (10 pmol) were mixed with His-select nickel-agarose beads (20 μl; Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C and then incubated with untagged WT or deletion mutants of NEIL1 (20 pmol) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for immunoblotting analysis. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (17.Das A. Boldogh I. Lee J.W. Harrigan J.A. Hegde M.L. Piotrowski J. de Souza Pinto N. Ramos W. Greenberg M.M. Hazra T.K. Mitra S.

Briefly, proteins were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μl) alone or bound to 10 pmol of GST-tagged NEIL1 domains (312–349 and 312–389), incubated with purified WT/truncated FEN-1 (5 pmol) in 0.5 ml, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-FEN-1 antibody. Affinity pull-down assays using CNBr-Sepharose beads were performed as previously published (30.Guo Z. Chavez V. Singh P. Finger L.D. Hang H. Hegde M.L. Shen B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—Interaction between NEIL1 and FEN-1 was analyzed by SPR using Biacore 3000 (GE Healthcare). Full-length NEIL1 (35 RU) was directly immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling. FEN-1 (62.5 nm to 2 μm) was injected over the sensor chip at 50 μl/min for 2 min in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The response units were corrected for the blank from the reference flow cell and analyzed using a 1:1 (Langmuir) binding model (BIAevaluation software; GE Healthcare). Fluorescence Analysis—Interaction of FEN-1 with the NEIL1 C-terminal peptide (residues 312–349, which lacks aromatic residues) was monitored by the increase in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of FEN-1 (λex = 295 nm, λem = 300–450 nm) upon titration in an LS50 spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For all binding experiments, the proteins in 10 mm PBS, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol were incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. The binding constant KD was calculated by plotting ΔF (change in FEN-1 fluorescence at 345 nm) versus ligand concentration according to the equation ΔF =ΔFmax·[ligand]/KD + [ligand]. Analysis of NEIL1 Activity—The strand cleavage of substrate DNA after lesion excision by NEIL1 was carried out using 5-OHU-containing oligonucleotide substrates at 37 °C for 15 min in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. The reaction was stopped with formamide dye mix (80% formamide, 20 mm NaOH, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol), and the products were separated by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, pH 8.4. The radioactivity was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For kinetic analysis, the substrate (2.5–120 nm) was incubated with 20 nm NEIL1 or NEIL1 plus FEN-1 (10 nm) for 4 min at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding NEIL1 to the reaction mixture. Km, Vmax, and kcat were calculated from the linear range of the reaction by regression analysis using Sigma Plot. In Vitro Reconstitution of BER— Ten pmol of 5-OHU-containing duplex oligonucleotide was incubated with various repair/replication proteins whose concentrations optimized for maximum product formation were as follows: 100 fmol each of NEIL1, PNK, Polβ, FEN-1, PCNA, and 200 fmol of DNA ligase IIIα. The reaction mixture (20 μl) also containing 1 mmol of ATP, 10 μmol of [α-32P]dNTP, and unlabeled dNTPs (25 mmol) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Appropriate controls lacked various components. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—HCT116 cells (5 × 104/dish) transiently expressing FLAG-NEIL1 were grown to 50% confluence on glass coverslips (25 mm) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, drying, and fixing in acetone-methanol 1:1 (v/v), the cells were incubated with rabbit FEN-1 antibody and counterstained with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The nuclear staining was carried out for 15 min with 10 ng/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 META system according to published protocol (17.Das A. Boldogh I. Lee J.W. Harrigan J.A. Hegde M.L. Piotrowski J. de Souza Pinto N. Ramos W.

Association of NEIL1 with FEN-1 in Vivo—We had previously shown that NEIL1 forms a stable complex with PNK, Polβ, DNA ligase IIIα, and XRCC1 that is able to carry out efficient SN-BER of oxidized bases (14.Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Karimi-Busheri F. Rasouli-Nia A. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Izumi T. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We have now identified FEN-1 in the FLAG-NEIL1 immunocomplex from HCT 116 cells but not in the vector control (Fig. 1A). In vivo association of NEIL1 and FEN-1 was further confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis. NEIL1 and FEN-1 were both localized to the nucleus of HCT116 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-NEIL1, and superimposition of confocal images fluorescence-stained for NEIL1 and FEN-1 showed substantial co-localization (supplemental Fig. 1). Direct Interaction between FEN-1 and NEIL1; Mapping the Interacting Interface of NEIL1—The binary interaction between recombinant NEIL1 and FEN-1 was confirmed using far Western analysis and an affinity co-elution assay. NEIL1 interacted with FEN-1, whereas no interaction was observed with bovine serum albumin used as a control (Fig. 1B). We next mapped the NEIL1-interacting domain for FEN-1. All of the interacting partners for NEIL1 identified so far bind to its disordered C-terminal region (residues 289–389), which is dispensable for activity (17.Das A. Boldogh I. Lee J.W. Harrigan J.A. Hegde M.L. Piotrowski J. de Souza Pinto N. Ramos W. Greenberg M.M. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Using nested deletion mutants of NEIL1, we observed stable interaction of FEN-1 with residues 1–349 and 289–389, 289–349, 312–389, and 312–349 but not with 1–311 and 1–288 in NEIL1 (Fig. 1C). We concluded that the minimum interacting interface for FEN-1 lies within NEIL1 residues 312–349. Co-elution of NEIL1 and its deletion polypeptides with His-FEN-1 showed that FEN-1 stably binds with full-length and truncation mutants with residues 1–349, 312–389, and 312–349 but not with residues 1–311 (Fig. 1D). The beads or FEN-1 alone (lanes 5 and 6, respectively) were used as controls. Reciprocal co-elution of FEN-1 with GST-fused C-terminal peptides of NEIL1 showed that NEIL1 residues 312–349 by itself were necessary and independently sufficient for interaction (Fig. 1E). Control GST did not interact with FEN-1, as expected (Fig. 1E, lane 3). Mapping the NEIL1 Interaction Site to the FEN-1 C-terminal Region—Like NEIL1, FEN-1 has an unconserved region at its C terminus that is disordered (34.Sakurai S. Kitano K. Yamaguchi H. Hamada K. Okada K. Fukuda K. Uchida M. Ohtsuka E. Morioka H. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and is involved in interaction with several partners (30.Guo Z. Chavez V. Singh P. Finger L.D. Hang H. Hegde M.L. Shen B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We tested whether the same segment is also involved in interaction with NEIL1 by using WT FEN-1 (DC0) and its C-terminal deletion mutants named DC1 (residues 1–367), DC2 (residues 1–353), DC3 (residues 1–344), and DC4 (residues 1–336) (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the C terminus does not affect folding or stability of the FEN-1 core domain (30.Guo Z. Chavez V. Singh P. Finger L.D. Hang H. Hegde M.L. Shen B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but CNBr pull-down analysis showed that NEIL1 stably bound with DC0 (arbitrarily set at 100% relative binding) and DC1 (∼50%) and weakly with both DC2 (∼10%) and DC3 (∼5%) and did not interact with DC4 at all (Fig. 2B). This result was confirmed by far Western analysis (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest that NEIL1 stably interacts with residues 354–380 of FEN-1 and makes weak contacts with residues 336–353. Identification of the FEN-1 NEIL1-binding Residues—We used site-specific mutants of FEN-1 to identify the residues in the interacting region that make contact with NEIL1. The residues in the FEN-1 C-terminal region critical for interaction with PCNA, APE1, WRN, Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1), and endonuclease G were recently identified using alanine-scanning mutagenesis (30.Guo Z. Chavez V. Singh P. Finger L.D. Hang H. Hegde M.L. Shen B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins showed nuclease activity comparable with that of the WT protein (30.Guo Z. Chavez V. Singh P. Finger L.D. Hang H. Hegde M.L. Shen B. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similar studies were carried out to identify the FEN-1 residues involved in NEIL1 binding (Fig. 2A). Several residues in the 356–380 region of FEN-1 were important for NEIL1 interaction. Specifically, single Ala mutants 20 (Lys354), 21 (Arg355), 22 (Lys356), 25 (Pro358), and 38 (Lys369) and multiple mutant 19 (Lys356/Arg357/Lys357) showed less than 25% affinity for NEIL1 relative to the WT protein (Fig. 2D).

In this study, we used the mouse bone marrow transplant model to further explore the role of 24p3 in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia. Consistent with our previous findings, when using non-irradiated mice as recipient, donor marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL but lacking 24p3 did not cause leukemia or any disease after 75 days, whereas all mice receiving wild type BCR-ABL donor cells died with CML-like disease. An agar clone of the BCR-ABL+ human CML cell line K562 (C5) that secretes relatively high levels of lipocalin 2 (human NGAL) induced suppression of hematopoiesis in spleen and marrow of mice, leading to early death in contrast to parental K562 or K562 clone (C6) expressing low amounts of NGAL. Compared with K562 cells, overexpressing NGAL in K562 led to a higher apoptosis rate and an atrophy phenotype in the spleen of the inoculated mice. Plasma from both leukemic mice and CML patients showed elevated lipocalin 2 levels compared with healthy individuals. Moreover, we found that a primary stable cell line from wild-type mouse marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL caused solid tumors in nude mice whereas a similar BCR-ABL+ cell line from 24p3 null mice did not. These findings demonstrate that lipocalin 2 has at least two functions related to tumorigenesis, one involving apoptosis induction of normal hematopoietic cells and the other being tissue invasion by leukemia cells."

https://openalex.org/W2028686797,"The requirement for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in the establishment of cell polarity and motility in a number of cell types has recently come into question. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin in neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells expressing CXCR2 resulted in reduced cell motility but normal chemotaxis in response to a gradient of CXCL8. However, wortmannin inhibition of PI3K did impair the ability of cells to re-orient their polarity and respond quickly to a change in the direction of the CXCL8 gradient. We hypothesized that Src-regulated ELMO-Dock2-Rac2 activation mediates chemotaxis in the absence of PI3K activity. Inhibition of Src with the small molecule inhibitor, PP2, or inhibition of Dock2 by shRNA knockdown confirmed the functional role of Src and Dock2 in regulating chemotaxis when PI3K was inhibited. Moreover, neutrophils isolated from bone marrow of hck-/-fgr-/-lyn-/- mice exhibited much more severe inhibition of chemotaxis when PI3K was blocked with wortmannin as compared with neutrophils isolated from bone marrow of wild-type mice. Thus, PI3K and Src-ELMO-Dock2 pathways work in parallel to activate Rac2 and modulate chemotaxis in response to a CXCL8 gradient in neutrophils.

PI3Kγ, the dominant class I PI3K in neutrophils, catalyzes the 3′-phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate PIP3. In PI3Kγ knockout mice, recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation was significantly reduced, though not completely inhibited. Additionally, in vitro chemotaxis assays showed incomplete inhibition of chemotaxis for neutrophils derived from these mice (5Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J.

Based on these data, it has been hypothesized that a PI3K-independent pathway exists in neutrophils that allows these cells to move toward a gradient of chemokine. Src family kinases (SFK) are a group of tyrosine kinases that play fundamental roles in mediating cell proliferation, survival, and focal adhesion regulation in response to a variety of environmental stimuli. In certain G protein-coupled receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways, SFK can bind and be activated by Gαi and Gαs subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein (8Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar).

Members of the Rho family of small GTPases are essential for regulation of cell cytoskeleton reorganization during motility and thus have great impact on cell morphology (polarized versus non-polarized). Activation of Rac has been shown to be required for extension of pseudopodia at the leading edge of moving cells. Rac2, as a hematopoietic-specific member of Rac, plays critical roles in regulating chemotaxis, endothelial cell rolling, superoxide production, and kinase activation in neutrophils (9Roberts A.W.

Recently, it has been reported that a random cell movement consists of bifurcation of the pseudopod at several locations and in diverse directions. In contrast, for persistent directional cell movement induced by a gradient of chemoattractant, there is domination and persistence of the pseudopod closest to the gradient (13Andrew N. Insall R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In this circumstance, the level of activated Rho GTPases, especially Rac, is key to the directional cell movement. Small Rho family GTPases are bound and activated directly by a group of proteins called guanine exchange factors (GEFs). It has been reported that PI3K up-regulates several members of these GEFs (14Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

More recently, an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins, CED-5 in Caenorhabditis elegans, Dock 180 in mammals and Mycoplast city in Drosophila (CDM) were identified to function as novel GEFs for Rac and other small Rho family GTPases (16Meller N. Merlot S. Guda C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4937-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Lu M. Ravichandran K.S.

Unlike traditional GEFs, Dock180 proteins do not contain Db1 homology or pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domains. Instead, they catalyze guanine exchange through the Dock homology region-2 (DHR2) or Docker domain (19Cote J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Dock180 proteins fold in such a way that the catalytic domain (Docker) is blocked, resulting in auto-inhibition. Only when the partner protein ELMO binds to a Dock180 family protein is the Docker domain exposed and allowed to bind and activate Rac (18Cote J.F. Vuori K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The binding of ELMO to the Dock180 family protein may also help target the complex to the plasma membrane (20Gumienny T.L. Brugnera E. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Kinchen J.M. Haney L.B. Nishiwaki K. Walk S.F. Nemergut M.E. Macara I.G. Francis R. Schedl T. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Hengartner M.O. Ravichandran K.S. Cell. 2001; 107: 27-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, Dock180 proteins contain a DHR-1 domain that interacts with PIP3 and elimination of this domain blocks chemotaxis (21Cote J.F. Motoyama A.B. Bush J.A. Vuori K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Dock2 is a leukocyte-specific Dock180 family member that plays a critical role in leukocyte polarization and migration by stimulating Rac activity (22Kunisaki Y. Nishikimi A. Tanaka Y. Takii R. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Watanabe K. Sanematsu F. Sasazuki T. Sasaki T. Fukui Y. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The binding of ELMO1 to Dock2, and often with another adaptor protein, CrkL, forms a multi-component complex that binds and activates the inactive form of Rac (23Sanui T. Inayoshi A. Noda M. Iwata E.

ELMO1 and CrkL were both found to be phosphorylated in lymphocytes by the Src family kinases, Hck and Lyn, respectively (24Nishihara H. Maeda M. Oda A. Tsuda M. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Tanaka S. Blood. 2002; 100: 3968-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Yokoyama N. deBakker C.D. Zappacosta F. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Ravichandran K.S. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8841-8849Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of ELMO1 is not required for binding of ELMO1 to Dock2, it is necessary for the function of this complex (25Yokoyama N. deBakker C.D. Zappacosta F. Huddleston M.J. Annan R.S. Ravichandran K.S. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8841-8849Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that both PI3K- and Src-dependent pathways independently lead to activation of Rac2 in neutrophils, which is responsible for the directional cell movement in response to a gradient of CXCL8.

Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human fibronectin was purchased from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Proteinase inhibitor cocktails, puromycin, and NAG (4-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. shRNA Knockdown—Two Dock2 shRNA clones were selected from the GIPZ Lentiviral shRNAmir library from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL), ID V2LHS 100893 and V2LHS 100889. A non-silencing sequence in the same vector was chosen as the non-silencing control (NS). The lentiviruses containing shRNA or non-silencing sequence were packaged in the 293-FT cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The medium containing the viruses was collected and used to infect HL60-CXCR2 cells after concentration through an Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Polyclonal stable cell lines were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Differentiated HL60-CXCR2 cells were washed and resuspended in serum-free medium. After stimulation of 5–10 × 107 cells/ml with CXCL8 at varying concentrations, cells were lysed by mixing with an equal volume of ice-cold 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 5 min, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting as previously described (27Sai J. Walker G. Wikswo J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35931-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the manufacturer recommended. Quantification was performed using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Rac Activity Assay—GST pull-down assay for Rac activation was performed as previously described by Benard et al. (28Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Cell Polarization in Zigmond Chamber and Immunostaining—Differentiated HL60-CXCR2 cells were washed, resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and seeded on a fibronectin (100 μg/ml)-precoated coverslip for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The coverslip was placed on a Zigmond chamber (Neuroprobe Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with cells facing down. One groove of the chamber was filled with serum-free medium and the other with 25 ng/ml CXCL8. The CXCL8 gradient was generated in the interface of these two solutions on the bridge of Zigmond chamber. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2, cells on the coverslip were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The orientation of the polarized cells on the coverslip was observed under the inverted microscope and counted manually. The cells polarized toward the direction of gradient were counted as P+, and the cells polarized in the opposite direction of gradient were counted as P-. If the percentage of P+ over total number of cells counted (P+ + P-) is 50%, there is no biased cell polarization toward the chemokine gradient or no chemotaxis. If [P+/(P+ + P-)] × 100% is significantly greater than 50%, chemotaxis occurs. Immunostaining was performed on these polarized cells based on the procedures previously described in Ref. 29Neel N.F. Lapierre L.A. Goldenring J.R. Richmond A. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, and confocal images were taken with LSM510 Zeiss inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimage, Germany). Preparation of Neutrophils (PMN) from Mouse Bone Marrow—Mouse neutrophils were isolated from long bones (femurs and tibias) of hck-/-fgr-/-lyn-/- C57BL/6 mice or wild-type C57BL/6 and purified as described in Ref. 30Boxio R. Bossenmeyer-Pourie C. Steinckwich N. Dournon C. Nusse O. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 75: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar. Briefly, HBSS was forced through mouse bones with a syringe. Total bone marrow cells were collected and red blood cells were removed by hypotonic buffer. Neutrophils were further purified in 3-layers of percoll gradient (78, 69, and 52%) by centrifugation at 1500 × g, 30 min without the brake. Cells at the interface between 78 and 69%, as well as the band of cells separated in the 79% percoll layer were collected and tested by flow cytometry with a specific neutrophil marker (Cedarlane Lab, Burlington, NC). Cells were resuspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until use. Flow Cytometry—Purified neutrophils (5 × 105 cells) were washed with 0.1% BSA in HBSS (pH 7.2) and resuspended in 100 μl of BSA/HBSS. FITC-conjugated neutrophil marker (1:50 dilution) (Cedarlane Lab, Burlington, NC) was added, and cells were allowed to sit on ice for 1 h. Cells were subsequently washed three times with ice-cold 0.1% BSA/HBSS and resuspended in 500 μl of 0.1% BSA/phosphate-buffered saline containing 7AAD (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for labeling live cells. Flow cytometry was performed using FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Chemotaxis Assays—The chemotaxis assay in a microfluidic chamber was performed as previously described (27Sai J. Walker G. Wikswo J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35931-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The chemotaxis assay for mouse bone marrow neutrophils was performed in a modified Boyden chamber MBA96 (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD) as follows. Different concentrations of CXCL8 chemokine were prepared in chemotaxis buffer (1% BSA/RPMI 1640 serum-free and phenol red-free medium). The bottom wells of the chamber were filled with medium containing chemokine at each concentration in triplicate. A polycarbonate filter (3-μm pore size) was placed on the top of this plate, and the chamber was assembled according to the manufacturer's suggestion. Mouse neutrophils were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with either wortmannin or DMSO (carrier control) in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed twice with chemotaxis buffer and resuspended in the same buffer at 106 cells/ml. Two hundred microliters of neutrophils were loaded into top wells of the chamber and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The chamber was dissembled carefully and the 96-well plate containing the transmigrated cells was placed in a centrifuge to spin at 2,000 rpm for 2 min to bring down the cells to the bottom wells. Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 100 μl of HBSS. Sixty microliters of NAG solution (4 mm NAG, 25 mm sodium citrate, 25 mm citric acid, and 0.25% Triton X-100, pH 5.0) were added to each well and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. One hundred microliters of stop solution (50 mm glycine and 5 mm EDTA, pH 10.4) were added to each well, and the color was read at 405 nm. The number of migrated cells was determined based upon the standard curve calculated from OD readings of 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 cells. Statistical Analysis—ANOVA with Bonferoni post-tests were used for statistical analysis. PI3K-independent Chemotaxis—Differentiated HL60 (dHL60) cells share many of the same characteristics of primary neutrophils and are therefore widely used for studying neutrophil chemotaxis. However, the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 is too low to mediate effective chemotaxis toward CXCL8 (27Sai J. Walker G. Wikswo J. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35931-35941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, a polyclonal HL60 cell line stably expressing CXCR2 (HL60-CXCR2) with similar numbers of receptors per cell in comparison with human neutrophils (27Sai J. Walker G. Wikswo J.

To assess PI3K activity in response to CXCL8, we examined the phosphorylation status of Akt (Thr-308), an indirect downstream target of the class I PI3Ks, in the presence or absence of wortmannin, an inhibitor of the class I PI3Ks. The phosphorylation of Akt (Thr-308) was completely inhibited by pretreatment of dHL60-CXCR2 cells with 50 nm wortmannin for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). When chemotaxis of dHL60-CXCR2 cells was tested in microfluidic chambers, cells migrated toward the CXCL8 gradient (0–25 ng/ml) at an average speed 6.54 μm/min (Fig. 1B and supplemental Movie S1). However, if cells were pretreated with wortmannin (50 nm, 30 min at 37 °C), the speed of cell migration was significantly slowed (average speed for wortmannin-treated cells, 5.37 μm/min versus control cells, 6.54 μm/min, p < 0.05). Surprisingly, the directionality of cell migration was not changed (Fig. 1B and supplemental Movie S2). In addition, when these cells were provided with universal stimulus of CXCL8 (25 ng/ml) in chemokinesis assays conducted in microfluidic chambers, the cells pretreated with wortmannin also showed slower movement (5.45 μm/min), compared with the control cells (6.65 μm/min, p < 0.01). These results suggest that PI3K plays a role in facilitating the speed of cell migration, but is dispensable for chemotaxis in response to a CXCL8 gradient in HL60-CXCR2. In testing the response of these cells to a directional change in the CXCL8 gradient using microfluidic gradient-reversing devices, we observed that cells changed the polarity instantly and migrated in the direction of the new gradient. However, the cells pretreated with wortmannin showed slower turning and a reduced number of cells changed the direction of migration in response to the gradient shift (31Liu Y. Sai J. Richmond A. Wikswo J.P. Biomed. Microdevices. 2008; 10: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) These data suggest that PI3K plays an important role in changing cell polarity as the direction of chemokine gradient is altered. Because wortmannin is a pan-PI3K inhibitor, the effect of PI3Kγ on CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis in dHL60 cells was tested by using the PI3Kγ-specific inhibitor, AS605240 (32Camps M. Ruckle T. Ji H. Ardissone V. Rintelen F. Shaw J. Ferrandi C. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Francon B. Martin T. Gretener D. Perrin D. Leroy D. Vitte P.A. Hirsch E. Wymann M.P. Cirillo R. Schwarz M.K. Rommel C. Nat.

Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2528-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The experiment confirmed that inhibition of PI3Kγ alone with AS605240 pretreatment (10 μm, 30 min) did not inhibit chemotaxis of dHL60-CXCR2 cells in response to a CXCL8 gradient. However, if cells were pretreated with both AS605240 and PP2, this chemotaxis was inhibited, and cells moved only along the direction of flow due to force from flow (supplemental Table S2 and Fig. S1). Activation of Src and Chemotaxis in dHL60 Cells—The intricate relationship between cell adhesion and cell movement led us to investigate the functional role of SFK in mediating dHL60-CXCR2 chemotaxis in response to a CXCL8 gradient. The phosphorylation of c-Src at pY418 is required for Src activity. Therefore a specific pY418 antibody was used for testing its activation. Because Src family kinases share a conserved sequence in this region, this antibody reacts with all members of this kinase family. In dHL60-CXCR2 cells, SFKs were activated immediately upon stimulation with CXCL8, reached a peak between 1 and 5 min, and were reduced to the basal level at 10 min. The activation of SFK was completely inhibited by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml for 4 h), suggesting CXCL8 activation of SFK is Gαi-mediated (supplemental Fig. S2). PP2, a specific inhibitor for Src family kinases, is widely used to study the function of SFK. A range of 1–25 μm PP2 were used to evaluate the optimal concentration to inhibit SFK in dHL60-CXCR2 after stimulation with CXCL8. Results from these experiments indicated that 10 μm PP2 pretreatment for 30 min at 37 °C completely inhibited activation of Src in response to CXCL8 stimulation, while 25 μm PP2 produced a level of phospho-Src even lower than the basal level in nonstimulated cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore, to avoid loss of Src kinase specificity or the toxicity of inhibitor, 10 μm PP2 was used in our experiments described here. Chemotaxis assay in the microfluidic chamber showed partial inhibition of chemotaxis in response to a CXCL8 gradient subsequent to PP2 treatment (Fig. 1D and supplemental Movie S3). The speed of migration was slower than with control pretreatment (4.88 μm/min versus 6.54 μm/min, p < 0.01). More importantly, when these cells were pretreated with a combination of wortmannin (50 nm) and PP2 (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, they completely lost chemotaxis in response to a CXCL8 gradient in microfluidic chambers, though they still exhibited random movement with average speed at 5.07 μm/min, which was also significant slower than DMSO control cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1D and supplemental Movie S4). These results suggest that the PI3K and SFK function in parallel in the sensing of the chemokine gradient and consequent directional movement. Cell Polarization in PI3K or SFK Inhibited dHL60 Cells—To evaluate the effect of inhibitors of PI3K or SFK on cell polarization in response to a chemokine gradient, experiments with the Zigmond chamber were performed, allowing for confocal analysis of polarized cells. In two independent experiments, 89% (99 of 110 cells analyzed) of the control cells pretreated with DMSO were polarized in the direction of the CXCL8 gradient (0–25 ng/ml). In cells pretreated with wortmannin (50 nm) or PP2 (10 μm) alone, the percentages of cells polarized in the direction of the CXCL8 gradient were 83% (54/65) and 86% (148/168), respectively. When cells were pretreated simultaneously with the combination of wortmannin and PP2, only 48% (33 of 68 cells) of the cells polarized toward the CXCL8 gradient, a number similar to the unbiased polarization of 50%. The percentage of non-polarized cells was increased when cells were pretreated with these inhibitors, 10.4% (wortmannin), 12% (PP2), and 23.2% (wortmannin + PP2) compared with vehicle-treated control (5.4%) (Fig. 2). Rac2 Activation in PI3K or SFK Inhibited dHL60 Cells—To further investigate the functional roles of PI3K and SFK signal transduction pathways in chemotaxis, we tested CXCL8 activation of Rac by the pull-down assay with or without the inhibition of PI3K and SFK. When dHL60-CXCR2 cells were pretreated with either wortmannin or PP2, the ligand-triggered Rac2 activation was only partially inhibited. However, when cells were pretreated with a combination of wortmannin and PP2A, the ligand-triggered Rac2 activation was completely inhibited. To confirm the efficiency and specificity of inhibition with wortmannin and PP2 for PI3K and SFK, respectively, Western blots of phospho-Akt, phospho-Src, together with total Akt and Src were performed (Fig. 3). Because the antibody for phospho-Src detects all the kinase members in the Src family of kinases, multiple bands were seen in the blot, while the antibody for total Src was c-Src only, and a single band was detected in the Western blot. These results suggest the existence of PI3K-dependent and -independent signal transduction pathways leading to activation of Rac2 in response to CXCL8 in dHL60 cells. Additionally, these results suggest that high levels of activated Rac2 (resulting fr"

We show that CD9 and CD81 are down-regulated in smoking-related inflammatory response of a macrophage line, RAW264.7. When functions of CD9 and CD81 were ablated with monoclonal antibody treatment, small interfering RNA transfection, or gene knock-out, macrophages were less motile and produced larger amounts of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 than control cells in vitro. In line with this, CD9/CD81 double-knock-out mice spontaneously developed pulmonary emphysema, a major pathological component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The mutant lung contained an increased number of alveolar macrophages with elevated activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and progressively displayed enlarged airspace and disruption of elastic fibers in the alveoli. Secretory cell metaplasia, a finding similar to goblet cell metaplasia in cigarette smokers, was also observed in the epithelium of terminal bronchioles. With aging, the double-knockout mice showed extrapulmonary phenotypes, including weight loss, kyphosis, and osteopenia. These results suggest that the tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 regulate cell motility and protease production of macrophages and that their dysfunction may underlie the progression of COPD."

https://openalex.org/W2039349984,"The E2f transcription factors are key downstream targets of the retinoblastoma protein tumor suppressor that control cell proliferation. E2F3 has garnered particular attention because it is amplified in various human tumors. E2f3 mutant mice typically die around birth and E2f3-deficient cells have a proliferation defect that correlates with impaired E2f target gene activation and also induction of p19Arf and p53. The E2f3 locus encodes two isoforms, E2f3a and E2f3b, which differ in their N-termini. However, it is unclear how E2f3a versus E2f3b contributes to E2f3's requirement in either proliferation or development. To address this, we use E2f3a- and E2f3b-specific knockouts. We show that inactivation of E2f3a results in a low penetrance proliferation defect in vitro whereas loss of E2f3b has no effect. This proliferation defect appears insufficient to disrupt normal development as E2f3a and E2f3b mutant mice are both fully viable and have no detectable defects. However, when combined with E2f1 mutation, inactivation of E2f3a, but not E2f3b, causes significant proliferation defects in vitro, neonatal lethality and also a striking cartilage defect. Thus, we conclude that E2f3a and E2f3b have largely overlapping functions in vivo and that E2f3a can fully substitute for E2f1 and E2f3 in most murine tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1980473840,"We have previously shown that the first generation human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion inhibitor T20 (Fuzeon) contains a critical lipid-binding domain (LBD), whereas C34, another anti-HIV peptide derived from the gp41 C-terminal heptad repeat, consists of an important pocket-binding domain (PBD), and both share a common 4-3 heptad repeat (HR) sequence (Liu, S., Jing, W., Cheung, B., Lu, H., Sun, J., Yan, X., Niu, J., Farmar, J., Wu, S., and Jiang, S. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9612-9620). T1249, the second generation HIV fusion inhibitor, has both LBD and PBD but a different HR sequence, suggesting that these three anti-HIV peptides may have distinct mechanisms of action. Here we rationally designed a set of peptides that contain multiple copies of a predicted HR sequence (5HR) or the HR sequence plus either LBD (4HR-LBD) or PBD (PBD-4HR) or both (PBD-3HR-LBD), and we compared their anti-HIV-1 activity and biophysical properties. We found that the peptide 5HR exhibited low-to-moderate inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion, whereas addition of LBD and/or PBD to the HR sequence resulted in a significant increase of the anti-HIV-1 activity. The peptides containing PBD, including PBD-4HR and PBD-3HR-LBD, could form a stable six-helix bundle with the N-peptide N46 and effectively blocked the gp41 core formation, whereas the peptides containing LBD, e.g. 4HR-LBD and PBD-3HR-LBD, could interact with the lipid vehicles. These results suggest that the HR sequence in these anti-HIV peptides acts as a structure domain and is responsible for its interaction with the HR sequence in N-terminal heptad repeat, whereas PBD and LBD are critical for interactions with their corresponding targets. T20, C34, and T1249 may function like 4HR-LBD, PBD-4HR, and PBD-3HR-LBD, respectively, to interact with different target sites for inhibiting HIV fusion and entry. Therefore, this study provides important information for understanding the mechanisms of action of the peptic HIV-1 fusion inhibitors and for rational design of novel antiviral peptides against HIV and other viruses with class I fusion proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4251310081,"p53 mutations occur frequently in human tumors. The low-molecular-weight compound PRIMA-1MET reactivates mutant p53, induces apoptosis in human tumor cells and inhibits tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Here, we show that PRIMA-1MET induces mutant p53-dependent mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through activation of caspase-2 with subsequent cytochrome c release and further activation of downstream caspase-9 and caspase-3. Inhibition of caspase-2 by a selective inhibitor and/or siRNA prevents cytochrome c release on PRIMA-1MET treatment and causes a significant reduction in PRIMA-1MET-induced cell death. Our findings highlight a chain of cellular events triggered by PRIMA-1MET that lead to apoptotic cell death. This should facilitate further development and optimization of efficient PRIMA-1MET-based anticancer drugs."

It functions as a chromophore of light-harvesting phycobiliproteins of cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads. Covalently linked to phycoerythrins, and some phycocyanins, PEB is an essential component of many phycobilisomes (1Ong L.J. Glazer A.N. J. Biol.

Besides this natural function, phycobiliproteins are also commonly used as fluorescent probes for biotechnological and biomedical applications (4Glazer A.N. J. Appl. Phycol. 1994; 6: 105-112Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Kronick M.N. Grossman P.D. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 1582-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of all bilins starts with the common precursor molecule biliverdin IXα (BV), which is the product of oxidative cleavage of heme by the enzyme heme oxygenase (6Cornejo J. Willows R.D. Beale S.I. Plant J. 1998; 15: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). BV is then further reduced by highly specific ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs) (7Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This new family of radical enzymes, characterized by the lack of organic or metal cofactors (8Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol.

Within the FDBR family, one can distinguish between two-electron and four-electron reductases. Phycocyanobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PcyA) is a four-electron FDBR and the best characterized member of this class of enzymes (8Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol.

It converts its substrate BV via the semireduced intermediate 181,182-dihydrobiliverdin (DHBV) to phycocyanobilin (PCB) (8Frankenberg N. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9219-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The required four electrons for the reduction are provided by the reduced form of the small acidic redox protein ferredoxin (Fd) (Fig. 1). In vivo, the electrons for Fd reduction most likely originate from photoreduced photosystem I and are then passed on to a variety of Fd-dependent enzymes (14Blankenship R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 94-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to the biosynthesis of PCB, two independent biosynthetic pathways leading to PEB have been described (Fig. 1). In phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria, BV is converted by two consecutive two-electron reductions to PEB (15Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Dammeyer T. Michaelsen K. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2007; 271: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The first reduction is catalyzed by 15,16-DHBV:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebA) and yields 15,16-DHBV. The product of this first reduction then serves as a substrate for PEB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebB) to generate PEB. A second pathway leading to PEB has recently been described by discovery of a new member of the FDBR family (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrobilin synthase (PebS; EC 1.3.7.6) catalyzes the Fd-dependent four-electron reduction of BV to PEB (Fig. 1). Biochemical analyses have established that the order of reduction is identical to that catalyzed by the consecutive action of PebA and PebB. The intermediate 15,16-DHBV is thought to remain in the active-site pocket of PebS and not to be released during catalysis (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This observation is in agreement with results on PebA and PebB from Synechococcus sp. WH8020 that suggest metabolic channeling of 15,16-DHBV directly from PebA to PebB (15Dammeyer T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27081-27089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). What is compelling about PebS is not only its novel activity but also its widespread distribution in wild cyanophage populations and absence in the respective host populations (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, PebS is a biologically and biochemically exceptional enzyme. Here, we present high resolution crystal structures of this novel enzyme, PEB synthase alone and in complex with its substrate BV. We provide further insights into the structural basis of substrate recognition and specific reduction of the tetrapyrrole system in this interesting family of radical enzymes. Recombinant Production and Purification of PebS—Heterologous expression of cyanophage pebS was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using a pGEX-6P-3 construct (GE Healthcare) for a translational fusion to glutathione S-transferase as described (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein product resulted in nine additional N-terminal amino acids that remained after cleavage with PreScission™ protease (GE Healthcare). For production of selenomethionine-labeled protein, pre-cultures and expression cultures were grown in glucose (0.4%)-supplemented M9 (instead of Luria-Bertani) medium. 20 min prior to induction with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cultures were cooled down, and an amino acid mixture containing l(+)-selenomethionine (50 mg/liter final concentration; Acros) was added to inhibit methionine biosynthetic pathways as described (18Van Duyne G.D.

The purified proteins were then concentrated using a nitrogen-pressurized stirred ultrafiltration cell with an Mr 10,000 filter cutoff (Millipore). The concentrated protein was incubated with an excess of BV (Frontier Scientific, Inc.) dissolved in Me2SO for 1 h on ice in the dark. To remove free BV and to reduce salt concentration, the protein solution was applied to a NAP™5 desalting column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 25 mm TES-KOH (pH 8.0). The protein concentration was determined using the calculated molar extinction coefficient (ϵ280 nm) (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) and adjusted to the respective concentrations. The activity of the native and selenomethionine-labeled proteins was assayed as described (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Crystallization of PebS and the PebS-BV Complex—Crystallization conditions were screened by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using the Classic, Cryo, and JSCG Suites (Qiagen), applying 200/100-nl and 100/100-nl mixtures of the protein solution (10.5 mg/ml)/reservoir solution incubated at 18 °C in the dark. Initial native PebS-BV crystals (clusters of green thin plates) grew in a 1:1 mixture of protein solution (10.5 mg/ml) and reservoir solutions containing 1.6 m sodium citrate. These conditions were further optimized with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, and final crystals grew within 14 days in a 10-μl drop. The drop was taken from a 1:1 mixture of protein solution (7.5 mg/ml) and 1.025 m sodium citrate containing 4% glycerol. The mixture was incubated for 15 h at 18 °C and centrifuged (2 × 30 min, 14,000 rpm) before placing the drop over a reservoir solution of 1.25 m sodium citrate at pH 8.0. Initial selenomethionine-labeled seleno-PebS (SePebS)-BV crystals (green) grew in a 2:1 mixture of protein solution (8.5 mg/ml)/reservoir solution containing 0.2 m magnesium chloride, 0.1 m bis-Tris (pH 5.5), and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Final crystals grew in 5-μl hanging drops and were harvested in cryoloops, briefly soaked in mother liquor with 20% polyethylene glycol 400 as cryoprotectant prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. Substrate-free (colorless) selenomethionine crystals (SePebS) grew in a 1:1 mixture of protein and reservoir solution containing 0.085 m HEPES sodium salt (pH 8.5), 17% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 8.5% isopropyl alcohol, and 15% glycerol.

Open table in a new tab Data set SePebS-1 was used for structure solution with the SHELX package (21Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80764) Google Scholar) using the HKL2MAP interface (22Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). Six selenium atoms were correctly located by SHELXD (resolution of 45 to 2.2 Å, CC (all/weak) 55.69/36.66, PATFOM of 31.6) (23Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

With the resulting phases, 203 residues could be automatically traced with ARP/wARP 6.0 (24Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The model was then iteratively refined against the high resolution data set SePebS-2 using refmac (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and coot 0.1.2 (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Model and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Residues 1–21 and 52–56 and the activesite residues Asp206 and Pro207 could not be modeled due to missing electron density. This structure represents the substrate-free protein (Protein Data Bank code 2VCL). The resulting model was then used to solve the structure of SePebS-BV in space group P1 using programs of the CCP4 package (27Collaborative Computational ProjectActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Four molecules in the unit cell were found all with bound BV in the active site. The model was again improved using iterative rounds of refinement in refmac (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) and rebuilding in coot (26Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar). Model and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The first 20 residues and region 52–56 were not modeled due to weak or missing density (Protein Data Bank code 2VCK). Crystals of unlabeled PebS with bound BV (PebS-BV) diffracted similarly well compared with the selenomethionine-labeled crystals but frequently showed multiple lattices. The structure was solved by MR in Phaser (28McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using chain A of SePebS-BV as a search model and refined as described above. Again, four molecules in the unit cell were found all with bound BV in the active-site pocket. In the final model, the first 20 residues (18 in the case of chain A) have been omitted due to missing density. The loop around Asp55 could be modeled in chain D; for the other chains, some residues were omitted due to disorder (chain A, residues 53–55; chain B, residues 55–56; chain C, residues 54–55) (Protein Data Bank code 2VGR). In all cases, medium NCS restraints have been used throughout refinement and have been released for variable parts of the structure where appropriate. All structural figures were produced using PyMOL (29DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). PebS Mediates the Transfer of Four Electrons from Ferredoxin to BV—PebS is only the second FDBR, after PcyA, known to perform a formal four-electron reduction (17Dammeyer T. Bagby S.C. Sullivan M.B. Chisholm S.W. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 442-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses established that the recombinant protein is most active under slightly basic conditions (∼pH 8.0). The in vitro reduction is faster employing the recombinant phage-encoded Fd (PetF_PSSM-2) for electron delivery compared with the use of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 Fd, resulting in an estimated turnover of ∼10 min–1 for BV at room temperature (data not shown). This is likely due to more efficient electron transfer among the phage proteins. The A-ring reduction of BV results in two possible stereoisomeric ethylidene groups, 3Z and 3E. Discussions in the past have always led to the question whether the 3Z-or3E-form is the primary product of certain FDBRs or whether they occur simultaneously. In this study, we confirmed 3Z-PEB as the primary product of PebS by absorbance spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S1). However, ratios of 3Z-PEB and 3E-PEB obtained through high pressure liquid chromatography analyses are distorted because sample preparation tends to favor conversion to the 3E-isomer (7Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (data not shown), the thermodynamically more stable isomer (30Rüdiger W. Brandlmeier T.

The formation of the 3Z-form as the primary product is in agreement with early studies on oat phytochromobilin synthase and other bilin reductases (7Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T.

Wild-type protein was crystallized with bound substrate BV (PebS-BV), and selenomethionine-labeled protein was crystallized with and without substrate (SePebS-BV and SePebS, respectively). The structure of SePebS was determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing and refined at 1.55-Å resolution to an R-factor of 0.174 and a free R-factor of 0.194 (Table 1). This structure was substrate-free and subsequently used as a search model to determine the structures of the BV complexes. Both SePebS-BV and PebS-BV crystallized in space group P1 with similar cell dimensions. In both cases, four molecules were found in the asymmetric unit. The structures were refined to R-factors of 0.184/0.227 and free R-factors of 0.225/0.285 using data to 1.8- and 2.1-Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). In all three structures, the N-terminal 20 residues were found to be disordered. Residues 51–56 form a flexible β-turn that was completely resolved only in chain D of PebS-BV. In the substrate-free form (SePebS), the active-site residues Asp206 and Pro207 could not be conclusively modeled. All Ramachandran plot outliers could be assigned to residues involved in either substrate coordination or crystal contact formation. PebS Is a Globular Single Domain Protein—The PebS enzyme is a single domain globular protein with dimensions of ∼45 × 36 × 33 Å, showing an α/β/α-sandwich fold (Fig. 2). A central seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is flanked by two α-helices on one side and three α-helices on the side of the substrate-binding pocket. The substrate BV is bound in a cavity formed by the β-sheet (proximal side) and by helices H3 and H4 and a long flexible loop between strands S6 and S7 (distal side), which closes in upon substrate binding. The flexibility of this region is illustrated in the C-α superposition of all nine copies of PebS present in the three crystal forms used in this study (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Stereoview of protein conformations observed in the crystal structures of PebS. Shown are C-α traces of the superposed monomers of SePebS without substrate (gray), SePebS-BV with bound substrate (red; chains A–D), and wild-type PebS-BV with bound substrate (blue; chains A–D).

PCC 6803 (Protein Data Bank codes 2D1E and 2DKE) (10Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (Protein Data Bank code 2G18) (12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1484-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S1), which belong to the same family of FDBRs. Helix H3 is shorter than the corresponding helix of PcyA, and the flexible loop between strands S6 and S7 forms two short helices in PcyA that are not present in PebS (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). Both proteins bind the same substrate BV but specifically reduce it at distinct double bonds, yielding the isomers PCB (PcyA) and PEB (PebS). Substrate Recognition—Clear electron density for the vinyl groups defines the orientation of the substrate with the propionate side chains facing toward the solvent (Figs. 2 and 5 and supplemental Figs. S3–S5). The A- and D-rings are buried inside the binding niche and are coordinated from the β-sheet by residues Asn88 (β-strand S4) and Asp105 (β-strand S5) (Fig. 5). Their side chains form a hydrogen bonding network with each other and the carbonyl oxygens of BV. These residues are comparably positioned in structure (supplemental Fig. S6A) and sequence alignment (supplemental Fig. S2) to the critical catalytic pair His88/Asp105 of PcyA (10Hagiwara Y. Sugishima M. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Tu S.-L. Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Fisher A.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 3127-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the distal side, the substrate is flanked by two α-helices (H3 and H4) that are connected by a short linker containing an Asp/Pro pair (Asp206/Pro207) that is strictly conserved among FDBRs except in PcyA. Interestingly, different binding modes for the substrate BV were identified within different molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of both crystal forms (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. S5). In SePebS-BV, three molecules show almost identical BV binding, with a water molecule being in hydrogen-bonding distance to all pyrrole nitrogens and to Asp206 (Fig. 5A). Here, BV is bound in a planar porphyrin-like conformation (supplemental Table S2), with the propionate side chains facing the solvent side. Within SePebS-BV, the fourth molecule in the asymmetric unit shows a different binding mode of BV. Asp206 is positioned closer to the pyrrole nitrogens, with one of the carboxylic oxygens replacing the pyrrole water (Fig. 5B). In the native structure PebS-BV, four different molecules are again found in the asymmetric unit. In three of these, the flexibility of the distal side is visible as Asp206 is rotated outside the active site (Fig. 5C). The absence of Asp206 then allows the substrate to adopt a helical lock-washer conformation, with the A-ring shifted partially above the D-ring (supplemental Table S2). This position is visible in chains A (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S4A) and C (supplemental Figs. S4C and S5C). This conformational change positions the second site of the reduction, the C-2 position of the 2,3,31,32-diene system of BV, in proton-accepting distance to O-19. FDBR enzymes catalyze the regio- and stereospecific reduction of BV to different bilin chromophores, which are essential for light harvesting in phycobilisomes and light sensing in phytochromes. Although the enzyme responsible for the four-electron reduction of BV to PCB has structurally and functionally"

Released by the epithelium into the airway surface liquid (ASL) layer, they regulate mucus clearance through P2 (ATP) receptors, and following surface metabolism through P1 (adenosine; Ado) receptors. The complexity of ASL nucleotide regulation provides an ideal subject for biochemical network modeling. A mathematical model was developed to integrate nucleotide release, the ectoenzymes supporting the dephosphorylation of ATP into Ado, Ado deamination into inosine (Ino), and nucleoside uptake. The model also includes ecto-adenylate kinase activity and feed-forward inhibition of Ado production by ATP and ADP. The parameters were optimized by fitting the model to experimental data for the steady-state and transient concentration profiles generated by adding ATP to polarized primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. The model captures major aspects of ATP and Ado regulation, including their >4-fold increase in concentration induced by mechanical stress mimicking normal breathing. The model also confirmed the independence of steady-state nucleotide concentrations on the ASL volume, an important regulator of airway clearance. An interactive approach between simulations and assays revealed that feed-forward inhibition is mediated by selective inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase. Importantly, the model identifies ecto-adenylate kinase as a key regulator of ASL ATP and proposes novel strategies for the treatment of airway diseases characterized by impaired nucleotide-mediated clearance.

The cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are particularly vulnerable to infection because of the sole dependence of MCC on P2 receptor-mediated signaling, reflecting the absence of the final effector for P1 signaling, i.e. functional CFTR.

Despite the importance of purinergic signaling for airway defenses, it has not been possible, until recently, to develop a mathematical model of ASL nucleotide regulation because of the absence of quantitative information regarding ASL nucleotide and Ado levels, the rates of nucleotide release and Ado uptake, and the kinetic properties of the ectonucleotidases.

The kinetic coefficients were optimized by fitting the output of the model to experimental values of ASL nucleotide and Ado concentrations, nucleotide release rates (12Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R.

The capacity of the model to reproduce the impact of physical parameters (ASL volume and mechanical stress) and functional interactions between network components was verified by biochemical assays on primary cultures of HBE cells. This study provides the first mathematical approach to the investigation of an important defense mechanism in human airways. Cell Culture—Model validation was conducted on HBE cultures maintained at air-liquid interface, as described previously (30Fulcher M.L. Gabriel S. Burns K.A. Yankaskas J.R. Randell S.H. Methods Mol. Med. 2005; 107: 183-206PubMed Google Scholar). The epithelial cells were obtained from healthy donors at the time of transplantation by the Tissue Culture Core of the Cystic Fibrosis Center (University of North Carolina) under the auspices of protocols approved by the Institutional Board of Review. They were isolated by protease digestion, seeded on 12-mm permeable supports (0.45 μm pores, T-Clear; Costar) coated with human type IV collagen, and kept in Ham's F-12-based medium supplemented with 5 μg·ml-1 transferrin, 30 nm triiodothyronine, 1 μm hydrocortisone, and 3.75 μg·ml-1 endothelial cell growth substance. The confluent cultures were maintained at air-liquid interface with medium on the basolateral side. After 4 weeks, they were composed of ciliated and secretory cells, with transepithelial electrical resistance ≥300 ohms/cm2. Cyclic Compressive Stress (CCS)—The HBE cultures were subjected to 1 h of CCS mimicking normal tidal breathing (20 cm of H2O; 20 cycles/min) using a system enclosed in an incubator (37 °C; 5% CO2) (10Button B. Picher M. Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 577-592Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two pieces of tubing, each containing a high speed solenoid valve, were inserted into a conical silicon plug fitted to the top of the T-Clear, one connected to a pressurized chamber and the other connected to the incubator atmosphere. A microprocessor regulated the amplitude and frequency of the chamber pressure applied to the culture by controlling the open/closed state of the solenoid valves (10Button B. Picher M. Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2007; 580: 577-592Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Biochemical Measurements of Steady-state Nucleotide Concentrations—The steady-state ASL ATP concentration was measured on HBE cultures by luminometry using soluble luciferase or a chimeric Staphylococcus aureus protein A-luciferase attached to the apical surface via keratan sulfate-specific antibodies (20Okada S.F. Nicholas R.A. Kreda S.M. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22992-23002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Steady-state concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, and Ado were determined on HBE cultures by ethenyl derivatization and fluorescence high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (12Lazarowski E.R.

Transient Nucleotide Concentration Profiles and Ectonucleotidase Activities—HBE cultures were preincubated 30 min (37 °C; 5% CO2) in Krebs buffer (pH 7.5) (0.35 ml; bilateral). Then 0.1-1000 μm ATP was added to the apical surface to determine the transient concentration profile and initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by HPLC analysis of buffer samples collected over 60 min (14Picher M. Burch L.H. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20234-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The contribution of each ectoenzyme was calculated from paired assays conducted on the same culture wells before and after pretreatment with selective noncompetitive inhibitor(s). The kinetic parameters of NSAP for ATP and ADP were determined as described previously for AMP (13Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but in the presence of 0.5 mm Ap5A to inhibit ecto-AK (ATP + AMP ↔ 2ADP) (28Picher M. Boucher R.C. J.

NSAP activity was calculated from the difference in linear rate of substrate hydrolysis measured before and after exposure to 10 mm levamisole, at each substrate concentration (0.1-1000 μm). Michaelis constants (KM) and maximal velocities (Vmax) were calculated as shown previously (13Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Kinetic Model of Airway ATP/Ado Regulation—This section outlines the theory and methodology used to build the mathematical model of airway nucleotide regulation on the apical surface of human airway epithelia. A biochemical network was derived using quantitative data gathered from the literature on nucleotide release (12Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 52: 66-75Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) by HBE cultures (Fig. 1). Because UTP levels are about 15% that of ATP (25Donaldson S.H. Lazarowski E.R. Picher M. Knowles M.R. Stutts M.J. Boucher R.C. Mol. Med. 2000; 6: 969-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the ASL layer, the influence of uridine nucleotides on ATP regulation was considered negligible. Therefore, the reactions governing ATP dephosphorylation to Ado and Ado deamination are as shown in Reactions 1-5, ATP→ADP+PiREACTION 1 ADP→AMP+PiREACTION 2 AMP→Ado+PiREACTION 3 Ado→InoREACTION 4 ATP→AMP+PPiREACTION 5 Each of the above reactions was assumed to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the form shown in Equation 1, reaction rate=Vmax(j)[S]KM(j)+[S](Eq. 1) where [S] is the substrate concentration, and Vmax(j) and KM(j) are the maximum velocity and Michaelis constant. The superscript j is used to index the multiple enzymes involved in the pathway. In contrast, the reversible ecto-AK Reaction 6, ATP+AMP↔2ADPREACTION 6 which involves two binding sites, has been shown to follow a Bi Bi mechanism (32Valero E. Varon R. Garcia-Carmona F. FEBS Lett. 2006; 273: 3598-3613Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 2, reaction rate=Vmax(f)1+KATP(f)KAMP(f)[ATP][AMP]+KATP(f)[ATP]+KAMP(f)[AMP]-Vmax(b)1+(KADP(b)[ADP])2+2KADP(b)[ADP](Eq. 2) This expression is a generalization of Michaelis-Menten kinetics that relies on the same underlying assumptions. The model also incorporates the feed-forward inhibition of AMP hydrolysis by ATP and ADP. Experimental evidence indicates that ATP and ADP competitively bind to enzymes that catalyze AMP dephosphorylation (13Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 33Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1979: 950Google Scholar). Equation 3 was used to model this effect, reaction rate=Vmax(j)[AMP]KM(j)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP](Eq. 3) Although it is possible that the inhibition constants KATP(in) and KADP(in) may differ for ecto-5′-NT and NSAP, these values were assumed identical for simplicity. The remaining elements that were incorporated into the model are the rates of ATP release and Ado/Ino uptake. In accordance with experimental observations (12Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36855-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the basal rate of ATP release (JATP) was considered constant. Because Ado and Ino are taken back into the cell through CNT3, and therefore compete for access to the transporter, this effect is modeled using the following rates for Ado and Ino uptake as shown in (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5), jAdo=-Vmax(n, 1)[Ado]KM(n, 1)+[Ado]+KM(n, 1)KM(n, 2)[Ino](Eq. 4) jIno=-Vmax(n, 2)[Ino]KM(n, 2)+[Ino]+KM(n, 2)KM(n, 1)[Ado](Eq. 5) which allows for the possibility of different Vmax and KM values for the two molecules. One of the functions of nucleotide release is to stimulate liquid secretion, which in turn may affect ASL nucleotide concentrations. Under static conditions, the basal rate of release does not maintain ATP at sufficiently high levels to activate P2 receptors (12Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36855-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, Ado levels generated from ATP metabolism under static conditions stimulate liquid secretion into the ASL layer via the A2B receptor-CFTR pathway (17Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, the model equations were derived for the general condition of a time-dependent ASL volume. To illustrate how the ASL volume enters the model, consider a simple case in which ATP is released into the ASL at a constant rate of JATP molecules/s, and then hydrolyzed by enzyme E. The surface area is denoted by A, and [E]T represents the surface density of E, expressed in mol·cm-2.If V indicates ASL volume, the equation governing ATP concentration is shown in Equation 6, d[ATP]dt=JATPV-KcatAV[E]T[ATP]KM+[ATP]-[ATP]VdVdt(Eq. 6) where (kcatA)/(V)[E]T corresponds to maximum velocity (Vmax) and the last term models changes in ATP concentration because of the changing ASL volume. The considerations discussed above led to the formulation of five equations to describe the regulation of adenine nucleotides in the ASL layer (Equations 7-11). All model simulations were performed in MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) using the ordinary differential equation solver of 15 s. d[ATP]dt=JATPV-Vmax(1)[ATP]KM(1)+[ATP]-Vmax(2)[ATP]KM(2)+[ATP]-Vmax(3)[ATP]KM(3)+[ATP]-Vmax(10)[ATP]KM(10)+[ATP] -Vmax(f)1+KATP(f)KAMP(f)[ATP][AMP]+KATP(f)[ATP]+KAMP(f)[AMP]+Vmax(b)1+(KADP(b)[ADP])2+2KADP(b)[ADP]-[ATP]VdVdt(Eq. 7) d[ADP]dt=Vmax(1)[ATP]KM(1)+[ATP]+Vmax(2)[ATP]KM(2)+[ATP]+Vmax(3)[ATP]KM(3)+[ATP]-Vmax(4)[ADP]KM(4)+[ADP] -Vmax(5)[ADP]KM(5)+[ADP]+2Vmax(f)1+KATP(f)KAMP(f)[ATP][AMP]+KATP(f)[ATP]+KAMP(f)[AMP]-2Vmax(b)1+KADP(b)[ADP]-[ADP]VdVdt(Eq. 8) d[AMP]dt=Vmax(4)[ADP]KM(4)+[ADP]+Vmax(5)[ADP]KM(5)+[ADP]+Vmax(10)[ATP]KM(10)+[ATP]-Vmax(f)1+KATP(f)KAMP(f)[ATP][AMP]+KATP(f)[ATP]+KAMP(f)[AMP] +Vmax(b)1+KADP(b)[ADP]Vmax(6)[AMP]KM(6)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP]-Vmax(7)[AMP]KM(7)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP] -Vmax(8)[AMP]KM(8)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP]-[AMP]VdVdt(Eq. 9) d[Ado]dt=-Vmax(9)[Ado]KM(9)+[Ado]-Vmax(u,1)[Ado]KM(u,1)+[ADO]+KM(u,1)KM(u,2)[Ino]+Vmax(6)[AMP]KM(6)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP]+Vmax(7)[AMP]KM(7)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP]+Vmax(8)[AMP]KM(8)(1+[ATP]KATP(in)+[ADP]KADP(in))+[AMP]-[Ado]VdVdt(Eq. 10) d[Ino]dt=Vmax(9)[Ado]KM(9)+[Ado]-Vmax(u,2)[Ido]KM(u,2)+[Ino]+KM(u,2)KM(u,1)[Ado]-[Ino]VdVdt(Eq. 11) Linear Model for the Steady-state Nucleotide Concentrations—The biochemical data showed that, under physiological conditions, steady-state nucleotide concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than the KM values of the enzymatic reactions (12Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Grubb B.R. van Heusden C.A. Okada S. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36855-36864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Hence, to a good approximation, the Michaelis-Menten reaction rates can be simplified (linearized) as shown in Equation 12, ∑j=1kVmaxj[S]KM(j)+[S]∼(∑j=1kVmaxjKM(j))[S]=p(k)⋅[S](Eq. 12) where the parameter P(K) denotes the sum of the ratios of Vmax(j) to KM(j) for all enzymes catalyzing the same reaction. The expressions for Ado and Ino uptake can be simplified in a similar way. The reversible ecto-AK reaction (Reaction 6) is a second order reaction requiring two substrates and therefore does not contribute significantly to the regulation of ASL nucleotide concentrations under steady-state conditions. Also, steady-state ATP and ADP levels are 1000-fold lower than their Ki values for the feed-forward inhibition reaction (13Picher M. Burch L.H. Hirsh A.J. Spychala J. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13468-13479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and therefore insufficient to inhibit AMP. Therefore, these equations were excluded from the linear model. Using these simplifications, (Eq. 7), (Eq. 8), (Eq. 9), (Eq. 10), (Eq. 11) can be approximated under steady-state conditions by the following set of linear (Eq"

Activation of RAF kinases involves a complex series of phosphorylations. Although the most prominent phosphorylation sites of B- and C-RAF are well characterized, little is known about regulatory phosphorylation of A-RAF. Using mass spectrometry, we identified here a number of novel in vivo phosphorylation sites in A-RAF. In particular, we found that Ser-432 participates in MEK binding and is indispensable for A-RAF signaling. On the other hand, phosphorylation within the activation segment does not contribute to epidermal growth factor-mediated activation. Furthermore, we show that the potential 14-3-3 binding domains in A-RAF are phosphorylated independently of its activation status. Of importance, we identified a novel regulatory domain in A-RAF (referred to as IH-segment) positioned between amino acids 248 and 267 that contains seven putative phosphorylation sites. Three of these sites, serines 257, 262, and 264, regulate A-RAF activation in a stimulatory manner. The spatial model of the A-RAF fragment, including residues between Ser-246 and Glu-277, revealed a switch of charge at the molecular surface of the IH-region upon phosphorylation, suggesting a mechanism in which the high accumulation of negative charges may lead to an electrostatic destabilization of protein-membrane interaction resulting in depletion of A-RAF from the plasma membrane. Together, we provide here for the first time a detailed analysis of in vivo A-RAF phosphorylation status and demonstrate that regulation of A-RAF by phosphorylation exhibits unique features compared with B- and C-RAF.

Unlike lower eukaryotes, which express only one RAF gene, vertebrates inherit three members of the RAF family of proto-oncogenes, A-RAF, B-RAF, and C-RAF (8.Bonner T.I. Kerby S.B. Sutrave P.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2651-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). All RAF isoforms share three conserved regions (CR1, CR2, and CR3) and can be divided in two functional parts, the N-terminal regulatory domain and the C-terminal kinase domain (9.Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The regulatory part includes CR1 and CR2 that in the case of C-RAF span residues 51-194 (CR1) and 254-269 (CR2). The CR1 consists of the Ras binding domain (RBD) followed by the cysteine-rich domain (CRD), whereas CR2 is rich in serines and threonines. CR3 represents the kinase domain extending in C-RAF from residues 347 to 613 (see also Fig. 1A). Despite intensive investigations, the molecular mechanism by which RAF activity is regulated is not completely elucidated. Although direct experimental support is missing, it has been generally accepted that the N-terminal regulatory part of C-RAF interacts in nonstimulated cells with catalytic domain, promoting a closed conformation of the kinase. Association with 14-3-3 proteins may further stabilize this inactive conformation (12.Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). A current model suggests that RAF association with plasma membrane lipids or lipid rafts represents the prerequisite step in the RAF activation (13.Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J.

Upon stimulation of cell surface receptors, association with the activated small G-protein Ras (Ras-GTP) occurs in the plane of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Binding to activated Ras initiates further activation steps such as phosphorylation events, differential association with 14-3-3 proteins, and finally dimer formation with B-RAF (15.Garnett M.J.

Phosphorylation of RAF kinases is of particular importance in RAF regulation, as it plays a crucial role not only in the activation process but is also a prerequisite for docking of several interacting partners such as 14-3-3 proteins and MEK. In C- and B-RAF both stimulatory and inhibitory sites have been reported. In C-RAF, the most prominent basal phosphorylation sites have been identified as serines 43, 259, and 621. These sites have been shown to be phosphorylated in growth factor-stimulated as well as in resting cells (20.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of serines in positions 259 and 621 is necessary for association with 14-3-3 proteins (21.Yaffe M.B.

Phosphorylation of the internal 14-3-3-binding site serine 259 has been reported to suppress C-RAF kinase activity (20.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3717-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that in addition to serine 259, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of serines 43 and 233 by protein kinase A results in negative regulation of C-RAF function. Recently, serine 471 in C-RAF and the corresponding residue in B-RAF (Ser-578) were identified as in vivo phosphorylation sites that are critical for RAF activity and serve as a docking site for MEK (28.Zhu J. Balan V. Bronisz A. Balan K. Sun H. Leicht D.T. Luo Z. Qin J. Avruch J. Tzivion G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4733-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The highly conserved motif DFGLATVKSR, which is a part of the activation segment, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation of residues Thr-491 and Ser-494 in C-RAF. They are homologous to Thr-452 and Thr-455 of A-RAF, as well as to Thr-599 and Ser-602 of B-RAF. This segment lies within the putative activation loop of the kinase domain and is likely to be necessary for kinase activity of B- and C-RAF (29.Zhang B.H. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 30.Chong H. Lee J. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3716-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The importance of these conserved residues for A-RAF activation remains to be investigated. Treatment of cells with growth factors induces phosphorylation of C-RAF at multiple sites located within the regulatory part of the protein. These are threonines 268/269, serines 289/296/301, serines 338/339, and tyrosines 340/341. Threonine 268 within the CR2 domain in C-RAF and the homologous residue threonine 372 in B-RAF represent an autophosphorylation site (20.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Stephens R.M. Sithanandam G. Copeland T.D. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas threonine 269 of C-RAF has been proposed to serve as a target for phosphorylation by KSR (32.Xing H.R. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9733-9741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, we and other groups (33.Hekman M. Fischer A. Wennogle L.P. Wang Y.K. Campbell S.L.

They are located within the variable sequence stretch, which connects CR2 with the kinase domain. Although the interpretation of the results is still controversial, the published data document that these sites regulate C-RAF by direct ERK-mediated feedback phosphorylation (34.Balan V. Leicht D.T.

Furthermore, a short conserved sequence in front of the kinase domain, also called the N-region (the name is derived from Negative-charge regulatory region) has been reported to be necessary for the basal activity and growth factor-induced activation of RAF kinases. This region contains one highly conserved serine, which is present in all three RAF isoforms (Ser-299 in A-RAF, Ser-338 in C-RAF and Ser-446 in B-RAF) and two conserved tyrosines (Tyr-301/Tyr-302 in A-RAF and Tyr-340/Tyr-341 in C-RAF), which are substituted to aspartates in B-RAF. Phosphorylation of these sites positively regulates kinase activity of RAF kinases (36.Diaz B. Barnard D. Filson A. MacDonald S. King A. Marshall M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37.Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Mason C.S. Marshall C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Corroborating the complex regulation of RAF kinase activity by the N-region, we recently showed that beside the regulatory function of serine 338 of C-RAF (and corresponding residues in A- and B-RAF), the nonconserved amino acids in positions -3 and +1 relative to Ser-338 play also an important role in the course of RAF activation (39.Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Regarding regulation of B-RAF activity by phosphorylation, there are similarities but also essential differences compared with C-RAF. Phosphorylation of serines 365 and 729 that are equivalent to serines 259 and 621 of C-RAF has been shown to mediate 14-3-3 binding to B-RAF and regulate its activity in a similar way as reported for C-RAF (16.Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Send-tner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14074-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40.Brummer T. Martin P. Herzog S. Misawa Y. Daly R.J. Reth M. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6262-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the N-region-mediated regulation is quite different in B- and C-RAF because the tyrosine residues of C-RAF (Tyr-340 and Tyr-341) are occupied by aspartic acids in B-RAF (Asp-448 and Asp-449). This leads to constitutive phosphorylation of the serine 446 in B-RAF (3.Wellbrock C. Karasarides M. Marais R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Thus, because of the accumulated negative charge at the N-region, the B-RAF kinase exhibits unusual high basal kinase activity (13.Hekman M. Hamm H. Villar A.V. Bader B. Kuhlmann J. Nickel J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24090-24102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38.Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Marshall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). With some exceptions little is known about the role of phosphorylation in the activation process of A-RAF. We showed recently that the presence of serine 299 within the N-region is necessary for A-RAF activation (39.Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To address how phosphorylation events apart from the N-region regulate the activation cycle of A-RAF, we performed here a systematic analysis of the potential phosphorylation sites in A-RAF protein by use of mass spectrometry. The physiological role and the function of the novel phosphorylation sites derived from the mass spectrometry data have been investigated subsequently by amino acid exchange at the relevant positions. In particular, we report here that, similar to B- and C-RAF, the potential 14-3-3 binding domains in A-RAF are phosphorylated at the serines 214 and 582 independent of its activation status. Furthermore, we found that serine 432 within the potential MEK binding domain is essential for A-RAF signaling, whereas the importance of phosphorylation within the activation segment (threonines 452 and 455) for A-RAF activity is restricted to the Ras/Lck-mediated stimulation. In addition, we identified seven novel phosphorylation sites within a tryptic peptide corresponding to A-RAF-(248-267). We designate this regulatory domain as the IH-segment (Isoform-specific Hinge segment). Three of the phosphorylation sites within this segment (serines 257, 262, and 264) are strongly involved in the positive regulation of A-RAF activity. The spatial model of the A-RAF fragment, including residues between serine 246 and glutamine 277, revealed a switch of charge at the molecular surface of the IH-region upon phosphorylation, suggesting a mechanism in which the high accumulation of negative charges may lead to an electrostatic destabilization of protein-membrane interaction resulting in depletion of A-RAF from the plasma membrane upon prolonged stimulation. Collectively, we present here for the first time a detailed analysis of the A-RAF phosphorylation that together with data recently published by our group (39.Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) illuminate the complex RAF activation process. Materials—EGF was from Cell Systems and U0126 from Pro-mega. Anti-phospho-ERK, anti-Myc, anti-ERK, anti-actin, and anti-Lck antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against H-Ras was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Phosphospecific antibodies directed against Ser(P)-259 of C-RAF were from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Ser(P)-621 of C-RAF antibody was generated in-house (16.Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Send-tner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Dianova. Anti-M2PK was from Schebo Biotech. Anti-histone 3 antibody was obtained from Apstate (kindly provided by M. Becker). Antibody against vimentin was from Dako (kindly provided by R. Houber). DNA Construction—Cloning of C-terminal Myc-tagged human A- and C-RAF was performed as described previously (39.Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The site-specific mutations of A-RAF were introduced using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fidelity of the A-RAF mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, in humidified air with 5% CO2. cDNA encoding the Myc-tagged A-RAF was transfected either alone or with H-Ras12V and Lck into COS7 cells using jetPEI transfection reagent (Biomol); a total of 8 μg of recombinant DNA per 10-cm Petri dish was used. The transfection was carried out under starvation conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.03% fetal calf serum for 24 h, followed by lysis with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of standard proteinase inhibitors for 45 min at 4 °C. In some experiments cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF or 10 μm U0126 for times indicated before lysis. All lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-Myc antibody. After addition of protein G-agarose (20-μl bead volume), the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 2 h. The agarose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and once with kinase assay buffer. Kinase assay was carried out directly with immunoprecipitated proteins as described below. In Vitro RAF Kinase Assay—Kinase assays were performed using recombinant MEK and ERK-2 as substrates as described previously (39.Baljuls A. Mueller T. Drexler H.C. Hekman M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26575-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To quantify the Western blot signals (e.g. A-RAF and pA-RAF, ERK, and pERK), x-ray films (FujiFilm) were scanned, and optical density was determined by use of ImageJ software. Infection of Sf9 Insect Cells, Purification of A-RAF Kinase, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—For the production of recombinant A-RAF proteins, Sf9 cells were infected with the desired baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and incubated for 48 h at 30 °C. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and pelleted at 1100 rpm. Lysis and purification of GST-tagged A-RAF proteins were performed as described by Hekman et al. (16.Hekman M. Wiese S. Metz R. Albert S. Troppmair J. Nickel J. Send-tner M. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14074-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purity of A-RAF was documented by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and staining with Coomassie Blue. For Western blot analysis, the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with antibodies specific for A-RAF. Subcellular Fractionation—Cell fractions were isolated using the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit (Calbiochem). COS7 cells were grown on the 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected with cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged A- and C-RAF proteins in the presence and absence of H-Ras12V and Lck. The cells were fractionated into four subproteomic fractions (cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, fractions of whole membranes, and cytoskeleton) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The recombinant RAF proteins were detected by anti-Myc antibody. The selectivity of subcellular extraction was documented by immunoblotting against marker proteins (M2PK for cytosolic fraction, histone 3 for nuclear fraction, and vimentin for cytoskeletal fraction). Modeling of the Three-dimensional Structure of the IH-segment in A-RAF—Structure models for the IH-segment of A-RAF comprising residues Ser-246 to Glu-277 were obtained by de novo modeling using the software QUANTA2006 (Accelrys Inc, San Diego). Briefly, the peptide sequence was built using the Sequence Builder in the ProteinDesign tool of QUANTA2006 with the peptide adopting an extended conformation. The sequence of the phosphopeptide was built in the identical manner using phosphoserines and phosphothreonine for residues Ser-250, Thr-253, Ser-257, Ser-259, Ser-262, Ser-264, and Ser-265. Secondary structure prediction using the software ProteinPredict (41.Rost B. Liu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3300-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), JPred (42.Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), and AGSSP (available on line) was performed to test whether the IH-segment of A-RAF might adopt a defined secondary structure. However, none of the programs predicted defined secondary structure elements independent of whether this or longer stretches covering the region of interest were used in the prediction. Thus, molecular dynamics simulation was used to determine possible differences because of the phosphorylation. First shorter simulations starting with an extended peptide were performed in vacuo using the CHARMM22 force field, including electrostatic terms, but with a constant dielectric with the dielectric constant ϵ set to 78 as in water. Simulations of 200 ps were performed causing the extended peptide to collapse to a more globular structure. These globular structures were put into explicit solvent by immersing the peptide structures in water using a water shell of 10 Å around the peptide. After energy minimization using 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, molecular dynamics simulations of 500 ps length were performed employing the CHARM22 force field. Several runs were conducted to determine the probabilities of defined structure elements obtained in these simulations. No defined structures could be obtained by these simulations, which is consistent with the secondary structure predictions. Calculation of the electrostatic potential maps of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptide was carried out using the software ABPS (43.Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5905) Google Scholar). The charge force field of AMBER7.0 was used. Charges for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were obtained from Homeyer et al. (44.Homeyer N. Horn A.H. Lanig H. Sticht H. J. Mol. Model. 2006; 12: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Potential maps were calculated using an ionic strength of 0 mm; however, using physiological salt concentrations of 150 mm did not alter the maps other than scaling the potentials to the higher salt. Charge distribution was identical at different salt concentrations. Mass Spectrometry Measurements—Purified GST-tagged A-RAF samples (about 10 pmol of each) were applied to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining applying the method of Neuhoff et al. (45.Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). In-gel reduction, acetamidation, tryptic, and/or GluC digestion were done according to Wilm et al. (46.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). After elution of the peptides, solutions were desalted using Millipore C18 ZipTip according to the manufacturer's instructions. ESI-MS was performed on a Bruker APEX II FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonic GmbH Bremen) equipped with an Apollo-Nano-ESI ion source in positive ion mode. To determine the exact positions of phosphates within the peptides, the nano-LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out as follows.

https://openalex.org/W1999535387,"Na(+) transport across epithelia is mediated in part by the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC. Previous work indicates that Na(+) is an important regulator of ENaC, providing a negative feedback mechanism to maintain Na(+) homeostasis. ENaC is synthesized as an inactive precursor, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of the alpha and gamma subunits. Here we found that Na(+) regulates ENaC in part by altering proteolytic activation of the channel. When the Na(+) concentration was low, we found that the majority of ENaC at the cell surface was in the cleaved/active state. As Na(+) increased, there was a dose-dependent decrease in ENaC cleavage and, hence, ENaC activity. This Na(+) effect was dependent on Na(+) permeation; cleavage was increased by the ENaC blocker amiloride and by a mutation that decreases ENaC activity (alpha(H69A)) and was reduced by a mutation that activates ENaC (beta(S520K)). Moreover, the Na(+) ionophore monensin reversed the effect of the inactivating mutation (alpha(H69A)) on ENaC cleavage, suggesting that intracellular Na(+) regulates cleavage. Na(+) did not alter activity of Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates ENaC cleavage, but Na(+) reduced ENaC cleavage by exogenous trypsin. Our findings support a model in which intracellular Na(+) regulates cleavage by altering accessibility of ENaC cleavage sites to proteases and provide a molecular explanation for the earlier observation that intracellular Na(+) inhibits Na(+) transport via ENaC (Na(+) feedback inhibition)."
https://openalex.org/W2017835089,"Normal human prostate (NHP) epithelial cells undergo senescence in vitro and in vivo, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show that the senescence of primary NHP cells, which are immunophenotyped as intermediate basal-like cells expressing progenitor cell markers CD44, α2β1, p63, hTERT, and CK5/CK18, involves loss of telomerase expression, up-regulation of p16, and activation of p53. Using genetically defined manipulations of these three signaling pathways, we show that p16 is the primary determinant of the NHP cell proliferative capacity and that hTERT is required for unlimited proliferative life span. Hence, suppression of p16 significantly extends NHP cell life span, but both p16 inhibition and hTERT are required to immortalize NHP cells. Importantly, immortalized NHP cells retain expression of most progenitor markers, demonstrate gene expression profiles characteristic of proliferating progenitor cells, and possess multilineage differentiation potential generating functional prostatic glands. Our studies shed important light on the molecular mechanisms regulating the proliferative life span of NHP progenitor cells.

Interestingly, the ABCG2+ cells in the benign prostate constitute <1% of total basal cell population and share essentially the same transcriptome as the side population cells (19Pascal L.E.

A population of CK5 and CK18 double positive (CK5+/CK18+) cells called intermediate basal cells, which constitute ∼1% of the basal cells, have also been proposed as prostate stem/progenitor cells (4Wang Y.

Since definitive prostate SCs have not been reported, prostate epithelial cells with certain SC properties (e.g. regenerating prostatic glands in vivo) are often termed as stem/progenitor cells or, simply, progenitor cells. Mammalian cells, including adult SCs, have a finite proliferative life span in that after a certain number of cell divisions, they enter a permanent cell cycle arrest termed senescence (21Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), which may constitute a critical tumor-preventing mechanism (22Yaswen P. Campisi J.

In animal models, prostate epithelial cell senescence appears to constitute a mechanism that inhibits progression of benign to malignant lesions (27Chen Z. Trotman L.C. Shaffer D. Lin H.K. Dotan Z.A. Niki M. Koutcher J.A. Scher H.I. Ludwig T. Gerald W. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 436: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), although our recent work demonstrates that senescent human prostate epithelial cells can also enhance tumorigenicity via cell fusion (28Bhatia B. Multani A.S. Patrawala L. Chen X. Calhoun-Davis T. Zhou J. Schroeder L. Schneider-Broussard R. Shen J. Pathak S. Chang S. Tang D.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, we first aim to characterize multiple primary strains of normal human prostate (NHP) epithelial cells with respect to their phenotypic and proliferative properties, since systematic studies have not been reported. We then explore the molecular mechanisms of NHP cell senescence by focusing on three essential molecules, p16INK4a (p16), p53, and telomerase. Although p16 has previously been shown to be up-regulated during prostate epithelial cell senescence (23Jarrard D.F. Sarkar S. Shi Y. Yeager T.R. Magrane G. Kinoshita H. Nassif N. Meisner L. Newton M.A. Waldman F.M. Reznikoff C.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2957-2964PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sandhu C. Peehl D.M. Slingerland J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2616-2622PubMed Google Scholar), the critical question of whether it is actually required for senescence has not been addressed. We provide definitive evidence that p16 is the primary factor that limits the proliferative capacity of NHP progenitor cells. Likewise, although hTERT has been utilized to immortalize prostate tumor cells (29Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L.

We show herein that both telomerase and p16 inhibition are required for NHP cell immortalization. Finally, we demonstrate that immortalized NHP cells retain gene expression profiles characteristic of proliferating progenitor cells and can differentiate into functional prostatic glands in vivo. Cells and Reagents—Twelve primary NHP cell strains (Table 1) were derived either from normal organ donors (NHP1, NHP3, NHP4, and NHP6 to -10; obtained from Cambrex (Rockland, ME)) or from uninvolved benign prostate tissues distant from PCa foci (NHP2, -5, -11, and -12). NHP2 and NHP5 cells were previously used in our studies (9Bhatia B. Tang S. Yang P. Doll A. Aumueller G. Newman R.A. Tang D.G.

NHP cells were routinely cultured on collagen-coated dishes in serum/androgen-free, partially defined PrEBM medium containing insulin, EGF, bovine pituitary extract (BPE) (Invitrogen), and antibiotics. This medium was based on that of Peehl and Stamey (34Peehl D.M. Stamey T.A. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), modified by Chopra et al.

PCa and 293T cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (for PCa cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for 293T cells) supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated FBS. Primary antibodies used in this study are listed in Table S1. All regular culture media were purchased from Invitrogen, and all other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6796-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Briefly, benign prostate tissues were minced into ∼1-mm3 pieces and subjected to an overnight digestion in a mixture containing type I collagenase and DNase (both at 50 units/ml). Upon digestion, epithelial organoids were enriched by a brief centrifugation, followed by trypsin digestion to release epithelial cells. Samples were then subjected to a discontinuous Percoll gradient purification step to remove the majority of mononuclear blood cells and dead cells. Finally, cell preparation was subjected to a negative selection process using MACS (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA) and the antibody mixture (anti-CD3, -CD14, -CD16, -CD19, -CD20, -CD31, -CD45, -CD56, and -CD140b) to remove the Lin+ cells, including hematopoietic, endothelial, and other stromal cells (smooth muscle, myoepithelial, fibroblast, etc.). The whole procedure took 6-8 h to accomplish and generally resulted in >98% pure human epithelial cells as judged by Ber-EP4 immunostaining. Immunoprecipitation and Coupled Immune Complex Kinase Assays—For immunoprecipitation, young (P3) and senescent (P6) NHP6 cells were harvested by trypsin and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then cells were resuspended in the homogenizing/lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% CHAPS, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 250 mm sucrose and protease inhibitors and homogenized in a glass Pyrex homogenizer (type A pestle). At the end, cells were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) to obtain clarified supernatant. Primary antibody (i.e. rabbit polyclonal Cdk4; 5 μg) or the control (Rb IgG) was preconjugated (in two aliquots) to protein G-Sepharose, followed by blocking with bovine serum albumin. Then the cell supernatant was added to the antibody-bound beads and incubated at 4 °C under rotating conditions overnight. Following extensive washing (4 times) in the homogenizing buffer, the immune complex-Sepharose beads were split into three portions. One portion was directly used in Western blotting for Cdk-associated p16. The other two portions were used in coupled immune complex kinase assays using either Rb C-terminal domain (sc-4112; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or histone H1 as substrate. Briefly, the immune complex on the beads was resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 50 μm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of substrate, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding an equal amount of 2× sample loading buffer. Reaction products were then fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging analysis. The Cdk-associated kinase activity was determined by densitometric scanning of the substrate band.

A minimum of 25 metaphases was scored blinded for each sample, and pairwise comparisons for statistical significance were made by Student's t test. Images were captured with Metamorph Premiere (Molecular Devices) and processed with Metamorph and Adobe Photoshop CS. Tissue Recombination (TR) Assays—Basic procedures (12Hayward S.W. Haughney P.C.

Briefly, the rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme (rUGM) was isolated from E17 or E18 rat embryos. NHP cells (200,000 cells) were then mixed with one rUGM in collagen and incubated overnight prior to transplantation. The following day, tissue recombinants were surgically transplanted under the renal capsule of male NOD/SCID mice supplemented with testosterone pellet. Grafts were collected and analyzed 3 or 6 months later. Paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm) or cryosections (8 μm) were used in immunostaining for various marker proteins. cDNA Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from NHP cells (see Fig. 12A) using an RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), including on-column DNase digestion to completely remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA concentrations were determined using NanoDrop, and the quality was assessed using a BioAnalyzer. Microarray experiments were carried out using the 44 K 60-mer “Human Whole Genome Oligo Microarray Kit” from Agilent (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with 500 ng of total RNA as starting material according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples 3, 4, 5, 7a, 9, 11, and 13 were all hybridized to sample 1 (see Fig. 12A) in triplicate; therefore, a total of 21 G4112F-014850 Agilent microarrays (each array containing 45,015 probe sets) were used. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 17 h, and hybridized arrays were scanned with Agilent's dual laser-based scanner. Feature Extraction software GE2-v5_91 was used to link a feature to a design file and determine the relative fluorescence intensity between the two samples.FIGURE 1Cultured NHP8 cells lose progenitor cell markers as they lose proliferative capacity. NHP8 cells at different passages were immunostained for the molecules indicated on top and counterstained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The passage number, cumulative PDs, and the percentages of proliferating (i.e. Ki-67+), hTERT+, CK5+/CK18+, p63+, CD44+, α2β1+, 15-LOX2+, and SA-β-galactosidase+ cells are indicated.

Using the annotation provided by Agilent (available on the company website). We focused on the 18,841 distinct gene symbols, with each symbol corresponding to one or more probe sets. In the case of multiple probe sets per gene, they were treated as additional replicates for the analysis. For each one of the 18,841 genes, we identified the corresponding probe sets (one or more) and applied a paired t test between the group of interest and the control (sample 1). The paired t test yields t-statistic values as well as p values to assess statistical significance of differential expression. For each comparison between the group of interest and control, a β-uniform analysis was performed on the correspondingp values (37Pounds S. Morris S.W.

In this case, we used a rather small value of the false discovery rate, equal to 0.0001. All comparisons yielded a varying and large number of significant genes. Table 2 shows the number of significant genes found by β-uniform analysis.TABLE 2ComparisonNumber of significant genes (false discovery rate = 0.0001)Type 3 versus control (type 1)5073 (p value cut-off = 0.0028)Type 4 versus control (type 1)4063 (p value cut-off = 0.0023)Type 5 versus control (type 1)3176 (p value cut-off = 0.0018)Type 7a versus control (type 1)4691 (p value cut-off = 0.0025)Type 9 versus control (type 1)3618 (p value cut-off = 0.0019)Type 11 versus control (type 1)3281 (p value cut-off = 0.0019)Type 13 versus control (type 1)3068 (p value cut-off = 0.0018) Open table in a new tab Primary NHP Epithelial Cells are CK5 and CK18 Double Positive Intermediate Basal Cells That Also Express Many Other Progenitor Cell Markers—We studied 12 primary NHP epithelial cell strains (Table 1), derived either from normal organ donors without prior history of prostatic diseases (including NHP1, -3, -4, and -6-10) or from uninvolved, benign prostate tissues distant from PCa foci (NHP2, -5, -11, and -12). We routinely cultured the purified prostate epithelial cells on collagen-coated dishes in epithelium-specific medium termed PrEBM(EGF + Ins) (9Bhatia B. Tang S. Yang P. Doll A. Aumueller G. Newman R.A. Tang D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3583-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). Under these culture conditions, we generally obtained enough pure NHP epithelial cells for experiments at passage 2 (P2), at which time the cells had undergone 16-19 cumulative population doublings (PDs). NHP2, NHP6, and NHP7 cells, at P2, were all CK5+/CK18+ (i.e. double positive) epithelial cells that also expressed the reported prostate stem/progenitor cell markers p63, hTERT, α2β1, and CD44, and none expressed luminal differentiation markers 15-LOX2, AR, PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase, and CD57 or NE cell markers neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A, or synaptophysin (1Tang D.G.

Immunophenotypic characterizations of all other NHP strains, including NHP1, NHP3 to -5, and NHP8 to -12 cells (Table 1), at P1 or P2, using antibodies for various markers (Table S1), similarly showed that essentially all of these NHP cells were CK5+/CK18+p63+hTERT+α2β1+CD44+ and negative for luminal and NE cell markers, as illustrated for NHP8 (Fig. 1, P2), NHP9 (Fig. S1), and NHP10 (Fig. S2) cells. For example, NHP8 cells at P2 were essentially all double positive for CK5 and CK18 and were also positive for CD44, α2β1, p63, and hTERT (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that in PrEBM(EGF + Ins) culture conditions, the primary NHP epithelial cells are CK5+/CK18+ intermediate basal-like cells (4Wang Y. Hayward S. Cao M. Thayer K. Cunha G. Differentiation. 2001; 68: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 20van Leenders G. Dijkman H. Hulsbergen-van de Kaa C. Ruiter D. Schalken J. Lab.

NHP Epithelial Cells Lose Proliferative Capacity in Culture and Undergo Senescence; Loss of Progenitor Markers Accompanies Senescence—We next assessed the proliferative capacity of serially passaged NHP cells and determined changes in various progenitor cell markers. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, NHP6 cells, derived from a 26-year-old normal organ donor (Table 1), underwent ∼17 cumulative PDs at P2 and, by P5, had undergone a total of ∼26 PDs, which did not further increase at P6-P7. NHP6 cells in culture showed a gradual decrease in cumulative BrdUrd labeling such that by P6, cells no longer incorporated BrdUrd and cell proliferation at the population level essentially stopped as a 5-day continuous BrdUrd pulse led to <10% labeling (Fig. 2, B and C). Starting from P5, many NHP6 cells displayed large and flat morphology and stained positive for SA-β-galactosidase (Fig. 2C), and at P6 and P7, senescent NHP6 cells increased to ∼50 and 90%, respectively. Similar passage-related senescence was observed in other NHP cells examined (Fig. 1) (9Bhatia B. Tang S. Yang P. Doll A. Aumueller G. Newman R.A. Tang D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3583-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (also see below). In general, NHP cells fully senesced at ∼20-26 PDs and, chronologically, within ∼2 months after initial plating. These observations indicate that 1) primary NHP cells in culture undergo senescence asynchronously, and the percentage of senescent cells correlates with cumulative PDs and 2) there is a noticeable gap between the cessation of PDs and the full manifestation of senescent phenotype, consistent with cell-cycle arrest preceding senescence. On these observations and considerations, we have used several terms in the forgoing discussions, which include young (P2-P3, low PDs), senescent or fully senescent (at the end of total PDs), near senescent (approaching the total PDs), and presenescent (intermediate between young and near senescent) (9Bhatia B.

https://openalex.org/W2018433678,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, catalysed by a family of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), plays an important role in a large variety of physiological processes, including cell proliferation, but its role in cell cycle progression is not yet completely defined. As reported here, the examination of early times following serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts suggests that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is necessary for the transition from the G0 phase to the G1 phase. We show that PARP activity is involved in this step through the regulation of immediate-early response genes, such as c-Fos and c-Myc. This is supported by the finding that exogenous Myc expression substantially restores cell cycle reactivation in the absence of polymer synthesis. Furthermore, using RNA interference, we show that PARP-1 is the PARP family member playing the most prominent role in the upregulation of c-Fos and c-Myc during G0–G1 transition. We report that even in lectin-stimulated peripheral blood mononucleated cells, the inhibition of PARP activity interferes with the upregulation of immediate-early genes and delays the induction of proliferation, suggesting a general role for PARP-1 in linking growth factor signaling with cell cycle entry."
https://openalex.org/W2038962261,"ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) plays a specific role in Golgi function controlling recruitment of GRIP domain proteins and ARL1 to the trans-Golgi. Deletion of the mouse Arfrp1 gene causes embryonic lethality during early gastrulation, because epiblast cells detach from the ectodermal cell layer and do not differentiate to mesodermal tissue. Here we show that in Arfrp1-/- embryos E-cadherin is mistargeted to intracellular compartments, whereas in control embryos it is present at the cell surface of trophectodermal and ectodermal cells. In enterocytes of intestine-specific Arfrp1 null mutants (Arfrp1vil-/-), E-cadherin is associated with intracellular membranes, partially colocalizing with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 or with punctae close to the cell surface. In contrast, in control enterocytes E-cadherin is exclusively located in the lateral membranes. In addition, ARL1 is dislocated from Golgi membranes to the cytosol of Arfrp1vil-/- enterocytes. Depletion of endogenous ARFRP1 by RNA interference leads to a dislocation of E-cadherin from the cell surface in HeLa cells and to a reduced cell aggregation in Ltk-Ecad cells. ARFRP1 was coimmunoprecipitated in a complex with E-cadherin, α-catenin, β-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120ctn from lysates of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing myc-ARFRP1. These data indicate that knock-out of Arfrp1 disrupts the trafficking of E-cadherin through the Golgi and suggest an essential role of the GTPase in trans-Golgi network function.

The ARF family includes three different groups of proteins, the ARFs, the ARLs (ARF-like proteins), and the secretion-associated Ras-related proteins. ARF-related protein 1 (ARFRP1) is a 25-kDa GTPase and member of the ARL family (2.Kahn R.A. Cherfils J. Elias M. Lovering R.C. Munro S. Schürmann A. J.

In contrast to other ARFs and ARLs, ARFRP1 can hydrolyze GTP in the absence of a GTPase-activating protein and lacks the N-myristoylation site (glycine 2), which is required for membrane association (3.Schürmann A. Massmann S. Joost H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30657-30663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the closest relative of ARFRP1, the yeast Arl3p protein, it was shown recently that membrane association is mediated via acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residue (4.Behnia R. Panic B.

ARFRP1 interacts with the Sec7 domain of the ARF-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor cytohesin 1 in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction resulted in the inhibition of the ARF/Sec7-dependent activation of phospholipase D in vitro and in vivo (6.Schürmann A. Schmidt M. Asmus M. Bayer S. Fliegert F. Koling S.

In contrast, the guanine nucleotide exchange defective ARFRP1 mutant (ARFRP1-T31N) clustered within the cytosol. Expression of ARFRP1-T31N or depletion of endogenous ARFRP1 by RNA interference disrupted the Golgi association of ARL1 and the GRIP domain protein Golgin-245 and altered the distribution of a trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker, syntaxin 6 indicating that ARFRP1 plays an important role for TGN structure and function (10.Zahn C.

Arfrp1-/- blastocysts implanted in vivo and formed egg cylinder-stage embryos that appeared normal until day 5. During early gastrulation (at day 6–6.5), Arfrp1-/- embryos exhibited profound alterations of the distal part of the egg cylinder. Rounded pyknotic cells within this area were only loosely attached to the ectodermal cell layer, and some apoptotic cells were found in the proamniotic cavity. This observation suggested that ARFRP1 plays a critical role in processes during early gastrulation such as adhesion-dependent morphogenesis, cytoskeletal reorganization, and/or development of cell polarity (11.Mueller A.G.

Cadherins represent a large family of cell-cell adhesion proteins that play crucial roles in tissue patterning, cellular growth control, and in the regulation of cell shape and migration (12.Vleminckx K. Kemler R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13.Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J.

Changes in cadherin expression are associated with numerous developmental events such as epithelial-mesenchymal transitions, e.g. during gastrulation each member of the family exhibits a specific spatial and temporal expression pattern (15.Hatta K. Takagi S. Fujisawa H. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). E-cadherin, the prototypical member of the classic cadherin family, is a major component of epithelial adherens junctions, where it mediates cell-cell adhesion through calcium-dependent, homophilic binding between molecules on adjacent cells (13.Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 625-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Leckband D.

Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). At the adherens junction, E-cadherin is bound to catenins with β-catenin attached to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and α-catenin associated with β-catenin. In contrast to previous models, α-catenin does not directly link the cadherin-catenin complex to the actin cytoskeleton (18.Drees F. Pokutta S. Yamada S. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I.

Recently, EPLIN/Lima-1 was identified as a missing link between the cadherin-catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton (20.Abe K. Takeichi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). p120ctn binds to a juxtamembrane site in the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin (21.Yap A.S. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. J.

We find ARFRP1 in a complex with E-cadherin, β-catenin, α-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120ctn. Additional data suggest that ARFRP1 is required for cell surface localization of E-cadherin because in the absence of ARFRP1, E-cadherin is dislocated from the plasma membrane, and cell adhesion is markedly reduced in vivo and in vitro.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntisera—The polyclonal antibody against recombinant GST-ARFRP1 was described before (3.Schürmann A.

The anti-GLUT2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used in a dilution of 1:20; anti-DDP4 (ab28341) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and used in a dilution of 1:50. Anti-gp84 antibody against E-cadherin (30.Kasper M. Huber O. Grossmann H. Rudolph B. Tränkner C. Müller M. Histochem.

Monoclonal antibody against E-cadherin (clone HECD-1) was used in a dilution of 1:400 for immunofluorescence analysis (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The antibody against α-catenin was purchased from NanoTools (Teningen, Germany). The anti-Na+/K+-ATPase antibody (1:200) and the 58K Golgi marker (1:200) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibodies against p120ctn (1 μg/ml for Western blotting), IQGAP1 (1 μg/ml for Western blotting), and β-catenin (1:2500 for Western blotting) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Alexa Fluor® 546 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) or Alexa Fluor® 488 F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used in a dilution of 1:800 as secondary antibodies.Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts plus 10% (v/v) FCS. For aggregation assays, Ltk-Ecad cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) high glucose in the presence of 10% (v/v) FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 5% CO2. Transient transfections of cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocols.MDCK T23 Cells and Stable Transfection of Myc-Arfrp1— The MDCK T23 cell line, which stably expresses the tetracycline-repressible transactivator, was described earlier (31.Barth A.I. Pollack A.L. Altschuler Y. Mostov K.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Prof. Keith E. Mostov (Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco). MDCK T23 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS supplemented with the necessary antibiotics and cultured under continuous presence of 40 ng/ml doxycycline. The medium was renewed every 48 h. N-terminal Myc tag was fused to the mouse Arfrp1 open reading frame by PCR and cloned into the pTRE2hyg vector (Clontech). Transfection of MDCK T23 cells was performed in 6-well plates with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were reseeded into 10-cm dishes, and selection of transfected cells was achieved with 40 ng/ml doxycycline and 300 μg/ml hygromycin in DMEM. After selection for 12 days, surviving colonies were isolated with the use of cloning rings and expanded in 48 wells. At confluency, cells from each of the surviving clones were split and maintained in the presence or absence of doxycycline. ARFRP1 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy 48 h after removal of doxycycline. Clones positive for ARFRP1 expression were expanded, and inducible expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis.Immunocytochemistry and Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—At the indicated time points, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with methanol (-20 °C for 10 min). Cells were washed with PBS, blocked with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20:5% (v/v) normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in antibody diluent (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor® 488- or Alexa Fluor® 546-conjugated secondary antibodies in antibody diluent at room temperature for 30 min. After washing with PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, cells were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako) and analyzed with a Leica TCS SP2 Laser Scan inverted microscope. We scanned the cells sequentially with an argon-krypton laser (488 nm) to excite the Alexa 488 dye, and with a helium-neon laser (543 nm) to excite the Alexa 546 dye. The spectral detector recorded light emission at 510–560 and 580–660 nm, respectively. We processed images of 1024 × 1024 pixels with Adobe Photoshop CS (version 8.0.1).Generation of Intestine-specific Arfrp1 Null Mutants (Arfrp1vil-/-Mice)—For tissue-specific disruption of Arfrp1, we used the Cre/loxP recombination system and generated Arfrp1flox/flox mice in which exons 2 and 4 of Arfrp1 were flanked with loxP sites. The targeting vector also contained pGKneo/HSVtk cassette (Neo/tk) with a third loxP site that was introduced between exon 4 and 5. It was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells that were screened for homologous recombination. A homologous recombined ES cell clone containing the targeted allele was retransfected with pIC-Cre to generate ES cell clones carrying the floxed Arfrp1 allele. One ES cell clone was injected into blastocysts, which were subsequently transferred into a day 2.5 pseudopregnant female C57BL/6 mouse. Male chimeric mice were mated with C57BL/6 females to generate Arfrp1flox/+ mice. Arfrp1flox/+ mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 three times. Intestine-specific Arfrp1 null mutants (Arfrp1vil-/-) were generated by intercrossing Arfrp1flox/flox with transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase under the control of the villin promotor/enhancer (villin-Cre) (32.Madison B.B.

The animals were housed in a controlled environment (20 ± 2 °C, 12:12-h light/dark cycle) and had free access to water and standard chow diet. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (State of Brandenburg, Germany).RNA Preparation and First Strand cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA from different tissues of the mice was extracted, and cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously (33.Buchmann J. Meyer C. Neschen S. Augustin R. Schmolz K. Kluge R. Al-Hasani H. Jurgens H. Eulenberg K. Wehr R. Dohrmann C. Joost H.G. Schürmann A. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1561-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Quality of cDNA was controlled by PCR with murine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (forward, 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA-3′).RT-PCR—For detection of deletion of exons 2–4 of Arfrp1 (Fig. 2B), reverse transcribed PCR was performed with the following primers: 5′-ATTCCGCCCGTGCTCCG-3′ and 5′-TTGATTCTGACAGCCTTTC-3′, which anneal to sequences corresponding to exon 1 and exon 5 of Arfrp1, respectively.Quantitative RT-PCR—Quantitative real time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Applied Biosystems 7300 real time pcr System as described previously (33.Buchmann J. Meyer C. Neschen S. Augustin R. Schmolz K. Kluge R. Al-Hasani H. Jurgens H. Eulenberg K. Wehr R. Dohrmann C. Joost H.G. Schürmann A. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1561-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the determination of Arfrp1 mRNA levels in ileum and colon, a TaqMan gene expression assay was used (Arfrp1 E6_E7, Mm00513004_m1). Data were normalized (34.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (119535) Google Scholar), and a β-actin expression assay (Mm00607939_s1) was used as endogenous control.Knockdown of Endogenous ARFRP1 by shRNA Interference—The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER.basic (OligoEngine), was used for expression of shRNA targeting human ARFRP1 in HeLa cells. A gene-specific insert defining a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 691–709 (GTGGATGGTGAAGTGTGTC, GenBank™ accession number NM_003224.2, ARFRP1-shRNA) was separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary loop sequence (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. Both sequences were subcloned into the BglII and HindIII sites of the pSUPER vector and referred to as pSUPER-ARFRP1. HeLa cells were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-ARFRP1 and processed for Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence after 4–8 days of incubation.Inhibition of ARFRP1 Expression by siRNA Oligonucleotides— Two small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting mouse ARFRP1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_029702) were used: si-a-ARFRP1 5′-GACUGUACCUGUAAGAUUGUU-3′ and si-b-RNA-ARFRP1 5′-GUAAUUGAUUCCACUGAUGUU-3′. Three control siRNAs were generated: scrambled-a 5′-GACUGUACGUGAUAGAUUGUU-3′, scrambled-b 5′-CUAAUCGAUUCCACUGAAGUU-3′, and siCONTROL™ nontargeting siRNA. The siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). Ltk-Ecad cells were transfected with siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocols.Immunoprecipitation—MDCK-T23 cells stably expressing myc-ARFRP1 in the absence of doxycyline were incubated with ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 6.8, 0.1 m KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 20 μm GTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm NaVO3, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and Complete™-EDTA protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation from precleared cell lysates (400 μg of total protein/assay) was performed with 4 μg of the anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody bound to protein-A beads as described previously (35.Weiske J. Schöneberg T. Schröder W. Hatzfeld M. Tauber R. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41175-41181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36.Weiske J. Huber O. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The figure depicts a representative experiment that was repeated at least three times.Adhesion Assay—For cell aggregation assays, 105 Ltk-Ecad cells were transfected with siCONTROL™ nontargeting siRNA, ARFRP1-specific siRNAs (si-a-ARFRP1 and si-b-ARFRP1), and mutated siRNAs (scrambled-a and scrambled-b) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. After 3 days, cell aggregation assays were performed as described previously (37.Huber O. Kermler R. Langosch D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4415-4423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the time points 0 and 45 min, two 10-μl aliquots were removed, and cells/cell aggregates were photographed using an Olympus BX-60 microscope with an Achrostigmat objective (10× magnification, 0.25 numerical aperture). JPEG images were generated with the Soft Imaging System Color View 12 and the analysis 3.0 software. After counting of particles (cells and cell aggregate), the aggregation index was calculated according to Nagafuchi and Takeichi (41.Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) as follows: Ai = (N0 - Nt)/N0, where N0 is the total particle number at t = 0 min, and Nt is the particle number after an incubation period of 45 min. Mean values ± S.D. of four independent aggregation assays are presented.RESULTSDistribution of E-cadherin Is Altered in Arfrp1-/-Embryos—We have previously shown that deletion of Arfrp1 in mice results in embryonic lethality because of the failure of differentiating epiblast cells to form the mesoderm. Epiblast cells of Arfrp1-/- embryos detached from the embryonic ectoderm, consistent with a defect in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion (22.Bryant D.M. Stow J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because changes in cadherin expression coincide with gastrulation (38.Klinowska T.C. Ireland G.W. Kimber S.J. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we analyzed the expression and distribution of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in control and Arfrp1-/- embryos between ED 5.0 and 6.5.In ED 5.0 control embryos (Fig. 1), a weak ARFRP1 expression is detected in ectodermal cells, and E-cadherin is located at the lateral membrane of trophectodermal epithelial cells (arrow in Fig. 1) and at the surface of ectodermal cells. In contrast, in ED 5.0 Arfrp1-/- embryos, no E-cadherin staining was visible in the trophoblast, and only a punctate pattern was detected in the embryonic ectoderm. The phenotype observed at ED 5.0 was even more pronounced at ED 6.0. At this stage, control embryos show a regular E-cadherin staining at the surface of each cell, although it is present predominantly in intracellular, aggregate-like structures in the Arfrp1-/- embryos. No N-cadherin staining was detectable in ED 5.0 and ED 6.0 embryos as described previously (data not shown, see Ref. 39.Radice G.L. Rayburn H. Matsunami H. Knudsen K.A. Takeichi M. Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 64-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). To test whether other plasma membrane proteins were affected in Arfrp1-/- embryos, we stained the glucose transporter GLUT1. GLUT1 was detected at the cell surface of both control and Arfrp1-/- embryos (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition, the plasma membrane marker Na+/K+-ATPase, an integral membrane protein complex, was detected at the cell surface of the Arfrp1-/- embryos (supplemental Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1Immunohistochemical analysis of ARFRP1 and E-cadherin in control and Arfrp1-/- embryos. Serial transversal (at ED 5.0) and sagittal (at ED6.0) sections were prepared and stained with antibodies against ARFRP1 and E-cadherin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Scale bars, 50 μm.

Simopoulos C. Karayiannakis A.J. J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 39: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, E-cadherin, together with integrins, plays an important role for the development and maintenance of normal intestinal epithelial architecture and is required for complex cell-cell interactions. To analyze the role of ARFRP1 for the distribution and expression of E-cadherin in epithelial cells, we used the Cre-loxP system to disrupt Arfrp1 specifically in the intestine (Fig. 2A). Arfrp1flox/flox mice were crossed with mice carrying villin-Cre (32.Madison B.B. Dunbar L. Qiao X.T. Braunstein K. Braunstein E. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33275-33283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) to finally generate Arfrp1flox/+/vilCre/+ and Arfrp1flox/+/+/+ mice, which were intercrossed to obtain Arfrp1flox/flox/vilcre/+ mice, in the following referred to as Arfrp1vil-/- mice. Arfrp1flox/flox/+/+ mice were used as controls and referred to as Arfrp1flox/flox mice. Intestinal epithelial specific recombination of the loxP sites was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2B). In Arfrp1vil-/- mice, Arfrp1 mRNA in ileum and colon as determined by quantitative RT-PCR was reduced by 70 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis confirmed a similar reduction of ARFRP1 protein levels (Fig. 2D).As shown in Fig. 3, E-cadherin was localized in the lateral membrane of the cell surface of crypts and villi in control Arfrp1flox/flox mice. In contrast, in Arfrp1vil-/- mice we detected E-cadherin also in intracellular compartments (arrows in Fig. 3A) and as punctae (arrowheads in Fig. 3A) close to the plasma membrane. The expression of E-cadherin as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3B) was not altered in ileum and colon of Arfrp1vil-/- mice.FIGURE 3Distribution and expression of E-cadherin in intestinal cells of Arfrp1flox/flox and Arfrp1vil-/- mice.A, sections of the intestine (ileum and colon) of 4-week-old Arfrp1flox/flox and Arfrp1vil-/- mice were stained with the anti-gp84 antibody against E-cadherin in combination with an Alexa488 secondary antibody, and E-cadherin distribution was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows depict an intracellular localization of E-cadherin, and arrowheads mark the accumulation of E-cadherin in punctae within Ar"
https://openalex.org/W2029772367,"Pituitary tumor transforming gene 1 (PTTG1), a transforming gene highly expressed in several cancers, is a mammalian securin protein regulating both G1/S and G2/M phases. Using protein array screening, we showed PTTG1 interacting with Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A), and confirmed the interaction using co-immunoprecipitation, His-tagged pull-down assays and intracellular immunofluorescence colocalization. PTTG1 transfection into HCT116 cells prevented Aurora-A T288 autophosphorylation, inhibited phosphorylation of the histone H3 Aurora-A substrate and resulted in abnormally condensed chromatin. PTTG1-null cell proliferation was more sensitive to Aurora-A knock down and to Aurora kinase Inhibitor III treatment. The results indicate that PTTG1 and Aurora-A interact to regulate cellular responses to anti-neoplastic drugs. PTTG1 knockdown is therefore a potential approach to improve the efficacy of tumor Aurora kinase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2090529223,"Viruses of the DNA tumor virus family share the ability to transform vertebrate cells through the action of virus-encoded tumor antigens that interfere with normal cell physiology. They accomplish this very efficiently by inhibiting endogenous tumor suppressor proteins that control cell proliferation and apoptosis. Simian virus 40 (SV40) encodes two oncoproteins, large tumor antigen, which directly inhibits the tumor suppressors p53 and Rb, and small tumor antigen (ST), which interferes with serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). We have constructed a Drosophila model for SV40 ST expression and show that ST induces supernumerary centrosomes, an activity we also demonstrate in human cells. In early Drosophila embryos, ST also caused increased microtubule stability, chromosome segregation errors, defective assembly of actin into cleavage furrows, cleavage failure, a rise in cyclin E levels and embryonic lethality. Using ST mutants and genetic interaction experiments between ST and PP2A subunit mutations, we show that all of these phenotypes are dependent on ST's interaction with PP2A. These analyses demonstrate the validity and utility of Drosophila as a model for viral oncoprotein function in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1963513860,"Increasing evidence indicates that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are crucial for cardiac induction, specification, and development. Although signaling of BMPs is tightly regulated through soluble BMP-binding proteins, how they regulate BMP signaling during cardiac differentiation remains unknown. To identify molecules responsible for BMP signaling during early cardiomyocyte differentiation of P19 cells, cDNA subtraction was performed. We found a bimodal expression of the BMP-binding protein Crossveinless-2 (Cv2) during cardiomyocyte differentiation; Cv2 is temporally expressed earlier than cardiac transcription factors such as Nkx2.5 and Tbx5 and acts as a suppressor for BMP signaling in P19 cells. We established a P19 clonal cell line harboring a cardiac alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein gene to monitor cardiac differentiation by flow cytometry. Treatment with BMP2 during the first 2 days of differentiation suppressed cardiomyocyte differentiation through activation of down-stream targets Smad1/5/8 protein and Id1 gene, whereas treatment with Cv2 conversely inhibited Smad1/5/8 activation and Id1 expression, leading to increased generation of cardiac cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown (KD) of endogenous Cv2 showed increased Smad1/5/8 activation and impaired cardiomyocyte differentiation. Expression of cardiac mesoderm markers was reduced, whereas expression of Id1 and endoderm markers such as Sox7, Hnf4, and E-cadherin was induced in Cv2-kinase dead cells. These phenotypes were rescued by the addition of Cv2 protein to the culture media during the first 2 days of differentiation or co-culture with parental cells. These data suggest that Cv2 may specify cardiac mesodermal lineage through inhibition of BMP signaling at early stage of cardiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2087432120,"In the presence of ERβ, trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) protects cells against 17β-estradiol (E2)-induced oxidative DNA damage (ODD) and this correlates with increased expression of the antioxidative enzyme quinone reductase (QR). Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for ERβ-mediated protection against ODD. We observe constitutive interaction between ERβ and the novel protein hPMC2. Using a combination of breast epithelial cell lines that are either positive or negative for ERα, we demonstrate TOT-dependent recruitment of both ERβ and hPMC2 to the EpRE (electrophile response element)-regulated antioxidative enzyme QR. We further demonstrate TOT-dependent corecruitment of the coactivators Nrf2, PARP-1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) and topoisomerase IIβ, both in the presence and absence of ERα. However, absence of either ERβ or hPMC2 results in nonrecruitment of PARP-1 and topoisomerase IIβ, loss of antioxidative enzyme induction and attenuated protection against ODD by TOT even in the presence of Nrf2 and ERα. These findings indicate minor role for Nrf2 and ERα in TOT-dependent antioxidative gene regulation. However, downregulation of PARP-1 attenuates TOT-dependent antioxidative gene induction. We conclude that ERβ and hPMC2 are required for TOT-dependent recruitment of coactivators such as PARP-1 to the EpRE resulting in the induction of antioxidative enzymes and subsequent protection against ODD."
