https://openalex.org/W2147570569,"More than a century after the introduction of incandescent lighting and half a century after the introduction of fluorescent lighting, solid-state light sources are revolutionizing an increasing number of applications. Whereas the efficiency of conventional incandescent and fluorescent lights is limited by fundamental factors that cannot be overcome, the efficiency of solid-state sources is limited only by human creativity and imagination. The high efficiency of solid-state sources already provides energy savings and environmental benefits in a number of applications. However, solid-state sources also offer controllability of their spectral power distribution, spatial distribution, color temperature, temporal modulation, and polarization properties. Such ""smart"" light sources can adjust to specific environments and requirements, a property that could result in tremendous benefits in lighting, automobiles, transportation, communication, imaging, agriculture, and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W1981186391,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs, about 21 nucleotides in length, that can regulate gene expression by base-pairing to partially complementary mRNAs. Regulation by miRNAs can play essential roles in embryonic development. We determined the temporal and spatial expression patterns of 115 conserved vertebrate miRNAs in zebrafish embryos by microarrays and by in situ hybridizations, using locked-nucleic acid–modified oligonucleotide probes. Most miRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner during segmentation and later stages, but not early in development, which suggests that their role is not in tissue fate establishment but in differentiation or maintenance of tissue identity."
https://openalex.org/W2111374582,"Domestication promotes rapid phenotypic evolution through artificial selection. We investigated the genetic history by which the wild grass teosinte ( Zea mays ssp. parviglumis ) was domesticated into modern maize ( Z. mays ssp. mays ). Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 774 genes indicates that 2 to 4% of these genes experienced artificial selection. The remaining genes retain evidence of a population bottleneck associated with domestication. Candidate selected genes with putative function in plant growth are clustered near quantitative trait loci that contribute to phenotypic differences between maize and teosinte. If we assume that our sample of genes is representative, ∼1200 genes throughout the maize genome have been affected by artificial selection."
https://openalex.org/W2154653323,"Acute cognitive impairment (i.e., delirium) is common in elderly emergency department patients and frequently results from infections that are unrelated to the central nervous system. Since activation of the peripheral innate immune system induces brain microglia to produce inflammatory cytokines that are responsible for behavioral deficits, we investigated if aging exacerbated neuroinflammation and sickness behavior after peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microarray analysis revealed a transcriptional profile indicating the presence of primed or activated microglia and increased inflammation in the aged brain. Furthermore, aged mice had a unique gene expression profile in the brain after an intraperitoneal injection of LPS, and the LPS-induced elevation in the brain inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress was both exaggerated and prolonged compared with adults. Aged mice were anorectic longer and lost more weight than adults after peripheral LPS administration. Moreover, reductions in both locomotor and social behavior remained 24 h later in aged mice, when adults had fully recovered, and the exaggerated neuroinflammatory response in aged mice was not reliably paralleled by increased circulating cytokines in the periphery. Taken together, these data establish that activation of the peripheral innate immune system leads to exacerbated neuroinflammation in the aged as compared with adult mice. This dysregulated link between the peripheral and central innate immune system is likely to be involved in the severe behavioral deficits that frequently occur in older adults with systemic infections."

Such a material must contain highly directional, short, and strong bonds. Hardness may also be increased by introducing a nanometer-scale structure that hinders the migration of dislocations. Despite all the scientific efforts to find a material that surpasses it, diamond remains the hardest known material. And hardness is not enough: To replace diamond in practical applications, a new superhard material must also match its other properties, such as chemical inertness.

https://openalex.org/W2058658881,"The protein complement of cellular membranes is notoriously resistant to standard proteomic analysis and structural studies. As a result, membrane proteomes remain ill-defined. Here, we report a global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane proteome. Using C-terminal tagging with the alkaline phosphatase and green fluorescent protein, we established the periplasmic or cytoplasmic locations of the C termini for 601 inner membrane proteins. By constraining a topology prediction algorithm with this data, we derived high-quality topology models for the 601 proteins, providing a firm foundation for future functional studies of this and other membrane proteomes. We also estimated the overexpression potential for 397 green fluorescent protein fusions; the results suggest that a large fraction of all inner membrane proteins can be produced in sufficient quantities for biochemical and structural work."
https://openalex.org/W2114869204,"The active sites of 491 human protein kinase domains are highly conserved, which makes the design of selective inhibitors a formidable challenge. We used a structural bioinformatics approach to identify two selectivity filters, a threonine and a cysteine, at defined positions in the active site of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSK). A fluoromethylketone inhibitor, designed to exploit both selectivity filters, potently and selectively inactivated RSK1 and RSK2 in mammalian cells. Kinases with only one selectivity filter were resistant to the inhibitor, yet they became sensitized after genetic introduction of the second selectivity filter. Thus, two amino acids that distinguish RSK from other protein kinases are sufficient to confer inhibitor sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2084559306,"Inhibiting spontaneous light emission and redistributing the energy into useful forms are desirable objectives for advances in various fields, including photonics, illuminations, displays, solar cells, and even quantum-information systems. We demonstrate both the “inhibition” and “redistribution” of spontaneous light emission by using two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals, in which the refractive index is changed two-dimensionally. The overall spontaneous emission rate is found to be reduced by a factor of 5 as a result of the 2D photonic bandgap effect. Simultaneously, the light energy is redistributed from the 2D plane to the direction normal to the photonic crystal."
https://openalex.org/W2123373938,"Aberrantly enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression is associated with increased tumor growth and metastatic spread of solid malignancies, including human renal carcinomas. Persistent activation of STAT3 is linked to tumor-associated angiogenesis, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, we examined whether STAT3 modulates the stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), and in turn enhances VEGF expression. We found that STAT3 was activated in ischemic rat kidneys and hypoxic human renal carcinoma cells. We also found that hypoxia-induced activation of STAT3 transactivated the VEGF promoter and increased the expression of VEGF transcripts. Consistent with these findings, STAT3 inhibition attenuated the hypoxic induction of VEGF. Interestingly, activated STAT3 increased HIF-1alpha protein levels due to the HIF-1alpha stability by blocking HIF-1alpha degradation and accelerated its de novo synthesis. The novel interaction of STAT3 with HIF-1alpha was identified in hypoxic renal carcinoma cells. Furthermore, hypoxia recruited STAT3, HIF-1alpha, and p300 to the VEGF promoter and induced histone H3 acetylation. Therefore, these findings provide compelling evidence that a causal relationship exists between STAT3 activation and HIF-1-dependent angiogenesis and suggest that therapeutic modalities designed to disrupt STAT3 signaling hold considerable promise for the blocking tumor growth and enhancing apoptosis of cancer cells and tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1979611175,"Mechanisms that protect against asthma remain poorly understood. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous bronchodilator, is depleted from asthmatic airways, suggesting a protective role. We report that, following allergen challenge, wild-type mice exhibiting airway hyperresponsivity have increased airway levels of the enzyme GSNO reductase (GSNOR) and are depleted of lung S-nitrosothiols (SNOs). In contrast, mice with genetic deletion of GSNOR exhibit increases in lung SNOs and are protected from airway hyperresponsivity. Our results indicate that endogenous SNOs, governed by GSNOR, are critical regulators of airway responsivity and may provide new therapeutic approaches to asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2160812815,"The typical scales for plant and fungal movements vary over many orders of magnitude in time and length, but they are ultimately based on hydraulics and mechanics. We show that quantification of the length and time scales involved in plant and fungal motions leads to a natural classification, whose physical basis can be understood through an analysis of the mechanics of water transport through an elastic tissue. Our study also suggests a design principle for nonmuscular hydraulically actuated structures: Rapid actuation requires either small size or the enhancement of motion on large scales via elastic instabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2007585974,"To estimate the cause-effect relationship between exposure to firearm violence and subsequent perpetration of serious violence, we applied the analytic method of propensity stratification to longitudinal data on adolescents residing in Chicago, Illinois. Results indicate that exposure to firearm violence approximately doubles the probability that an adolescent will perpetrate serious violence over the subsequent 2 years."
https://openalex.org/W1966472669,"Searles Lake is a salt-saturated, alkaline brine unusually rich in the toxic element arsenic. Arsenic speciation changed from arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)] with sediment depth. Incubated anoxic sediment slurries displayed dissimilatory As(V)-reductase activity that was markedly stimulated by H 2 or sulfide, whereas aerobic slurries had rapid As(III)-oxidase activity. An anaerobic, extremely haloalkaliphilic bacterium was isolated from the sediment that grew via As(V) respiration, using either lactate or sulfide as its electron donor. Hence, a full biogeochemical cycle of arsenic occurs in Searles Lake, driven in part by inorganic electron donors."
https://openalex.org/W2105797458,"Type Ic supernovae, the explosions after the core collapse of massive stars that have previously lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes, are particularly interesting because of their link with long-duration gamma ray bursts. Although indications exist that these explosions are aspherical, direct evidence has been missing. Late-time observations of supernova SN 2003jd, a luminous type Ic supernova, provide such evidence. Recent Subaru and Keck spectra reveal double-peaked profiles in the nebular lines of neutral oxygen and magnesium. These profiles are different from those of known type Ic supernovae, with or without a gamma ray burst, and they can be understood if SN 2003jd was an aspherical axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the equatorial plane. If SN 2003jd was associated with a gamma ray burst, we missed the burst because it was pointing away from us."
https://openalex.org/W2136348758,"Rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) data from migrated hydrocarbons establish the timing of petroleum emplacement for the giant oil sand deposits of Alberta, Canada, at 112 ± 5.3 million years ago. This date does not support models that invoke oil generation and migration for these deposits in the Late Cretaceous. Most Re-Os data from a variety of deposits within the giant hydrocarbon system show similar characteristics, supporting the notion of a single source for these hydrocarbons. The Re-Os data disqualify Cretaceous rocks as the primary hydrocarbon source but suggest an origin from older source rocks. This approach should be applicable to dating oil deposits worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W2142264428,"Current models for the evolution of new gene functions after gene duplication presume that the duplication events themselves have no effect on fitness. But those duplications that result in new gene functions are likely to be positively selected from their inception. The evolution of new function may start with the amplification of an existing gene with some level of preadaptation for that function, followed by a period of competitive evolution among the gene copies, resulting in the preservation of the most effective variant and the 'pseudogenization' and eventual loss of the rest."
https://openalex.org/W2122816122,"Plant pathogens, like animal ones, use protein-carbohydrate interactions in their strategy for host recognition, attachment, and invasion. The bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum, which is distributed worldwide and causes lethal wilt in many agricultural crops, was shown to produce a potent l-fucose-binding lectin, R. solanacearum lectin, a small protein of 90 amino acids with a tandem repeat in its amino acid sequence. In the present study, surface plasmon resonance experiments conducted on a series of oligosaccharides show a preference for binding to αFuc1-2Gal and αFuc1-6Gal epitopes. Titration microcalorimetry demonstrates the presence of two binding sites per monomer and an unusually high affinity of the lectin for αFuc1-2Gal-containing oligosaccharides (KD = 2.5 × 10-7 m for 2-fucosyllactose). R. solanacearum lectin has been crystallized with a methyl derivative of fucose and with the highest affinity ligand, 2-fucosyllactose. X-ray crystal structures, the one with α-methyl-fucoside being at ultrahigh resolution, reveal that each monomer consists of two small four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets. Trimerization through a 3-fold or pseudo-3-fold axis generates a six-bladed β-propeller architecture, very similar to that previously described for the fungal lectin of Aleuria aurantia. This is the first report of a β-propeller formed by oligomerization and not by sequential domains. Each monomer presents two fucose binding sites, resulting in six symmetrically arranged sugar binding sites for the β-propeller. Crystals were also obtained for a mutated lectin complexed with a fragment of xyloglucan, a fucosylated polysaccharide from the primary cell wall of plants, which may be the biological target of the lectin.

Ralstonia solanacearum is a Gram-negative β-protobacterium, inhabiting water and soil and causing lethal wilt in more than 200 plants worldwide (1Hayward A.C. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1991; 29: 65-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). From the soil, it can enter plant roots via wounds or secondary roots, invade the xylem vessels, and spread in the plant (2Schell M.A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2000; 38: 263-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This bacterium causes major agronomic and economic losses in tropical climates and threatens potatoes in temperate climates, especially with the recent extension of strains adapted to cooler environmental conditions in Europe and North America. The expression of genes encoding the machinery for adhesion to plant cells (hrp) is enhanced by plant cell wall fragments (3Aldon D. Brito B. Boucher C. Genin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the specific signal molecule has not yet been identified, it appears to be a component of the cell wall polysaccharide matrix, since removal of lipids and proteins does not affect the activity of cell wall fragments. In addition to linear insoluble cellulose, complex branched polysaccharides such as pectins and xyloglucans, also called hemicelluloses, are found in the primary cell walls of higher plants (4Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Fucose-containing xyloglucan oligomers have been shown to exert signaling effects on plant tissues (5Darvill A. Augur C. Bergmann C. Carlson R.W. Cheong J.J. Eberhard S. Hahn M.G. Lo V.M. Marfa V. Meyer B. Mohnen D. O'Neill M.A. Spiro M.D. van Halbeek H. York W.S. Albershein P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Since host carbohydrates have been known for many years to constitute specific attachment sites for pathogen protein receptors (6Bock K. Karlsson K.A. Stromberg N. Teneberg S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 228: 153-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1R-10RCrossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), there is great interest in structure-function studies of bacterial proteins enabling the pathogen attachment to host glycans. However, only a limited number of their complexes with receptors have been characterized by crystallography. Most of the structural studies dealt with toxins that bind specifically to intestine (8Fan E. O'Neal C.J. Mitchell D.D. Robien M.A. Zhang Z. Pickens J.C. Tan X.J. Korotkov K. Roach C. Krumm B. Verlinde C.L. Merritt E.A. Hol W.G. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 294: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or to neural glycans (9Turton K. Chaddock J.A. Acharya K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 552-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Recently, adhesins located on the tip of pili from uropathogenic or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains were structurally characterized (10Sauer F.G. Barnhart M. Choudhury D. Knight S.D. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa soluble lectins, PA-IL and PA-IIL, that are specific for galactose and fucose, respectively (11Gilboa-Garber N. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These latter structures provide clues for the binding of the bacteria to the overfucosylated mucins present in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (12Imberty A. Wimmerova M. Mitchell E.P. Gilboa-Garber N. Microb. Infect. 2004; 6: 222-229Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar).Studies of lectins involved in interactions of phytopathogens with plant glycans are in their very early stage. The search for a fucose-binding lectin in R. solanacearum led to the characterization of two soluble lectins. The first, RS-IIL, binds to fucose but has a strong preference for mannose despite its strong sequence and structural similarity to PA-IIL (13Sudakevitz D. Kostlanova N. Blatman-Jan G. Mitchell E.P. Lerrer B. Wimmerova M. Katcof F. D.J. Imberty A. Gilboa-Garber N. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second lectin, RSL, 1The abbreviations used are: RSL, R. solanacearum lectin; AAL, A. aurantia lectin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Fuc, l-fucoside; r.m.s., root mean square; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry. 1The abbreviations used are: RSL, R. solanacearum lectin; AAL, A. aurantia lectin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; Fuc, l-fucoside; r.m.s., root mean square; ITC, isothermal titration microcalorimetry. is slightly smaller than PA-IIL (90 amino acids) and has strong affinity for fucose and fucose-containing oligosaccharides such as human ABO blood group determinants (14Sudakevitz D. Imberty A. Gilboa-Garber N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This lectin displays sequence similarity to the fucose-binding lectin of another soil inhabitant, the orange peel mushroom Aleuria aurantia. Structural determination of A. aurantia lectin (AAL) showed a six-bladed β-propeller with five fucose binding sites (15Wimmerova M. Mitchell E. Sanchez J.F. Gautier C. Imberty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27059-27067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the RSL monomer sequence is three times shorter than that of AAL, corresponding to only two repeats, and therefore cannot adopt the same fold.The present paper describes the production, binding properties, and structure of RSL. The specificity of recombinant RSL toward a large number of human and plant oligosaccharides was screened by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The affinity toward the best ligands was further characterized by titration microcalorimetry, confirming a very high affinity toward the αFuc1-2Gal disaccharide. Crystal structures of three different RSL-sugar complexes revealed the molecular basis of both the affinity and specificity of this lectin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Lewis a (α-l-Fuc-(1→4)[β-d-Gal-(1→3)]-d-GlcNAc), Lewis X (α-l-Fuc-(1→3)[β-d-Gal-(1→4)]-d-GlcNAc), blood group A (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-[β-d-GalNac-(1→3)]-d-Gal), blood group B (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-[β-d-Gal-(1→3)]-d-Gal), and blood group H type II (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→4)-d-GlcNAc) trisaccharides were purchased from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). l-fucose, p-nitrophenyl-α-l-fucoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-l-fucoside, α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-d-Gal (FucGal), α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→4)-d-Glc (FucLac) and other monosaccharides were purchased from Sigma. α-Methyl-l-fucoside (MeFuc) was purchased from Interchim.Synthesis of Methyl 1-Seleno-α-l-fucopyranoside—Organic reagents were used as purchased except CH2Cl2, which was distilled from CaH2 and stored over molecular sieves (4 Å), and MeCN, which was dried and stored over molecular sieves (3 Å). Organic solutions were concentrated under reduced pressure at <40 °C (bath temperature). NMR spectra were recorded on a 300-MHz (Varian) and a 400-MHz (Jeol) spectrometer in CDCl3 or D2O. TMS was used as the internal standard (δ = 0) for 1H spectra in chloroform, and 13C spectra were referred to the chloroform signal (δ = 77.17). Silica gel Normasil (40-63 μm, Prolabo; VWR International) was used for flash chromatography. TLC was performed on silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) glass plates with detection by charring with 8% sulfuric acid.Methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-seleno-α-l-fucopyranoside (2) was prepared as follows. Me2Se2 (200 μl, ∼8 mmol) was added to a slurry of NaBH4 (1.0 g, 26 mmol) in MeCN. The mixture was refluxed for 1 h under a nitrogen atmosphere before 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-β-l-fucopyranosyl bromide, freshly prepared from ethyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-thio-β-l-fucopyranoside (1, 1.0 g, 3 mmol) and bromine (180 μl, 3.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2, was added together with an additional amount of Me2Se2 (200 μl, ∼8 mmol). Heating was continued for 15 min, after which the mixture was cooled and then poured into aqueous HCl (20 ml, 1 m). The crude product was extracted with Et2O (3 × 20 ml), dried over Na2SO4, concentrated, and purified by flash chromatography (toluene → toluene/EtOAc 10:1) to give methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-seleno-β-l-fucopyranoside (800 mg, 2.2 mmol, 70%) as a crystalline material; [α]D + 7.6° (c 1.77, CHCl3); NMR (CHCl3): 1H, δ 1.20 (d, 3H, JH-5,H-6 = 7 Hz, Me), 1.97, 2.05, 2.10, 2.16 (s, 4 × 3H, COMe, SeMe), 3.82 (m, 1H, H-5), 4.60 (d, 1H, JH-1,H-2 = 10 Hz, H-1), 5.02 (dd, 1H, JH-3,H-4 = 3 Hz, H-3), 5.26 (t, 1H, JH-2,H-3 = 10 Hz, H-2), 5.28 (dd, 1H, JH-4,H-5 = 1 Hz, H-4); 13C, δ 2.4 (SeMe), 16.5 (Me), 20.7, 20.8, 21.0 (COMe), 67.6, 70.6, 72.1, 74.3 (C-2-5), 77.2 (C-1), 169.8, 170.2, 170.7 (COMe) ppm; mp 72-73 °C. A solution of methyl 2,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-1-seleno-β-l-fucopyranoside (450 mg, 1.22 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (12 ml) containing BF3·Et2O (2.5 vol %) was stirred at ambient temperature until formation of the hydrolysis product started to increase significantly (∼3 h, monitored by TLC). The reaction was then quenched by the addition of Et3N, the mixture was concentrated, and the residue was applied onto a silica gel column and eluted (toluene → toluene/EtOAc 10:1) to give 2 (195 mg, 0.53 mmol, 43%) and recovered starting material (88 mg, 0.25 mmol, 20%); [α]D - 235° (c 0.71, CHCl3); NMR (CDCl3): 1H, δ 1.16 (d, 3H, JH-5,H-6 = 7 Hz, Me), 1.91, 1.97, 2.04, 2.15 (s, 4 × 3H, COMe, SeMe), 4.38 (m, 1H, H-5), 5.19 (m, 2H) and 5.28 (sb, 1H) (H-2-4), 5.92 (d, 1H, JH-1,H-2 = 4 Hz, H-1); 13C, δ 2.5 (SeMe), 16.0 (Me), 20.7, 20.8, 20.9 (COMe), 66.3, 68.6, 69.4, 70.7 (C-2-5), 79.4 (C-1), 170.0, 170.2, 170.6 (COMe) ppm; mp 128 °C.Methyl 1-seleno-α-l-fucopyranoside (3) was prepared as follows. Sodium methoxide (1 m, 250 μl) was added to a solution of compound 2 (180 mg, 0.49 mmol) in methanol (10 ml). The mixture was left stirring overnight and then neutralized with H+ ion exchange resin. The resin was removed by filtration (washed with methanol and water), and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was dissolved in water (10 ml) and washed with Et2O (2 × 5 ml). Freeze-drying gave 3 (115 mg, 0.48 mmol, 98%).

Pectic polysaccharides were solubilized by sequential extraction (16Chambat G. Cartier N. Lefebvre A. Marais M.F. Joseleau J.P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 35: 655-664Google Scholar), the main hemicellulose fraction was obtained with 2.5 n NaOH solution and xyloglycan was purified as previously described (17Joseleau J.P. Cartier N. Chambat G. Faik A. Ruel K. Biochimie (Paris). 1992; 74: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Xyloglucan from a 20-day-old cell suspension was used to prepare a fraction of high degree of polymerization (>10 kDa) by ultrafiltration using an Amicon cell fitted with Mr 104 cut-off membranes (Amicon, Beverly, MA) (18Chambat G. Karmous M. Costes M. Picard M. Joseleau J.P. Cellulose. 2005; 12: 117-125Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fucosylated nonasaccharide (XXFG) was prepared from xyloglucan from 24-day-old cell suspension by enzymatic digestion using xyloglucanase Cel12B produced by Aspergillus aculeatus and kindly supplied by Novozymes. The resulting oligomers were separated and characterized as described previously (17Joseleau J.P. Cartier N. Chambat G. Faik A. Ruel K.

The nonfucosylated oligosaccharide (XXLG) was prepared by the enzymatic digestion of xyloglucan from Tamarindus seeds using the same conditions as above. The structures of the two oligomers were assigned by FAB-ms analysis (XXLG m/z = 1225 [M + H]+ and m/z = 1247 [M + Na]+; XXFG m/z = 1393 [M + Na]+).Production of Recombinant RSL and Mutagenesis—Native RSL has been purified from R. solanacearum ATCC 11696 purchased from the American Type Culture Collection as previously described (14Sudakevitz D. Imberty A. Gilboa-Garber N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified genomic DNA from the same bacterial strain has been used for the construction of recombinant RSL. The initial primers to amplify the genomic fragment around the gene of hypothetical protein RSc2107 (TrEMBL access code Q8XXK6), which was previously assigned to be RSL, were designed based on the sequenced genome of R. solanacearum GMI1000 (19Salanoubat M. Genin S. Artiguenave F. Gouzy J. Mangenot S. Arlat M. Billault A. Brottier P. Camus J.C. Cattolico L. Chandler M. Choisne N. Claudel-Renard C. Cunnac S. Demange N. Gaspin C. Lavie M. Moisan A.

To solve strain-dependent sequence variations, initial primers complementary to about 10-20 bp upstream (5′-GTGATCCAACTCGTTCACTTTTTC-3′) and downstream (5′-GATTCCACATTGCCCAGCAGA-3′) of the rsc2107 gene were prepared, and the amplified PCR product from the ATCC 11696 strain was sequenced. New gene-specific primers (5′-GAG ACG ACA TAT GTC GAG CGT TCA GAC CG-3′ and 5′-CAA AGC TTC AGT TCG TGG CGG TGT AGG CGC-3′) introducing NdeI and HindIII restriction sites to edge the rsl gene were used for preparation of the recombinant protein. After digestion with NdeI and HindIII, the amplified fragment was introduced into the cloning site of pET-25(b+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), resulting in plasmid pET25rsl.The expression vector pET25rsl was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Cells harboring pET25rsl plasmid were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The cells were then cultured for an additional 3 h with the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min and washed with an equal volume of buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, (pH 7.4). The cell suspension was disintegrated by ultrasonic vibration, and cell-free extract was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 50 min.Recombinant RSL was purified by affinity chromatography on a mannose-agarose column. Protein extract was loaded on a column pre-equilibrated by 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.4, and unbound proteins were washed out with the same buffer. RSL was eluted with 0.1 m d-mannose in the same buffer, dialyzed against deionized water at 4 °C for 5 days, and then concentrated by lyophilization. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectroscopy.Random RSL mutants were generated by amplification of the rsl gene by DyNAzyme™ II recombinant DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland). A selected double mutant (D77G/G84S) was cloned, expressed, and purified as described for the wild-type recombinant RSL.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials were performed with Hampton crystallization screens I and II (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Crystals of the RSL-fucose complex were obtained using the following conditions: 2 μl of precipitant (0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 0.2 m magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000) mixed with 2 μl of RSL solution at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and l-fucose at a concentration of 137 μg/ml. The drops were allowed to equilibrate over a reservoir of 1 ml of the precipitating solution at 20 °C. Crystals were then soaked for 5 h in a solution of 50 mm α-Me-l-fucoside. They belong to space group P31 with unit cell dimensions of a = 44.13 Å and c = 103.66 Å at 100 K. The asymmetric unit accommodates three monomers, corresponding to a Vm of 2.0 Å3 Da-1 and 38% solvent content.Crystals of the RSL-Me-selenofucoside and RSL-FucLac complexes were obtained by co-crystallization of RSL with sugars in the presence of glycine as an additive. Solutions of 2.5 μl of RSL at a concentration of 15 mg/ml containing Me-selenofucoside and FucLac at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and 1.95 mg/ml, respectively, were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution (30% polyethylene glycol 6000 in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.2) and with 1 μl of 0.5 m glycine as additive. The RSL-SeMeFuc complex was isomorphous to the RSL-MeFuc one, whereas the RSL-FucLac complex crystallized in space group H32 with cell dimensions of a = 76.8 Å and c = 101.5 Å at 100 K with one monomer per asymmetric unit corresponding to a Vm of 3.0 Å3 Da-1 and 58% solvent content. Since trials of RSL crystallization in the presence of xyloglucan were not successful, a mutant (RSLm) in which half of the binding sites are altered (D77G/G84S) was also screened. Co-crystals of RSLm and the nonasaccharide fragment XXFG were obtained by soaking protein/fucose crystals prepared in 1.5 m (NH4)2SO4 in 2.7 mg/ml XXFG solution. Crystals were obtained in space group P4122 with unit cell dimensions of a = 64.1 Å, c = 128.1 Å at 100 K with three monomers in the asymmetric unit corresponding to a Vm of 2.3 Å3 Da-1 and 45% solvent content.Crystals were cryo-cooled at 100 K, after soaking them for as the shortest possible time in 30% (v/v) glycerol in precipitant solution. Data images were recorded on an ADSC Q4R CCD detector (Quantum Corp.) or a MAR 225 detector (MAR USA Inc.) at beamlines ID14-2 and ID23-1, respectively, at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Highly redundant single wavelength (0.9793 Å) anomalous diffraction data to 1.7 Å resolution were collected using ID23-1 from a single crystal containing the seleno-ligand. The three native forms were measured at a 0.933 Å wavelength using ID14-2. Diffraction images were processed using MOSFLM (20Leslie A.G.W.

Harker sections of the anomalous difference Patterson map showed peaks corresponding to one selenium per monomer in the asymmetric unit. Selenium site coordinates, phasing, and solvent flattening were carried out with autoSHARP (22de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G.

This was followed by a complete automatic construction, side chain docking, and an initial water molecule construction with ARP/wARP. In each complex, the few missing amino acids and all sugar residues clearly defined in density were positioned manually using O. Refinement cycles with Refmac, including further automatic water molecule placement using ARP/wARP, manual rebuilding with O, and construction of alternative conformations where necessary (with occupancies estimated from the refined relative B-factors of the conformations), resulted in final models with refinement statistics listed in Table II.Table IIRefinement statisticsRSL/MeFucRSL/2FucLacRSL/XXFGResolution limits (Å)30.67 to 0.9455.6 to 2.164.15 to 1.80Working set R (observation)0.098 (135,348)0.183 (6,435)0.146 (24,221)Test set R (observation)0.120 (7,126)0.253 (317)0.188 (1,299)Highest resolution shellWorking set R0.260 (467)0.185 (1,708)Test set R0.297 (25)0.257 (96)Cruickshank's DPIaFor RSL/MeFuc refinements, the value was estimated from a Luzatti plot0.050.1880.106Average Biso (Å2)13.619.811.3No. of protein atoms2076882024No. of solvent/sugar/other ligands541/72/076/66/1334/126/36No. of residues in alternative conformations900No. of outliers on Ramachandran plotbAnalysis was determined by PROCHECK (23)000Overall G factorbAnalysis was determined by PROCHECK (23)-0.10-0.10-0.02Distance deviationsBond distances (Å)0.0140.0170.017Bond anglescFor RSL/MeFuc refinement, values refer to root mean square deviations (in Å) for angle and planar restraint distances (degrees)0.0301.882.00Planar groupscFor RSL/MeFuc refinement, values refer to root mean square deviations (in Å) for angle and planar restraint distances (Å)0.0330.0070.009a For RSL/MeFuc refinements, the value was estimated from a Luzatti plotb Analysis was determined by PROCHECK (23Laskowski R.A.

Measurements were carried out simultaneously on all four measuring channels using three different concentrations of immobilized RSL, whereas the fourth channel was used as the control flow cell. A research grade CM5 sensor chip was activated with an EDC/NHS solution (1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide) for 10 min, and 50 μl of RSL in 5 mm maleate buffer, pH 6.0, at concentrations of 300, 100, and 50 μg/ml, respectively, was injected into a particular flow cell. The unreacted species on the sensor surface were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine. The blank channel was treated identically except for no lectin injection.30 μl of carbohydrate solutions (concentrations between 0.024 and 400 μm) in running buffer were injected into the flow cells using the kinject mode. The equilibrium response (after subtraction from the response of the reference surface) of each experiment was used to create curves of analyte binding, which were both evaluated by Scatchard plot and fitted to a 1:1 steady-state affinity model using Origin 6.1 software (OriginLab Corp.).Titration Microcalorimetry Measurements—ITC experiments were performed with a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Sugars and proteins were dissolved in the same buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5). Protein concentration in the microcalorimeter cell (1.4478 ml) varied from 23.5 to 50 μm. Sugar solution in 30 injections of 10 μl at concentrations varying from 0.24 to 0.5 mm were added at intervals of 4 min while stirring at 310 rpm. Control experiments performed by injections of buffer in the protein solution yielded insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal with ΔH (enthalpy change), Ka (association constant), and n (number of binding sites per monomer) as adjustable parameters, from the following relationship,Qi=nPtΔHVo2[1+AtnPt+1nKPt−(1+AtnPt+1nKPt)2−4AtnPt]eq.1 where Pt represents the total protein concentration, At is the total concentration of the ligand, Vo is the volume of the cell, and Qi is the total released heat for the injection i.

Most organisms express multiple formins, but it has been unclear whether they have similar or distinct activities and how they may be regulated differentially. We isolated and compared the activities of carboxyl-terminal fragments of the only two formins expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bni1 and Bnr1. Bnr1 was an order of magnitude more potent than Bni1 in actin nucleation and processive capping, and unlike Bni1, Bnr1 bundled actin filaments. Profilin bound directly to Bni1 and Bnr1 and regulated their activities similarly. However, the cell polarity factor Bud6/Aip3 specifically bound to and stimulated Bni1, but not Bnr1. This was unexpected, since previous two-hybrid studies suggested Bud6 interacts with both formins. We mapped Bud6 binding activity to specific residues in the carboxyl terminus of Bni1 that are adjacent to its diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD). Fusion of the carboxyl terminus of Bni1 to Bnr1 conferred Bud6 stimulation to a Bnr1-Bni1 chimera. Thus, Bud6 differentially stimulates Bni1 and not Bnr1. We found that Bud6 is up-regulated during bud growth, when it is delivered to the bud tip on Bni1-nucleated actin cables. We propose that Bud6 stimulation of Bni1 promotes robust cable formation, which in turn delivers more Bud6 to the bud tip, reinforcing polarized cell growth through a positive feedback loop.

Most formins contain a prolinerich formin homology 1 (FH1) domain, through which they interact directly with the actin monomer binding protein profilin.

Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4971-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the differential functions of Bni1 and Bnr1 has been unclear. The activities of Bni1 on actin have been characterized in detail in recent studies (3Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 4Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but little is known about Bnr1 activities. Thus, it has been an open question whether differences in Bni1 and Bnr1 functions relate to their distinct localization patterns in vivo or, alternatively, whether they might have distinct activities and/or be differentially regulated by ligand interactions. Here, we carefully compare the actin nucleation and processive capping activities of Bni1 and Bnr1 and find that Bnr1 is 10-fold more potent than Bni1. Further, Bnr1, but not Bni1, bundles F-actin. The cell polarity factor Bud6/Aip3 binds specifically to Bni1, and not Bnr1, and we map binding to specific sequences in the carboxyl-terminal extension of Bni1 that are not conserved in Bnr1. Bud6 also stimulates the actin nucleation activity of Bni1, but not Bnr1. This interaction provides a new understanding of how yeast formins are differentially regulated in vivo. From these and other data, we propose a mechanism for how Bud6 and Bni1 contribute to polarized cell growth through a positive feedback mechanism. Plasmid and Yeast Strain Construction—Standard methods were used for DNA manipulations and yeast growth and transformation (23Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To construct a His6-Bni1(FH1-COOH) yeast expression plasmid, Bni1 (residues 1227-1953) was PCR-amplified from a GST-Bni1(FH1-COOH) bacterial expression plasmid (6Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pQE-9 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), which introduces an amino-terminal 6-histidine tag. The His6-Bni1-(1227-1953) encoding DNA fragment of this plasmid was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the BglII-NotI sites of pBG007 (a URA3, 2 μ vector with an insertion of the GAL promoter) to create pBG564. To construct a plasmid for expressing His6-Bnr1(FH1-COOH), DNA encoding Bnr1 (residues 757-1375) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the NheI-NotI sites of pBG564 to construct pBG565. To construct a plasmid for expressing Bni1(FH1FH2), DNA encoding Bni1 (residues 1227-1824) was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the BamHI-NotI sites of pBG564 to construct pBG580. The plasmid for expressing the Bnr1-Bni1 chimera (Bnr1 residues 758-1320 fused to Bni1 residues 1808-1953) was constructed by homologous recombination (“gap repair”) as follows. DNA encoding Bni1 (residues 1808-1953) was PCR-amplified using primers ACGATGGTGAAAAAGTAAACAGGGATGCTGTTGATCTACTCATATCTAAATTGAAAAATGCAGGTCCTGC and AATACAAATTTTCCGCGGCCGCCTATATATTTTGAATATCGTTCAGCATACTATTATTTGAAACTTAGCCTGTTAC and then co-transformed with SphI-digested pBG565 into a bnr1Δ strain, a gift from Dr. David Pellman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). The resulting gap-repaired plasmid, pBG581, was rescued from yeast and amplified in Escherichia coli. Bni1 fragments used to test Bud6 binding (see Fig. 6) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into BamHI-HindIII sites of pQE-9 for expression in E. coli as His6 fusion proteins. All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Further details of constructs are available upon request. A 3× HA tag was integrated in frame at the carboxyl terminus of the BUD6 gene to generate the yeast strain BGY968. The 3× HA tag (marked with His3MX6) was PCR-amplified from pFA6a-3HA-His3MX6 (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) using primers AGCAGAAGGATGAAGCAAATTTGAGAGCATATTTTGGGCCGGGGTTTACTCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA and AGCCAAAAGCACTAATCTCTTTTCCGTTAGCTTTCATAAAATTAGTGTATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC. The PCR product was transformed into the haploid yeast strain BGY10 (MATa his3-11, 15 ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 ade2-1 trp1-1), and transformants were selected on His-medium. Integration was verified by PCR analysis of isolated genomic DNA. Protein Expression and Purification—Rabbit skeletal muscle was purified (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (26Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D.

Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) were purified as described. To isolate His6-Bni1(FH1-COOH), His6-Bnr1(FH1-COOH), His6-Bni1(FH1FH2), and His6-Bnr1(FH1FH2)-Bni1(COOH), the yeast strain BJ2168 (30Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was transformed with pBG564, pBG565, pBG580, and pBG565, respectively. For each, 2 liters of cells were grown to log phase in 2% raffinose-containing medium and then switched to 2% galactose-containing medium to induce protein expression as described (31Rodal A.A. Manning A.L. Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1000-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in a 1:3 (v/w) ratio of water, frozen in liquid N2, and lysed as described (32Goode B.L. Wong J.J. Butty A.-C. Peter M. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To isolate protein, frozen cell powders (9 g each) were thawed in a 1:1 (v/w) ratio of 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 2× PBS (40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (final concentration of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin A, chymostatin, and aprotinin). A total of 15 ml of crude lysate was centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 20 min in a TLA100.3 rotor (Beckman/Coulter, Fullerton, CA), and the supernatant was applied to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen). After a 1.5-h incubation, beads were washed twice in 15 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1× PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 350 mm NaCl, followed by three washes in 15 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1× PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT. Beads were then loaded into empty polyprep chromatography columns (0.8 × 4 cm) (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were eluted using a gradient of 50-200 mm imidazole in 1× PBS, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol. Peak fractions were concentrated in a Centricon-10 device (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and further purified on a Superose12 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in HEKG10 buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). Peak fractions were aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Bni1 fragments used to map the Bud6 binding site (BBS) (see Fig. 6) were expressed as His6 fusion proteins in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Cells were grown to log phase at 37 °C and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 25 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1× PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (listed above). Cells were incubated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) on ice for 15 min, followed by sonication. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and His6 fusion proteins were isolated from the supernatant on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads as described above. Actin Filament Assembly and Elongation Assays—Monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared by gel filtration using a Sephacryl S-200 column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in G-buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm DTT). Actin assembly was measured in 60-μl reactions. Gel-filtered monomeric actin (final concentration 1 or 2 μm, 5% pyrene-labeled) was converted to Mg-ATP-actin for 2 min immediately before use in the reaction as described (12Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Mg-ATP-actin was then mixed with 10 μl of HEKG10 buffer or proteins in HEKG10 buffer and added immediately to 3 μl of 20× initiation mix (40 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 1 m KCl) to initiate assembly. Pyrene fluorescence was monitored over time at an excitation of 365 nm and emission of 407 nm in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ) at 25 °C. Rates of actin assembly were calculated from the slopes of the assembly curves at 50% polymerization. Filament elongation reactions were performed as described (6Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) using gel-filtered actin monomers (10% pyrene-labeled). Actin Filament Bundling Assays—For low speed centrifugation assays, 18 μl of preassembled 5 μm F-actin (rabbit muscle actin) and 12 μl of HEKG10 buffer or proteins in HEKG10 buffer were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were centrifuged for 4 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Actin filaments were manipulated using precut pipette tips to prevent filament shearing. For electron microscopy, 12 μl of preassembled 5 μm F-actin and 8 μl of HEKG10 buffer or proteins in HEKG10 buffer were mixed. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were diluted 1:10 in F-buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.7 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DTT), and a 10-μl aliquot was immediately spotted onto carbon-coated copper grids, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and examined in a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Specimens were imaged using an AMT CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Corp., Danvers, MA) at 80,000 kV with a magnification of ×32,000. Bud6 and Profilin Binding Assays—For the assays shown in Figs. 5F and 6A, Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads coated with either Bni1(FH1-COOH) or Bnr1(FH1-COOH) were prepared from yeast lysates as described above (prior to elution with imidazole). Control beads were prepared in parallel by incubation with a wild type yeast cell lysate. The concentration of formin bound to the beads was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. 40 μl reactions (in 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1× PBS, 0.5 mm DTT) containing formin-coated or control beads (final formin concentration in reaction = 1 μm) were incubated (by rotating tubes) with 3 μm C-Bud6 or 10 μm yeast profilin (Pfy1 or Pfy1-19) for 10 min at room temperature. Beads were pelleted by low speed centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant (unbound fraction) was removed. Beads were washed with 40 μl of 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 1× PBS, 0.5 mm DTT once for profilin binding assays and three times for Bud6 binding assays. For the assays shown in Fig. 6, B and C, Bni1-coated beads were prepared as described above, and control beads were incubated with lysate from control bacteria (carrying empty pQE-9 plasmid). Binding reactions were performed as described for formins expressed in yeast. Cell Synchronization Assays—BGY968 cells (MATa BUD6-3HA::HIS3MX6) were grown to an A600 of 0.1 in YPD medium and arrested at G1 by treatment with α-factor (5 μg/ml) for 2 h. Cells were washed two times in YPD and resuspended in YPD to release them from G1 arrest. Samples were removed at 15-min intervals and examined by light microscopy to assess progression through the cell cycle, judged by bud size (>75% of cells synchronized). At each time point, whole cell lysates were prepared as described (33Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). A total of 0.2 A600 units of cells were loaded per lane on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fractionated, and immunoblotted with anti-HA(F-7)-horseradish peroxidase antibodies as below. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against yeast tubulin, a gift from Frank Solomon (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), was used at a 1:3500 dilution. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation of Bud6-3HA (see Fig. 8B), BGY968 cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of HEK + 1% Nonidet P-40 (w/v) supplemented with protease inhibitors (as above). Cells were resuspended, lysed by vortexing with glass beads, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected and mixed for 2 h at 4°C with 10 μl of Protein-A Sepharose CL-4B beads (AP Biotech) precoated with HA.11 antibody (1 mg/ml final concentration on beads) (Covance, Princeton, NJ). The beads were collected by centrifugation, and 5 μl of beads were incubated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or mock buffer (lacking enzyme) at 30 °C for 30 min. Beads were boiled in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with 1:5000 anti-HA(F-7)-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Signals were detected using Super-signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Phosphoprotein Staining—SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond Phosphoprotein Gel Stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and visualized according to the manufacturer's specifications. Bnr1 Potently Nucleates Actin Assembly and Processively Caps Filament Barbed Ends—To compare Bni1 and Bnr1 activities, we purified equivalent fragments of these two proteins, extending from a conserved residue at the amino-terminal boundary of the FH1 domain to their natural carboxyl termini (schematic in Fig. 1A, gel of purified proteins in Fig. 1B). We based our design on similar fragments of Bni1 and other formins (containing FH1, FH2, and carboxyl extensions) that have the strongest actin nucleation activities measured to date (3Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D.

Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Zigmond S.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because we used these Bni1(FH1-COOH) and Bnr1(FH1-COOH) fragments for most of our analyses, we refer to them throughout the paper as Bni1 and Bnr1. Bni1 and Bnr1 were expressed and purified as His6 fusion proteins from their native source (S. cerevisiae), representing the first purification and characterization of formins in any species from a nonbacterial source. Bni1 expressed in bacteria and yeast had equivalent actin nucleation activities, but Bnr1 isolated from bacteria had greatly reduced activity compared with Bnr1 isolated from yeast. 2J. B. Moseley and B. L. Goode, unpublished data. Consistent with this observation, a recent study detected weak actin assembly activity for a bacterially expressed GST-Bnr1(FH1FH2) construct (22Pruyne D. Gao L. Bi E. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4971-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was necessary to purify both formins from yeast to compare their activities. The increased activity we observed for Bnr1 purified from yeast may reflect a requirement for eukaryotic protein chaperones. However, purified Bnr1 isolated from yeast does not appear to be phosphorylated (see below). We first compared Bni1 and Bnr1, purified from yeast, in actin assembly assays. Bni1 nucleated the polymerization of 2 μm gel-filtered Mg2+-actin monomers (5% pyrene-labeled) as previously reported for similar Bni1 constructs isolated from bacteria (Fig. 1C) (3Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Pring M. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Zigmond S.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By comparison, Bnr1 showed a far more robust nucleation activity than Bni1 (Fig. 1D). Direct comparisons over a range of formin concentrations demonstrated that Bnr1 is >10-fold more potent than Bni1 in nucleation activity (Fig. 1E). These results raise three important points. First, the potency of Bnr1 nucleation activity is at least equivalent to the strongest reported for any formin protein to date; previous studies showed that the mouse formin mDia1 is about 7-fold more active than Bni1 (13Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Second, comparisons of some bacterially expressed formins may be compromised, and accurate comparisons of formin activities may require their expression in yeast or other eukaryotes. Third, the >10-fold difference in nucleation activity for Bnr1 compared with Bni1 may be important in vivo, tailored to specific functions of these formins. For example, more robust actin nucleation activity may be required at the bud neck, where Bnr1 is positioned throughout the cell cycle. To determine whether post-translational modifications underlie the robust nucleation activity for Bnr1 purified from yeast, we examined the phosphorylation states of our purified Bni1 and Bnr1 fragments. By two different assays, we found that Bni1, but not Bnr1, is phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). First, treatment with λ-phosphatase changes the migration of Bni1 but not Bnr1 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Second, a fluorescent phosphoprotein dye could detect purified Bni1 but not Bnr1 in protein gels, and the signal was abolished by treatment of Bni1 with λ-phosphatase. For these reasons, phosphorylation does not appear to contribute to the robust nucleation activity of Bnr1. We also examined the functional significance of Bni1 phosphorylation for its nucleation activity. Reversal of Bni1 phosphorylation by λ-phosphatase treatment had no appreciable effect on its nucleation activity alone (Fig. 2B) or in the presence of C-Bu"

https://openalex.org/W2086258145,"One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the self-aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in extracellular amyloid fibrils. Among the different forms of Abeta, the 42-residue fragment (Abeta1-42) readily self-associates and forms nucleation centers from where fibrils can quickly grow. The strong tendency of Abeta1-42 to aggregate is one of the reasons for the scarcity of data on its fibril formation process. We have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize in liquid environment the fibrillogenesis of synthetic Abeta1-42 on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. The results presented provide nanometric resolution of the main structures characteristic of the several steps from monomeric Abeta1-42 to mature fibrils in vitro. Oligomeric globular aggregates of Abeta1-42 precede the appearance of protofibrils, the first fibrillar species, although we have not obtained direct evidence of oligomer-protofibril interconversion. The protofibril dimensions deduced from our AFM images are consistent with a model that postulates the stacking of the peptide in a hairpin conformation perpendicular to the long axis of the protofibril, forming single beta-sheets ribbon-shaped. The most abundant form of Abeta1-42 fibril exhibits a nodular structure with a ~100-nm periodicity. This length is very similar 1) to the length of protofibril bundles that are the dominant feature at earlier stages in the aggregation process, 2) to the period of helical structures that have been observed in the core of fibrils, and 3) to the distance between regularly spaced, structurally weak fibril points. Taken together, these data are consistent with the existence of a ~100-nm long basic protofibril unit that is a key fibril building block."
https://openalex.org/W2139439841,"Endoglin is an accessory receptor for transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) in endothelial cells, essential for vascular development. Its pivotal role in angiogenesis is underscored in Endoglin null (Eng-/-) murine embryos, which die at mid-gestation (E10.5) from impaired yolk sac vessel formation. Moreover, mutations in endoglin and the endothelial-specific TGFβ type I receptor, ALK1, are linked to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. To determine the role of endoglin in TGFβ pathways, we derived murine endothelial cell lines from Eng+/+ and Eng-/- embryos (E9.0). Whereas Eng+/+ cells were only partially growth inhibited by TGFβ, Eng-/- cells displayed a potent anti-proliferative response. TGFβ-dependent Smad2 phosphorylation and Smad2/3 translocation were unchanged in the Eng-/- cells. In contrast, TGFβ treatment led to a more rapid activation of the Smad1/5 pathway in Eng null cells that was apparent at lower TGFβ concentrations. Enhanced activity of the Smad1 pathway in Eng-/- cells was reflected in higher expression of ALK1-dependent genes such as Id1, Smad6, and Smad7. Analysis of cell surface receptors revealed that the TGFβ type I receptor, ALK5, which is required for ALK1 function, was increased in Eng-/- cells. TGFβ receptor complexes were less numerous but displayed a higher binding affinity. These results suggest that endoglin modulates TGFβ signaling in endothelial cells by regulating surface TGFβ receptors and suppressing Smad1 activation. Thus an altered balance in TGFβ receptors and downstream Smad pathways may underlie defects in vascular development and homeostasis.

Vasculogenesis in the Eng-/- mice is normal, but angiogenesis is impaired along with remodeling of the primary vascular plexus. Mice exhibit poor vascular smooth muscle development that results in dilatation and rupture of the vascular channels. Heart development is arrested in Eng-/- mice at E9.0. The atrioventricular canal endocardium fails to undergo mesenchymal transformation and to generate the cushion tissue essential for valve formation and heart septation (11Bourdeau A. Dumont D.J. Letarte M. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Transient expression of endoglin is also striking during human development, as it is up-regulated during heart valve formation but subsequently reduced as the valves mature (14Qu R. Silver M.M.

Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 584-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that controls proliferation, migration, adhesion, and apoptosis of diverse cell types (18Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar, 19Roberts A.B. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TGFβ signals through a heteromeric complex of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Receptor activation occurs upon binding of ligand to the type II receptor (TβRII), which recruits and phosphorylates type I receptors and then propagates the signal to downstream target receptor-regulated Smads (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar, 22Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The specificity of cellular responses to TGFβ is mediated by the type I receptors. Most cells utilize the type I receptor ALK5, which phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. However, endothelial cells have an additional type I receptor, ALK1, which phosphorylates Smad1 and Smad 5 (23Chen Y.G. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Kim S. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Of note, TGFβ-dependent activation of ALK1 requires ALK5, such that both are present with TβRII in a composite receptor complex that acts via Smad1 and Smad5. Once phosphorylated, one of these receptor-regulated Smads combines with the common Smad4, and the complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate transcription (22Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 25Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). The inhibitory Smads 6 and 7 are a third class of Smads that down-regulate TGFβ-related responses (26Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Wrana J.L. Falb D.

Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). TGFβ1 has various roles in development and homeostasis of the vascular system and regulates both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. It can regulate vascular permeability, endothelial cell proliferation and migration, production of extracellular matrix, and vascular remodeling (29Pepper M.S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Recruitment of mesenchymal cells into new vessels is achieved in part by TGFβ. Upon contact of mesenchymal cells with the endothelium, latent TGFβ is activated, inducing differentiation of mesenchymal cells into pericytes and smooth muscle cells (30Hirschi K.K. Rohovsky S.A. D'Amore P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Gene ablation of TGFβ, its receptors, and Smads underscores the essential role of TGFβ signaling in vascular development. Gene knock-outs of TGFβ1, TβRII, ALK5, ALK1, and Smad5 all die from improper development of yolk sac vascular networks and/or cardiac malformations. Although TβRII and ALK5 null mice also have yolk sac defects, the most similar phenotypes to endoglin null mice are the ALK1- and Smad5-deficient embryos, which also develop dilated vessels ascribed to poor smooth muscle cell development (31Lebrin F. Deckers M. Bertolino P. Ten Dijke P. Cardiovasc Res. 2005; 65: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the ACVRL1 gene, which codes for ALK1, cause HHT2, exhibiting vascular lesions similar to HHT1, suggesting that endoglin and ALK1 may function in the same pathway (32Johnson D.W. Berg J.N. Baldwin M.A. Gallione C.J. Marondel I. Yoon S.J. Stenzel T.T. Speer M. Pericak-Vance M.A. Diamond A. Guttmacher A.E. Jackson C.E. Attisano L. Kucherlapati R. Porteous M.E. Marchuk D.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Endoglin does not bind TGFβ on its own but associates with TGFβ receptor complexes primarily by interacting with the ligand binding receptor TβRII (17Barbara N.P. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 584-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Endoglin also interacts with ALK5 and ALK1 in the absence of TGFβ (33Abdalla S.A. Pece-Barbara N. Vera S. Tapia E. Paez E. Bernabeu C. Letarte M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1227-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Guerrero-Esteo M. Sanchez-Elsner T. Letamendia A. Bernabeu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29197-29209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although endoglin is thought to modulate TGFβ signaling, its role in the endothelial cell receptor complex is not well understood. Ectopic overexpression of endoglin in myoblasts and activated monocytes interferes with several TGFβ responses, including inhibition of proliferation (35Lastres P. Letamendia A. Zhang H. Rius C. Almendro N. Raab U. Lopez L.A. Langa C. Fabra A. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 36Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabeu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33011-33019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment of endothelial cells with antisense oligonucleotides for endoglin enhanced the ability of TGFβ1 to suppress growth and migration of these cells (37Li C. Hampson I.N. Hampson L. Kumar P. Bernabeu C. Kumar S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of endoglin in the vascular system, we analyzed TGFβ signaling in Eng-/- and control murine embryonic endothelial cells (MEEC). Our results are consistent with a model in which endoglin modulates TGFβ-dependent activation of ALK1 versus ALK5 to maintain a balance between Smad1/5 and Smad2/3 signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Derivation of MEEC—Eng+/+ and Eng-/- murine embryos and yolk sacs were isolated at E9.0 of gestation (N4 generation, C57BL/6 mice), prior to onset of the lethal phenotype in the Eng null mice as previously described (38Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After disaggregation of tissues, endothelial cells were selectively immortalized with polyoma middle T antigen in the retrovirus vector N-TkmT using 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma), and lines were established as reported (38Balconi G. Spagnuolo R. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The infected cells were selected by adding the neomycin analogue G418 (Invitrogen) at 800 μg/ml. Cells were maintained in MCDB131 medium plus 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 15 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies), heparin 10 units/ml (Hepalean), gentamicin 50 μg/ml (Wisent), and glutamine 1% (Amersham Biosciences). Two-color Flow Cytometry—MEEC were detached by brief trypsinization, neutralized with 15% FBS, and washed in Ca2+-Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% FBS. Cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 1 h with saturating amounts of FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody (mAb) MJ7/18 (Biocan Scientific) to murine endoglin (CD105), phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated mAb MEC 13.3 to PE-CAM (CD31; BD Biosciences) or respective conjugated isotype controls and then washed again. Samples were run on the fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur® (BD Biosciences). A gate was set using forward and side scatter and both FL1 (FITC) and FL2 (phosphatidylethanolamine) channels were acquired. Data were analyzed using CellQuest® software where percent positive cells were determined relative to the isotype controls. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Equivalent numbers of matched MEEC lines were incubated with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label; ICN Pharmaceuticals) in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3.5 h. Cells were solubilized in lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) and a mixture of inhibitors, immunoprecipitated with mAb MJ7/18 (Biocan Scientific) to endoglin, and processed according to published procedures (16Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White Jr., R.I. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Determination of Proliferation Rates—To measure doubling time of MEEC, they were seeded at 1 × 105 (100-mm dish) in complete medium containing 15% FBS. At successive times post-seeding, cells were trypsinized, neutralized with 15% FBS, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted in a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). The proliferation rate of lines was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Cells were seeded at 2,000 cells/well (96-well plate) in complete medium containing 1% FBS and 15 μg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies) and then pulsed for 8 h (1 μCi/well) at various time points. Cells were lysed with water and harvested with a microplate harvester (Inotech Biosystems International); radioactive incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation analysis (Beckman Instruments). Multiple conditions were tested for cell density, growth factor, FBS concentrations, and length of pulse. Results reported here show an optimal experiment with reduced serum. For inhibition of proliferation by TGFβ1 (R&D Systems), cells were left overnight in complete medium containing 15% FBS and 15 μg/ml endothelial mitogen, starved for 2 h, and incubated with increasing concentrations of TGFβ1 ranging from 0 to 100 pm in medium containing 1% FBS and 15 μg/ml endothelial mitogen for 48 h, including an 8-h pulse with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well). These conditions were optimized for cell density, growth factor concentration, and time in culture with both matched sets of lines to obtain maximal inhibition of proliferation by TGFβ1. Measurement of Smad Phosphorylation by Western Blot—Equivalent numbers of MEEC were seeded in complete medium. After 48 h, cells were starved for 2–3 h in serum-free medium, treated with TGFβ1 for the times and concentrations indicated, and solubilized in lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of inhibitors (20Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated, and volumes of samples with equivalent protein were fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were immunoprobed, processed, and detected as reported (16Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White Jr., R.I. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) except that chemiluminescence detection was performed using SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce) and blots quantified using a Fluor-S-max® CCD camera and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad) or exposed to Hyper-film (Amersham Biosciences) and films scanned by densitometer. Antibodies used for detection were polyclonal antibody (pAb) to phospho-Smad2 (Cell Signaling), mAb to Smad2/3 (Transduction Laboratories), pAb to phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Cell Signaling), pAb to Smad1/5 prepared in-house (Wrana) or from Cell Signaling. Anti-β-actin (Sigma) was used to reprobe blots to determine equal loading. Smad2/3 Nuclear Translocation Assay—15,000 cells of each MEEC line were seeded per well of 96-well plates and after 24 h were rinsed, starved for 2 h in serum-free MCDB/131 medium, and treated with TGFβ1 in medium containing 0.2% FBS for the times and concentrations indicated. Cells were fixed for 10 min by adding paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 4% and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 2.5 min at 23 °C. After washing extensively, cells were blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline plus 10% FBS. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mAb recognizing both Smad2 and Smad3 (Transduction Laboratories). They were washed and incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Molecular Probes) plus 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:2000; Sigma) to stain nuclei for 1 h at 23 °C. Nuclei were defined using the DAPI stain and fluorescence within a cytoplasmic ring, and the nucleus was measured with the FITC channel on the ArrayScanII® from Cellomics Instruments. The mean nuclear-cytoplasmic intensity difference was simultaneously quantified using the Molecular Translocation BioApplication® and Data Viewer software (Cellomics). Real-time PCR of mRNA Levels—RNA was extracted by adding TRIzol (Invitrogen) directly onto washed MEEC monolayers. RNA quality and concentration were estimated using the Agilent Analyser. Samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) primers (Superscript II RT-PCR kit; Invitrogen) and the cDNA samples used in real-time PCR experiments. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as the housekeeping gene, and gene expression was measured using SYBR green II (Qiagen) with the ABI PRISM 7900 real-time PCR system. The primer sequences were obtained from Dr. Koichi Mishima (Dept. of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo). The PCR program consisted of the initial activation step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 50 cycling steps of denaturing for 15 s at 94 °C, annealing at appropriate temperature for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s. The PCR data were analyzed using SDS 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems). Cell Surface Biotinylation and Western Blot—Receptor levels were quantified by Western blot analysis as described for Smad phosphorylation except that cells were not treated with TGFβ1. Antibodies used for detection were pAb C16 to TβRII (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mAb MJ7/18 (Biocan Scientific) to murine endoglin, mAb to ALK1 (R&D systems), and pAb V22 to ALK5 (Santa Cruz). For quantification of cell surface TβRII, equivalent numbers of MEEC were seeded in complete medium; after 48 h, intact monolayers were surface labeled with 0.3 mg/ml of sulfo-succinimidyl 6 (biotinamido)-hexanoate (NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) as reported previously (16Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White Jr., R.I. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Lysates from surface-biotinylated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-TβRII pAb C16 (Santa Cruz) or anti-endoglin mAb MJ7/18 (Biocan Scientific). Samples containing equivalent protein content were analyzed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex) and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase as reported. Quantification was achieved by chemiluminescence with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) followed by reading with a Fluor-S-Max® CCD camera and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Affinity Labeling of Receptor Complexes, Turnover, and Scatchard Analysis—TGFβ (R&D Systems) was iodinated with 125I using chloramine-T as described previously (39Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 68: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). For turnover of active complexes, confluent monolayers were affinity labeled by incubation with 250 pm125I-TGFβ1 for 2 h at 4°C, washed, and treated with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline-Tris (pH 7.6) and incubated in medium at 37 °C for the times indicated for receptor turnover experiments. Cells were then solubilized in lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of inhibitors as reported (40Massague J. Prog. Med. Virol. 1985; 32: 142-158PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gels (Novex). Receptors were quantified using a STORM Phosphorimager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). For Scatchard analysis, confluent monolayers were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-TGFβ1 in the presence or absence of 40× competing cold TGFβ1 at 4 °C for 3.5 h and cross-linked as described above. Labeling medium and supernatants were collected and counted in a gamma counter. Lysates were also counted and then analyzed by 4–12% SDS-PAGE (Novex). Pixels were converted to cpm by comparing to known amounts of 125I-TGFβ1 that were spotted onto filters and exposed along with gels and quantified as above. Eng Null Endothelial Cells Show Increased Proliferation and Growth Inhibitory Response to TGFβ—To better understand the role of endoglin in TGFβ-mediated signaling in endothelial cells, we generated endothelial cell lines from murine embryos and yolk sacs (E9.0) prior to onset of the lethal phenotype in Eng null mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Eng+/+ and Eng-/- embryos from two founding mothers, numbered herein as 150 and 152, were independently used for the derivation of lines. When embryonic cells are infected with retrovirus vectors containing polyoma middle T antigen, endothelial cells are selectively immortalized. This allows pure wild type and endoglin null MEEC lines to be obtained even if starting from a mixed population. Fig. 1A shows the characterization of these lines: Eng+/+ 150/7 with Eng-/- 150/9 and Eng+/+ 152/8 with Eng-/- 152/10. Two-color flow cytometry analysis revealed that 96–98% of Eng+/+ cells were in the upper right quadrant and thus were positive for endoglin (CD105) and PECAM (CD31). Alternatively, 90–93% of Eng-/- cells were in the upper left quadrant and thus were positive for the endothelial cell marker PECAM, indicating that these MEEC lines were endothelial but lacked endoglin. Analysis of endoglin expression by metabolic labeling followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) demonstrated that wild type cells expressed the full-length monomeric glycosylated (E) and precursor (P) forms, whereas no endoglin was detectable in the mutants. Next we analyzed the proliferation rate of the Eng-/- and control Eng+/+ MEEC lines and found that Eng-/- cells proliferated faster and achieved higher cell densities when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Subsequently, we examined TGFβ-dependent inhibition of proliferation. Although TGFβ is a potent inhibitor of proliferation in epithelial cells, both wild type endothelial cell lines examined here displayed poor responses (Fig. 2C), similar to previously published reports in other endothelial cell types (16Pece N. Vera S. Cymerman U. White Jr., R.I. Wrana J.L. Letarte M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 41Muller G. Behrens J. Nussbaumer U. Bohlen P.

Dis. 1989; 140: 1126-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, when we examined the Eng-/- lines, we observed potent anti-proliferative responses to TGFβ, with over 80% inhibition observed at between 25–50 pm (Fig. 2C). Of note, none of our cell lines displayed a TGFβ-dependent proliferative response, contrasting with MEEC cells reported by Lebrin et al. (7Lebrin F. Goumans M.J. Jonker L. Carvalho R.L. Valdimarsdottir G. Thorikay M. Mummery C. Arthur H.M. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4018-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) that displayed a “low-dose” TGFβ-induced proliferation dependent on endoglin. Our data suggest that in wild type cells, endoglin functions to block TGFβ-dependent inhibition of proliferation, in agreement with published data of a knockdown of endoglin in endothelial cells using antisense oligonucleotides leading to enhanced growth inhibition by TGFβ1 (37Li C. Hampson I.N. Hampson L. Kumar P. Bernabeu C. Kumar S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Endoglin Does Not Alter TGFβ1 Activation of Smad2 in MEEC Lines—To better define a mechanism for the increased TGFβ responsiveness in the Eng-/- lines, we looked at downstream signaling events, namely Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3). We first examined Smad2 phosphorylation in response to increasing doses of TGFβ using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes activated Smad2. This revealed robust Smad2 activation that was near maximal at 5 pm, the lowest dose of TGFβ1 tested (Fig. 3A). Next we examined the rate of Smad2 activation in response to 50 pm TGFβ1 and observed that, whereas Eng-/- cells displayed a slightly earlier activation of Smad2 (Fig. 3B), there was no difference when we assessed the magnitude and endurance of Smad2 activation in response to a brief 30-min pulse of TGFβ1 (Fig. 3C). We also quantified the nuclear accumulation of Smad2 and Smad3 in the nucleus using a Cellomics Arrayscan system (28Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Go"
https://openalex.org/W2079333946,"Alzheimer disease is associated with extracellular deposits of amyloid β-peptides in the brain. Amyloid β-peptides are generated by proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases. The cleavage by secretases occurs predominantly in post-Golgi secretory and endocytic compartments and is influenced by cholesterol, indicating a role of the membrane lipid composition in proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein. To analyze the role of glycosphingolipids in these processes we inhibited glycosyl ceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. The depletion of glycosphingolipids markedly reduced the secretion of endogenous β-amyloid precursor protein in different cell types, including human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Importantly, secretion of amyloid β-peptides was also strongly decreased by inhibition of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Conversely, the addition of exogenous brain gangliosides to cultured cells reversed these effects. Biochemical and cell biological experiments demonstrate that the pharmacological reduction of cellular glycosphingolipid levels inhibited maturation and cell surface transport of the β-amyloid precursor protein. In the glycosphingolipid-deficient cell line GM95, cellular levels and maturation of β-amyloid precursor protein were also significantly reduced as compared with normal B16 cells. Together, these data demonstrate that glycosphingolipids are implicated in the regulation of the subcellular transport of the β-amyloid precursor protein in the secretory pathway and its proteolytic processing. Thus, enzymes involved in glycosphingolipid metabolism might represent targets to inhibit the production of amyloid β-peptides. Alzheimer disease is associated with extracellular deposits of amyloid β-peptides in the brain. Amyloid β-peptides are generated by proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases.

Aβ derives from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing, which involves sequential cleavages by proteases called β- and γ-secretases (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar, 3Annaert W. de Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 4Walter J. Kaether C. Steiner H. Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). APP is a type I membrane protein that is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi compartment to the cell surface and undergoes maturation by N′- and O′-glycosylation (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar, 3Annaert W. de Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Within the secretory pathway and at the cell surface APP is predominantly cleaved by α-secretase, resulting in the secretion of soluble APP (APPS) (5Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Because α-secretase cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, this cleavage precludes the generation of Aβ. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved by β-secretase. The cleavage of APP by β-secretase occurs predominantly in endosomal and lysosomal compartments after internalization from the cell surface (6Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 7Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP resulting from α- or β-secretase cleavage can be cleaved within the transmembrane domain by γ-secretase to release p3 and Aβ, respectively (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5170) Google Scholar, 3Annaert W. de Strooper B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The proteolytic processing of APP is influenced by the lipid composition of cellular membranes, as demonstrated by the pharmacological modulation of cellular cholesterol levels (9Wolozin B.

In addition, the inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) also led to strong reduction of Aβ generation in cultured cells and transgenic mice, indicating that cholesterol esters also influence proteolytic processing of APP (13Puglielli L.

These effects on APP processing might involve altered cleavage of APP by α-secretase and/or β-secretase, probably by redistribution of APP and secretases between distinct membrane microdomains (15Abad-Rodriguez J.

It has been shown that the levels of several gangliosides are altered in AD brains (19Cutler R.G. Kelly J. Storie K. Pedersen W.A. Tammara A. Hatanpaa K. Troncoso J.C. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2070-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In addition, the ganglioside GM1 binds to Aβ and might contribute to early deposition of the peptide in amyloid plaques (20Yanagisawa K. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Ihara Y. Nat.

The biosynthesis of GSLs starts with the generation of glucosylceramide from UDP-glucose and ceramide by glucosylceramide synthase (Fig. 1A). Glucosylceramide represents the precursor of a large variety of GSLs (23Kolter T. Proia R.L. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25859-25862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) that are transported in the secretory pathway from the Golgi to the cell surface (11Simons K.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The physiological functions of GSLs include the regulation of cell adhesion, cell differentiation, and signal transduction (24Sprong H. van der Sluijs P. van Meer G. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). Dysfunction of GSL degradation is associated with several inherited diseases that are characterized by the accumulation of GSLs in endosomal/lysosomal compartments (27Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 605-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Schuette C.G. Doering T. Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we sought to analyze the role of GSLs in the proteolytic processing of APP and the generation of Aβ. By using different cell types that express endogenous APP, we demonstrate that depletion of cells from GSLs results in reduced secretion of soluble APP and Aβ. Our data indicate that GSLs are implicated in the transport of APP in the secretory pathway and its expression at the cell surface, thereby altering the proteolytic processing by secretases. Reagents and Antibodies—d- and l-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), C6-ceramide, and TRITC-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) were obtained from Sigma.

C6-ceramide was dissolved at a concentration of 10 mm in ethanol. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of PDMP, ceramide, or exogenous GSLs as indicated (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Control cells were incubated with the carrier alone.Fig. 3GSL depletion selectively inhibits secretion of APPS in SH-SY5Y cells.A, human SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 25 μm PDMP for 48 h and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 15 min.

Samples were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—For pulse-chase experiments, cells were starved at 37 °C in methionine-free, serum-free medium for 45 min and then labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (MP Biomedicals Inc.) at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and excess amounts of unlabeled methionine for the indicated periods of time. Cells were lysed in STEN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and 2% bovine serum albumin on ice for 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14000 × g and immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.) and analyzed by autoradiography or phosphorimaging. Alternatively, proteins were detected by immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Total Protein Secretion—Whatman 3MM paper was cut into squares (2 × 2 cm), soaked with 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and dried. Conditioned chase media (25 μl) of radiolabeled cells was applied to the paper and left to dry. The filter papers were washed in 5% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), absolute ethanol, and acetone (twice each). Subsequent to drying, the filter papers were transferred to scintillation counter vials containing 5 ml of Optiphase Highsafe II scintillation mixture. The activities of 35S in the samples were counted on a scintillation counter using a 60-s time window. Isolation of Membranes and Detection of GM1—Cells were scraped from the culture dishes and incubated in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) for 10 min on ice. Cells were then homogenized by passing 15 times through a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm to pellet nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged 30 min at 16000 × g. Pelleted membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and GM1 was detected by Western immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin (Sigma). Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—To label cell surface proteins, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Perbio Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 20 mm glycine and finally lysed with STEN buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% Triton X-100. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from cleared lysates with streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The respective proteins were then detected by Western immunoblotting. Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated from B16 and GM95 cells using TRIzol, followed by reverse transcription to obtain cDNA. Semi-quantitaive PCR was then performed for APP and actin cDNA with 18 cycles. Primer pairs were 5′-GGTGGACTCTGTGCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCCGTTCTGCTGCATCTTGG-3′ for APP and 5′-TGCGTGACATCAAAGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCATAGCTCTTCTCCAGG-3′ for actin. Data Analysis and Statistics—In metabolic labeling experiments, band intensities were analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (FLA2000; Fuji) and the Fuji Image Gauge 3.0 software. For enhanced chemiluminescence detection, signals were measured and analyzed using an ECL imager (ChemiDoc™ XRS; Bio-Rad) and the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). For quantitations, three independent experiments (n = 3) were carried out. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student's t test. Significance values are as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (Figs. 3 and 4). To analyze the role of GSLs in the proteolytic processing of APP and Aβ generation, GSL biosynthesis was inhibited with PDMP, a competitive inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase that has been shown previously to efficiently decrease GSL biosynthesis in cultured cells (30Rosenwald A.G.

Treatment of HEK293 or HeLa cells with PDMP for 48 h led to a significant decrease in GSL biosynthesis as demonstrated by a strong reduction of GM1 levels (Fig. 1B). The treatment of cells with PDMP at the concentrations used did not affect cell viability (Supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). We therefore used this approach to investigate the role of GSLs in APP processing. HEK293 or HeLa cells were treated with PDMP, and APP was immunoprecipitated from conditioned media and lysates. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the secretion of APPS into conditioned media was markedly decreased in both HEK293 and HeLa cells that were treated with PDMP (Fig. 1, C-F). The decrease in APP secretion was observed for both variants APPS-α and APPS-β (Supplemental Fig. 2, available in the on-line version of this article). We also assessed the effect of PDMP on the precursor-product relationship of cellular and secreted APP in a pulse-chase experiment. In control cells, ∼8% of 35S-labeled cellular APP was secreted into the conditioned media after 2 h. In the same time period, only ∼ 2.5% of cellular APP was secreted in PDMP-treated cells (not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that PDMP treatment significantly decreases the secretion of APP. It should be noted that the effects of PDMP on APP secretion were selectively observed in non-transfected cells, but not in cells that stably overexpress APP (data not shown). This might be due to a tight regulation of the interaction of APP with membrane lipids (see “Discussion”). We therefore used exclusively non-transfected cells for the further experiments. To prove that the effects of PDMP are due to decreased levels of GSLs, we first analyzed the effect of short term treatment with PDMP. In contrast to long term treatment (48 h), incubation of cells with PDMP for only 2 h did not significantly reduce levels of GSLs (data not shown). Under these conditions, the secretion of APPS was not significantly changed (Fig. 2A). We also assessed the effect of the inactive enantiomer l-PDMP that does not inhibit glucosylceramide synthase. Long term treatment of cells for 48 h with l-PDMP did not reduce APPS secretion (Fig. 2B). Together, these control experiments indicate that the reduced secretion of APPS observed upon cell treatment with PDMP is due to decreased GSL levels in cellular membranes. We next tested the effect of exogenous GSLs on proteolytic processing of APP. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of purified bovine brain gangliosides, and levels of cellular and secreted APP were analyzed. The addition of exogenous GSLs significantly increased the cellular levels of endogenous APP as well as the secretion of APPS (Fig. 2C). Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role of GSLs in the cellular metabolism of APP. The levels of endogenous Aβ in the conditioned media of HEK293 were below the detection limits (data not shown), likely due to efficient cleavage of APP by α-secretase in this cell type (34Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Fig. 2). Because neuronal cells secrete higher levels of Aβ, we used human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to prove a role of GSLs in the processing of APP by pulse-chase experiments. Two variants of endogenously expressed APP were detected after pulse labeling in cell lysates that represent distinct APP splice forms, including the neuron-specific APP695 form (Fig. 3A). The presence of distinct splice variants in SH-SY5Y cells was also confirmed by reverse transcription PCR using isoform-specific primers (Supplemental Fig. 3, available in the on-line version of this article). PDMP treatment did not affect the expression of the distinct APP variants, as demonstrated by the similar levels of cellular APP after pulse labeling (Fig. 3A). Also, no effect on cell viability was detected (Supplemental Fig. 1C). As observed in HEK293 and HeLa cells, PDMP resulted in a significant reduction of APPS secretion into the conditioned media of SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The reduction was observed for the APP751/770 as well as for the neuron-specific APP695 splice variants. In contrast to HEK293 cells, SH-SY5Y cells predominantly secrete APPS-β (not shown). Together, these data indicate that PDMP treatment inhibits secretion of both APPS-α and APPS-β. However, total protein secretion was not reduced upon PDMP treatment, indicating a selective role of GSLs in the secretion of APP (Fig. 3C). Because the inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase might lead to accumulation of its substrate ceramide, which was shown to alter the proteolytic processing of APP by stabilization of the β-site APP-cleaving enzyme BACE1 (35Puglielli L. Ellis B.C. Saunders A.J. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19777-19783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of C6-ceramide on the secretion of APPS. The treatment of cells with ceramide at concentrations of 10 μm, which was shown to stabilize BACE1 (35Puglielli L. Ellis B.C. Saunders A.J. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19777-19783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), did not inhibit the secretion of APPS, indicating that the inhibition of APP secretion observed after PDMP was due to decreased levels of GSLs (Fig. 3D). To investigate the role of GSLs in the generation of Aβ, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PDMP for 48 h, and Aβ was immunoprecipitated from conditioned media. The secretion of Aβ was significantly reduced upon the inhibition of GSL biosynthesis (Fig. 4, A and B). On the other hand, the addition of exogenous GSLs increased the secretion of Aβ (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that GSLs participate in the generation of Aβ. We also analyzed the APP CTFs that derive from proteolytic processing of APP by β-secretase or α-secretase. Two major species of APP CTFs were detected that represent CTF-β and CTF-α resulting from β- and α-secretase cleavage, respectively (Fig. 4E). In addition, an intermediate band was detected that likely represents CTF-β′, a variant generated by an alternative cleavage of APP by β-secretase at Glu-11 within the Aβ domain (36Fluhrer R.

Importantly, these channels play a pivotal role in the control of cardiac and neuronal pacemaker activity. Dysfunction of HCN channels has been associated with human diseases, including cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain. The properties of three HCN channel isoforms (HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4) have been extensively investigated. By contrast, due to the lack of an efficient heterologous expression system, the functional characteristics of HCN3 were by and large unknown so far. Here, we have used lentiviral gene transfer to overexpress HCN3 in HEK293T cells. HCN3 currents revealed slow activation and deactivation kinetics and were effectively blocked by extracellular Cs+ and the bradycardic agent ivabradine. Cyclic AMP and cGMP had no significant impact on activation kinetics but induced a 5-mV shift of the half-maximal activation voltage (V0.5) to more hyperpolarized potentials. A negative shift of V0.5 induced by cyclic nucleotides is an unprecedented feature within the HCN channel family. The expression of HCN3 in mouse brain was examined by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody. High levels of protein were detected in olfactory bulb and hypothalamus. In contrast, only very low expression was found in cortex. Using reverse transcriptase PCR transcripts of HCN3 were also detected in heart ventricle.

In conclusion, the distinct expression pattern in conjunction with the unusual biophysical properties implies that HCN3 may play an unique role in the body. The hyperpolarization-activated cation current, termed Ih or If, is widely expressed in heart cells and neurons. The current is best known for its prime role in the generation of rhythmic activity in cardiac and neuronal pacemaker cells (1Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 2DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Ih is also present in several types of non-pacing neurons where it contributes to various physiological functions, including the setting of the resting membrane potential, synaptic transmission, and dendritic integration. Recent evidence suggests that Ih is involved in diseases making the channel a promising target for drug therapy. For example, the dysfunction of cardiac Ih was identified in patients suffering from sick sinus bradycardia (3Schulze-Bahr E. Neu A. Friederich P. Kaupp U.B. Breithardt G. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J.

Furthermore, it was proposed that overexpression of Ih in heart ventricle is associated with cardiac hypertrophy (5Cerbai E. Sartiani L. DePaoli P. Pino R. Maccherini M. Bizzarri F. DiCiolla F. Davoli G. Sani G. Mugelli A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ivabradine (S-16257-2), a blocker of Ih, is currently considered as a novel drug in the therapy of tachycardic arrhythmia and angina pectoris (6Bois P. Bescond J. Renaudon B. Lenfant J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Ih is also likely to participate in neurological diseases. In particular, there is accumulating evidence that the current is involved in epileptogenesis (7Poolos N.P. Epilepsy Curr. 2004; 4: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 216-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of Ih was observed in rat models of peripheral nerve injury suggesting a potential role of this current in driving neuropathic pain (9Chaplan S.R. Guo H.Q. Lee D.H. Luo L.

Rev. 2003; 55: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A structural hallmark of all HCN channels is a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain in the C terminus that confers sensitivity to cAMP (12Zagotta W.N. Olivier N.B. Black K.D. Young E.C. Olson R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2003; 425: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 13Wainger B.J. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). So far, the functional properties of three members of the HCN channel family (HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4) have been extensively studied using heterologous expression. Moreover, the specific physiological relevance of these channels has been defined using genetargeting approaches in mice (8Ludwig A. Budde T. Stieber J. Moosmang S. Wahl C. Holthoff K.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry indicated that this channel is expressed at low levels in rat and mouse brains (17Moosmang S. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 975-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Monteggia L.M. Eisch A.J. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Nestler E.J. Brain Res. Mol.

The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the channel are by and large unknown.In the present study we set out to address this important issue. We investigated the expression levels of murine HCN3 in mouse brain regions using Western blot analysis. Moreover, we achieved robust expression of the channel in HEK293T cells using lentiviral expression vectors. We show that HCN3 reveals some properties shared by other HCN channel types but is unique among these channels by being rather inhibited than activated by cyclic nucleotides.MATERIALS AND METHODSLentiviral HCN2 and HCN3 Expression Vectors—The mouse HCN3 (mHCN3) coding sequence was excised as a 2.7-kb HindIII-SpeI fragment from the plasmid mHCN3/pcDNA3 (16Moosmang S. Stieber J. Zong X. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The mHCN3 was cloned via XbaI and SpeI sites into pBluescript II KS plasmid containing the IRES-EGFP coding sequence (Clontech). Lentiviral plasmid LV-HCN3 was prepared by replacing the GFP coding sequence with the XbaI-SalI HCN3-IRES-EGFP fragment. A schematic representation of the HCN3 lentiviral expression vector is given in Fig. 2. The lentiviral HCN2 expression vector LV-HCN2 was constructed accordingly by cloning the coding region of mHCN2 (20Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) into the LV vector. Recombinant lentivirus as well as lentiviral particles were generated as described previously (21Pfeifer A. Brandon E.P. Kootstra N. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11450-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—HEK293T cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) infected with lentiviruses as previously described (21Pfeifer A. Brandon E.P. Kootstra N. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11450-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in T25, gelatin-fibronectin-coated flasks (Sigma). For electrophysiological experiments, glass coverslips were coated in 24-well dishes with poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and 30,000 cells/well were seeded.RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and subsequently treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of RNA with the Superscript II H--Kit (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. HCN3 was amplified from 0.5 μl of cDNA using following primers and conditions: 5′-GTCCGCCGGGGCCTGGAT-3′ (forward), 5′-CCTCCCACTGGTGTATGTAGC-3′ (reverse); 40 cycles at 60 °C. Amplicons were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized on a Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad). The primer pairs were intron-spanning to avoid amplification of genomic DNA.Generation of Anti-HCN3 Antibody and Western Blot—Polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the C-terminal (amino acids 552-779) region of murine HCN3 was generated by immunization (Gramsch Laboratories; Schwabhausen, Germany) with a His-Tag fusion protein expressed and purified using the QiaExpress-Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and affinity-purified using the Amino-Link-Kit (Pierce).To determine the specificity of the anti-HCN3 antibody, membrane proteins were isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with mHCN1, mHCN2, mHCN3, or hHCN4 as described previously (22Much B. Wahl-Schott C. Zong X. Schneider A. Baumann L. Moosmang S. Ludwig A. Biel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43781-43786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-HCN3. HEK293T cells transduced with LV-HCN3 were analyzed using the same protocol.Tissue from various mouse brain regions was dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized on dry ice using a mortar and pestle, boiled in lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris) for 10 min, and centrifuged (15 min at 16,000 × g) to remove cell debris. Proteins were separated using 7% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis according to standard procedures. The antibodies anti-HCN3 (1:2,000) and anti-tubulin (1:400; Dianova, Germany) were used.For deglycosylation, homogenates or membrane proteins were first denatured in the presence of 0.5% SDS/0,1 M 2-mercaptoethanol for 3 min at 95 °C and then incubated in 50 mm PBS/1% Nonidet P-40 and 500U of peptide/N-glycosidase F (Roche) for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis.Electrophysiology—Currents were measured 2-3 days after infection with recombinant lentivirus using whole-cell patch clamp technique. Patches were equilibrated for at least 2 min before starting experiments to minimize run down of current. The standard extracellular solution was composed of 110 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 30 mm KCl, pH = 7.4, adjusted with NaOH. When required, ivabradine (S 16257-2) and Cs+ were added to the extracellular solution by dissolving a stock 10 mm solution to the final 30 μm and a stock 1 m to the final 2 mm, respectively. The intracellular solution contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH = 7.4, adjusted with KOH. For determining the cAMP and cGMP sensitivity of HCN channels intracellular solution was supplemented with 0.5 mm cAMP or cGMP. The extracellular solutions were exchanged by a local solution exchanger. The different solutions reached the cell membrane within less than 100 ms. All recordings were obtained at room temperature. Data were acquired at 10 kHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 8 (Axon Instruments). Voltage clamp data were stored on the computer hard disk and analyzed off-line by using Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments) and Origin (Origin Lab Corporation). For determination of the voltage of half-maximal activation (V0.5) currents were elicited by hyperpolarizing the membrane for 3 s to voltages ranging from -140 to -20 mV (in 10-mV increments) from a holding potential of -40 mV followed by a 500 ms step to -140 mV. Amplitude of tail currents, determined immediately after the disappearance of the capacitance transient, were normalized to the maximal current at -140 mV (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The data points were fitted with the Boltzmann function, (I - Imin)/(Imax - Imin) = 1/[1 - exp([Vm - V0.5]/k)], where Imin is an offset caused by a non-zero holding current, Vm is the test potential, V0.5 is the voltage of half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Time constants of channel activation (τact) of HCN2 and HCN3 channels were determined by monoexponential function fitting the current evoked during hyperpolarizing voltage pulses to appropriate voltage. As has been described earlier the initial lag in the activation of HCN channel currents was excluded from the fitting procedure (23Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For determination of contribution of instantaneous current (Iinst) to the total Ih current, the size of instantaneous as well as steady-state current elicited by a 3-s pulse to -140 mV was determined and corrected for the leak, and the amplitude of instantaneous current was normalized with respect to the amplitude of the steady-state current.Statistics—All values are given as mean ± S.E., and n is the number of experiments. An unpaired Student's t test was performed for the comparison between two groups. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSExpression of HCN3 in Mouse Heart and Brain—RT-PCR revealed that HCN3 transcripts are present in the mouse brain and heart ventricle (Fig. 1A). To study the expression levels of the channel in distinct regions of the brain we raised a polyclonal antibody against the unique C terminus of the protein. The antibody recognized a 86-kDa protein (corresponding to the theoretical Mw of mHCN3) in membrane fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with mHCN3 (Fig. 1B). This band was not observed in non-transfected cells and in cells transfected with HCN1, HCN2, or HCN4, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-HCN3 antibody (Fig. 1B). In mouse brain the antibody detected a slightly bigger protein (∼90 kDa) than in HEK293 cells transfected with mHCN3 (Fig. 1C). This size difference was because of N-linked glycosylation because it disappeared after incubation with N-glycosidase F (Fig. 1D). The expression levels of HCN3 were high in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, intermediate in amygdala and hippocampus, and low in retina and cortex (Fig. 1C). In cerebellum, HCN3 was only faintly, if at all, detectable (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the expression of HCN3 protein in heart tissue was below detection level (not shown).Fig. 1Analysis of HCN3 expression in mouse tissues. A, RT-PCR with HCN3-specific primers detects HCN3 mRNA in total mouse brain (Br) and heart ventricle (Ve); Ø indicates control reactions without cDNA. B, immunoblot with anti-HCN3 performed with membrane protein preparations of untransfected and HCN1-, HCN2-, HCN3-, or HCN4-transfected HEK293 cells (16 μg of protein/lane). C, Western blot of homogenates from mouse retina (Re), olfactory bulb (Ob), amygdala (Am), hippocampus (Hi), cortex (Cx), hypothalamus (Hy), and cerebellum (Ce) (top panel). 55 μg of protein was loaded per lane except for cerebellum (110 μg). In the first lane, membrane fractions of HCN3-expressing HEK293 cells (20 μg) were loaded as a positive control. The same blot probed with anti-tubulin antibody (bottom panel). D, analysis of N-linked glycosylation. Homogenates from mouse olfactory bulb (100 μg) and membrane fractions of HCN3-expressing HEK293 cells (40 μg; HCN3) were incubated for 1 h in the presence (+) or in the absence (Ø) of peptide/N-deglycosylase F (PNG-F). Proteins were then analyzed by immunoblot with anti-HCN3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lentiviral Expression of HCN3 in HEK293T Cells—In previous attempts using chemical transfection methods only a small percentage of cells exhibited Ih, with current densities too low for a detailed biophysical analysis. To circumvent this problem we made use of a state-of-the-art lentiviral expression system (21Pfeifer A. Brandon E.P. Kootstra N. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11450-11455Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The vector design allows the coexpression of the gene of interest together with EGFP (via an IRES sequence) to facilitate the screening of the positive cells. Fig. 2A shows an example of HEK293T cells infected with LV-HCN3. About 30% of the cells revealed green fluorescence. The successful expression of the HCN3 protein was confirmed by Western blot. When a membrane preparation from infected cells was used, a specific band of ∼86 kDa was observed, corresponding to the non-glycosylated HCN3 protein (Fig. 2B).HCN3 Encodes a Hyperpolarization-activated Current with Slow Kinetics—EGFP-positive cells were used for electrophysiological analysis. HCN3 currents were compared in side-by-side experiments with Ih from HEK293T cells infected with a lentiviral HCN2 expression vector. The current density obtained for HCN3 was approximately five times smaller than the current density in HCN2-expressing cells (27 ± 5 pA/pF, n = 29 for HCN3 versus 139 ± 26 pA/pF, n = 26 for HCN2). Fig. 3, A and B show representative whole-cell current traces elicited by a family of hyperpolarizing steps from a holding potential of -40 mV. Both currents are composed of a fast Iinst and a slowly activating sigmoidal component. The relative amplitude of the Iinst was consistently larger in HCN3 (13 ± 2% of total current, n = 19) than in HCN2 (5.0 ± 0.7%, n = 20). HCN3 activated and deactivated with significantly slower kinetics than HCN2. The activation time constants at a fully activating membrane potential (-140 mV) were τact = 470 ± 30 ms (n = 13) for HCN3 and τact = 330 ± 30 ms (n = 9) for HCN2. By contrast, HCN2 and HCN3 did not differ from each other, with respect to their voltage of half-maximal activation (V0.5 = -95 mV, Fig. 3D). In addition, the reversal potential obtained from the I-V curve of the fully activated channel was not different between the two channels (-27 mV, data not shown) indicating that both channels share the same ion selectivity.Fig. 3Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of HCN3 and HCN2 overexpressed in HEK293T cells using lentiviral vectors. A and B, family of current traces of HCN3 (A) and HCN2 (B) elicited by stepping from a holding potential of -40 mV to hyperpolarizing voltages from -140 to -20 mV for 3 s; followed by a 500-ms step to -140 mV. C, voltage dependence of activation time constant τact for HCN3 (•) and HCN2 (○). D, I-V characteristics of HCN3 (•) and HCN2 (○) as derived from the tail current analysis of currents like those in A and B, respectively. Tail currents immediately after the disappearance of the capacitance transient (arrow) were normalized to maximal current at -140 mV (Imax) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. Solid lines are fits to the Boltzmann function. The fitting parameters were obtained as follows: HCN3, V0.5 = -95 ± 1 mV; k = 9.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 18); HCN2, V0.5 = -95 ± 1 mV; k = 7 ± 1 mV (n = 13).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HCN3 currents revealed the typical pharmacological profile of native and heterologously expressed Ih channels. The channel was readily blocked by 2 mm extracellular Cs+ (Fig. 4A). Likewise, the bradycardic drug ivabradine (6Bois P. Bescond J. Renaudon B. Lenfant J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) almost completely inhibited the fully activated current at a concentration of 30 μm. This concentration was used previously to block specifically Ih in sino-atrial node cells (24Bucchi A. Baruscotti M. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Extracellular Cs+ and ivabradine block HCN3 currents.

Fig. 5, A and B show representative normalized current traces of fully activated HCN2 and HCN3 channels (at -140 mV) obtained either with control pipette solution or after perfusion with 0.5 mm cAMP. In accordance with previous studies using chemical transfection methods (25Biel M. Schneider A. Wahl C. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) cAMP speeded up the activation kinetics of HCN2 (τact (-cAMP) = 330 ± 30 ms (n = 9); τact (+cAMP) = 165 ± 7 ms (n = 12); Fig. 5E). By contrast, perfusion with 0.5 mm cAMP did not significantly alter the kinetics of the HCN3 current (τact (-cAMP) = 470 ± 30 ms (n = 13); τact (+cAMP) = 510 ± 30 ms (n = 11)). Cyclic AMP shifts the voltage dependence of all HCN channels characterized so far to more depolarized potentials. Indeed, the voltage curve of lentivirally expressed HCN2 was about +10 mV more positive in the presence than in the absence of cAMP (V0.5 = -95 ± 1 mV versus -85 ± 1 mV (n = 13 and 9, respectively); Fig. 5F). Interestingly, the effect of cAMP on the HCN3 activation curves (Fig. 5D) was profoundly different from that on HCN2 (Fig. 5C). cAMP reduced the steepness of the I-V curve (k (-cAMP) = 9.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 18); k (+cAMP) = 11.8 ± 0.7 mV (n = 15)). As a consequence, the half-maximal activation potential was slightly but significantly shifted to more negative values (V0.5 = -95 ± 1 mV versus -100 ± 2 mV (n = 18 and 15, respectively); p < 0.05; Fig. 5F).Fig. 5Modulation of HCN2 and HCN3 current by cAMP. A and B, normalized current traces of HCN2 (A) and HCN3 (B) in the absence and presence of 0.5 mm intracellular cAMP. Currents were evoked by a hyperpolarizing step to -140 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV. The leak current was subtracted. C and D, activation curves of HCN2 (C) and HCN3 (D) in the absence (•) and presence (○) of cAMP. Solid lines represent fit to the Boltzmann function. Parameters in the presence of cAMP are as follows: HCN2, V0.5 = -85 ± 1 mV; k = 8 ± 1 mV (n = 9); HCN3, V0.5 = -100 ± 2 mV; k = 11.8 ± 0.7 mV (n = 15). For fitting parameter in the absence of cAMP see Fig. 3. E, activation constants of the fully activated channels obtained at -140 mV (τact-140). HCN3, τact-140 = 470 ± 30 ms and 510 ± 30 ms in the absence (n = 13) and presence (n = 11) of cAMP, respectively; HCN2, τact-140 = 330 ± 30 ms and 165 ± 7 ms in the absence (n = 9) and presence (n = 12) of cAMP, respectively.

Intracellular application of 0.5 mm cGMP did not significantly alter the kinetics of the fully activated HCN3 current (τact (-cGMP) = 470 ± 30 ms (n = 13); τact (+cGMP) = 520 ± 50 ms (n = 17) at -140 mV; Fig. 6A). At less hyperpolarizing conditions cGMP tended to slow down HCN3 current kinetics (Fig. 6B). However, this effect was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In the presence of cAMP the same behavior was observed (data not shown). Like cAMP, cGMP shifted the voltage dependence of HCN3 activation slightly to more negative values (V0.5 = -95 ± 1 mV versus -101 ± 1 mV (n = 18 and 17 in the absence and presence of cGMP, respectively); Fig. 6C). This effect was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and resulted from the change in the steepness of the I-V curve (k (-cGMP) = 9.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 18); k (+cGMP) = 11.3 ± 0.6 mV (n = 17)).Fig. 6Modulation of HCN3 current by cGMP.

Because the voltage dependence of HCN2 activation determined in our study was entirely consistent with previous data on that channel the unique behavior of HCN3 was genuine and not an artifact resulting from the lentiviral expression system used.DISCUSSIONOur knowledge of the HCN channel family has increased dramatically since the first cloning of the channels 7 years ago (20Ludwig A.

https://openalex.org/W2144728460,"High-resolution inelastic neutron scattering was used to identify major sources of low-frequency vibrations in zeolite crystals. Dispersed and nondispersed modes were found, both of which are prominent in the early stages of compressive amorphization but decline dramatically in strength once a glass of conventional density is created. By identifying the dispersed modes with the characteristic vibrations of the various secondary building units of zeolitic structures, the Boson peak, a characteristic of the glassy state, can be attributed to vibrations within connected rings of many different sizes. The nondispersed phonon features in zeolites, retained in the amorphized glass, were also replicated in silica. These modes are librational in origin and are responsible for destabilizing the microporous crystalline structure, for converting the resulting glass from a low- to a high-density phase, and for the associated changes in network topology that affect the Boson peak."
https://openalex.org/W1999738453,"Anti-GD2 ganglioside antibodies could be a promising, novel therapeutic approach to the eradication of human small cell lung cancers, as anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) induced apoptosis of small cell lung cancer cells in culture. In this study, we analyzed the mechanisms for the apoptosis of these cells by anti-GD2 mAbs and elucidated the mechanisms by which apoptosis signals were transduced via reduction in the phosphorylation levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the activation of a MAPK family member, p38, upon the antibody binding. Knock down of FAK resulted in apoptosis and p38 activation. The inhibition of p38 activity blocked antibody-induced apoptosis, indicating that p38 is involved in this process. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting analysis of immune precipitates with anti-FAK or anti-integrin antibodies using an anti-GD2 mAb revealed that GD2 could be precipitated with integrin and/or FAK. These results suggested that GD2, integrin, and FAK form a huge molecular complex across the plasma membrane. Taken together with the fact that GD2+ cells showed marked detachment from the plate during apoptosis, GD2+ small cell lung cancer cells seemed to undergo anoikis through the conformational changes of integrin molecules and subsequent FAK dephosphorylation.

Gangliosides have been considered to be tumor markers of neuroectoderm-derived human cancers, such as malignant melanomas, neuroblastomas, and gliomas (1Lloyd K.O. Old L.J.

They have been used as target molecules in antibody therapy, i.e. GD3 in malignant melanomas (3Houghton A.N. Mintzer D. Cordon-Cardo C. Welt S. Fliegel B. Vadhan S. Carswell E. Melamed M.R.

In the extended analysis of ganglioside expression in other human cancer cells, we have demonstrated the characteristic expression of GD2 in human T lymphotropic virus type I-infected T lymphocytes (5Furukawa K. Akagi T. Nagata Y. Yamada Y. Shimotohno K. Cheung N.K. Shiku H. Furukawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In many of these studies, no clear implication of individual gangliosides have been elucidated, except that GD2 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 1The abbreviations used are: SCLC, small cell lung cancer; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-tetrazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; siRNA(s), small interfering RNA(s); MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. was shown to induce increased cell growth and invasion using the transfectant cells with GD3 synthase cDNA (7Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could suppress the cell proliferation of GD2+ SCLC cells and also induce apoptosis with caspase activation. These results indicated that antibody therapy might be a promising approach to overcoming the disastrous disease SCLC. As for the tumor cell apoptosis with anti-ganglioside antibodies, a few studies have been reported. Hanai and co-workers (8Nakamura K. Hanibuchi M. Yano S. Tanaka Y. Fujino I. Inoue M. Takezawa T. Shitara K. Sone S. Hanai N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5323-5330PubMed Google Scholar) report apoptosis induction of melanoma cells with anti-GM2 mAb in multicellular heterospheroids. On the other hand, in neuronal tissues, anti-ganglioside antibodies often cause tissue damage mainly in the motor neuron system and trigger serious motor neuron paralysis, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (9Willison H.J. Yuki N. Brain. 2000; 125: 2591-2625Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that gangliosides on malignant tumor cells can be good targets of antibody therapy with mAbs or their modified forms, although not many examples of apoptosis induction with anti-ganglioside mAbs have been reported so far. To clarify the possibility of therapeutic application of anti-ganglioside mAbs for malignant tumors, molecular mechanisms for the apoptosis of SCLC cells with anti-GD2 ganglioside were studied. The most intriguing issue in understanding the apoptosis signals triggered by an antibody binding to gangliosides express on the cell surface membrane is how the events outside of the cells can induce the sequential activation of molecules involved in the apoptotic pathway inside of the cells. Here we have demonstrated a whole feature of the signaling pathway for apoptosis triggered by anti-GD2 mAbs leading to apoptotic cell death. Cell Lines—A GD3 synthase gene transfectant cell line, D-18, and a vector control cell line, C-2, were generated from SK-LC-17 in our laboratory (7Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and G418 (250 μg/ml) in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Other SCLC cell lines, NCI-417, ACC-LC-171, and ACC-LC-96 were as described previously (7Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody Purification—The anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 220-51 (mouse IgG3), which was generated in our laboratory (10Fukuda M. Horibe K. Furukawa K. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 2: 471-475PubMed Google Scholar), was purified using a protein G affinity column, and the concentration of the protein was determined by Lowry's method (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of ganglioside GD2 was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) using an anti-GD2 mAb, 220-51. Cells were incubated with mAbs for 60 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (ICN/Cappel, Durham, NC). Control cells for flow cytometry were prepared using the second antibody alone. MTT Assay—For cell proliferation assay, transfectant cells and control cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were prepared in 48-well plates (CellStar, Carrollton, TX) in serum-containing medium and cultured for 4 days. For cell growth inhibition assay, transfectant cells and control cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates (CellStar) in serum-containing medium and treated with anti-GD2 mAb 220-51 diluted to the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Freshly prepared medium containing antibodies was used for medium exchange everyday. To quantify the cell proliferation, MTT (Sigma) was added to each well (0.5 mg/ml). After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the supernatants were aspirated, and 100 μl of n-propyl alcohol containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 4 mm HCl were added. The color reaction was quantitated using an automatic plate reader, Immuno-Mini NJ-2300 (Nihon InterMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 590 nm with a reference filter of 620 nm, as reported previously (12Mitsuda T. Furukawa K. Fukumoto S. Miyazaki H. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11239-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). MTT assays were carried out in triplicate. To analyze the growth suppression effects of mAb 220-51 in the transfectants, cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were prepared in 24-well plates in serum-containing medium and treated with 0-60 μg/ml of mAb 220-51 for 24 h and then counted with trypan blue. Analysis of Apoptosis—Cells (1 × 106 cells) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates (CellStar) in serum-containing medium and then treated with 60 μg/ml mAb 220-51 for 2 h at 37 °C. After the treatment, the cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) and then incubated with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) (Annexin V-FITC kit; Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The numbers of apoptotic cells were monitored with flow cytometry. DNA Fragmentation Assay—Cells (1 × 106 cells) were treated with 60 μg/ml mAb 220-51. After 42 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in 100 μl of a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and 6 μl of RNase (10 mg/ml) and 6 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the fragmented DNA was precipitated in 2-propanol (360 μl) and electrophoresed at 50 V for 1.6 h on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was observed under UV light. Western Immunoblotting—For the antibody stimulation experiments, cells (8 × 105 cells) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium and then treated with 60 μg/ml mAb 220-51 for the appropriate times in the individual experiments. After treatment, the cells were harvested with 0.02% EDTA, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 20 units of aprotinin). Soluble proteins (50 μg/lane) were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and then incubated with antibodies reactive with p38, phospho-p38 (Tyr-180/Tyr-182, rabbit anti-human p38 mitogen-activated protein polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), and β-actin (mouse monoclonal anti-mouse β-actin; Sigma). Bands were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or anti-mouse IgG (anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked whole antibody from sheep; Amersham Biosciences) combined with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with 5 μl of anti-FAK (1 μg IgG) (rabbit polyclonal anti-human FAK; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight, and then 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1) (Amersham Biosciences) was added and incubated for 3 h at 4°C. After being washed with immunoprecipitation washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4), the precipitates were solubilized in 50 μl of lysis buffer, and 20 μl was subjected to immunoblotting, as described above. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, mouse monoclonal IgG2b; BD Biosciences) or anti-FAK antibody was used for the immunoblotting, as described above. Co-precipitation Experiments—To analyze the co-precipitation of FAK and integrin, cells (2 × 106) were solubilized in 50 μl of the lysis buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated separately with 5 μl (1 μg of IgG) of anti-FAK or anti-integrin β1 (rabbit polyclonal anti-human integrin β1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) following the methods described under “Western Immunoblotting.” The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described above. An antibody against integrin β1 was used in the immunoblotting combined with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling) as a second antibody. To examine the co-precipitation of GD2 with FAK and integrin, 2 × 107 cells were solubilized in 100 μl of the lysis buffer and were immunoprecipitated separately with 5 μl (1 μg of IgG) of anti-FAK, anti-integrin β1, or normal rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described above. mAb 220-51 was used at a dilution of 1:100 in the immunoblotting combined with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as a second antibody. Knock Down of FAK—To suppress FAK expression, we prepared five kinds of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). siRNA duplexes were directed toward the following mRNA targets (nucleotide 1 is A of ATG): nucleotides 510-531, 5′-AAG UUG GGU UGU CUA GAA AUA-3′; nucleotides 920-941, 5′-AAG UGA AGA CAA GGA CAG AAA-3′; nucleotides 1011-1032, 5′-AAG GAG AAU AUG GCU GAC CUA-3′; nucleotides 2030-2051, 5′-AAG CAC AAU CCU GGA GGA AGA-3′; nucleotides 2307-2328, 5′-AAC CAA ACA GAU UCA UGG AAU-3′. Fluorescein-labeled luciferase GL2 Duplex (DHARMACOM RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO) was used as a control. The double-stranded RNAs were introduced into the cells with Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. The cells were used after 48 h for immunoblotting of total FAK protein and for apoptosis induction experiments. p38 Inhibition—p38 activity was inhibited via exposure to SB203580 (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) and diluted to the indicated concentrations from 0 to 100 μm for 24 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of the Me2SO vehicle (1%) was used as a control. Inhibition was confirmed by the suppression of p38 phosphorylation after UV light exposure (100 J/m2) with immunoblotting of phospho-p38 as well as p38 and β-actin. Cells with ∼70% inhibition of p38 phosphorylation were used in the experiment for apoptosis induction. GD2 Expression in the Transfectant Cells and SCLC Cell Lines—It was known that the GD3 synthase gene was highly expressed in the SCLC cell lines (7Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). The GM2/GD2 synthase gene was broadly expressed in the majority of lung cancer cell lines examined, whereas SCLC lines showed slightly higher expression levels. The transfection of GD3 synthase cDNA can, therefore, induce GD2 expression, as shown in Fig. 1A. D-18 was generated by the transfection of GD3 synthase cDNA into SK-LC-17. GD2 expression was also detected in three SCLC cell lines at slightly lower levels than D-18 (Fig. 1B). Suppression of Cell Growth by Anti-GD2 Antibodies—The effects of anti-GD2 mAbs on cell growth were then examined by adding antibodies to the culture medium. The increased cell growth after GD3 synthase gene transfection was strongly suppressed in the presence of an anti-GD2 mAb 220-51. The suppression effects were dependent on the concentration of the added antibody and were significant even at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis Induction by Anti-GD2 mAbs—To examine the induction of apoptosis during the growth suppression of SCLC cell lines with anti-GD2 mAb, double staining of cells with Annexin V (FITC) and propidium iodide was performed. A transfectant line treated with anti-GD2 mAb was 38.7% positive for Annexin V binding at 2 h after the addition of the mAb (Fig. 2B), indicating the induction of apoptotic cell death. The vector control line C-2 showed no staining for both reagents. Three SCLC cell lines expressing GD2 treated with anti-GD2 mAb were also positive for Annexin V and/or propidium iodide (Fig. 2B), indicating that the native GD2-expressant cells are also sensitive to apoptosis induction. To confirm the DNA degradation in the anti-GD2 mAb-treated cells, cytoplasmic DNA was prepared from 1 × 106 cells and used for agarose gel electrophoresis. Only D-18 cells treated with the mAb showed definite DNA ladder formation (Fig. 2C), suggesting that apoptosis was really induced by the anti-GD2 mAb. The transfectant cells treated with anti-GD2 mAb showed marked shrinkage of cytoplasm and formation of spaces between cells, whereas vector control cells showed no change in morphology (Fig. 2D). As for the native GD2-expressant cell lines, similar morphological changes were observed (Fig. 2D), although the changes were less obvious due to their original morphology. Phosphorylation of MAPKs, ERK1/2, and p38 after Addition of the Antibody—For the antibody stimulation experiments, cells (8 × 105) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium and then treated with 60 μg/ml mAb 220-51 for the appropriate times in the individual experiments. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was reduced from 240 min after the addition of the antibody in GD2-expressing D-18 (but not in the vector control cells) (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of p38 was induced from 120 min after the addition of the antibody in GD2-expressing D-18 (but not in the vector control cells) (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of p38 was also examined in a native GD2-expressant line, ACC-LC-171, and a very similar activation pattern of p38 was observed (Fig. 3C). Phosphorylation of FAK after Addition of the Antibody—Cells (8 × 105) were plated in 60-mm tissue culture plates in serum-containing medium and then treated with 60 μg/ml of mAb 220-51 for the appropriate times in the individual experiments. The lysates were incubated with anti-FAK (1 μg IgG) and immunoprecipitated and then used for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) or anti-FAK antibody. Phosphorylation of FAK was reduced along with the time of the antibody treatment from 10 min in GD2-expressing D-18, whereas no reduction in the FAK phosphorylation level was observed in vector control cells (Fig. 4A). In the case of a native GD2-expressant line, ACC-LC-171, a similar or even faster reduction of FAK phosphorylation was observed after the antibody treatment (Fig. 4B). GD2, FAK, and Integrin Formed a Complex in the Transfectant Cells—To analyze the association of GD2 with integrin or FAK, immunoprecipitates with anti-integrin or those with anti-FAK were used for immunoblotting with anti-GD2 mAb. First of all, integrin was co-precipitated with FAK, as shown in Fig. 5A. Thereafter, it was shown that GD2 was co-precipitated with FAK and/or integrin (Fig. 5B). This was also the case in the native GD2-expressant lines (Fig. 5C). Taken together, GD2 seemed to form a complex with integrin and FAK molecules across the plasma membrane. Suppression of FAK Expression Resulted in Apoptosis—Five kinds of siRNAs were prepared based on the cDNA sequence and used to suppress FAK expression. The effects were examined with immunoblotting of anti-phospho-FAK as well as anti-FAK antibodies (Fig. 6A). More than 60% of suppression in FAK expression was achieved in siRNA1-treated cells. Bands of tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK also reduced in intensity in parallel with total FAK bands. Therefore, this was used for the apoptosis induction experiment. After siRNA transfection, cells were used for an apoptosis assay by FACS. After the transfection of FAK siRNA, expression of FAK was definitely reduced, and apoptosis was found in both D-18 and C-2 cells (Fig. 6B, top panels). The apoptosis induction was also detected in two native GD2-expressant lines after the transfection of FAK siRNA (Fig. 6B, bottom panels). Phosphorylation of p38 Was Induced by the Suppression of FAK—The phosphorylation level of p38 increased by the suppression of FAK via FAK siRNA (Fig. 6C). Further increase in p38 phosphorylation was found by the addition of anti-GD2 mAb in immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38. Apoptosis Induced by Anti-GD2 mAb Was Protected with Inhibition of p38—p38 activity after UV light exposure (100 J/m2) was inhibited via pre-exposure to SB203580 at 100 μm (but not at concentrations of 50 μm or less, as determined by Western immunoblotting of phospho-p38) (Fig. 7A). After treatment with SB203580 (100 μm) or Me2SO (vehicle), cells were treated with mAb 220-51 (60 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and used for apoptosis assay by FACS. Apoptosis in D-18 was almost completely protected by SB203580 treatment (Fig. 7B, right panels). In the vector control cells, no apoptosis was induced by anti-GD2 mAb regardless of SB203580 treatment (Fig. 7B, left panels). As for the native GD2-expressant lines, both of the two cell lines examined showed marked suppression of apoptosis by SB203580 treatment (Fig. 7C). SB203580 Showed No Effect on the Phosphorylation Levels of FAK—The effects of p38 inhibition with SB203580 on the phosphorylation levels of FAK was examined by immunoblotting. It was shown that SB203580 had almost no effect on the phosphorylation levels of FAK, suggesting that p38 was positioned at the downstream of FAK in the apoptosis signaling pathway (Fig. 8). Apoptosis Signaling Pathway Triggered by Anti-GD2 mAbs—An apoptosis signaling pathway triggered by anti-GD2 mAbs was proposed based on the results demonstrated in this study in Fig. 9. It is unusual that only an antibody binding to a surface molecule can induce apoptotic cell death, except for anti-Fas antibodies, which bind the Fas antigen associated with sequential death signaling molecules, such as FADD (13Thorburn A. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 14Wajant H. Science. 2002; 296: 1635-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). On the other hand, gangliosides are embedded in the outer layer of the plasma membrane, and there appears to be difficulty in transmitting signals from outside the cell into the cell nucleus. Therefore, we need to consider a quite novel mechanism for apoptosis induced via gangliosides. Although Cheresh et al. (15Cheresh D.A. Klier F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) already report the cell rounding and detachment of melanoma cells from fibronectin substrate with anti-GD2 mAbs, we demonstrated in this study that the apoptosis of SCLC cells induced with anti-GD2 mAbs was caused by dephosphorylation of FAK with various results, i.e. reduction of phosphorylated FAK and morphological changes of GD2+ cells after the treatment with anti-GD2 mAbs and apoptosis induction with knock down of FAK. The formation of spaces between cells under antibody treatment seemed to be caused by the detachment of apoptotic cells. However, the precise cause of the cell shrinkage that simultaneously occurred (probably due to detachment) remains to be clarified. Apoptosis induced with disruption of cell-matrix interaction has been called “anoikis” (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic or anti-anoikis activity of FAK has been reported by a number of studies using overexpression of wild type FAK (17Kurenova E. Xu L.H. Yang X. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Hanks S.K. Liu Z.G. Cance W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), introduction of the constitutively activated form of FAK (18Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), or enforced activation of β1 integrin (19Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for these anti-apoptotic activities of FAK include its binding to a death domain of receptor-interacting protein, augmentation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85), phosphorylation, and Akt activity. Interestingly, FAK phosphorylation is also critical in the protection of apoptosis induced with ultraviolet irradiation (20Chan P.C. Lai J.F. Cheng C.H. Tang M.J. Chiu C.C. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, FAK induces resistance to apoptosis induced with hydrogen peroxide in glioma cells (21Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and even in a leukemia cell line (HL-60) (22Sonoda Y. Matsumoto Y. Funakoshi M. Yamamoto D. Hanks S.K. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In turn, apoptosis induction with disruption of FAK has also been reported using a peptide of the FAK binding site of the integrin β1 tail, microinjection of anti-FAK antibody (23Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), mutated FAK at a tyrosine-phosphorylation site (24Sakurai S. Sonoda Y. Koguchi E. Shinoura N. Hamada H. Kasahara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal domain of FAK (25Beviglia L. Golubovskaya V. Xu L. Yang X. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All of these results indicate that the activation levels of FAK are considered to be a crucial and universal factor in determining the fates of those cells treated with preapoptotic stresses in both monolayer cells and suspension cells. In addition to the dephosphorylation of FAK, increased phosphorylation of p38 was one more conspicuous change during the apoptosis induction. The signaling pathway between FAK dephosphorylation and p38 activation is not known at this moment. In the previous report, we have found that JNK activation was observed at 6 h after anti-GD2 antibody treatment (26Yoshida S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2002; 93: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, activation of another MAPK, p38, could be detected at a much earlier time, suggesting p38 is primarily involved in the apoptosis induction. It has been reported that inhibition of FAK resulted in the activation of p38 and anoikis in a colon cancer cell line (27Walsh M.F. Thamilselvan V. Grotelueschen R. Farhana L. Basson M. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 13: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and in myotube (28Laprise P. Poirier E.M. Vezina A. Rivard N. Vachon P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether dephosphorylation of FAK causes p38 activation in a single direction. In our results, knock down of FAK induced p38 activation, and p38 inhibition failed to affect the phosphorylation levels of FAK, suggesting that p38 is located at the downstream of FAK, although the linking pathway between them remains to be investigated. Involvement of various adaptor molecules associating with FAK, such as p130Cas (29Wei L. Yang Y. Zhang X. Yu Q. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 91: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Yu H.G. Schrader H. Otte J.M. Schmidt W.E. Schmitz F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and paxillin (31Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), should be examined as intervening molecules leading to the activation of p38. The most intriguing issue in understanding the apoptotic process with anti-GD2 antibodies is how the antibody binding to gangliosides can trigger the initial signal for cell death. The fact that GD2 was physically associated with integrins (Fig. 5) strongly suggested that the antibody binding to GD2 causes conformational changes in integrin molecules, leading to the dephosphorylation of FAK, because integrins and FAK had been known to be tightly associated in both physical and functional senses (32Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The formation of a tertiary complex consisting of GD2, integrin, and FAK seemed to be a critical substantial basis to generate and/or maintain the malignant properties of SCLC cells (7Yoshida S. Fukumoto S. Kawaguchi H. Sato S. Ueda R. Furukawa K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). Insults destroying the intact form of the molecular complex might, therefore, result in the reduction of FAK-mediated anti-anoikis signals with its dephosphorylation. Functional modulation of integrins by the expression of glycosphingolipids was previously suggested by Cheresh et al. (33Cheresh D.A. Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Klier F.G. Ruoslahti E. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and our group (34Chen H.H. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Nakao A. Akiyama S. Urano T. Furukawa K. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using human melanoma cells and murine lung cancer cells, respectively. Although gangliosides have been considered to be tumor-associated molecules and have been used as tumor markers, no clear and specific biological function in the malignant properties of human cancer cells have been elucidated. Colocalization of GD2/GD3 gangliosides at the adhesion plaque of melanoma cells was reported by Cheresh et al. (35Cheresh D.A. Harper J.R. Schulz G. Reisfeld R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). At that time, they demonstrated that these disialo-gangliosides were involved in the adhesion of melanoma cells to the extracellular matrix (15Cheresh D.A. Klier F.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1887-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Cheresh D.A. Pierschbacher M.D. Herzig M.A. Mujoo K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 688-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The critical effects of a peptide containing the ECM binding motif of integrins in the ganglioside-associated adhesion was also shown (33Cheresh D.A. Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Klier F.G. Ruoslahti E. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), indicating that disialo-gangliosides are functionally involved in the cell adhesion mediated by the interaction between integrins and the extracellular matrix. Burns et al. (37Burns G.F. Lucas C.M. Krissansen G.W. Werkmeister J.A. Scanlon D.B. Simpson R.J. Vadas M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) also reported synergism between gangliosides and Arg-Gly-Asp-directed glycoprotein receptors in attachment to the matrix protein by melanoma cells, whereas Kojima and Hakomori (38Kojima N. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) interpreted the synergism as the result of a combination of two cell recognition systems, i.e. interaction of glycosphingolipid-glycosphingolipid and that of adhesive matrix protein-integrin. The mechanisms and implication of the interaction of gangliosides with integrin molecules on the cell surface is not well understood. Wang et al. (39Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44504-44511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) report that GT1b induced apoptosis of SCC12 cells by binding to integrin α5β1 and the resultant inhibition of the integrin-linked kinase/protein kinase B/Akt pathway. They also report that GM3 blocks epidermal growth factor receptor activation induced by disrupting the association of integrin β1 with the epidermal growth factor receptor (40Wang X.Q. Sun P. Paller A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48770-48778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). They raised the possibility of the modification of caveolin-1 with GM3 as a mechanism, but no evidences were demonstrated. Kawakami et al. (41Kawakami Y. Kawakami K. Steelant W.F. Ono M. Baek R.C. Handa K. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34349-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) also report the promotion of interaction between tetraspanin CD9 and α3 integrin in microdomain with GM3, leading to inhibition of laminin-5-dependent cell motility. This regulation seems to be based on the modified organizational status of the glycolipid-enriched microdomain with glycosylation status. Actually, alteration of glycosylation in glycolipids affects intracellular localization of integrin, Src, and caveolin into or out of the glycolipid-enriched microdomain (42Kazui A. Ono M. Handa K. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Many of these studies indicate that gangliosides suppress integrin functions in cell adhesion, and mainly monosialyl gangliosides have been analyzed in those studies. However, many so-called “cancer-associated glycolipids” are polysialo compounds, as described in the Introduction. Therefore, modes of interaction with integrin and resulting effects should be different depending whether the glycolipids are monosialyl or polysialyl structures. In previous studies, direct interaction between gangliosides and integrin has never been clearly demonstrated, although the possibility that GD2 associates with integrins was suggested by Cheresh et al. (33Cheresh D.A. Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Klier F.G. Ruoslahti E. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) on the basis of their co-purification with an affinity column containing either an Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptide, concanavalin A, or lentil lectin. However, actual molecular interaction has never been demonstrated. Results in this study elucidated, at least partly, the molecular association of GD2 with a membrane-penetrating molecule and an intracellular kinase molecule, i.e. GD2/integrin/FAK, although it is not yet clear whether the interaction between GD2 and integrins is direct or indirect. Precise modes of interaction between polysialo gangliosides and integrins should be clarified with more effective approaches, such as cross-linking, to further understand the mechanisms for apoptosis with anti-ganglioside mAbs. Whatever the mechanisms are, the fact that not only GD2-overexpressing cells but native GD2-expressant SCLC cell lines underwent equivalent degrees of apoptosis with anti-GD2 mAb strongly encourages us to apply the antibody therapy for the treatment of SCLC patients. The ganglioside nomenclature followed was that of Svennerholm (43Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). We thank M.

https://openalex.org/W2015012123,"GIT1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1) has been shown to regulate focal adhesion disassembly. We previously reported that GIT1 associates with MEK1 and acts as a scaffold to enhance ERK1/2 activation. Here, we show that GIT1 co-localizes with ERK1/2 in focal adhesions and regulates cell migration in vascular smooth muscle cells, HEK293 cells, and HeLa cells. Immunofluorescence showed that GIT1 co-localized with phospho-ERK1/2 in focal adhesions after epidermal growth factor stimulation. Because Src is required for both GIT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and focal adhesion disassembly, we studied the effects of Src on GIT1-ERK1/2 interactions. PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) inhibited association of GIT1 with ERK1/2, and their co-localization in focal adhesions was dramatically decreased in SYF–/– cells. GIT1 small interfering RNA significantly inhibited ERK1/2 recruitment to and activation in focal adhesions. GIT1 small interfering RNA and mutated GIT1 lacking the MEK1 binding domain significantly decreased epidermal growth factor-stimulated cell spreading and migration, suggesting that GIT1-mediated events such as ERK1/2 activation are required for spreading and migration. In summary, the present study further supports a key role for GIT1 (a MEK1-binding protein) as a scaffold for signal transduction in focal adhesions.

Cell motility requires coordinated temporal and spatial regulation of cell extension, adhesion, deadhesion, and contraction. The epidermal growth factor receptor is a model transmembrane tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor that mediates cell migration as one of its many cell effects. It has been suggested that such specific cellular responses are determined by the spatial targeting of downstream signaling events. This simple concept is complicated by the fact that epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated cell motility requires signaling through the ubiquitous intracellular kinases ERK1/2, 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phospho-ERK; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; CC, coiled-coil; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; Mab, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; PIX, PAK-interacting exchange factor; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; pERK, phospho-ERK; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; CC, coiled-coil; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RNAi, RNA interference; Mab, monoclonal antibody; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; PIX, PAK-interacting exchange factor; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine. which are present in several compartments including cell membrane, focal adhesions, and nucleus (1Glading A.

Furthermore, Src-induced formation of the calpain·FAK·ERK1/2 complex and ERK1/2 activation are required for calpain-mediated proteolysis of FAK (3Carragher N.O. Westhoff M.A. Fincham V.J.

Evidence shows that ERK1/2 enhances cell migration via regulation of myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphorylation (4Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P.

However, little is currently known about the mechanisms that regulate spatial organization of ERK1/2 required for cell migration. GIT1 (also termed Cat-1 for Cool (cloned out of library)-associated tyrosine phosphorylation protein) was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that bound G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) (6Premont R.T.

Initial results demonstrated that GIT1 functions as a GTPase-activating protein for the ADP-ribosylation factor family of proteins. The two GIT family members (GIT1 and GIT2 (also termed PKL)) have been shown to have important roles in receptor endocytosis (6Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A.

The SHD-1 domain is named for the yeast SpaII homology domain and spans amino acids 255–365. A linker of unknown function connects the amino terminus to several coiled-coil (CC) domains in the carboxyl terminus. There are three putative CC domains in GIT1: CC1 (residues 254–274), CC2 (residues 426–474), and CC3 (residues 659–689). GIT1 associates with many proteins including CC2 domain interactions with PAK (11Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S.

Specifically, these authors propose that upon cell activation, Cdc42 recruitment of PAK and PIX drives association of GIT1 with focal adhesions. This favors dissociation of paxillin, which destabilizes focal adhesions, and promotes motility by decreasing cell adherence. The association of GIT1 with PIX, PAK, and paxillin suggests a functional role in the regulation of cytoskeleton and focal adhesions (10Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The SHD domain in the yeast SpaII protein promotes polarized morphogenesis in yeast through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and a polarity signaling pathway (16van Drogen F. Peter M. Curr.

Here, we provide evidence that GIT1 associates with ERK1/2 in focal adhesions and recruits additional ERK1/2 to focal adhesions after EGF stimulation via a Src-dependent pathway that stimulates cell migration. Cell Culture—Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) prepared as described previously (17Melaragno M.G. Wuthrich D.A. Poppa V. Gill D. Lindner V. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ.

We compared three different RNAi sequences based on our previous publication (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We used construct 3, oligonucleotides 3A (5-CTC-CAG-GTA-CTC-CTG-CAG-CGT-CAC-AGC-CGA-AGC-TTG-GGC-TGT-GGC-GTT-GTA-GGA-GTA-CTT-GGA-GCT-GTT-TTT-T-3) and 3B (5-GAT-CAA-AAA-ACA-GCT-CCA-AGT-ACT-CCT-ACA-ACG-CCA-CAG-CCC-AAG-CTT-CGG-CTG-TGA-CGC-TGC-AGG-AGT-ACC-TGG-AGC-G-3), for the adenovirus described here. Yeast—GIT1-RNAi and GFP-RNAi (control) were cloned into the pCFP-N3 using EcoO1091 (CFP-GIT1-RNAi and CFP-GFP-RNAi). GIT1-RNAi was cloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pEntr/DTOPO (Invitrogen) and then recombined with this vector and pAd/PL-DEST (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was transformed into a suitable Escherichia coli host to select for the correct clone. Next, pAd/PL-DEST was transfected into HEK293 cells. After homologous recombination in vivo, plaques resulting from viral cytopathic effects were selected and expanded in HEK293 cells. Virus was purified, and virus titer was determined. GFP-RNAi is a control vector for GIT1-RNAi. The adenovirus expressing GFP-RNAi was a kind gift from Joe Miano (University of Rochester). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—GST monoclonal antibody (Mab), MEK1, and ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). GIT1 antibody (Mab) was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. GIT1 antibody (polyclonal antibody) was obtained from Erik Shaefer BioSource International. FLAG M2 and HA Mabs were received from Sigma. pERK1/2 Mab was purchased from Sigma. pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) and Promega. ERK1/2 Mabs for immunofluorescence were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. company (1:200). For immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Analysis of exposed film after immunoblotting was performed by scanning densitometry and processed with NIH Image. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-GIT1-(WT) or pcDNA3.1 with HA-ERK2 by Lipofectamine. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sonication at 50 kHz for 6 s, cell lysates were centrifuged (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Approximately 500 μg of precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated by 2 μg of HA antibody and mouse IgG. They were then separated and probed with FLAG and HA antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by ECL technique. Cell Fractionation—Confluent HEK293 cells from 100-mm dishes transfected with the indicated cDNAs were collected and homogenized in TEEND buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with protease inhibitors. Samples were spun at 6000 × g for 10 min, homogenized, and then spun again. The supernatant from this spin was aspirated and re-spun at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant fraction, representing cytosolic components, was set aside, and the pellet was resuspended in NaCl/sucrose buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium azide, 20 mm Tris base (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets) containing the nonionic detergent IGEPAL CA-630 (1%, similar to Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 2700 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant contained membrane proteins. The pellet contained cytoskeletal proteins. Protein concentrations of each fraction were determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were starved with serum-free DMEM overnight and then stimulated with EGF. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton for 5 min, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. Cells were incubated with pERK1/2, GIT1, and paxillin antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline followed by Alexa Fluor 546 anti-goat, mouse, or rabbit IgG (H+L) for red fluorescence or by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse or rabbit (H+L) for green fluorescence (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline at a final concentration of 1.5–2 μg/ml each. Chemotaxis Assays—For the Boyden chamber assay, VSMCs or HeLa cells were infected with GIT1-RNAi or GFP-RNAi adenovirus for 8 h and then changed to normal medium for 24 h. Cells were starved overnight, suspended, and seeded (50 μl containing 105 cells) in the upper chamber on collagen-precoated polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membrane. Control medium (DMEM/0.5% fetal calf serum) or EGF medium (DMEM/0.5% fetal calf serum containing 20 ng/ml EGF) in 30 μl was placed in the lower chamber. After incubation at 37 °C and 95% air/5% CO2 for 6 h, cells attached to the lower side were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and then stained for 30 min in 0.1% cresyl violet. Co-localization of pERK1/2 with GIT1 in Focal Adhesions—An important role for GIT1 family members in focal adhesions has been shown by several laboratories (10Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 14Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat.

Our laboratory found that GIT1 translocates to focal adhesions and that GIT1 interacts with MEK1 in VSMCs and HeLa cells (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Natarajan K. Yin G. Hoefen R.J. Osawa M. Haendeler J. Ridley A.J. Fujiwara K. van Hinsbergh V. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent work has suggested that MEK1 and ERK1/2 co-localize with paxillin after cell spreading on fibronectin and that ERK1/2 is targeted to newly formed sites of cell-matrix interaction (2Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2911-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. Catling A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To determine whether GIT1 co-localizes with pERK1/2 in focal adhesions, we used HeLa cells because they have ample endogenous GIT1, and focal adhesions can easily be observed. HeLa cells were starved overnight and then stimulated with EGF. Immunostaining for pERK1/2 revealed a low level of pERK1/2 that was diffusely present in the cytoplasm prior to EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A, a). In response to EGF, pERK1/2 translocated to focal adhesions and the nucleus within 5 min, peaking at 10 min (Fig. 1A, b and c, arrows). Treatment with 30 μm PD98059 to block MEK1 completely inhibited the appearance of pERK1/2 (data not shown). A similar effect was observed in VSMCs after EGF stimulation (data not shown). To test whether EGF causes GIT1 to redistribute to focal adhesions, HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF and stained with GIT1 antibody. GIT1 was localized in focal adhesions basally (Fig. 1A, d), and there was no significant change with EGF stimulation (Fig. 1A, e and f). To determine whether GIT1 co-localizes with pERK1/2, HeLa cells were double-stained for pERK1/2 and paxillin (Fig. 1B, a–c), pERK1/2 and vinculin (Fig. 1B, d–f), and pERK1/2 and GIT1 (Fig. 1B, g and h). After stimulation with EGF for 10 min, the punctate pERK1/2 staining pattern exactly matched the punctate staining patterns of paxillin (Fig. 1B, c), vinculin (Fig. 1B, f), and GIT1 (Fig. 1B, i). These results are consistent with recent reports showing ERK1/2 co-localization with paxillin (21Ishibe S. Joly D. Zhu X. Cantley L.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and pERK1/2 targeting to newly formed focal adhesions in fibroblasts (2Fincham V.J. James M. Frame M.C. Winder S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2911-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). GIT1 Knockdown Inhibited ERK1/2 Translocalization and Phosphorylation in Focal Adhesions—To define the functional relationship between GIT1 and ERK1/2, we studied the effect of GIT1 knockdown on pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 localization. We previously reported that GIT1 RNAi inhibited endogenous GIT1 expression by ∼85% in HeLa cells (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells transfected with GFP-RNAi (control), pERK1/2 localized to focal adhesions and the nucleus after EGF stimulation (Fig. 2b, arrows). EGF stimulation led to an increase in total ERK1/2 in focal adhesions (Fig. 2f, arrows). In contrast, localization of pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 in focal adhesions was significantly inhibited by transfection with GIT1 RNAi (Fig. 2, d and h). Importantly, localization of pERK1/2 to the nucleus was not inhibited by GIT1 knockdown (Fig. 2, d and h). These results indicate that GIT1 is important for pERK1/2 and ERK1/2 localization in focal adhesions. GIT1-RNAi did not grossly affect the structure of focal adhesions as shown by cell morphology and by paxillin and vinculin localization (Fig. 2, i–n). These data are similar to those we previously obtained for endothelial cells, in which GIT1 knockdown did not alter basal cell morphology but increased cell rounding and focal adhesion formation in response to thrombin (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Natarajan K. Yin G. Hoefen R.J. Osawa M. Haendeler J. Ridley A.J. Fujiwara K. van Hinsbergh V. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). GIT1 Is Required for ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Cytoskeletal Fractions—We previously reported that GIT1 knockdown decreased ERK1/2 activation by EGF that was most significant at 10 min (see Fig. 6 in Ref. 13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We studied the effect of GIT1 knockdown on ERK1/2 activation in the cytoskeleton fractions of HeLa cells to characterize further the specificity of GIT1 scaffolding. We have previously shown that this cell fractionation protocol enriches vinculin and FAK by 5–10-fold compared with total cell lysates. GIT1 expression was decreased by 80% with GIT1-RNAi in total cell lysates (Fig. 3A, Cytoskeleton, panel 4) with no change in vinculin expression in cytoskeletal fractions (Fig. 3A, Cytoskeleton, panel 3). Prior to EGF stimulation, there were no differences in ERK1/2, pERK1/2, or vinculin expression in cytoskeleton or cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 4). In response to EGF, pERK1/2 was significantly increased in cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic fractions at both 5 and 10 min in cells transfected with GFP-RNAi (Fig. 3A, panels 1 and 5). Quantitation showed a ∼5-fold increase (Fig. 3B). In cells transfected with GIT1-RNAi, there was a dramatic decrease in pERK1/2 only in the cytoskeleton fractions (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 5 and 6 in panel 1 to lanes 2 and 3). There was no change in pERK1/2 in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3A, panel 5). In several experiments we observed an apparent decrease in total ERK1/2 present in cytoskeleton after treatment with GIT1-RNAi (Fig. 3A, panel 2, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 1–4). Although the mechanism is unclear, the most likely explanation is increased ERK1/2 in nuclear fractions because we saw no change in cytoplasmic (Fig. 3A, panel 6) or membrane fractions (data not shown). To account for the decrease in total ERK1/2 in cytoskeleton fractions, we normalized pERK1/2 to total ERK1/2. Quantitation using this measurement showed a ∼50% decrease in pERK1/2 in cytoskeleton of cells treated with GIT1-RNAi (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by EGF was decreased in membrane fractions of cells transfected with GIT1-RNAi compared with GFP-RNAi (data not shown). There was no significant change in ERK1/2 expression in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions (Fig. 3A, panel 6; data not shown). These results demonstrate that decreased GIT1 expression is associated with significant inhibition of agonist-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and location in the cytoskeleton fractions. To determine whether GIT1 modulates ERK1/2 activation in the nucleus, we used the Elk-1 reporter gene assay. There was no significant change after GIT1 knockdown in response to EGF stimulation (data not shown). GIT1 Associates with ERK1/2—We previously reported that the association of GIT1 and MEK1 enhanced MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activation in response to EGF and angiotensin II (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GIT1 is a specific scaffold protein in the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway. MEK1 interaction with ERK1/2 is required for ERK1/2 activation, and both were reported to be located in focal adhesions (20Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B. Marshall M.S. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. Catling A.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), where GIT1 also localizes. To confirm that GIT1 interacts with ERK1/2, we used HEK293 cells because of their high transfection efficiency and relatively low level expression of endogenous GIT1. We co-transfected FLAG-GIT1-(1–635), FLAG-GIT1-(del SHD), and FLAG-GIT1-(250–770) with HA-ERK2 into HEK293 cells. The HA-ERK2 associated with GIT1-(1–635), GIT1-(del SHD), and GIT1-(250–770) (Fig. 4A). The fact that all constructs co-precipitated with HA-ERK2 suggested that essential amino acids were present in a binding domain that encompassed residues 420–635. Note that these experiments were performed in the absence of EGF stimulation, so the binding of ERK2 to GIT1 is relatively low, as expected. To determine which domain of GIT1 is important for interaction with ERK2, we made a GFP-GIT1-(590–770) mutant. GFP-GIT1-(WT) and GFP-GIT1-(590–770) were co-transfected with HA-ERK2. GIT1-(WT) co-precipitated with HA-ERK2, but not with GFP-GIT1-(590–770) (Fig. 4B). Based on this deletion mutation analysis, amino acids 420–590 of GIT1 are important for interaction with ERK2. To prove physiological interaction, we used VSMCs because of ample endogenous GIT1 and ERK1/2. Endogenous GIT1 interacted with endogenous ERK2 (data not shown). A similar result was observed for ERK1 (data not shown). We selected ERK2 to determine its binding domain in GIT1. Specific Domains of GIT1 Mediate Interaction with ERK2—CC structures are believed to be sites of protein-protein interaction. Three putative CC domains exist in GIT1 (10Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Loo T.H. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6354-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The CC1 (amino acids 253–274) overlaps with the SHD-1, which is required for interaction with MEK1 (13Yin G. Haendeler J. Yan C. Berk B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but not for interaction with ERK1/2. GIT1 residues 420–590 that are required for binding ERK1/2 overlap with the CC2 (amino acids 424–474) domain. To determine whether the CC2 region is necessary for interaction with ERK2, we co-transfected HA-ERK2 with"

The balance of protein synthesis and degradation processes is essential to maintain cellular homeostasis. Cells possess two major pathways to fulfill protein degradation: proteins are digested either by proteolytic enzymes within the lysosomes or via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The imbalance of the protein synthesis and degradation processes causes many pathological processes (1.Adams J. Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2004: 77-84Crossref Google Scholar).26 S proteasomes, multi-subunit protease complexes, perform ATP-dependent degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins and are responsible for most of the non-lysosomal proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. They consist of the proteolytic 20 S proteasome core particle and are capped at one or both ends by 19 S regulatory particles (2.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar, 3.Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The 20 S core particle is a cylindrical assembly of 28 subunits arranged in four stacked heptameric rings; two rings are formed by 7 α-type subunits, and two rings are build of 7 β-type subunits (4.Peters J.M. Cejka Z. Harris J.R. Kleinschmidt J.A. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 932-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 5.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The two inner β-rings form the central cavity of the cylinder and harbor the proteolytic sites. In contrast to prokaryotic 20 S proteasomes, which contain 14 identical proteolytically active β-type subunits, eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes belong to the family of N-terminal nucleophilic hydrolases (6.Groll M. Ditzel L. Loewe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 7.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). They possess only three subunits with N-terminal active site threonines in the β-ring. In addition, the stimulation of mammalian cells by γ-interferon causes the replacement of the three active β-subunits β1, β2, and β5 by their immunohomologues β1i, β2i, and β5i, resulting in the formation of immunoproteasomes, which display modified cleavage patterns of substrate peptides. The functional integrity of proteasomes is indispensable for a variety of cellular functions, such as metabolic adaptation, cell differentiation, cell cycle control, stress response, degradation of abnormal proteins, and generation of epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex class I receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 8.Kloetzel P.-M. Ossendorp F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar and 9.Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). However, proteasomes are an important supplier (but not the exclusive supplier) of antigenic peptides (10.Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 11.Seifert U. Maranon C. Shmueli A. Desoutter J.-F. Wesoloski L. Janek K. Henklein P. Diescher S.

Inhibition of proteasomes influences the stability of many proteins, especially those that are involved in the cell cycle regulation. In fact, most of the cells treated with proteasomal inhibitors become sensitive to apoptosis (12.Golab J. Bauer Thomas M. Daniel V. Naujokat C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2004; 340: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13.An B. Goldfarb R.H. Siman R. Dou Q.P. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1062-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, selective inhibitors of catalytic proteasome subunits are attractive targets for drug development (14.Orlowski R.Z. Small G.W. Shi Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27864-27871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Interestingly, tumor cells are usually more sensitive to proteasomal inhibition than normal cells. Healthy cells display cell cycle arrest when treated with proteasomal inhibitors but, in contrast to tumor cells, are not as susceptible to apoptosis (15.Orlowski R.Z. Eswara J.R. Lafond-Walker A.

So far, several proteasomal inhibitors have been characterized, both selective (4, lactacystin; 5, TMC-95A; and 6, epoxomicin) and nonspecific (1, dichlorovinyl ester; 3, MG132) (Fig. 1A) (17.Groll M.

Acta. 2004; 1695: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).The most prominent proteasomal inhibitor 2 (Bortezomib®, VELCADE™) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a prescription drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma (18.Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Houston M. Abendroth K. Elliott P.J. Adams J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3535-3540PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Orlowski R.Z. Stinchcombe T.E. Mitchell B.S. Shea T.C. Baldwin A.S.

Similar applications of proteasomal inhibitors in oncology and neurodegenerative diseases are at the focus of our interest (21.Myung J. Kim K.B. Crews C.M. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 245-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We intend to develop selective inhibitors for the three different proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome. Our goals may be achieved by creating compounds or reactive moieties, which bind covalently to the N-terminal threonine.The proteasomal amide hydrolysis differs from all other classes of proteases and is performed by N-terminal threonines, as depicted in Fig. 1B. The crystal structure analysis of the 20 S proteasome revealed that the Thr-1Oγ functions as the nucleophile and that the N-terminal amino group serves as an acyl carrier (6.Groll M. Ditzel L. Loewe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). Covalent inhibitors can bind to the active site through the Thr-1Oγ hydroxyl group or both the free N terminus and Thr-1Oγ (for review, see Ref. 17.Groll M. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).Effective in vivo inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome require high selectivity and good penetration of the cellular membranes. We decided to address the selectivity problems of 3 (MG132) first. A focused set of peptide analogue aldehydes 13–18 aimed at the proteolytic activity of β5 subunit was synthesized and tested for inhibition of the 20 S proteasome and β-secretase (22.Schmidt B. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23.John V. Beck J.P. Bienkowski M.J. Sinha S. Heinrikson R.L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4625-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These results encouraged us to address the design of irreversible and selective proteasome inhibitors. We concentrated on the nonspecific serine protease inhibitor 1 and introduced modifications to improve its selective inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of 20 S Proteasomes—20 S proteasomes were isolated from red blood cells. Cells were lysed with dithiothreitol (1 mm), and the stroma-free supernatant was applied to DEAE-Sepharose (Toyopearls). 20 S proteasome was eluted with a NaCl gradient in TEAD (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm azide, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) from 100 to 350 mm NaCl. 20 S proteasome was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (between 40 and 70% of saturation) and separated in a 10–40% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 16 h (SW40; L7; Beckman & Coulter). Finally, 20 S proteasome was purified on MonoQ column and eluted with a NaCl gradient at 280 mm NaCl. The fractions containing purified 20 S proteasome were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl in TEAD and stored on ice. The purity was determined by SDS-PAGE.Protease Assays—Suc-LLVY-AMC, 1The abbreviations used are: AMC, 7-aminomethylcoumarin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. Z-VGR-AMC, and LLE-AMC (Bachem, Calbiochem) were used to estimate chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like (post-acidic) activities of the 20 S proteasome, respectively. Substrates were incubated with 20 S proteasome at 37 °C in assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h. 100 ng of 20 S proteasome was preincubated with 0.01–10 μm of the inhibitors for 15 min. The reaction was started by addition of substrate (50 μm). The released AMC was detected by fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at 390 nm) using a TECAN fluorometer. Activity was estimated in fluorescence units, and the inhibition is represented by IC50 values.Cell Culture—HeLa cells and MeWo cells (human melanoma) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 5% CO2. Inhibitors were applied from 100× stocks (in Me2SO) at the indicated final concentrations and incubated for variable times.Sensitivity of Cells against Added Compounds—The viability of HeLa cells was tested by crystal violet staining after incubation with inhibitors. The cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 1% of glutardialdehyde for 30 min, and washed again. Finally, the fixed cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in PBS for 30 min and subsequently washed carefully with water to remove unbound dye. The remaining dye was eluted by 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and determined at 550 nm.Inhibition of 20 S Proteasomes within Cells—Cells were harvested and lysed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in TEAD in the presence of the commercial protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science). The proteasomal activity was measured in 10 μl of lysates by using Suc-LLVY-AMC as a substrate. The protein content was quantified by Bradford (Protein assay; Bio-Rad).Detection of Accumulated Polyubiquitinated Proteins—50 μg of total cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked by 5% of milk suspension. The polyubiquitinated proteins were detected by anti-ubiquitin antibody (DAKO) and anti-rabbit peroxidase-labeled as secondary antibody (DIANOVA) and then visualized by ECL.Analysis of Cell Cycle—MeWo cells were treated with inhibitor 15 and MG132 for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, washed with cold PBS, suspended in 70% ethanol, and fixed at -20 °C for 2 h. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, incubated with RNase A (Sigma) at room temperature for 20 min, and placed on ice. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and cells were stained at least for 2 h at 4 °C. The cells were analyzed after staining by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. Statistical significance was determined by the χ2 test.Apoptosis Assay—HeLa cells (10,000 cells/well) were disseminated in a 96-well plate and treated with 1 μm of inhibitors for 20 h. The ongoing apoptosis was estimated by the Apo-One® assay (Promega).Co-crystallization—Crystals of 20 S proteasome from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were grown in hanging drops at 24 °C as described previously (6.Groll M. Ditzel L. Loewe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar) and incubated for 60 min with compound 15. The protein concentration used for crystallization was 40 mg/ml in Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.5) and EDTA (1 mm). The drops contained 3 μl of protein and 2 μl of the reservoir solution, which contained 30 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2, and 10% 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol.The space group belongs to P21 with cell dimensions of a = 135.8 Å, b = 300.1 Å, c = 144.4 Å, and β = 113.1°. Data to 2.8 Å were collected using synchrotron radiation with λ = 1.05 Å on the BW6-beamline at DESY (Hamburg, Germany). Crystals were soaked in a cryoprotecting buffer (30% 2-methylpentane-2,4-diol, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm morpholinoethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.9) and frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen gas at 90 K (Oxford Cryo Systems). X-ray intensities were evaluated by using the MOSFILM program package (version 6.1), and data reduction was performed with CCP4 (24.Leslie A.G.W. Mosflm User Guide, Mosflm Version 5.20. MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambrige, UK1994Google Scholar). The anisotropy of diffraction was corrected by an overall anisotropic temperature factor by comparing observed and calculated structure amplitudes using the program X-PLOR (25.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). A total of 2,383,416 reflections yielding 248,616 unique reflections (96.9% completeness) was collected. The corresponding Rmerge was 8.7% at 2.8 Å resolution (41.9% for the last resolution shell). Electron density was improved by averaging and back-transforming the reflections 10 times over the 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry axis using the program package MAIN (26.Turk, D. (1992) Weiterentwicklung eines Programms für Molekülgraphik und Electronendichte-Manipulation und seine Anwendung auf verschiedene Protein-Strukturaufklärungen.

Conventional crystallographic rigid body, positional, and temperature factor refinements were carried out with X-PLOR using the yeast 20 S proteasome structure as starting model (6.Groll M. Ditzel L. Loewe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). For model building, the program MAIN was used. The structure was refined to a R-factor of 21.7% (free R-factor, 24.9%) with root mean square deviations from target values of 0.007 Å for bonds and 1.30° for angles (27.Engh R. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; A47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Modeling experiments were performed using the coordinates of yeast 20 S proteasome with the program MAIN (26.Turk, D.

Ph.D. thesis, Technische Universität München, MunichGoogle Scholar).Synthesis—Compounds 7–18 were synthesized as analogues of 3 (MG132) based on the established substrate preferences of β-secretase (23.John V. Beck J.P. Bienkowski M.J. Sinha S. Heinrikson R.L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4625-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) by standard methodology or as published previously (28.Schmidt B. Ehlert D.K. Braun H.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004; 45: 1751-1753Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The condensation of commercial protected dipeptides and amino acids with commercial amino alcohols was followed by oxidation to the aldehydes by 2-iodooxybenzoic acid in Me2SO.RESULTSThe intermediate alcohol derivatives 7–12 and the tripeptidic aldehydes 13–18 were investigated for enzyme inhibition. Inhibition of β-secretase was rather poor (IC50 >> 200 μm), 2M. Willem, S. Umbreen, and B. Schmidt, unpublished results. but several compounds turned out to be potent inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome. Peptide aldehydes generally lack selectivity in enzyme inhibition. Therefore, other moieties were tested for their ability to inhibit threonine proteases. The nonselective dichlorovinyl ester 1, which reacts readily with all sorts of nucleophiles such as cysteine, serine, and, eventually, threonine, served as our lead, but we intended to reduce the inherent overactivation. The removal of the acyl group may reduce the nonspecific hydrolysis by ubiquitous nucleophiles and results in reasonably stable dichlorovinyl ethers (28.Schmidt B. Ehlert D.K. Braun H.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 2004; 45: 1751-1753Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Such ethers (19 and 20) tolerate acidic environment but hydrolyze readily at pH 11 to be converted into α-chloroacetates, which in turn may react with nucleophiles. This dual reactivity, which is delivered in a cascade reaction, meets the specific requirements of an N-terminal threonine protease inhibitor. An analogue dual reactivity may be observed for propargylic ketones. A similar compound was synthesized, but unfortunately, the alcohol 21 resisted oxidation to the desired ketone. Therefore, we focused on transition state mimetics as inhibitors. Lead structures, such as statines (34.Garcia-Echeverria C. Imbach P. France D. Fürst P. Lang M. Noorani A.M. Scholz D. Zimmermann J. Furet P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), α-ketoamides, and chloromethyl ketones, are well established in protease inhibition. Combination of these structures with a β5 selective tripeptide furnished the compounds 22–28 (Fig. 2). Compound 22 was prepared from commercial Z-LL and chloromethyl leucine. Compounds 23–25 were obtained by a Passerini reaction of MG132 with three isonitriles. The subsequent oxidation by 2-iodooxybenzoic acid in Me2SO furnished the α-ketoamides 26–28.Fig. 2Peptidomimetics designed for 20 S proteasome inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)All peptide mimetics (7–28) were tested for their ability to inhibit the 20 S proteasome. Initially, we investigated the inhibition of cellular soluble proteases. 10 μm solutions of compounds 7–28 were added to the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells and incubated for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, the proteolytic process was monitored by addition of the peptidic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC. In parallel, the cytosolic fraction was treated with the broad specific protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Applied Science) prior to the addition of substrate. This inhibitor mixture did not affect 20 S proteasomes. 11 of 22 investigated compounds diminished proteolysis in the cytosolic fraction as well as in the Complete-pretreated lysate (Fig. 3). The inhibition rates differed drastically. Some of the compounds displayed no inhibition, whereas five of the analyzed compounds decreased the hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC by >75%.Fig. 3Estimation of proteolysis in cell lysates by addition of MG132 and 7–28. Compounds (10 μm) were added to clarified lysates and preincubated for 30 min on ice prior to the proteolysis assay (black bars). In parallel, lysate was preincubated with the commercial protease inhibitor mixture Complete for 30 min, which inhibited most of the cytosolic serine/aspartate proteases, but not proteasomes (white bars). This partial inactivation was followed by incubation with the indicated compounds. The proteolytic activity was determined in 10 μl of the lysates by addition of LLVY-AMC (100 μl, 50 μm) in TEAD. The AMC released by non-inhibited lysate was set to 100%. MG132 was used as inhibition control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ensure that the inhibitory effect observed in the cytosolic fraction was indeed caused by inhibition of 20 S proteasomes, the inhibitors were added at different concentrations to isolated 20 S proteasomes. The effect of the inhibitors was compared with that of the frequently employed 20 S proteasome inhibitor 3 (MG132). The chymotryptic-like (Suc-LLVY-AMC), tryptic-like (Bz-VGR-AMC), and caspase-like (Z-LLE-AMC) activities of 20 S proteasomes were determined after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The strongest inhibitory effects were observed for chymotryptic-like activity. Six of the tested inhibitors (13, 15, 25, 26, 27, and 28) displayed IC50 values of <1 μm. The inhibition of tryptic-like activity was <1 μm for the inhibitors 7, 13, and 15. Only compounds 7 and 8 showed exclusive inhibition of tryptic-like activity. The inhibition of caspase-like activity was even weaker (Table I). 20 S proteasomes isolated from HeLa cells contain more constitutive proteasomes than immunoproteasomes. Therefore, we repeated the inhibition experiments with immunoproteasomes isolated from stably transfected T2.27 cells. These experiments revealed that immunoproteasomes and constitutive proteasomes display similar sensitivities to the inhibitors (data not shown). 26 S proteasomes are responsible for ATP-dependent degradation of polyubiquitin-tagged proteins within living cells. They exhibited a similar susceptibility to the most potent inhibitor (15) in vitro (data not shown).Table ICalculated IC50 values for compounds 7–28. IC50 values were calculated from inhibition of proteasomes at increasing amounts of inhibitors. Samples were preincubated for 15 min in ice. The assay was started by addition of 50 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate. LLVY-AMC and GLL-AMC for chymotryptic-like, VGR-AMC for tryptic-like, and LLE-AMC for caspase-like activity. The release of AMC was determined at 460 nm emission (excitation, 390 nm).

Proteasome Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2004: 77-84Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, selected inhibitors were tested on cell cultures for cell lysis or cell death. The viability of HeLa cells in the presence of different compounds was tested in 24-h cultures. HeLa cells tolerated 1 μm concentrations of inhibitory and non-inhibitory substances (Fig. 4A). The relative survival rate of the cells was clearly diminished at concentrations of 10 μm. This effect was pronounced for the most potent inhibitors from the in vitro experiments (15, 28, and 27) (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4A, viability of HeLa cells after incubation with MG132 and 7–28. The viability of HeLa cells incubated with inhibitors (1 μm) was determined by crystal violet staining after 20 h. B, the viability of HeLa cells is dependent on inhibitor concentrations. HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations (100 nm, gray bars; 1 μm, white dotted bars; 10 μm, white bars) of inhibitors for 20 h. Control cells are indicated by black bars. Cell survival was determined by crystal violet staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The impact of inhibitors on living cells and organisms crucially depends on adequate cell permeability. Therefore, we analyzed the proteasome function within cells at different inhibitor concentrations. The application to cell cultures or animals required the concentrations of the inhibitors to be as low as possible. The specific proteasome activity was reduced below 50% (Fig. 5A) in cells treated with 1 μm solutions of 15, 22, 25, 26, and 28. Compounds 7, 13, and 27 exhibited weaker effects on the specific activity, whereas compounds 18 and 21 hardly inhibited the cellular proteasome at all. Remarkably, inhibitors 15, 22, and 28 reduced the proteolytic activity already at a concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 5A). Specific inhibition of proteasomes results in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Indeed, the amounts of polyubiquitinated proteins increased during incubation with the inhibitors. First effects were observed after 2 h for the potent compound 15 (Fig. 5B) and for compounds 20, 22, 25, and 28 (data not shown). The accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins via proteasome inhibition depended strongly on the applied concentrations (Fig. 5C). Thus, several of these new inhibitors are able to permeate cells and affect the activity of proteasomes. The consequences of proteasome inhibition for distinct cellular functions are subject to ongoing investigations.Fig. 5Inhibition of proteasomes within cells. The p"

https://openalex.org/W2044037402,"Caveolin-1 (CAV1) is the structural protein of the filamentous coat that decorates the cytoplasmic surface of each caveola. Cell culture studies have implicated CAV1 in playing an important role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. In addition, it has been reported that CAV1 forms a detergent-resistant protein complex with Annexin-2 in enterocytes that can be disrupted by the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, suggesting a possible role for CAV1 in cholesterol absorption. In this report, we have evaluated cholesterol homeostasis in Cav1 knock-out mice. Deletion of CAV1 does not result in either a compensatory increase of CAV2 or CAV3 in intestine. In addition, Cav1 knock-out mice display normal mRNA and protein levels of Annexin-2 or the putative cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) in proximal intestinal mucosa. Fractional cholesterol absorption and fecal neutral sterol excretion are statistically similar in Cav1 knock-out mice and their wild-type littermates. Moreover, oral administration of ezetimibe is equally effective in decreasing cholesterol absorption in Cav1 null mice and wild-type controls. The mRNA expression levels of genes sensitive to intracellular cholesterol concentration (ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG5, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and the LDL receptor) are similarly altered in the proximal intestinal mucosa of Cav1 null and wild-type mice following ezetimibe treatment.

These results demonstrate that CAV1 is not required for cholesterol absorption or ezetimibe sensitivity in the mouse. Ezetimibe is a member of the 2-azetidinone class of drugs that has recently been approved for clinical use in reducing plasma cholesterol levels (1Sudhop T. Lutjohann D. von Bergmann K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 105: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This drug significantly reduces the uptake of intestinal sterols by a mechanism that has not been fully elucidated. One protein that appears to be involved is NPC1L1 (2Altmann S.W. Davis H.R. Zhu L.-J. Yao X. Hoos L.M. Tetzloff G. Iyer S. P.N. Maguire M. Golovko A. Zeng M. Wang L. Murgolo N. Graziano M.P.

The possibility exists, therefore, that other proteins are required for the inhibitory effects of this drug.

In zebrafish and mice, CAV1 has been shown to tightly associate with annexin-2 to form a complex that is resistant both to high heat and to solubilization by a SDS detergent. Treatment of mice with ezetimibe can disrupt this complex, suggesting that it may be a molecular target for the drug. Additionally, CAV1 is an attractive candidate target protein because there is considerable evidence for its involvement in intracellular cholesterol transport.

CAV1 also has been linked to cholesterol efflux in animals that are susceptible to gallstones. When gallstone-susceptible C57L/J mice are placed on a lithogenic diet, liver CAV1 mRNA and protein appear to be upregulated (13Fuchs M. Ivandic B. Muller O. Schalla C. Scheibner J. Bartsch P. Stange E.F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CAV1 expression may also be regulated by cholesterol depletion by chronic high density lipoprotein exposure in cultured cells (14Frank P.G. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Razani B. Cohen D.E. Marcel Y.L. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1204-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An important test of protein function is the phenotype of animals that lack the protein. For example, the high density lipoprotein receptor SR-B1 is clearly involved in efflux and influx of cholesterol (15Stangl H. Hyatt M. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32692-32698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), yet animals lacking SR-B1 are not defective in intestinal absorption of cholesterol (16Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J.

Likewise, if CAV1 is a target for ezetimibe, then entero-hepatic cholesterol transport should be markedly reduced in animals lacking CAV1, and they should be unresponsive to ezetimibe. Here we show that Cav1 null mice do not exhibit any defect either in cholesterol transport or in response to ezetimibe. Cav1-deficient mice were generated by gene deletion of exon 2 as described previously (18Cao G. Yang G. Timme T.L. Saika T. Truong L.D. Satoh T. Goltsov A. Park S.H. Men T. Kusaka N. Tian W. Ren C.

The resulting mouse strain was intercrossed with C57/Bl6 mice for 10 generations to establish a pure C57/Bl6 background. Mouse genotyping was performed by PCR using the primers F1, 5′-ttctgtgtgcaagcctttcc; R1, 5′-gtgtgcgcgtcatacacttg; and R2, 5′-ggggaggagtagaaggtggc to generate a product of 307 bp for the null allele and 260 bp for the wild-type allele (18Cao G.

Although it has been reported that older Cav1 null mice are smaller than wild-type mice (19Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E.

Animals were housed individually in plastic colony cages containing wood shavings in a 22 °C room lit from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Mice were fed ad libitum a cereal-based rodent diet (Teklad Diet number 7001, Madison, WI) that contains 0.02% (w/w) cholesterol and 4% total lipid. The mice were fed the powdered form of this diet, which in some experiments was supplemented with ezetimibe to provide 10 mg/day/kg of body weight (based on the consumption of 160 g of diet/day/kg of body weight). Ezetimibe was provided by Harry R. Davis, Jr. at the Schering-Plough Research Institute. Experiments were performed at the end of the dark cycle, and mice were in a fed-state at the time of study. Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Mice were anesthetized and blood was sampled from the inferior vena cava into EDTA-containing microfuge tubes (final concentration of EDTA ∼2 mm). Plasma was prepared by low speed centrifugation (5,000 g) for 10 min at 4 °C. For the lipoprotein profiles, equal volumes of plasma from individuals of each group were pooled then diluted 1:1 (v/v) with phosphate-buffered saline and filtered through a 0.22-μm syringe filter (Millipore). One-hundred microliters of diluted sample was injected onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column for fractionation by fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia ΔKTA) at 4 °C. Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in buffer containing 0.05 m phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.15 m NaCl. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected for analysis. Cholesterol concentrations were measured enzymatically using the Infinity Cholesterol Reagent (401-500P, Sigma). Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were measured enzymatically using a 1:2 ratio of color reagent A to color reagent B from NEFA-C kit (994-75409, Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Plasma total triglycerides were measured enzymatically with triglyceride (GPO-Trinder) reagents A and B (T2449 and F6428, Sigma). All kits provided appropriate controls to establish a standard curve for calculation. Cholesterol—An aliquot of liver was saponified in 3% KOH (in ethanol) and extracted in petroleum ether (PE) with added standard (stigmastanol). An aliquot of the PE phase was dried down and resuspended in hexane prior to analysis by gas chromatography (20Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triglyceride—An aliquot of liver (∼250 mg) was extracted in 20 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of [14C]triolein (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO). The entire extract was filtered and dried under air, and the residue was redissolved in 1 ml of hexane:methyl-t-butyl ether (100:1.5, v/v). This solution was run over a Sep-Pak Vac RC silica cartridge (500 mg, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Following elution of the cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols were eluted with 12 ml of hexane:methyl-t-butyl ether (96:4, v/v). The eluate was brought to 100 ml with hexane, and 2-ml aliquots were dried under air and measured for radioactivity using a scintillation counter to calculate the percent recovery of the internal standard and triacylglycerol. Separate 2-ml aliquots were used for enzymatic determination of triacylglycerol quantity with Infinity triglycerides liquid stable reagent (ThermoTrace, Noble Park, Australia). Absorption—Fractional cholesterol absorption was measured by a fecal dual isotope ratio method (21Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice received a single intragastric dose of medium chain triglyceride oil containing [5,6-3H]sitostanol (2 μCi, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc) and [14C]cholesterol (1 μCi, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Stools were collected over the following 3 days. Samples of the dosing mixture and aliquots of stool were extracted, and the ratio of 14C:3H in each was determined to calculate percent cholesterol absorption (21Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fecal Neutral Sterol and Acidic Sterol Excretion—Stools were collected from individually housed mice over 3 days. They were dried, weighed, and ground. An aliquot of this material was used to determine bile acid content by an enzymatic method (22Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A second aliquot was saponified, solvent was extracted, and the amounts of cholesterol, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and cholestanone was quantified by gas chromatography (23Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts measured were adjusted to reflect the daily excretion (based on feces collected over 3 days) per 100 g of body weight. Mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated via the descending vena cava. Small intestines were removed, flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and cut into three sections of equal length (the proximal third denoted as duodenum). The sections were slit lengthwise, and the mucosae were gently scraped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -85 °C. Whole livers were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then crushed to a fine powder with a Besselar Tissue pulverizer and stored at -85 °C, thus providing multiple homogenous aliquots for various assays. Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc.). Total protein was obtained from the organic phase remaining after RNA isolation by precipitating with isopropanol, consecutively washing with 0.3 m guanidine hydrochloride in 95% ethanol and ethanol, and then solubilizing the protein pellet in 1% SDS. RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Total protein obtained from whole-cell lysates of duodenal mucosa (see above) was size-fractionated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (60 μg/lane), transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with one of the following antisera: CAV1, amino terminus “pAb1” (N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000); CAV1, central “pAb2” (amino acids 1-97, BD Biosciences, 1:5000); CAV1, carboxyl terminus “pAb3” (produced in rabbits by injection of the peptide IFSNVRINLQKEI (24Ko Y.-G.

This antiserum recognizes a ∼200-kDa protein in intestine samples of wild-type but not NPC1L1-null mice, 2H. Hobbs and J. Cohen, personal communication. ANXA2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ERK1/2 (Upstate Group LLP, Charlottesville VA). Proteins were visualized by sequential treatment with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensity of bands on autoradiograms was measured by densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer Model 300A. Northern Analysis—Equal quantities of total RNA from the samples of each group were pooled, and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Pharmacia Biotech). mRNA (5 μg/lane) was size fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Zetaprobe, Bio-Rad) for probing with 32P-labeled cDNAs. Probes for ANXA2 and NPC1L1 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using RNA isolated from mouse duodenum as template and the following primers: ANXA2-F, 5′-gctctcagcgatacgtgc; ANXA2-R, 5′-gagcgaagtctctagaacg (yielding an ANXA2 product consisting of nucleotides 31-1167, GenBank™ NM_007585); NPC1L1-F, 5′-agacgagggttatcactagag; NPC1L1-R, 5′-atttataaataccttggccata (yielding full-length mouse NPC1L1 per GenBank™ XM_137497, a fragment generated by PstI digestion containing nucleotides 658-1446 was used as a probe). A second cDNA produced against the 3′-untranslated region of NPC1L1 gave identical results by Northern analysis and was generated using the same reverse primer and NPC1L1-F2, 5′-aatggagtaggagcttgtc (yielding a product containing nucleotides 4127-4572). HMG-CoA Syn cDNA was provided by Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein (UTSW, (25Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar)), ABCG5 cDNA was provided by Helen Hobbs (UTSW, (26Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A. Yu L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P.

Li W.-P. Liu P. Anderson R. G.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Quantitiative Real Time PCR—Quantitiative real time (qRT)-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system as described (28Kurrasch D.M. Huang J. Wilkie T.M. Repa J.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) to generate cDNA. Primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and validated by analysis of template titration and dissociation curves. Primer sequences are available upon request. Each qRT-PCR contained (final volume of 10 μl) 25 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, each primer at 150 nm, and 5 μl of 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Results were evaluated by the comparative CT method (User Bulletin No. 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using cyclophilin as the invariant control gene. RNA levels are expressed relative to those obtained for the wild-type mice fed the basal diet and reflect the average ± S.E. for n = 5-6 animals/group. Statistical Analysis of Data—Data are reported as the mean ± S.E. for the specified number of animals. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. If unequal variance was indicated by Bartlett's test, log transformation was performed prior to statistical analysis. Two-way analysis of variance was used (factors: genotype, drug). In no instance was a significant interaction of factors observed; therefore, statistical differences for each factor are fully described in each figure legend: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. To investigate the role of CAV1 in cholesterol homeostasis, we evaluated a number of metabolic parameters indicative of cholesterol absorption and trafficking in intact mice. In addition, we measured the RNA and protein levels of key transporters, enzymes, and trafficking proteins in intestine and liver to corroborate the metabolic changes observed in these mice. Cav1 null mice and their wild-type controls were fed a standard rodent diet containing 4% total lipid and 0.02% cholesterol for 15 days. Some mice received this diet supplemented with 10 mg of ezetimibe/kg of body weight. This dose of ezetimibe has previously been established as effective in mice and results in a greater than 90% decrease in fractional cholesterol absorption (29Davis H.R. Compton D.S. Hoos L. Tetzloff G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2032-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 30Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Quan G. Dietschy J.M. J.

Stool samples were collected from days 7-10 to measure fecal sterol and bile acid excretion, and mice received an intragastric dose of labeled sterols on day 12 to measure cholesterol absorption by the fecal dual isotope method (20Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turley S.D. Daggy B.P. Dietschy J.M. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After completion of the 15-day dietary regimen, mice were anesthetized and exsanguinated, and tissue samples were obtained. Western blot analyses were performed using whole-cell lysates prepared from the proximal third of the small intestine of individual mice (Fig. 1). The genotype of mice used in the study was confirmed by the absence of the 22-kDa CAV1 protein (5Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R. G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar) in samples from the Cav1 knock-out mice. Importantly, there was no evidence of any immunoreactive CAV1 polypeptide fragment generated in these mice as assessed by a variety of polyclonal antisera that target the amino terminus (pAb1) through the carboxyl terminus (pAb3). This was necessary, as a truncated CAV1 transcript was still evident by Northern analysis in these samples (Fig. 2C). The absence of invaginated caveolae in vascular endothelial cells (data not shown) further confirm the deletion of this gene product. The inclusion of ezetimibe in the diet had no effect on the CAV1 protein levels measured in the wild-type mice.Fig. 2Relative expression of various genes involved with cholesterol handling in the duodenum. Wild-type and Cav1-/- mice were fed a powdered basal diet with or without ezetimibe (EZ) (to provide 10 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 15 days. RNA was isolated from mucosa of the proximal third of the mouse small intestine (see B for legend). A and B, mRNA levels were determined for duodenum of individual mice by quantitative real time PCR using SYBR green chemistry with gene-specific primers and calculated by the comparative CT method using cyclophilin as the invariant control. The average cycle number at threshold is inset for the control group (wild-type mice, basal diet), note, cyclophilin CT = 20.3. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of data from 5-6 mice/group. Statistical analyses were performed by two-way analysis of variance with genotype and ezetimibe treatment as the two factors. No significant interaction of drug and genotype was observed for any mRNA species measured, and aside from CAV1 mRNA levels, no other RNA species exhibited different levels because of Cav1 deletion. The asterisks denote significant difference due to ezetimibe treatment. *, p < 0.05; ***, p < 0.0001.

This protein size is in agreement with that described for rat and human NPC1L1 (31Davies J.P. Scott C. Oishi K. Liapis A. Ioannou Y.A. J. Biol.

The specificity of the NPC1L1 antiserum was confirmed by immunoblotting of intestinal samples from wild-type and Npc1l1 knock-out mice, with no detected protein in the null animals. 2H. Hobbs and J. Cohen, personal communication. Protein quantification by densitometry revealed that neither the Cav1 genotype nor the ezetimibe treatment had a significant effect on NPC1L1 protein levels (WT control diet, 0.68 ± 0.05 density units relative to loading standard ERK1/2; WT EZ, 0.80 ± 0.20; CAV1-/-control, 0.56 ± 0.09; CAV1-/-EZ, 0.66 ± 0.15, n = 5-6 mice/group). Blotting with an ANXA2 polyclonal antiserum revealed three protein bands, with the most prominent (∼37 kDa) in agreement with previous reports (11Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Donzell W.C. Anderson R. G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The larger molecular weight forms could be a result of ANXA2 ubiquitination as has been observed with extracts from intestinal mucosa (33Lauvrak S.U. Hollas H. Doskeland A.P. Aukrust I. Flatmark T. Vedeler A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Densitometric measurement of the principle ANXA2 band indicated that neither the Cav1 genotype nor the ezetimibe treatment resulted in altered ANXA2 expression levels (WT control diet, 0.18 ± 0.07 density units relative to loading standard ERK1/2; WT EZ, 0.30 ± 0.10; CAV1-/-control: 0.24 ± 0.07; CAV1-/-EZ, 0.19 ± 0.09, n = 5-6 mice/group). In summary, the Western analyses shown in Fig. 1 conclusively demonstrate that the absence of CAV1 does not affect the protein levels of NPC1L1 and ANXA2 in the mouse intestine. In addition, treatment of mice with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe does not alter duodenal levels of NPC1L1 and ANXA2 proteins. Additional evaluation of NPC proteins, CAV isoforms, and gene products important for enterocyte cholesterol balance was performed by using qRT-PCR to measure RNA levels (Fig. 2, A and B). CAV1 RNA was not detected in the Cav1 knock-out mice by this method. CAV2 and CAV3 levels were unchanged by either genotype or drug treatment. The cycle numbers needed to amplify the CAV PCR products allow for a rough approximation of relative expression of these three isoforms, and suggest that CAV1 is most abundant (CT = 24.8) and CAV3 RNA (CT = 30.9) most sparse in the mouse intestine. This is in agreement with immunoblot analyses that suggest a similar relative expression of these CAV family members in the mouse intestine (9Li W.-P. Liu P. Pilcher B.K. Anderson R. G.W. J.

Previously, a cellular UDP-Glc deficiency was related with a hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of Cp-PLC. Because UDP-Glc is required in the synthesis of proteoglycans, N-linked glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids, the role of these gly-coconjugates in the cellular sensitivity to Cp-PLC was studied. The cellular sensitivity to Cp-PLC was significantly enhanced by glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitors, and a mutant cell line deficient in gangliosides was found to be hypersensitive to Cp-PLC. Gangliosides protected hypersensitive cells from the cytotoxic effect of Cp-PLC and prevented its membrane-disrupting effect on artificial membranes. Removal of sialic acids by C. perfringens sialidase increases the sensitivity of cultured cells to Cp-PLC and intramuscular co-injection of C. perfringens sialidase, and Cp-PLC in mice potentiates the myotoxic effect of the latter. This work demonstrated that a reduction in gangliosides renders cells more susceptible to the membrane damage caused by Cp-PLC and revealed a previously unrecognized synergism between Cp-PLC and C. perfringens sialidase, providing new insights toward understanding the pathogenesis of clostridial myonecrosis.

Clostridium perfringens, the pathogenic bacterium most widely distributed in nature (5Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S. Hayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), produces one phospholipase C (referred to here as Cp-PLC), which is highly toxic; it decreases cardiac contractility, increases capillary permeability, and displays platelet-aggregating, hemolytic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic activities (6Titball R.W. Naylor C.E. Basak A.K. Anaerobe. 1999; 5: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cp-PLC is also called α-toxin and has been associated with enteritis in domestic animals, Crohn disease, and gas gangrene in humans (6Titball R.W. Naylor C.E. Basak A.K. Anaerobe. 1999; 5: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Gas gangrene is an acute and life-threatening infection most frequently caused by C. perfringens and characterized by massive local edema, severe myonecrosis, and the accumulation of gas at the site of infection (7Stevens D.L. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Gas gangrene without external injury is associated with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, or an underlying gastrointestinal or hematologic malignancy (8Burke M.P. Opeskin K. Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 1999; 20: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More often, gas gangrene is associated either to trauma or surgery, occurring after the introduction of bacterial spores in a deep lesion or in a surgical wound (7Stevens D.L. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the use of antibiotics and intensive care regimes, in many cases of gas gangrene radical amputation is the treatment of choice to avoid shock, multiorgan failure, and death (7Stevens D.L. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The plc gene, encoded in the C. perfringens chromosome, shows minimal inter-strain sequence variations and is highly expressed in all strains associated with gas gangrene (6Titball R.W. Naylor C.E. Basak A.K. Anaerobe. 1999; 5: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 9Rood J.I. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Homologous genes are found in other Clostridium species such as Clostridium sordellii, Clostridium absonum, and Clostridium novyi, which occasionally cause gas gangrene (10Karasawa T. Wang X. Maegawa T. Michiwa Y. Kita H. Miwa K. Nakamura S. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Clark G.C. Briggs D.C. Karasawa T. Wang X. Cole A.R. Maegawa T. Jayasekera P.N. Naylor C.E. Miller J. Moss D.S. Nakamura S. Basak A.J. Titball R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Cp-PLC is the major virulence factor in C. perfringens-induced gas gangrene. First, when injected intramuscularly in mice, recombinant Cp-PLC causes myonecrosis and reproduces the histopathological features of gas gangrene (12Bunting M. Lorant D.E. Bryant A.E. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stevens D.L. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Second, immunization with the recombinant Cp-PLC C-terminal domain protects mice from the intramuscular challenge with a lethal dose of C. perfringens vegetative cells (13Williamson E.D. Titball R.W. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Third, a C. perfringens mutant strain, in which the plc gene has been inactivated by homologous recombination, is unable to produce gas gangrene (14Awad M.M. Bryant A.E. Stevens D.L. Rood J.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in the knowledge of the structure of Cp-PLC, our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of its toxic effects is still incomplete (15Flores-Díaz M. Thelestam M. Clark G.C. Titball R.W. Alape-Girón A. Anaerobe. 2004; 10: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A mutant cell line hypersensitive to Cp-PLC, referred to here as Don Q, was isolated previously (16Florin I. Microb. Pathog. 1991; 11: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This cell line has a permanent low UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) level due to a recessive point mutation in the UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (UDPG:PP) gene (17Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Striber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We showed previously (18Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Titball R.W. Moos M. Guillouard I. Cole S. Howells A.M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Florin I. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24433-24438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that upon one allele reversion of the mutation or transfection with a wild type UDPG:PP, the mutant cell compensates the UDP-Glc deficiency and regains the same relative resistance to Cp-PLC as the one displayed by the parental cell. However, the molecular basis relating the cellular UDP-Glc deficiency to the sensitization to Cp-PLC has not been established. UDP-Glc is required for the synthesis of the carbohydrate moiety of cell surface glycoconjugates, such as proteoglycans, N-glycosylated glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) (17Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Striber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans consist of variable polysaccharide chains, the glycosaminoglycans, linked to a core polypeptide. The mature glycosaminoglycans contain glucosamine or galactosamine alternating in glycosidic linkages with glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, or galactose and are sulfated or acetylated to varying degrees (19Prydz K. Dalen K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 193-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosaminoglycans are assembled in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus by sequential addition of monosaccharides to the linker tetrasaccharide GlcUAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-, which is bound to a Ser or a Thr residue of the core polypeptide (20Ge Wei X.B. Sinha A. Esko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc is essential for the synthesis of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-galactose, two monosaccharide donors used in glycosaminoglycans synthesis. N-Glycosylated glycoproteins have covalently bound to an Asn residue, oligosaccharides of variable composition, all of which arise from the common core precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol (21Helenius H. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide moiety of this precursor is synthesized by the stepwise addition of monosaccharide units onto dolichol pyrophosphate on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is then transferred en bloc onto the nascent polypeptide chains (21Helenius H. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). UDP-Glc is actively transported to the lumen of the ER, where it serves as donor of the three terminal glucoses of the core precursor (21Helenius H. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Within the ER, UDP-Glc is also used by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which recognizes and glucosylates misfolded glycoproteins (21Helenius H. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). This glucosylation prolongs the contact of N-linked glycoproteins with the lectin-type chaperones calnexin and calreticulin and thus leads to their retention within the ER until they are correctly folded (21Helenius H. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). GSLs are composed of a variable carbohydrate moiety linked to ceramide and derive either from glucosylceramide (GlcCer) or galactosylceramide (GalCer) (22Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). GalCer is synthesized from ceramide and UDP-galactose on the luminal face of the ER membrane, whereas GlcCer is synthesized from ceramide and UDP-Glc on a pre-Golgi compartment or on the cytosolic face of the Golgi apparatus (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Ceramide, a common precursor of GSLs and SM, is either synthesized de novo from l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA (22Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) or by a salvage pathway from sphingosine (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The de novo synthesis of ceramide involves serine palmitoyltransferase, 3-ketosphinganine reductase, sphinganine/sphingosine N-acyltransferase, and dihydroceramide desaturase (22Merrill A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), whereas the salvage pathway requires only the N-acyltransferase (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition, GSLs from the extracellular space are incorporated in the plasma membrane and internalized along the lysosomal pathway (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the most abundant derivatives of GlcCer are gangliosides, for which lactosylceramide serves as a precursor (Fig. 1). Gangliosides may have either one (a series), two (b series), or three (c series) sialic acid (SiaAc) residues linked to the 3-position of the inner galactose moiety or may lack SiaAc at this position (0 series) (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Complex gangliosides have another SiaAc moiety linked to the 3-position of the terminal galactose (23Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 301-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because a UDP-Glc deficiency leads to a cellular hypersensitivity to Cp-PLC (18Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Titball R.W. Moos M. Guillouard I. Cole S. Howells A.M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Florin I. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24433-24438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and this metabolite is essential in the synthesis of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and GSLs, the aim of this work was to clarify the role of these glycoconjugates in the cellular sensitivity to this toxin. Toxins, Antibodies, and Chemicals—Wild type recombinant Cp-PLC from the strain NCTC 8237 or its C-terminal fragment (C-PLC) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (24Alape-Girón A.

Cells and Cell Culture—Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, referred to here as Don wt, mouse melanoma cells (B16), Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1), and human larynx carcinoma cells (HEp-2) were from ATCC. The UDP-Glc-deficient mutant of Don wt cells, Don Q, which has a defective UDPG:PP, the spontaneous revertant of this mutant, Don QR, and the UDPG:PP transfectant clone. B9 was described previously (18Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Titball R.W. Moos M. Guillouard I. Cole S. Howells A.M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Florin I. Thelestam M. J. Biol.

Don wt, Q, QR, B9, B16, GM95, and CG-1 cells were cultivated at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. CHO, pgs-110, and pgs-T cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented as above. Cytotoxicity Assays—Cells in 96-well plates grown to 80–90% of confluence were exposed to Cp-PLC or to wheat germ lectin in 200 μl of medium/well, and cell viability was assessed 24 h later using a neutral red assay (18Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Titball R.W. Moos M. Guillouard I. Cole S. Howells A.M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Florin I. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24433-24438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated for 2 h with 200 μl/well of neutral red (50 μg/ml) dissolved in supplemented culture medium, and the incorporated dye was extracted with 100 μl of acetic acid/ethanol/water (1:50:49), before recording the absorbances at 540 nm. Cell survival was expressed as a percentage, considering as 100% the value of parallel cultures incubated with only medium or with medium and drugs at the indicated concentrations. Assays were performed with 3–6 replicate samples. When not shown, the standard deviation was <10%. Pharmacological or Enzymatic Treatments and Evaluation of Their Effects—Cells were preincubated for 18–24 h with 1-deoxynojirimycin (1–90 μg/ml), castanospermine (1–90 μg/ml), swainsonine (1–90 μg/ml), brefeldin A (0.1–9 μg/ml), monensin (1–90 μg/ml), tunicamycin (0.1–9 μg/ml), β-chloroalanine (1–90 μg/ml), l-cycloserine (3–300 μg/ml), myriocin (3–300 μg/ml), fumonisin B1 (0.3–30 μm), PPMP (0.3–30 μg/ml), C. perfringens large sialidase (0.3–100 milliunits/ml) or V. cholerae sialidase (0.3–100 milliunits/ml) or for 2 h with galactocerebrosides (90–900 μg/ml), gangliosides (90–900 μg/ml), in supplemented medium containing 10% FBS, or for 18–24 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with S. plicatus endoglycosidase H (1–9 milliunits/ml) or C. meningosepticum endoglycosidase F1 (1–9 milliunits/ml). Proteins in lysates of untreated and treated cells were submitted to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes as described (17Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Persson B. Pollesello P. Moos M. von Eichel-Striber C. Thelestam M. Florin I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23784-23791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate moieties in glycoproteins were oxidized with periodate and detected using biotin-hydrazide and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase with the GlycoTrack carbohydrate detection kit (Oxford Glycosystems, Abingdon, UK). GSLs were isolated from trypsinized cells and pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C at 300 × g for 10 min. Cell pellets were lyophilized and extracted twice with chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v). The combined extracts were reduced to 25% of the original volume and kept at 4 °C overnight, and then the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C at 100 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was dried under nitrogen and lyophilized, and the lipids were partitioned twice in 6 ml of diisopropyl ether/1-butanol, 60:40 (v/v), and 3 ml of 0.1% aqueous NaCl. The aqueous phase was lyophilized and redissolved in 300 μl of distilled water. Salts were removed by gel filtration in Sephadex G-50. HPTLC separation and immunostaining were performed as described (30Yu R.K. Ariga T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 115-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using mAb DH2 (26Dohi T. Nores G. Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5680-5685PubMed Google Scholar) or a rabbit anti-glucosylceramide antiserum (31Brade L. Vielhaber G. Heinz E. Brade H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Densitometric scanning analysis was performed with a Shimadzu CS-930 HPTLC scanner. To evaluate ganglioside incorporation into the membrane, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and washed once with PBS, and the cell pellet was resuspended and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml of the ganglioside-specific mAbs for 1 h on ice. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulins for 30 min on ice. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data were collected and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To evaluate the effects of the treatments in sensitivity to toxins, cells were grown to 60–80% of confluence in 96-well plates and exposed to the treatments for the mentioned periods of time before and during exposure to serial dilutions of the toxins. Cell viability was measured 24 h later using the neutral red assay as described. At the concentrations used, none of the substances by itself caused significant cytotoxicity (viability was higher than 95% in comparison with untreated cells). In control experiments after ganglioside addition, mild trypsinization was carried out with 0.1% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.8, for 15 min at 37 °C. Hydrolysis of Choline-containing Phospholipids from Prelabeled Cells—Cells were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline (Amersham Biosciences) for 18 h, washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and exposed to Cp-PLC (20 ng/ml) in supplemented medium for 0.5, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 h. The amount of radioactive choline incorporated into membranes and the choline remaining after Cp-PLC treatment were determined by counting the radioactivity in the lipid phase after extraction with chloroform/methanol (18Flores-Díaz M. Alape-Girón A. Titball R.W. Moos M. Guillouard I. Cole S. Howells A.M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Florin I. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24433-24438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The released counts/min were measured and related either to the amount of cellular protein determined in parallel cultures using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay or to the total counts/min incorporated into the membranes. Release of Lactate Dehydrogenase—The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) released to the medium after exposure of cells to toxins for 2 h was determined by using a kit from Roche Applied Science. LDH release was expressed as a percentage, considering as 100 and 0% the values of parallel cultures exposed to 0.1% Triton X-100 or medium only. Assays were performed with 3–4 replicate samples. Myotoxicity Studies—Myotoxicity was estimated by measurement of the creatine kinase (CK) activity in the plasma after intramuscular injection of the toxin in the right gastrocnemius in groups of five CD-1 mice, as described (24Alape-Girón A. Flores-Díaz M. Guillouard I. Naylor C. Titball R.W. Rucavado A. Lomonte B. Basak A.K. Gutiérrez J.M. Cole S. Thelestam M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5191-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Animals were housed, fed, and handled according to the principles and practices approved by the Institutional Committee for Care and Handling of Experimental Animals of Universidad de Costa Rica. The CK activity in plasma was determined using a kinetic assay (Sigma, CK-10) 3 h after injection of 0.7 μg of Cp-PLC alone or together with different amounts of C. perfringens sialidase. Membrane-disrupting Effect in Liposomes—Unilamellar liposomes composed of cholesterol and either PC or SM (in 1:1 molar ratio) encapsulating carboxyfluorescein were prepared as described (32Jepson M. Howells A. Bullifent H.L. Bolgiano B. Crane D. Miller J. Holley J. Jayasekera P. Titball R.W. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3297-3301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases purified gangliosides were incorporated into the liposomes at concentrations of 100, 33, and 11 μg/ml (which would correspond to PC/ganglioside or SM/ganglioside molar ratios of about 30:1; 90:1, and 270:1). After a 20-min exposure to Cp-PLC (20 μg/ml), fluorescence at 520 nm (excitation at 485 nm) was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent fluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were assayed in triplicate. Carboxyfluorescein release was expressed as a percentage, considering as 100 and 0% the values of liposomes exposed for 1 h to 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C or to borate saline buffer, pH 7.6, respectively. Biosensor Studies—Analysis was performed using a BIAcore 2000 biosensor and the carboxymethyl-dextran-coated sensor chip, CM5, or the lipophilic pioneer L1 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden). GT1b ganglioside was immobilized onto a CM5 surface as described previously (27Catimel B. Scott A.M. Lee F.T. Hanai N. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, ganglioside GT1b was dissolved in 50% methanol/ethanol at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and 50 μl of this solution was diluted (1:3 v/v) in running buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and injected at a flow rate of 5 μl/min over the unmodified surface. The surface was then washed with 10 mm NaOH until a stable base line was obtained (27Catimel B. Scott A.M. Lee F.T. Hanai N. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Approximately 0.12 ng/mm2 (120 RU) was immobilized onto the sensor surface. For immobilization onto the L1 chip, GT1b was incorporated in PC vesicles (100 μg of GT1b/1 mg of PC), and the surface was then washed with 10 mm NaOH to remove unattached vesicles. Approximately 3.0 ng/mm2 (3028 RU) was immobilized onto the sensor surface, whereas PC vesicles (∼3.2 ng/mm2, 3254 RU) were immobilized onto the control surface. mAbs, Cp-PLC, or C-PLC were buffer-exchanged into the biosensor running buffer using a Fast desalt column (PC 3.2/10) connected to a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences).

Cp-PLC or C-PLC were also injected (30 μl and 2.35 and 3.5 mm, respectively) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min over immobilized GT1b ganglioside.

Inhibition of Proteoglycan Synthesis Does Not Affect Cellular Sensitivity to Cp-PLC—To evaluate the role of proteoglycans in the cell sensitivity to Cp-PLC, the following two cell lines having extreme differences in their proteoglycan content due to a genetic reason were used: the proteoglycan-deficient mutant cell line, pgsG-110, which has an impaired activity of"

We have shown that 5-HT4R undergoes rapid and profound homologous uncoupling in neurons. However, no significant uncoupling was observed in COS-7 or HEK293 cells, which expressed either no or a weak concentration of GRK2, respectively. High expression of GRK2 in neurons is likely to be the reason for this difference because overexpression of GRK2 in COS-7 and HEK293 cells reproduced rapid and profound uncoupling of 5-HT4R. We have also shown, for the first time, that GRK2 requirements for uncoupling and endocytosis were very different. Indeed, β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis was observed in HEK293 cells without any need of GRK2 overexpression. In addition to this difference, uncoupling and β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis were mediated through distinct mechanisms. Neither uncoupling nor β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis required the serine and threonine residues localized within the specific C-terminal domains of the 5-HT4R splice variants. In contrast, a cluster of serines and threonines, common to all variants, was an absolute requirement for β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent receptor endocytosis, but not for receptor uncoupling. Furthermore, β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis and uncoupling were dependent on and independent of GRK2 kinase activity, respectively. These results clearly demonstrate that the uncoupling and endocytosis of 5-HT4R require different GRK2 concentrations and involve distinct molecular events.

Among the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) genes, the 5-HT4R gene is one of the largest (700 kb) (7Bender E. Pindon A. van Oers I. Zhang Y.B. Gommeren W. Verhasselt P. Jurzak M. Leysen J. Luyten W.

All of these variants differ at their C termini after a single position (Leu358). They share different sets of Ser and Thr residues in their specific domains and a common cluster of six Ser and Thr residues upstream of the splice site. All are putative sites for G protein receptor kinase (GRK)-mediated phosphorylation. 5-HT4Rs are coupled to the Gs/cAMP/protein kinase A pathway (9Fagni L. Dumuis A. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Other signal transduction pathways have also been reported, but mainly in heterologous transfected cells (2Bockaert J. Claeysen S. Compan V. Dumuis A. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004; 3: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 10Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol.

Sebben M. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 808-816PubMed Google Scholar). Since this early work, very little additional information has been learned about the molecular mechanisms involved in the desensitization of this important receptor. Recently, Ponimaskin et al. (13Ponimaskin E. Dumuis A. Gaven F. Barthet G. Heine M. Glebov K. Richter D.W. Oppermann M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1434-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that 5-HT4(a)Rs are phosphorylated when heterologously expressed in insect cells. This phosphorylation is modulated by palmitoylation of Cys residues present in the C-terminal domain and is unrelated to the weak desensitization observed when the receptor is transfected in COS-7 cells.GPCR activity represents a coordinated balance between molecular mechanisms governing receptor signaling, desensitization, and resensitization (14Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The homologous desensitization of GPCR signaling is a multistep process, classically described by four main events (15Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin.

In the first step, GPCR is uncoupled from the G proteins following stimulation of the receptor by the agonist, resulting in attenuation of the primary response (i.e. second messenger production or channel regulation). In most cases, this process, often called “desensitization,” involves GRKs. However, in some cases, the kinase activity of GRKs is not required (21Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3816-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Receptor/G protein uncoupling is due not only to phosphorylation of the receptor per se, but also to binding of β-arrestins (26Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1980; 255: 7410-7419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is often, but not always, β-arrestin-dependent (17Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol.

The molecular characteristics involved in the interaction between the receptor and β-arrestin determine the particularities of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, recycling, and resensitization (third step) or degradation (fourth step; also called “down-regulation”) (20Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mukherjee C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).GPCRs have been divided into two classes based on their aptitude to bind β-arrestin (33Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Class A receptors (e.g. μ-opioid, β2- and α1B-adrenergic, and dopamine D1 receptors) are defined by the presence of scattered Ser/Thr residues, rapid dissociation of arrestins, and rapid recycling back to the cell surface. Class B receptors (e.g. substance P, angiotensin 1a, and vasopressin-2 receptors) are defined by the presence of clustered Ser/Thr residues, formation of a stable complex with arrestins, and predominant targeting to lysosomes for degradation (down-regulation) (33Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although this model may be applied to many GPCR/arrestin interactions, there are exceptions. For example, a recent study by Tulipano et al. (35Tulipano G. Stumm R. Pfeiffer M. Kreienkamp H.J. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21374-21382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) showed that somatostatin 2a receptors belonging to class B, characterized by stable association with β-arrestin, are rapidly resensitized and recycled back to the plasma membrane, unlike other class B receptors.Molecular processes for GPCR desensitization are pleiotropic and generally receptor-specific. Understandably, studies have been performed in heterologous cell lines because, unlike neuronal cultures, these systems are easily transfected and analyzed in molecular and biochemical terms. However, as recently reviewed, the signaling pathways of a given receptor are highly dependent on the cell line or even the subclone used (36Gray J.A. Sheffler D.J. Bhatnagar A. Woods J.A. Hufeisen S.J. Benovic J.L. Roth B.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Clark R.B. Rich T.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1015-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because the final goal is, of course, to understand what occurs in native tissues, our first goal was to compare the desensitization profile of 5-HT4Rs obtained in colliculus neurons versus heterologous cell lines. A marked difference was found; in colliculus neurons, uncoupling was rapid and intense, whereas it was slow and weak in COS-7 and HEK293 cells. We found that colliculus neurons expressed only GRK2, but at a high density. Overexpression of GRK2 in COS-7 or HEK293 cells was sufficient to observe rapid and marked uncoupling of 5-HT4Rs, as seen in colliculus neurons. This uncoupling was not dependent on the presence of Ser and Thr residues at the specific C-terminal domains, and full uncoupling could be obtained by overexpressing the kinase-deficient GRK2(K220R) mutant. The molecular events involved in the uncoupling step were clearly different from those implicated in endocytosis. Indeed, 5-HT4R endocytosis could be obtained in HEK293 cells without any overexpression of GRK2. This β-arrestin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis required the presence of the cluster of serines and threonines common to all variants and the kinase activity of GRK2. The kinase-deficient GRK2 mutant inhibited β-arrestin-dependent endocytosis, but promoted β-arrestin-independent endocytosis. Thus, desensitization can be further broken down into two independent molecular events, uncoupling and endocytosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Plasmids pRK5-GRK2 and pRK5-DN-GRK2(K220R) (where DN is dominant-negative) were kindly provided by Dr. S.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Lamaze (Institut Curie, Paris, France).Construction of Tagged 5-HT4R cDNAs—The c-Myc-tagged 5-HT4R and Rho-tagged 5-HT4R constructs were described previously (10Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar, 40Adamus G. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1991; 34: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged 5-HT4R cDNAs in pRK5 were generated by fusing the sequence of the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) to a cleavable signal peptide (MVLLLILSVLLLKEDVRGSAQS) derived from the metabotropic glutamate type 5 receptor. This sequence was inserted into the pRK5 vector using XbaI and MluI restriction sites. Then, full-length mouse 5-HT4(a)R, 5-HT4(b)R, 5-HT4(e)R, and 5-HT4(f)R cDNAs were subcloned in-frame using MluI and HindIII.Construction of Truncated and Mutated 5-HT4(a)R cDNAs— Truncated receptor constructs were described previously (10Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, constructs Δ346 and Δ358 were obtained by inserting a stop codon after residue 327, 346, or 358 in the 5-HT4(a)R cDNA sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The same kit was used to replace Ser or Thr residues between positions 347 and 355 with alanine residues to generate the Δ358Ala construct.Antibodies—Anti-GRK4/5/6 monoclonal antibody was generated in the laboratory of Dr. R.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences (Orsay, France).RNA Preparation and Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from colliculus neurons in primary culture using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I from a DNA-free™ kit (Ambion, Cambs, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then used to perform two-step reverse transcription-PCR. Briefly, 1 μg of DNA-free total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 2.5 μm random primers and 0.5 mm dNTP. The resulting cDNA (20 ng) was used as a template for real-time PCR using ABI PRISM 7000 with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix, Applera, Courtaboeuf, France. Standard curves were performed for each 5-HT4R variant by serial dilutions of the corresponding cDNA. Primers were designed with Primer Express™ software (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of all primers used are provided in Supplemental Table 1. PCR was performed in 10 μl in the presence of 300 nm specific primers. Thermal cycling parameters were 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles for 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Data were analyzed with ABI PRISM 7000 SDS software, and the threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated from each amplification plot. Standard curves (Ct value (y) versus log copy number (x)) were used to calculate the relative input amount of mRNA for each variant based on the Ct value (42Bustin S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (3032) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as a percentage of the most abundant variant (5-HT4(b)R). Data are the means ± S.D. of duplicate determinations and are representative of three independent experiments.Cell Cultures and Transfection—Primary cultures of colliculus neurons were prepared as described previously (43Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells dissociated from the colliculi of 14-15-day-old Swiss mouse embryos were plated in serum-free medium in 12-well culture dishes (0.8 × 106 cells/ml, 1 ml/dish). Cultures were maintained for 6 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% H2O, and air. Colliculus neurons were nucleofected using a mouse neuron Nucleofector™ kit (Amaxa Biosystems, Koeln, Germany). One Nucleofection sample contains 5 × 106 cells, 3 μg of HA-tagged or Rho-tagged 5-HT4R cDNA in pRK5, and 100 μl of mouse neuron Nucleofector solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. COS-7 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and antibiotics. They were transfected to 60-70% confluence by electroporation as described previously (10Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 910-920PubMed Google Scholar). Colliculus neurons and transfected COS-7 and HEK293 cells were processed for subsequent experiments: desensitization, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and cell-surface enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Determination of cAMP Production in Transfected Cells—COS-7 or HEK293 cells were transfected with the appropriate cDNA and plated in 24-well plates (70,000 cells/well). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, a 5-min stimulation with the appropriate concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 0.1 mm l-ascorbic acid, and 0.1 mm Ro 20-1724 (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) was performed at 37 °C in 250 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The same volume of Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added to stop the reaction, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Quantification of cAMP production was performed by HTRF™ (homogenous time-resolved fluorescence) using a cAMP dynamic kit (CIS Biointernational, Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Uncoupling of 5-HT4R-stimulated cAMP Production in Colliculus Neurons—To analyze receptor desensitization, neurons endogenously expressing 5-HT4Rs (prepared as described above) were preincubated with 10 μm 5-HT for the indicated time periods (0-2 h). After three washes with culture medium, cAMP accumulation was started by addition of culture medium containing 5-HT (30 μm), isobutylmethylxanthine (1 mm), and forskolin (0.1 μm), and the accumulation was measured for 5 min. Quantification of cAMP production was performed as described under “Determination of cAMP Production in Transfected Cells.”Uncoupling of 5-HT4R-stimulated cAMP Production in the Heterologous System—COS-7 or HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated 5-HT4R construct (wild-type (WT) or mutant) either alone or in combination with GRKs as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were seeded at 0.5 × 106/well on a 24-well plate 1 day prior to the experiment. To analyze receptor uncoupling, cells expressing 5-HT4R in the presence or absence of GRKs were first preincubated with 5-HT (10 μm) for different time periods (uncoupling period). Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline, and cAMP accumulation was initiated by addition of HEPES-buffered saline containing 5-HT (10 μm) with l-ascorbic acid (0.1 mm) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (0.1 mm). The accumulation was measured for 5 min. Quantification of cAMP production was performed as described under “Determination of cAMP Production in Transfected Cells.”Intact Cell 5-HT4R Phosphorylation—To measure phosphorylation of Rho-tagged 5-HT4R in intact cells, transiently transfected COS-7 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 106 cells/dish on 100-mm dishes. The next day, the cells were washed with serum- and phosphate-free DMEM and then labeled with 150 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 90 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were stimulated or not with 10 μm 5-HT for 10 min as indicated in the figure legends. Subsequently, cells were placed on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm disodium pyrophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g. Soluble proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 8 μg of anti-Rho tag monoclonal antibody. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washes with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE; the gel was dried; and 32P was detected by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax MS film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France).Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were used for microscopy because of their favorable morphology for comparison of the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane distribution of proteins. Cells overexpressing YFP-tagged β-arrestin-2 or c-Myc-tagged 5-HT4R were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated glass coverslips and incubated in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Thirty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved overnight. To visualize c-Myc-tagged receptors, cell-surface receptors were labeled with 1 μg/ml anti-c-Myc antibody 9E10 for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with serum-free medium and stimulated with 10 μm 5-HT in the same medium at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody at 2 μg/ml. After extensive washes, the coverslips were mounted onto slides using Mowiol mounting medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot 2 microscope with Zeiss ×63 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lenses. Excitation and emission filters for the different labeled dyes were as follow: YFP (green), λex = 450-490 nm and λem = 520 nm; and Alexa Fluor 594 (red), λex = 546 nm and λem = 590 nm. Analysis of endocytosis in colliculus neurons was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. Rho-tagged 5-HT4Rs were labeled with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Rho antibody. Secondary labeling was carried out with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody. Slides was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser. Series of optical sections were obtained with a step of 0.30 μm. For receptor recycling experiments, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium after stimulation. Cells were then incubated in DMEM for different times of recycling before fixation.Immunoblotting—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using a Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Cell-surface ELISA—HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged 5-HT4R alone or in combination with GRK2, GRK2(K220R), dominant-negative β-arrestin-(319-418), or dominant-negative dynamin(K44A) as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated 96-well plates in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were stimulated or not with 10 μm 5-HT in serum-free medium at 37 °C. After one wash, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum (blocking buffer). Cells were then incubated with anti-HA antibody at 0.6 μg/ml for 30 min in the same buffer. After four washes with blocking buffer, cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody at 1 μg/ml for 30 min. After extensive washes, chromogenic substrate (SuperSignal® ELISA femto maximum sensitivity substrate, Perbio, Brebières, France) was added. Chemiluminescence was detected and quantified using a Wallac Victor2 luminescence counter. For each experiment, mock conditions corresponding to cells transfected with empty vector were included. The level of receptors at the cell surface was expressed as a percentage of the residual surface receptor relative to the maximum detected before any treatment.Data Analysis—The dose-response curves were fitted using Graph-Pad Prism and the following equation for monophasic dose-response curves: y = (ymax - ymin)/(1 + (x/EC50)nH) + ymin, where EC50 is the concentration of the compound necessary to obtain 50% of the maximum effect"

However, the precise biological functions of its products remain unknown. To investigate the role of EWS-Fli1 in cell growth signaling, we transfected Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells with short interfering RNAs for EWS-Fli1. EWS-Fli1 knockdown reduced cell growth and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced activation of the growth signaling enzymes. Interestingly, phospholipase D2 (but not the PDGF-BB receptor) showed marked down-regulation in the EWS-Fli1-knocked down TC-135 cells compared with the control cells. In Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells, the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of growth signaling involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Akt, p70S6K, and the expression of cyclin D3 were markedly inhibited by transfection with short interfering RNA phospholipase (PL)-D2. The PDGF-BB-induced activation of growth signaling was also suppressed by 1-butanol, which prevents the production of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D (but not by t-butyl alcohol), thereby implicating PLD2 in PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in TC-135 cells. These results suggest that EWS-Fli1 may play a role in the regulation of tumor proliferation-signaling enzymes via PLD2 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells.

Ewing sarcoma and other peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors are pediatric malignant solid tumors, >95% of which show the chromosomal translocations t(11;22, q24;q12) or t(21;22, q22;q12), which produce the fusion genes EWS-Fli1 and EWS-erg, respectively (1Arvand A.

Cytogenetic and molecular analyses of these translocation products have revealed that the 5′-region of the EWS gene (from band 22q12) is fused to the 3′-region of either the Fli-1 gene (from band 11q24) or the erg gene (from band 21q22), both of which are members of the ETS family of transcription factors. Less frequent chromosomal translocations involve the same region of the EWS gene and various other ETS genes, such as ETV-1, E1AF, or FEV (1Arvand A. Denny C.T.

We have previously shown that EWS preferentially binds to poly(G) and poly(U) RNA. The binding activity of EWS is located in the RGG box, which is in the carboxyl-terminal region. The amino-terminal region of EWS regulates the RNA binding activity of EWS protein (5Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar). Functional characterization of the EWS-Fli1 and EWS-erg chimeric proteins has suggested that they act as sequence-specific transcriptional activators and are capable of transforming cells (6Bailly R.A.

PLD2 is constitutively active and has been shown to require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate in in vitro systems (13Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem.

Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1674-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanisms that regulate PLD2 activity are still undefined. PLD is thought to be involved in a variety of cellular responses, including cell proliferation and differentiation (15Banno Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Nozawa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A recent report has also implicated PLD in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of cell growth signaling (17Kam Y. Exton J.H. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To improve understanding of the biological function of EWS-Fli1 in terms of cellular growth signal transduction, in the present study we examined the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB signaling pathway in Ewing sarcoma cells transfected with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for EWS-Fli1 and PLD2. We found that EWS-Fli1 plays a role in PDGF-induced signaling by regulating PLD2 expression. Cell Culture—The Ewing sarcoma cell line TC-135 was kindly supplied by Dr. T. J. Triche (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B at 37 °C. Cell Growth Assay—Cell growth was determined by a WST-8 assay kit (Kishida Kagaku, Osaka, Japan). Briefly, cells (5 × 103 cells/well) in 96-well plates were incubated overnight. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with new medium containing U0120, LY294002, rapamycin, or transfection reagent. After 48–96 h of incubation, the WST-8 reagents were added to the culture. After 1 h of incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. All experiments were performed at least three times. siRNA Constructs and Synthesis—The siRNA EWS-Fli1 constructs were prepared as described previously (18Dohjima T. Lee N.S. Li H. Ohno T. Rossi J.J. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 811-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, two sequences were targeted; site I was 5′-AGCTACGGGCAGCAGA/ACCC-3′ (nt 821–841), and site II was 5′-AGCAGA/ACCCTTCTTATGAC-3′ (nt 831–851). We also used an irrelevant (IR) sequence, 5′-AGTCGACGTCAG-CTGAAGGC-3′, as a control. These siRNAs were individually expressed under the influence of the U6 promoter in the pTZU6 + 1 vector. A 23-nt sequence matching human PLD2 (nt 432–454; 5′-GAGACACACAAAGTCTTGATGAGTC-3′) was chosen for PLD2 RNA interference targeting. Sense and antisense RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using a CUGA®7 in vitro siRNA synthesis kit (Nippongene). A 19-nt sequence matching GL3 (nt 155–173) was chosen for GL3 RNA interference targeting as a negative control. Transfection—For transfection, the TC-135 cells were transferred to 6-well or 100-mm plates and grown to 60% confluency. The cells were then transiently transfected with 20 nm siRNA duplex. To determine transfection efficiencies, the cells were cotransfected with the siRNA expression vectors and pLEGFP-N1 (a green fluorescent protein expression construct; BD Biosciences) at a ratio of 9:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's recommended procedure. Measurement of PLD Activity—Subconfluent cells were labeled for 12 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were washed and preincubated in Hepes-Tyrode buffer containing 0.3% 1-butanol (v/v) or 0.3% t-butyl alcohol for 10 min. After the cells had been stimulated with 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB; Pepro Tech EC Ltd, London, UK), the reaction was terminated by removing the assay buffer and then adding 1 ml of an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/methanol (2:5, v/v) mixture to the culture dishes. After extracting the cellular lipids, [3H]phosphatidylbutanol (PBut) was separated by thin layer chromatography and measured as described previously (19Banno Y. Fujita H. Ono Y. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Kuzumaki N. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27385-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—The control and test cells were harvested into ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium cholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4) and sonicated. Protein concentrations were assayed using the Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). The total cell lysates (100 μg protein) were subjected to SDS/PAGE (9% gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk. All proteins were determined by immunoblotting. The EWS-Fli1 fusion protein (68 kDa) was sensitively detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-Fli-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ser473-phosphorylated Akt, Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK1/2, Thr421/Ser424-phosphorylated p70S6K, Akt, ERK1/2, and mouse monoclonal antibody against cyclin D3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the p70S6K platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against PI3K p85 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Mouse monoclonal antibody against actin was obtained from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human PLD2 was prepared as described previously (19Banno Y. Fujita H. Ono Y. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Kuzumaki N. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27385-27391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and antibody against PLD1 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the chemiluminescence kit (ECL® system) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Quantitative changes in luminescence were estimated by densitometry (KODAK 1D image analysis software, EDAS290, version 3.5). Knockdown of EWS-Fli1 Protein by siRNA EWS-Fli1 and Growth Inhibition in TC-135 Cells—To reduce EWS-Fli1 protein expression of EWS-Fli1, two siRNA EWS-Fli1 constructs were cotransfected with an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression vector into Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells. When the expression level of EWS-Fli1 was examined by Western blot analysis using an antibody raised against Fli-1, there was significant loss of EWS-Fli1 protein expression in cells transfected with the siRNAs directed against both site I and site II compared with the control cells. The expression of EWS-Fli1 protein was decreased to 12.3% in site I siRNA-transfected cells and to 14.2% in site II siRNA-transfected cells. (Fig. 1A). When the cell growth in each culture was measured four days after transfection, the cells that had been transfected with the site I siRNA showed inhibition of proliferation to 38.8% of the level seen in those transfected with the irrelevant siRNA. The corresponding percentage for cells transfected with the site II siRNA was 36.7% (Fig. 1B). These results showed that reduction of EWS-Fli1 resulted in growth inhibition of Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells. Characterization of the PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K Activation Pathway in TC-135 Cells—It has been reported that PDGF-BB signaling is important for cell proliferation in Ewing sarcoma (20Uren A. Merchant M.S. Sun C.J. Vitolo M.I. Sun Y. Tsokos M. Illei P.B. Ladanyi M. Passaniti A. Mackall C. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that some pathways in growth signaling involving p70S6K depend on stimulants and cell type (21Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The stimulation of the cells with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6K in a time-dependent manner within 30 min. The ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased at 2 min after stimulation with PDGF-BB and peaked at 10 min. The phosphorylations of Akt and p70S6K were significantly increased at 5 min, with a peak response at 10 min (Fig. 2A). To determine the p70S6K activation pathway(s) mediated by PDGF-BB, the effects of inhibitors of PI3K and MEK were examined. Pretreatment of the cells with U0126 (5 μm), an inhibitor of MEK, or LY294002 (10 μm), an inhibitor of PI3K, completely blocked the downstream enzymes ERK1/2 and Akt, respectively. U0126 showed no inhibitory effect on the PDGF-BB-induced Akt phosphorylation. PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K phosphorylation was partially inhibited by both the MEK (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002) inhibitors. Moreover, a combination of the two inhibitors induced an additive inhibitory effect on p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the ERK1/2- and Akt-activating pathways are both partially involved in PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K activation, but that these pathways act independently. It is known that the growth response to p70S6K is dependent on mTOR (21Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Fang Y. Park I.H. Wu A.L. Du G. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Chen J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2037-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 23Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3895-3897PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the role of mTOR in PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K activation, TC-135 cells were treated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. The PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K was indeed down-regulated by rapamycin in a dose-dependent manner, inhibiting ∼90% (Fig. 2C). However, PDGF-BB-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not affected by the inhibitor. This suggests that mTOR acts upstream of p70S6K during PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in TC-135 cells. To examine the effects of signaling pathway inhibitors on TC-135 cell growth, a cell proliferation assay was performed with or without various inhibitors. Signaling pathway inhibitors, such as U0126, LY294002, and rapamycin, partially affected cell growth inhibition, and a combination of the three inhibitors had an additive effect on cell growth inhibition (Fig. 2D). This result shows that these three signaling pathways are important in the PDGF-BB-induced growth of TC-135 cells. PDGF-BB-induced Growth Signaling in TC-135 Cells with EWS-Fli1 Knockdown—As shown in Fig. 1, the growth of TC-135 cells was suppressed in EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells. We then examined the effects of EWS-Fli1 siRNA on PDGF-BB-induced ERK1/2, Akt, p70S6K signaling, and expression of cyclin D3 in TC-135 cells. PDGF-BB-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were diminished in EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells compared with those in control cells (Fig. 3). However, the levels of ERK1/2 and Akt protein were unaffected, confirming the specificity of the siRNAs for EWS-Fli1. PDGF-BB-induced PI3K p85 phosphorylation was also partially suppressed by siRNAs for EWS-Fli1 (data not shown). PDGF-BB-stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation and expression of cyclin D3 were significantly reduced in the EWS-Fli1 knockdown TC-135 cells, although the total protein level remained unchanged. These data suggest that EWS-Fli1 is involved in the PDGF-BB-mediated growth signaling pathways involving ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6K. Down-regulation of PLD2 Expression and PDGF Signaling in TC-135 Cells with EWS-Fli1 Knockdown—It has been reported that activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC-γ1 and PLD plays an important role in PDGF-stimulated intracellular signaling leading to proliferation in various cells (24Alimandi M.

Cancer. 2000; 82: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several reports have suggested that PLDs are involved in the extracellular ligand-induced activation of ERK1/2-, Akt-, and mTOR-mediated growth and survival signaling pathways (28Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

Therefore, we examined the role of PLD in PDGF-BB signaling in TC-135 cells. To examine the subtype of PLD expressed in TC-135 cells, the cell lysates were blotted with specific antibodies against PLD1 and PLD2. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mixed antibodies of PLD1 and PLD2 clearly detected recombinant PLD1a, -1b, and -2, and PLD2 was distinct in TC135 cell lysates, whereas PLD1, which corresponds to PLD1a, was hardly detectable, indicating that PLD2 is the main form expressed in TC-135 cells. Interestingly, PLD2 showed marked down-regulation in the EWS-Fli1 knockdown TC-135 cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B). The expression of PLD2 was reduced to 19.7% by the EWS-Fli1 site I siRNA and to 23.4% by the site II construct. On the other hand, expression of the PDGF receptor (PDGFR) in the EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells did not differ from that in the control cells. To confirm the implication of PLD2 on proliferation signaling, we used PLD2 siRNA. Transfection of TC-135 cells with PLD2 siRNA caused a significant decrease of PLD2 expression (to 30% that of the control) (Fig. 5A). The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was reduced by 30–40% in PLD2 down-regulated TC-135 cells, whereas the expression levels of ERK1/2 and Akt were unaffected (Fig. 5A). A previous study has demonstrated that the level of cyclin D3 protein, known to be an activator of G1–S phase transition in the cell cycle, is aberrantly high in cells overexpressing PLD1 and PLD2 in comparison with control cells (30Min D.S. Kwon T.K. Park W.S. Chang J.S. Park S.K. Ahn B.H. Ryoo Z.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee Y.S. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of P70S6K was further decreased to 40% of the control, and cyclin D3 expression was further reduced (to 50% of the control) in PLD2 down-regulated TC-135 cells compared with the control cells. These data suggested that PLD2 could play a role in growth signaling involving p70S6K and cyclin D3 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells. In fact, PLD2 siRNA exerted a strong influence on suppression of cell growth in Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells (Fig. 5B). Effect of PLD Inhibitor on PDGF-BB-induced ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6K Activation in TC-135 Cells—To examine the activation of PLD in response to PDGF-BB in TC-135 cells, we determined cellular PLD activity by measuring the formation of PBut in the presence of 1-butanol via the trans-phosphatidylation reaction in cells prelabeled with [3H]palmitic acid. As shown in Fig. 6A, when the TC-135 cells transfected with siRNA for IR were stimulated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) for 10 min, PBut formation was significantly increased (2.5-fold). In TC-135 cells transfected with siRNA for EWS-Fli1 site I, PDGF-induced PBut formation was largely reduced, suggesting that EWS-Fli1 was involved in regulation of PDGF-induced PLD activation. To examine the involvement of PLD in PDGF-BB-induced growth signaling activation in TC-135 cells, we examined the effects of treatment with 1-butanol (which is an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid formation by PLD activation and t-butyl alcohol), negative control on PDGF-BB-induced ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6K activation, and expression of cyclin D3. Pretreatment of the cells with 1-butanol (0.3%) completely abolished PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and the decrease of cyclin D3 expression, whereas t-butyl alcohol (0.3%) had no effect (Fig. 6B). The PDGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was partially suppressed by 1-butanol. These results further suggested that PLD is implicated in PDGF-BB-induced growth signaling in TC-135 cells. PDGF-BB-induced Growth Signaling in Ewing Sarcoma Cells—Recent studies have shown that aberrant fusion products from the chromosomal rearrangements seen in Ewing sarcoma and PNET may be responsible for these malignancies (1Arvand A.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5859-5863PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that knockdown of the fusion protein EWS-Fli1 by siRNAs directed against specific sites in its gene caused a significant reduction in cell growth. A recent study has demonstrated that expression of β-PDGFR, which is a functional and potentially crucial component of the signaling pathway, is important for the growth of Ewing sarcoma cells (20Uren A. Merchant M.S. Sun C.J. Vitolo M.I. Sun Y. Tsokos M. Illei P.B. Ladanyi M. Passaniti A. Mackall C. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, we observed that there was no significant difference in PDGFR expression between EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells and the control TC-135 cells. Constitutive ERK1/2 activation is also evident in several human Ewing sarcoma-derived cell lines (31Silvany R.E. Eliazer S. Wolff N.C. Ilaria Jr., R.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and ribosomal p70S6K is known to be important for growth signaling (21Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism underlying the inhibition of cell growth caused by EWS-Fli1 knockdown, we examined the signaling pathway stimulated by PDGF-BB in TC-135 cells. In TC-135 cells, the PDGF-BB-induced growth signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of p70S6K was inhibited by the inhibitors LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), U0126 (a MEK inhibitor), and rapamycin (a mTOR inhibitor), suggesting that at least three independent signaling pathways (the MEK-ERK1/2-p70S6K, PI3K-Akt-p70S6K, and mTOR-p70S6K pathways) are mediated by PDGF-BB in TC-135 cells (Fig. 7). In fact, the combination of LY294002 with U0126 caused additive inhibition of PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K phosphorylation. These PDGF-BB-mediated signaling pathways were suppressed by transfection of TC-135 cells with EWS-Fli1 siRNA. The decrease of p70S6K activation was most evident in EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 has been reported in PDGF-BB-stimulated Ewing sarcoma cells (20Uren A. Merchant M.S. Sun C.J. Vitolo M.I. Sun Y. Tsokos M. Illei P.B. Ladanyi M. Passaniti A. Mackall C. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2334-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Our previous study has demonstrated down-regulation of PLC-β in Ewing sarcoma cells transfected with an antisense EWS-Fli1 sequence, whereas there was no apparent difference in PLC-γ1 (27Dohjima T. Ohno T. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Wen-yi Y. Shimizu K. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the PLC-γ signaling pathway may not be involved in growth signaling of EWS-Fli1. The Relationship between EWS-Fli1 and PLD Expression in Cell Growth Signaling—Numerous studies have suggested that PLD might be involved in tumorigenesis (15Banno Y. J. Biochem.

For example, enhanced expression and increased activity of two PLD isoforms have been found in cancer cells and tissues (33Noh D.Y. Ahn S.J. Lee R.A. Park I.A. Kim J.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee K.H.

We have observed that ADP-ribosylation factor-activated PLD activity was transiently increased in regenerating liver nuclei and that PLD2 levels were markedly elevated in the nuclei of hepatoma and kidney tumor cells (35Zhao Y.

There is also evidence that PLD2 levels are markedly elevated in the caveolae of stimulated oncogenic cells and multidrug-resistant cancer cells (37Fiucci G. Czarny M. Lavie Y. Zhao D. Berse B.

J. 2004; 378: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of PLD1 or PLD2 in mouse fibroblasts induces colony formation in soft agar, and both transformants induce undifferentiated sarcoma when transplanted into nude mice (30Min D.S. Kwon T.K. Park W.S. Chang J.S. Park S.K. Ahn B.H. Ryoo Z.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee Y.S. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1641-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated expression of either PLD1 or PLD2 prevents cell cycle arrest induced by high intensity Raf signals (39Joseph T. Bryant A. Frankel P. Wooden R. Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Foster D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and protects actinomycin D-induced apoptosis (38Yamada M. Banno Y. Takuwa Y. Koda M. Hara A. Nozawa Y. Biochem.

A number of studies have demonstrated that PLD directly regulates mTOR/p70S6K signaling (22Fang Y. Park I.H. Wu A.L. Du G. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Walker S.J. Brown H.A. Chen J. Curr.

Nakashima S. Suh P.G. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35622-35628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our finding that the expression of PLD2, the main form of PLD expressed in TC-135 cells, was markedly reduced in EWS-Fli1 knockdown cells raised the possibility that the PDGF-induced growth signaling pathways might be down-regulated by a decrease of PLD2 expression. In PLD2-reduced TC-135 cells induced by transfection with the siRNA, phosphorylation of p70S6K and the level of cyclin D3 expression were further suppressed, suggesting a role of PLD2 in growth signaling in Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells. In fact, the PLD2 siRNA transfection as well as EWS-Fli1 siRNA caused suppression of TC-135 cell growth. The PDGF-BB-mediated growth signaling pathways in TC-135 cells were inhibited by 1-butanol (which inhibits phosphatidic acid formation after PLD activation) but not by t-butyl alcohol. These results obtained with the two types of butanol further support the notion that PLD has a role in the PDGF-BB-induced p70S6K activation pathways involving ERK1/2 and Akt activation in TC-135 cells. Although PLD2 is implicated in EWS-Fli1-induced growth signaling, it cannot be ruled out that PLD1 is involved in PDGF-BB-mediated growth signaling in TC-135 cells, because PLD1 was present in small amounts in TC-135 cells, and the inhibition of growth signaling by 1-butanol was much stronger than that obtained by transfection with PLD2 siRNA. In this study, we demonstrated down-regulation of PLD2 expression in EWS-Fli1 knockdown TC-135 cells, suggesting an association of PLD2 expression with EWS-Fli-1. To gain more insight into the role of EWS-Fli1 in the expression of PLD, we examined the effects of EWS-Fli1 overexpression on the expression of PLD in NIH3T3 cells. Stable cell lines transfected with cDNA encoding EWS-Fli1 or vector alone were established. Significant up-regulation of PLD2 expression was found in EWS-Fli-1-overexpressing cells compared with the vector control. On the other hand, Western blot analysis with the anti-PLD1 antibody showed no significant change of PLD1 expression in both cell lines (data not shown). This result suggests that the promoter region of PLD2 may be regulated by the target sequence of EWS-Fli1 protein. The Effect of cyclin D Expression on Ewing Sarcoma Cells— Some previous studies have shown that EWS-Fli1 is correlated with cyclin D expression (43Zhang J. Hu S. Schofield D.E. Sorensen P.H.

Biol. 2003; 23: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Also, a recent study has demonstrated distinct regulation of D-type cyclins in Ewing tumor cells; in TC-71 Ewing sarcoma cells, inhibition of EWS-Fli1 decreases the level of cyclin D1 but increases that of cyclin D3 (43Zhang J. Hu S. Schofield D.E. Sorensen P.H. Triche T.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 64: 6026-6034Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in TC-135 cells, we showed that cyclin D3 expression was down-regulated by transfection with EWS-Fli1 siRNA. The reason for the difference in cyclin D3 expression between these two cell lines remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, cell- and tissue-specific patterns of D-type cyclin expression have been reported (43Zhang J. Hu S. Schofield D.E. Sorensen P.H. Triche T.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 64: 6026-6034Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Ewing tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas, both the Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways regulate cyclin D expression (43Zhang J. Hu S. Schofield D.E. Sorensen P.H. Triche T.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 64: 6026-6034Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that EWS-Fli1 knockdown caused a decrease of cyclin D3 expression, which may have been due to down-regulation of p70S6K pathways through a decrease of PLD2 expression. Furthermore, PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of PI3K was reduced in cells transfected with EWS-Fli1 siRNA (data not shown). From these results, it may be suggested that EWS-Fli1 regulates cyclin D3 expression by p70S6K through the Ras-ERK, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR growth signaling pathways. In conclusion, the present study using EWS-Fli1 siRNAs has demonstrated that EWS-Fli1 may play a role in regulating the expression of PLD2, which is a critical regulator of proliferation and survival signaling in TC-135 Ewing sarcoma cells. The down-regulation of PLD2 induced by transfection with EWS-Fli1 siRNA may suppress the growth of TC-135 cells. We thank Dr. T. J. Triche (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) for providing the Ewing sarcoma cells, E. Wada for assistance, and our colleagues at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Gifu University School of Medicine, for encouragement."

These lines of evidence suggest that the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides correlates with the progression of NPC1 disease and induces neurodegeneration. However, there is a different viewpoint on the pathogenesis of NPC1 disease; i.e. the continuous defective use of cholesterol in NPC1 neural tissues causes tauopathy (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S.

Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This notion is supported by previous studies showing that there is cholesterol deficiency in cellular compartments including distal axons (18Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4168-4175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), although cholesterol accumulation occurs in the late endosome/lysosomal compartment (4Kobayashi T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) due to a defect in the transport of cholesterol, the source of which is either endogenous synthesis or exogenous uptake. With respect to neuronal gangliosides, a previous study supports the notion that the accumulation of gangliosides causes neurodegeneration (19Walkley S.U. Siegel D.A. Dobrenis K. Zervas M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 845: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas another study indicates that the accumulation of gangliosides is not the cause of neurodegeneration in NPC1 mice (20Liu Y. Wu Y.P. Wada R. Neufeld E.B. Mullin K.A. Howard A.C. Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A recent study has demonstrated that impaired neurosteroidogenesis, due to disordered cholesterol trafficking, affects neuronal growth and differentiation and that allopregnanolone treatment delays the onset of neurological symptoms and lengthens the life of NPC1 mice (21Griffin L.D. Gong W. Verot L. Mellon S.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Our recent study has shown a novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration in NPC1 disease, whereby an increased cholesterol level in mitochondrial membranes adversely affects mitochondrial membrane potential, the synthesis of ATP, and the level of cellular ATP in NPC1 mouse brains and neurons (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). Since mitochondria are a key organelle for steroidogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction may responsible for impaired neurosteroidogenesis. In addition, this also indicates that not whole-cell cholesterol level but rather compartmentor organelle-associated cholesterol level is critical for maintaining neuronal functions. Note that NPC1 disease is an autosomal recessive disease, and heterozygous carriers of NPC1 mutations are not assumed to develop any neurological symptoms during their entire life span, and note that the effect of heterozygous NPC1 mutations on the development of neurological disorders has not been extensively investigated. This is also the case for NPC1+/- mice. However, intermediate abnormalities in terms of cholesterol metabolism have been shown in nonneuronal cells from NPC1 patients (23Kruth H.S. Comly M.E.

In addition, our recent study has demonstrated that NPC1+/- exhibits intermediate dysfunction in the mitochondria of the brains of NPC1+/- mice at 9 weeks of age (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). These lines of evidence have led us to examine whether there occurs neuronal dysfunction or damage in NPC1+/- mouse brains under certain conditions such as aging. In this study, morphological and biochemical studies were performed on brains of aged heterozygous NPC1+/- mice. In contrast to what has been assumed, neurodegeneration as demonstrated by Purkinje cell loss, enhanced phosphorylation of tau, and activated MAPK/ERK1/2 were clearly observed in NPC1+/- mouse brains. It has been assumed that mutant NPC1 heterozygotes do not develop any clinical symptoms; however, these results suggest that heterozygous NPC1 mutations may be a risk factor for tauopathy. Since it is estimated that the incidence of NPC1 disease is as high as 1:150,000 (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3611-3633Google Scholar), the percentage of the total population with the heterozygous NPC1 mutation is estimated to be around 0.5%. Thus, our present results show that heterozygous NPC1 mutations unexpectedly affect brains with aging and thus may lead to the investigation of the link between heterozygous NPC1 mutations and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. BALB/c NPC1NIH Mice—The animal care and experiments using animals performed in this study were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines. BALB/c mice carrying the genetic mutation for NPC1 were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). These heterozygous mice were bred to acquire NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice used in this study. The genotypes of the mice were determined from genomic DNA isolated from tail snip DNA using a PCR-based method and oligonucleotide primers described previously (7Loftus S.K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Gu J.Z. Cummings C. Brown A. Ellison J. Ohno K. Rosenfeld M.A. Tagle D.A. Pentchev P.G. Pavan W.J. Science. 1997; 277: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated using a 1.2% agarose gel. The mice used in this study ranged from 104 to 106 weeks of age. Reagents—The monoclonal anti-phospho-independent tau antibody T46 was obtained from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The monoclonal anti-tau antibodies AT8 (specific for phospho-Ser199 and -Ser202), AT-100 (specific for phospho-Ser212 and -Thr214), AT180 (specific for phospho-Thr231), and AT-270 (specific for phospho-Thr181) were purchased from Innogenetics (Ghent, Belgium). The monoclonal anti-tau antibody SMI31 (specific for phospho-Ser396) was purchased from Sternberger Monoclonals Inc. (Baltimore, MD). The monoclonal anti-tau antibody, PHF-1 (specific for phospho-Ser396 and -Ser404), was kindly provided by Dr. P. Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for phospho-MAPK/ERK1/2 (specific for phospho-Thr202 and -Tyr204), pan-MAPK/ERK1/2, phospho-SAPK/JNK, and pan-SAPK/JNK and a monoclonal antibody recognizing phospho-GSK-3β (specific for phospho-Tyr279 and -Tyr216) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The monoclonal anti-phospho-independent GSK-3β antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit anti-p35 antibody, which reacts with the p35 and p25 regulatory subunits of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The polyclonal anti-calbindin D28K was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal anti-flotillin-1 antibody and anti-β-tubulin antibody were purchased from Covance (Richmond, CA) and BD Transduction Laboratories (San Jose, CA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B and the filipin complex were purchased from Sigma. Histological Analysis—The mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and perfused intracardially with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing heparin (50 units/ml). The brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C and then rinsed with PBS and cryoprotected in a solution of 30% sucrose in PBS. Fixed tissues were sectioned on a semimotorized rotary microtome (LEICA RM2145, Wetzlar, Germany) at 30 μm and processed for immunohistochemistry with the anti-calbindin D28K (1:500) and AT8 (1:500). Immunoreactivity was detected with diaminobenzidine using the ABC Elite kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For cresyl violet staining, slides were immersed in 70, 80, and 95%, ethanol for 5 min each and in 100% ethanol for 5 min and then in xylene for 15 min. The slides were then sequentially immersed back in 100, 95, and 70% ethanol solutions and distilled water for 5 min in each. The slides were stained for 1 min in filtered cresyl violet solution and then briefly rinsed twice in distilled water. They were then sequentially dehydrated again in 70, 80, 95, and 100% ethanol solutions for 2 min each. The slides were placed in xylene for another 10 min and then mounted with Permount. For double fluorescence staining, the sections were treated overnight with calbindin D28K antibody (1:500) and AT-8 antibody (1:500) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with second antibodies, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon International, Temecura, CA) diluted at 1:500, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA) diluted at 1:50, for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector). For costaining with calbindin D28K antibody and filipin, the sections were incubated overnight with calbindin D28K antibody (1:500) at 4 °C overnight, followed by washing three times for 5 min each using 100 μg/ml filipin in PBS and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Fluorescent images were obtained using a model LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a × 63 Plan Apochromat numerical aperture and a 1.4 oil immersion objective. Protein Preparation—The mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation, and their brains were harvested, rinsed in PBS, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cerebrum and cerebellum were separated and homogenized in 10 volumes of Tris-saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl), containing protease inhibitors (Complete™) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μm NaF and 1 mm orthovanadate) using a motor-driven Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored for biochemical analyses. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Determination of ATP Level—ATP level in mouse brain tissues was determined as previously reported (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). In brief, the homogenates of cerebrum and cerebellum were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C and then rinsed three times with PBS. ATP level in these samples was determined using the ATP Bioluminescence Assay kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science). In brief, the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold ATP lysis buffer (100 mm Tris and 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.75), to which 150 μl of boiling ATP lysis buffer was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 min at 99 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Finally, the ATP level was determined by combining 50 μl of the supernatant with 50 μl of the luciferase reagent. After a 20-s delay, chemiluminescence was measured with a 2.6-s integration time using a microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Luciferase activity was expressed in fluorescence units/μg of protein. Determination of ATP Synthase Activity—Brain mitochondria were isolated as previously reported (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). For the determination of ATP synthase activity, 100 μg of mitochondrial protein from each sample was used to measure the rate of ATP synthesized. The reaction was initiated by adding 100 μg of mitochondrial protein into 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm K2HPO4 (pH 7.4) 300 mm d-mannitol, 10 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. After 1 min, 10 μl of ADP (50 μm) was added, and the intensity of bioluminescence was recorded at 37 °C, where peak height was proportional to the amount of ATP synthesized. Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins separated using 4-20% gradient Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (Dai-ichi Pure Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For the detection of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used in conjunction with SuperSignal chemiluminescence (Pierce) to obtain images on the film. Preparation of Raft Fractions—Detergent-insoluble membrane raft fractions were obtained according to the established method previously reported (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). One milliliter of each fraction was sequentially collected from the top of the gradient. The extraction of lipids and the subsequent determination of the amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids in each sample were carried out according to previously described methods (29Michikawa M. Fan Q.W. Isobe I. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Lipid Analysis—The levels of cholesterol and phospholipids in the samples were determined using enzymatic methods. Cholesterol level was determined using a cholesterol determination kit, LTCII (Kyowa Medex, Tokyo), whereas phospholipid level was determined using a phospholipid determination kit, PLB (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Detection of GM1 Ganglioside—For the detection of GM1 ganglioside, samples from each fraction were dissolved in equal volumes of Laemmli buffer. They were then subjected to 4-20% gradient Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (Dai-ichi Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.). The separated GM1 ganglioside was transferred onto an Immobilon or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) with a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) using a transfer buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol). The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B (Sigma) (final concentration of 42 ng/ml) overnight at 4 °C. In between steps, the membranes were washed four times with PBS-T for 15 min. Bound cholera toxin was detected using Super Signal Chemiluminescence (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out using Stat-View computer software (Macintosh version 5.0, Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA). A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. Cholesterol Accumulation in Brains of Aged NPC1 Heterozygous Mouse—The brains of NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 24, 40, and 104-106 weeks of age were isolated, and the levels of cholesterol and phospholipids were determined. The cholesterol levels in the cerebrum and cerebellum of the NPC1+/- mice were significantly elevated compared with those in the same brain areas of the NPC1+/+ mice at 104-106 weeks of age (Fig. 1a), whereas the cholesterol levels were similar in the two groups at 24 and 40 weeks of age (Fig. 1a). The phospholipid levels were similar in the two genotypes at every age examined (Fig. 1b). The filipin and calbindin staining of brain samples (the third lobe of each cerebellum) prepared from the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 104 weeks of age shows that cells exhibiting a strong filipin-positive signal in the NPC1+/- cerebellar section (from the third lobe) are also calbindin-positive, whereas the calbindin-positive cells in the NPC1+/+ cerebellar section exhibit a very weak signal for filipin staining (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that cholesterol accumulation occurs in Purkinje cells of aged NPC1+/- mouse cerebellum. Purkinje Cell Loss in Aged NPC1 Heterozygous Mice—The cerebellums of NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 104-106 weeks of age were immunohistochemically analyzed using the anti-calbindin antibody, which specifically recognizes Purkinje cells. The number of anti-calbindin antibody-positive cells decreased in the NPC1+/- cerebrum (Fig. 2, d-f) compared with that in the NPC1+/+ cerebellum (Fig. 2, a-c), suggesting that Purkinje cell loss occurred in the aged NPC1+/- cerebellum. However, this was not the case for the NPC1+/- cerebellum at 24 and 40 weeks of age (data not shown). Next, the number of anti-calbindin antibody-positive cells in each lobe of the cerebellums of the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 104-106 weeks of age was determined. The number of Purkinje cells was significantly decreased in first + second, third, seventh, and eighth lobes of NPC1+/- cerebellum compared with those of NPC1+/+ cerebellum (Fig. 2g). Hyperphosphorylation of Tau in NPC1+/- Mouse Brain—Since neurodegeneration found in the NPC homozygous mouse brain is accompanied by hyperphosphorylated tau (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Bu B. Li J. Davies P. Vincent I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6515-6525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sagittal sections of the brains were immunohistochemically stained using the anti-phospho-tau antibody AT-8. AT-8 stained neurons strongly in the cerebral cortices and hippocampus of the NPC1+/- mice (Fig. 3, b and d) compared with those of the NPC1+/+ mice (Fig. 3, a and c). For cerebellar sections, double staining using anti-calbindin antibody was performed. The Purkinje cells demonstrated as being calbindin-positive were very faintly stained with AT-8 in the aged NPC1+/- mouse cerebellum, whereas calbindin-positive Purkinje cells were also AT-8-positive in the aged NPC1+/+ mouse cerebellum (Fig. 3, e-h). The ratio of AT-8-positive Purkinje cells to total Purkinje cells was very high in NPC1+/- mouse cerebella compared with that of NPC1+/+ mouse cerebella (Fig. 3i). To verify that the histologic abnormalities are a result of enhanced tau phosphorylation, immunoblot analysis was conducted using lysates of the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- cerebrums and cerebellums. The antibodies used were T-46, which recognizes phospho-independent tau; AT-8, AT-100, AT-180, AT-270, PHF-1, and SMI-31, which recognize site-specific phosphorylation of tau; and the anti-β-tubulin antibody as an internal standard. The intensities of the signals corresponding to phosphorylated tau demonstrated by AT-8 and AT-100 increased in the cerebrum and cerebellum of the NPC1+/- mice at 104-106 weeks of age compared with those for the NPC1+/+ mice of at the same age (Fig. 4a). However, the intensities of the signals demonstrated by AT-180, AT-270, PHF-1, and SMI-31 did not differ between samples from the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- brains (Fig. 4a). The phosphorylation site of tau in the cerebrums and cerebellums of the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 24 and 40 weeks of age was also determined (Fig. 4, b and c, respectively). The phosphorylation state of tau and the total tau level in both samples demonstrated by AT-8 and T-46 did not differ between the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice (Fig. 4, b and c). MAPK Was Activated in NPC1+/- Mouse Brains—Since our previous reports demonstrated that tau phosphorylation in NPC1-deficient cells is caused by enhanced MAPK activity (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Chang T.Y. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the activity of tau kinases including MAPK was determined. Among the kinases examined, including MAPK/ERK1/2, GSK-3β, JNK, and Cdk5/p25, the levels of phospho-MAPK/ERK1/2 in the cerebrum and cerebellum of the NPC1+/- mice at 104-106 weeks of age increased compared with those for the NPC1+/+ mice (Fig. 5a), whereas the levels of phospho-GSK-3β, -JNK, and Cdk5/p25 remained unchanged (Fig. 5, b, c, and d). The activities of MAPK/ERK1/2 in the cerebrums and cerebellums of the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice at 24 and 40 weeks of age were also determined. The activities of MAPK/ERK1/2 in both samples did not differ between the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice (Fig. 5, e and f). Cholesterol Level in Lipid Rafts Decreased in NPC1+/- Mouse Brains—Because the enhanced MAPK/ERK1/2 activity due to the decreased cholesterol level in the lipid rafts is suggested to induce tau phosphorylation in NPC1-/- mouse brains and NPC1-/- cells (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Chang T.Y. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), lipid compositions in the raft fractions isolated from the cerebral cortices of the NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- mice were analyzed. The raft marker GM1 ganglioside was recovered in fractions 4 and 5, and another raft marker, flotillin-1, was recovered in fraction 5 (Fig. 6c). The cholesterol levels in fractions 4 and 5 isolated from the NPC1+/- brain were significantly lower than those in the same fractions isolated from the NPC1+/+ brain (Fig. 6a), whereas the levels of phospholipids in these fractions showed no significant difference between the two genotypes (Fig. 6b). Level of ATP in NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- Brains—Our previous study demonstrated that ATP levels in NPC1-/- organs including the brain, liver, and muscles as well as in NPC1-/- cultured neurons decrease compared with those in NPC1+/+ organs and neurons (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar); thus, ATP level and ATP synthase activity in the aged NPC1+/+ and NPC1+/- brains were determined. As shown in Fig. 7, ATP levels in the cerebrum and cerebellum of the NPC1+/- mice at 104-106 weeks of age significantly decreased compared with those in the same brain areas of the NPC1+/+ mice (Fig. 7a). ATP synthase activity in the cerebellum of the aged NPC1+/- mice also decreased compared with that of the aged NPC1+/+ mice (Fig. 7b). Here we demonstrate for the first time the unexpected phenomenon that neurodegeneration occurs in aged NPC1+/- mouse brains. This neuronal damage is accompanied by tau hyperphosphorylation and enhanced MAPK/ERK1/2 activity, which are observed in young NPC1-/- mouse brains and NPC1-/- cells (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S.

Gong J.S. Chang T.Y. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The significant accumulation of cholesterol in neurons in the brain and the significant reduction in cholesterol level in raft fractions isolated from aged NPC1+/- cerebrums were also observed. These changes are found to depend on aging in NPC1+/- mice. NPC1 disease is a hereditary disorder that develops in an autosomal recessive manner; thus, it has been assumed that heterozygous carriers of NPC1 mutations do not develop any neurological symptoms during their entire life span (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B. Blanchette Mackie E.J. Pentchev P.G. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3611-3633Google Scholar). It has also been presumed that this is the case for NPC1+/- model mice. Therefore, little attention has been paid to whether NPC1+/- mice develop any symptoms with aging. To our surprise, however, the present study has clearly shown that neurodegeneration demonstrated as Purkinje cell loss accompanied by intracellular cholesterol accumulation and its deficiency in lipid rafts occurs in the aged NPC1+/- mouse brain. A few studies have investigated NPC1 heterozygotes and have shown that NPC1 heterozygotes have “intermediate” abnormalities in cholesterol metabolism at the nonneuronal cell level (23Kruth H.S. Comly M.E. Butler J.D. Vanier M.T. Fink J.K. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16769-16774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Garver W.S. Krishnan K.

These lines of evidence suggest that cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system changes and neurodegeneration accompanied by abnormal tau phosphorylation occurs only in aged NPC1+/- mice. The reason for the change in cholesterol metabolism found only in the aged NPC1+/- brains may be the expression of the NPC1 protein in NPC1+/- brains being approximately half that in NPC1+/+ brains (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which may very slightly affect cellular cholesterol trafficking. As a result, it takes a longer time for neurons to show any abnormalities in terms of cholesterol accumulation in the late endosome/lysosome compartment and the subsequent shortage of cholesterol in other compartments. Since a decreased cellular cholesterol level stimulates MAPK activity (17Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Chang T.Y. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Wang P.Y. Liu P. Weng J. Sontag E. Anderson R.G.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to postulate that a reduced cholesterol level in lipid rafts, due to impaired cholesterol trafficking, increases MAPK activity and enhances tau phosphorylation in aged NPC1+/- brains. This is the case for younger NPC1-/- brains; i.e. neurodegeneration in NPC1-/- brains is linked with an increased MAPK activity and enhanced tau phosphorylation induced by a sustained cholesterol shortage due to the absence of its trafficking (6Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Ninomiya H. Ohno K. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10314-10319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Sawamura N. Gong J.S. Chang T.Y. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1086-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, it is likely that impaired cholesterol trafficking and the resultant intracellular cholesterol accumulation may result in an increased cholesterol level in mitochondria, which induces mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby affecting ATP synthase activity and reducing cellular ATP level, because, as we have reported, both increased and decreased cholesterol level in the mitochondrial membrane cause mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce cellular ATP level, which causes neurodegeneration in the younger NPC1-/- mice (22Yu W. Gong J.S. Ko M. Garver W.S. Yanagisawa K. Michikawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). With these results taken together, it is possible that the altered cellular cholesterol metabolism enhances tau phosphorylation and decreases cellular ATP level, both of which synergistically or independently induce neuronal neurodegeneration. One may raise the questions of what causes neurodegeneration, enhanced tau phosphorylation or low ATP level, and whether these two pathways work independently or dependently. The present study cannot answer these questions. Previous studies demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction with energy depletion causes cell death (33Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lang-Rollin I.C. Rideout H.J. Noticewala M. Stefanis L. J.

However, previous studies showed that there is a correlation between ATP level and the activity of tau kinases including MAPK/ERK1/2 (37Bush M.L. Miyashiro J.S. Ingram V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

These results enable us to assume that mitochondrial dysfunction with a decreased ATP level and the enhancement of tau phosphorylation synergistically contribute to neurodegeneration in aged NPC1+/- mouse brains. Finally, the results of our present study, contrary to what has been assumed, suggest that heterozygous NPC1 mutations are a risk for neuronal impairment. Since the ratio of the population with heterozygous NPC1 mutations is estimated to be as high as 0.5% (1Patterson M.C. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Morris J.A. Carstea E.D. Neufeld E.B.

These issues should be addressed in future studies."

Homodimers of MyoD bind E-box less tightly and are less efficient activators of transcription. Recent results from our laboratory (Yafe, A., Etzioni, S., Weisman-Shomer, P., and Fry, M. (2005) Nucleic Acids Res. 33, 2887–2900) indicate that regulatory sequences of several muscle-specific genes contain a disproportionate high content of guanine clusters that readily form hairpin and parallel-stranded unimolecular and bimolecular tetraplex structures. Here we have shown that homodimers of full-length recombinant MyoD formed complexes with bimolecular tetraplex structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences but not with their double-stranded, hairpin, or unimolecular tetraplex forms. Preferential binding of homodimeric MyoD to bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures over E-box DNA was reflected by the 18.7–39.9-fold lower dissociation constants, Kd, of the MyoD-tetraplex DNA complexes. Conversely, MyoD-E47 heterodimers formed tighter complexes with E-box as indicated by their 6.8–19.0-fold lower Kd relative to complexes with bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures. Similarly, homodimers of the 60-amino acid basic helix-loop-helix domain of MyoD bound E-box more efficiently and tetraplex DNA less efficiently than homodimers of full-length MyoD. It might be that the favored binding of MyoD homodimers to tetraplex DNA structures lowers their ability to activate muscle-specific gene transcription, whereas the formation of MyoD-E47 heterodimers and their preferential binding to E-box DNA enhance transcription.

The development of skeletal muscle from pluripotent mesodermal stem cells involves multiple consecutive steps. At first, cells commit to myogenic precursors and proliferate as myoblasts. In a following differentiation step, myoblasts cease to divide, begin to express muscle-specific genes, and finally fuse to form fully differentiated syncytial myotubes (1Tajbakhsh S. Curr. Opin.

Four myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), 1The abbreviations used are: MRF, myogenic regulatory factors; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; sMtCK, sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase. MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4, regulate the coordinated activation of multiple muscle-specific genes during myogenesis. These transcription factors comprise a subgroup within the superfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins (for review see Ref. 3Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of the various MRFs in the germ line of mice indicated that the commitment of proliferating somitic cells to the myogenic lineage is controlled by MyoD and Myf-5 (4Braun T.

The HLH section of the bHLH domain is responsible for oligomerization of MRF proteins, whereas its basic region is required for their specific binding to DNA (11Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Heterodimers of MyoD with the bHLH proteins E12, E47, and ITF1 were found to be formed at a greater efficiency than homodimers of MyoD (Refs. 11Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H.

BioEssays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Studies of differentiation in vitro revealed that heterodimers of MyoD with E12 or E47 proteins activated transcription by their binding to a conserved E-box motif, d(CANNTG), in the promoter or enhancer regions of muscle-specific genes. Also, the affinity of MyoD-E12 heterodimers for E-box was significantly higher than that of their respective homodimers (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V.

Homodimers of the 60 amino-acid-long protein fragment that spans just the bHLH domain of MyoD were shown to be sufficient for specific DNA binding in vitro (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), and similar to full-length MyoD, they were capable of inducing myogenesis in stably transfected mouse fibroblasts (15Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As originally proposed by Larsen and Weintraub (16Larsen A. Weintraub H. Cell. 1982; 29: 609-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), some regulatory proteins may affect transcription by specifically recognizing altered DNA conformation rather than a nucleotide sequence in B-DNA. In line with this idea, the ability of myogenic proteins to recognize DNA conformations other than double strands was first inferred from the sequence-specific binding of MyoD and of a muscle protein designated MF3 to single-stranded E-box motif (17Santoro I.M. Yi T.M. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). More significantly, recombinant MyoD was reported to form complexes with tetrahelical structures of a guanine-rich mouse creatine kinase enhancer sequence or of Tetrahymena telomeric DNA (18Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements of dissociation constants indicated that the binding of MyoD to tetraplex DNA structures is 4–5-fold tighter than to E-box DNA (18Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reported recently that promoter and enhancer regions of several muscle-specific genes contained segments with a disproportional high frequency of clusters of contiguous guanine residues (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, guanine-rich DNA tracts in the regulatory regions of the muscle-specific genes readily folded into a variety of secondary structures, hairpin and parallel-stranded unimolecular and bimolecular tetraplexes (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine whether these secondary structures may be of potential regulatory significance, we examined in this work the association of MyoD homodimers and MyoD-E47 heterodimers with E-box DNA and with the various secondary structures of guanine-rich muscle gene regulatory sequences. We report that MyoD homodimers specifically bound bimolecular DNA tetraplexes but not single or double strands or hairpin or monomolecular tetraplex structures of the guanine-rich muscle gene DNA sequences. Further, measurements of dissociation constants of complexes of MyoD homodimers with DNA indicated that complexes of this protein with the bimolecular tetraplexes were more stable than its complex with E-box DNA. Conversely, MyoD-E47 heterodimers bound E-box DNA more tightly than bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures. We speculate that the preferential binding of the relatively inactive MyoD homodimers or the transcriptionally active MyoD-E47 heterodimers to tetraplex or E-box DNA, respectively, may contribute to the timed regulation of muscle-specific gene expression during myogenesis. Preparation of Hairpin, Double-stranded, and Monomolecular and Bimolecular Tetraplex DNA Structures—The nucleotide sequences of the synthetic DNA oligomers (Genosys) that are listed in Table I were derived from guanine-rich promoter regions of the genes sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (sMtCK oligomer) or α7 integrin (integrin 26 and integrin 29 oligomers) (see Ref. 19Yafe A.

The single-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled at their 5′-ends by 32P in bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase-catalyzed reaction. Hairpin and monomolecular and bimolecular tetraplex structures of the DNA oligomers were formed as we described (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M.

Sequences of cDNA that encode full-length MyoD protein or its bHLH domain (residues 102–162 of MyoD) in pRK171α vector (23Bengal E. Flores O. Rangarajan P.N. Chen A. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Proc.

The product cDNA molecules were purified (QIAquick; Qiagen) and ligated to XhoI- and EcoR1-digested pGEX-6P vector. The recombinant plasmids were electroporated into Escherichia coli XL-1, and the presence of intact cDNA inserts was verified by determination of their nucleotide sequences. To isolate recombinant MyoD protein and its bHLH domain, pGEX-6P plasmids harboring MyoD or bHLH cDNA were electroporated into competent E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, the bacteria were grown to A600 of ∼0.6 in Luria Bertani medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and synthesis of the glutathione S-transferase-fused proteins was induced by exposure to 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The recombinant proteins were purified to >95% homogeneity from the bacterial cell extracts by glutathione-agarose (Sigma) affinity column chromatography. The glutathione S-transferase residue was cleaved by incubating 100 μg of fusion protein for 4 h and at 4 °C with 2.0 units of preScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay of Protein Binding to DNA and Determination of Dissociation Constants of the Protein-DNA Complexes—Homodimers of MyoD or its bHLH domain or MyoD-E47N heterodimers were formed prior to their binding to the various DNA probes by incubating for 10 min at 37 °C specified amounts of purified recombinant MyoD or bHLH alone or an equimolar mixture of MyoD and E47N in reaction mixtures that contained, in a final volume of 10 μl, 45 mm KCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.5 μg of HeLa whole cell extract protein. Reaction mixtures for protein-DNA binding contained, in a final volume of 10 μl, specified amounts of MyoD or bHLH homodimers or MyoD-E47N heterodimers and 5′-32P-labeled DNA probe, 14.5 mm KCl, 0.45 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.05 μg of HeLa whole cell extract protein. Reaction mixtures for the binding of end-labeled double-stranded E-box DNA or double-stranded forms of the examined guanine-rich myogenic sequences also contained 100-fold (w/w) excess of unlabeled poly d(I-C) (Sigma). Mixtures for the binding of end-labeled bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences contained 100-fold (w/w) excess of unlabeled single-stranded oligomer of the same sequence. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free DNA by electrophoresis at 4 °C and 200–250 V in non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel (acryl/bisacrylamide, 19:1) in 10 mm KCl, 0.25× TBE buffer (1.2 mm EDTA in 0.54 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3). Electrophoresis of the DNA was conducted until a bromphenol blue marker dye migrated 7.5 cm into the gel. In a case that required greater resolution of protein-DNA complexes, (see Fig. 1), electrophoresis was conducted until the marker dye migrated 15 cm into a longer gel. The gels were dried on DE81 filter paper, and the relative proportions of bands of free and protein-bound DNA structures were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. To determine values of dissociation constants, Kd, of complexes of MyoD or MyoD-E47 dimers with E-box DNA or with bimolecular tetraplex structures of guanine-rich muscle-specific DNA sequences, increasing amounts of 32P-labeled DNA were incubated with a constant amount of protein as described above. Following electrophoretic mobility shift resolution of the protein-DNA complexes from free DNA, their relative amounts were determined by phosphorimaging quantification of the dried gel. Kd values were derived from the negative reciprocal of the slope of a Scatchard plot of the results as detailed elsewhere (24Sarig G. Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) MyoD and E47N Proteins Bind E-box and Bimolecular Tetraplex DNA in Their Homodimeric and Heterodimeric Forms— The HLH domains of MyoD or E proteins mediate formation of homodimers of each protein or their association to form heterodimers. We first inquired whether the binding of double-stranded E-box DNA and bimolecular tetraplex structure of integrin 26 DNA is mediated by the monomeric or oligomeric forms of these proteins. Oligomerization of MyoD and E47N was promoted by incubating each protein separately or an equimolar mixture thereof in the presence of a HeLa whole cell extract protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The proteins were subsequently incubated under DNA binding conditions with 5′-32P-labeled E-box DNA or bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA. Formed protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free DNA by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Representative results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 1. These data indicated that both MyoD and E47 formed complexes with the two types of end-labeled DNA. The MyoD-DNA complexes migrated in the gel more slowly than the E47N-DNA complexes, as expected for the 318-amino acid-long MyoD as compared with the 157-amino acid-long E47N (22Sun X.H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Most importantly, incubation of each type of DNA with the mixture of MyoD and E47N yielded protein-DNA complexes that migrated midway between the slower and the more rapid complexes of MyoD and E47N, respectively (Fig. 1). The intermediate electrophoretic mobility of DNA complexes with the mixture of MyoD and E47N strongly suggested that heterodimers of the larger and smaller sized MyoD and E47N, respectively, were responsible for the binding of DNA. Likewise, when compared with the midway migration of these complexes, the slower or more rapid migration of either MyoD or E47N alone, respectively, was consistent with a homodimeric structure of each protein. Homodimeric MyoD Selectively Binds Bimolecular Tetraplex Structures of Muscle-specific Regulatory Sequences—Recently gathered data show that short guanine-rich tracts derived from enhancer or promoter sequences of muscle-specific genes readily folded into hairpin forms or parallel-stranded unimolecular or bimolecular tetraplex structures (19Yafe A.

Also, as was previously demonstrated, MyoD associated with tetraplex forms of sequences of mouse creatine kinase enhancer (18Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or sMtCK promoter (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) more efficiently than with E-box DNA. Because MyoD regulates the transcription of muscle-specific genes whose regulatory sequences formed secondary structures, we compared the binding of homodimeric MyoD to single-stranded, double-stranded, hairpin, or tetraplex structures of these guanine-rich tracts. Increasing amounts of MyoD homodimers were incubated with a constant amount of endlabeled bimolecular tetraplex structures of the integrin 26 or sMtCK DNA oligomers or with the double-strands that these oligomers formed with their respective complementary sequences (see Table I for oligomer sequences). As seen in Fig. 2, MyoD associated avidly with the bimolecular tetraplex structures of both sequences, whereas its binding to the double-stranded forms of both sequences was negligible. As was shown (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the integrin 26 sequence formed a mixture of unimolecular and bimolecular parallel-stranded tetraplexes. Results presented in the upper electrophoretogram of Fig. 2 indicated that, whereas the MyoD homodimers bound bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA efficiently, they did not detectably associate with the unimolecular tetraplex form of this sequence. In other experiments we found that in contrast to the efficient association of MyoD with bimolecular tetraplex sMtCK DNA (Fig. 2), it failed to form complexes with hairpin structures of the same sequence (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, MyoD in its homodimeric state appeared to bind preferentially bimolecular tetraplex structures of guanine-rich tracts of promoter sequences of the muscle-specific integrin and sMtCK genes. Binding of MyoD Stabilizes Tetraplex sMtCK DNA—We next inquired whether the stability of the bimolecular tetraplex structure of a promoter-derived sequence of the muscle-specific sMtCK gene was affected by its association with MyoD. Bimolecular tetraplex structures of the sMtCK DNA oligomer were bound to homodimeric recombinant MyoD to form protein-DNA complexes, whereas control mixtures did not contain MyoD. Aliquots of the binding or control mixtures were either incubated for 10 min each at increasing temperatures or were heated at 50 °C for various periods of time. DNA denaturation was terminated by rapid cooling of the mixtures to 4 °C, the DNA was stripped of bound protein by 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and bimolecular tetraplex sMtCK DNA was resolved from denatured single-stranded sMtCK DNA by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Data shown in Fig. 3 indicated that the association with MyoD augmented the thermal stability of bimolecular tetraplex sMtCK DNA. In accord with data presented elsewhere (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), results shown in Fig. 3A indicated that free bimolecular tetraplex sMtCK DNA was denatured with an approximate melting temperature, Tm, of 49 °C. However, when its complex with MyoD was similarly heated, the thermal stability of the tetraplex DNA structure was increased significantly such that only 5% of its initial amount was denatured at 52 °C (Fig. 3A). Likewise, whereas ∼50% of the free bimolecular tetraplex sMtCK DNA was denatured after 10 min at 50 °C, almost 100% of the MyoD-bound tetraplex DNA remained heat resistant (Fig. 3B). Bimolecular Tetraplex DNA Is the Preferred Binding Target for Full-length MyoD, whereas E-box DNA Is Favored by Its bHLH Domain—Similarly to full-length MyoD (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D.

Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), its isolated bHLH domain is also capable of activating the muscle differentiation program by associating in a sequence-specific manner with an E-box DNA motif, d(CANNTG) (11Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 15Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Science. 1988; 242: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In view of the capacity of MyoD to bind tetraplex structures of muscle-specific DNA sequences, we compared the relative binding of homodimers of full-length MyoD or its bHLH domain to bimolecular integrin 26 DNA and E-box DNA. Representative results shown in Fig. 4, upper panel, indicated that the full-length MyoD protein formed complexes with tetraplex integrin 26 DNA in preference over E-box DNA. For example, employing the same binding conditions, 30 pmol full-length MyoD bound 22 fmol bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA, but only about 2 fmol E-box DNA. The isolated bHLH domain, however, associated with E-box DNA more avidly than with the tetraplex DNA. As seen in Fig. 4, 30 pmol bHLH bound 22 fmol E-box DNA and 13 fmol bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA. Thus, relative to full-length MyoD, bHLH bound E-box DNA at an ∼10-fold greater efficiency, whereas its capacity to bind the bimolecular tetraplex DNA structure was decreased by close to 2-fold. The preferential avidity to bimolecular tetraplex DNA that marked full-length MyoD was lost therefore by the isolated bHLH domain, mainly because of its greatly increased affinity for E-box DNA. Unlike MyoD homodimers, MyoD-E47 Heterodimers Favor E-box DNA over Bimolecular Tetraplex DNA—Homodimers of MyoD are formed at a lower efficiency than its heterodimers with the bHLH proteins E12 or E47 (12Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Further, transcription of muscle-specific genes is enhanced more effectively by MyoD-E47 heterodimers than by MyoD homodimers (14Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 23Bengal E. Flores O. Rangarajan P.N. Chen A. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6221-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We therefore next compared the affinities of MyoD homodimers or MyoD-E47N heterodimers for E-box DNA and for bimolecular tetraplex structures of promoter sequences of two muscle-specific genes. To this end, we determined values of dissociation constants, Kd, of complexes of MyoD homodimers or heterodimers with the various DNA structures. Representative results shown in Fig. 5 illustrate the distinct affinities of MyoD homodimers or heterodimers for a representative bimolecular tetraplex DNA structure. The homodimeric MyoD possessed a significantly higher affinity for bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA than the MyoD-E47N heterodimer. This was reflected by a 10-fold higher Kd value of the complex of the tetraplex DNA with MyoD-E47N heterodimer relative to MyoD homodimer (Fig. 5, D and B, respectively). In contrast to the preferential binding of MyoD homodimers to tetraplex DNA (Figs. 2 and 4), representative results shown in Fig. 6 indicated that MyoD-E47N heterodimers had a significantly higher affinity for E-box DNA than for bimolecular tetraplex DNA. As observed in this experiment, the Kd value of the MyoD-E47N heterodimer complex with E-box DNA was >20-fold lower than the Kd of its complex with the bimolecular tetraplex structure of integrin 26-integrin 29 DNA. The disparate preference of MyoD homodimers and heterodimers for tetraplex DNA structures and E-box DNA was established in repeated measurements of Kd values of the respective protein-DNA complexes. Results of these experiments summarized in Table II showed that the average dissociation constant of the complex of E-box DNA with MyoD homodimers was 55-fold higher than the Kd value of its complex with MyoD-E47N heterodimer. Conversely, MyoD homodimers bound bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures more tightly than E-box DNA. Thus, the Kd values of complexes of MyoD homodimers with bimolecular tetraplex structures of the sMtCK, integrin 26, and integrin 26-integrin 29 DNA sequences were 4.9–7.8-fold lower than dissociation constants of the respective complexes with MyoD-E47N heterodimers (Table II). In sum, these results clearly indicated that MyoD homodimers associated preferentially with bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures of muscle-specific regulatory sequences, whereas E-box DNA was a preferred target for the binding of MyoD-E47N heterodimers.Fig. 6MyoD-E47N heterodimers bind E-box DNA more tightly than a bimolecular integrin 26-integrin 29 DNA tetraplex structure. MyoD-E47N heterodimers that were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” were incubated under DNA binding conditions with the indicated increasing amounts of 5′-32P-labeled E-box DNA or a bimolecular tetraplex structure of integrin 26-integrin 29 DNA. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved from free DNA by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and their relative proportions were determined by phosphorimaging analysis as described in the legend to Fig. 5. A, phosphorimage of electrophoretically resolved complexes of E-box DNA with MyoD-E47N heterodimers.

A starting point to this work was the reported tight binding of the master transcription factor MyoD to tetrahelical structures of guanine-rich tracts in the muscle creatine kinase enhancer sequence or telomeric DNA (18Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the higher affinity of MyoD for tetrahelical DNA than for its E-box target sequence (18Walsh K. Gualberto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) raised the possibility that tetraplex structures in DNA may contribute to the regulation of the transcription of muscle-specific genes. Involvement of tetraplex DNA structures in gene transcription is not without precedents. Evidence indicates that a tetrahelical DNA domain formed upstream to the P1 promoter of c-myc suppressed its expression (42Siddiqui-Jain A. Grand C.L. Bearss D.J. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Gleason-Guzman M. Hurley L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6140-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conversely, tetraplex structures in the human insulin-linked polymorphic region acted to enhance transcription of this gene (47Hammond-Kosack M.C. Dobrinski B. Lurz R. Docherty K. Kilpatrick M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 48Lew A. Rutter W.J. Kennedy G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12508-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recent results from our laboratory showed that promoter or enhancer regions of several muscle-specific genes included tracts rich in guanine clusters that readily folded in vitro into hairpin and parallel-stranded unimolecular and bimolecular tetraplex structures (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Examination of the binding of homodimers of recombinant MyoD to the different secondary structures of these guanine-rich sequences revealed its clear preference for association with bimolecular tetraplex DNA structures. Thus, for instance, homodimeric MyoD efficiently bound bimolecular tetraplex formations of the integrin 26 or sMtCK DNA sequences, whereas their double-stranded structures did not form detectable complexes with this protein (Fig. 2). Similarly, neither unimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA (Fig. 2) nor hairpin sMtCK DNA (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) formed detectable complexes with the MyoD homodimers. The tight association of MyoD with bimolecular integrin 26 DNA was manifested by the significant increase in the thermal stability of the protein-bound tetrahelix (Fig. 3). Most interestingly, however, the binding of MyoD homodimers to bimolecular tetraplex DNA was tighter than to the E-box DNA motif. Results illustrated in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table II indicated that the dissociation constants of complexes of homodimeric MyoD with bimolecular tetraplex structures of the integrin and sMtCK DNA sequences were 18.7–39.9-fold lower than the Kd value of its complex with E-box DNA. However, heterodimers of MyoD with E47N displayed a converse relative affinity to tetraplex and E-box DNA (Fig. 6 and Table II). Results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that MyoD-E47N heterodimers bound E-box more tightly than MyoD homodimers. The summary of a series of determinations presented in Table II showed a 55.6-fold lower Kd value of complexes of E-box DNA with the heterodimers as compared with complexes with MyoD homodimers. Further, heterodimeric MyoD-E47N formed tighter complexes with E-box DNA than with bimolecular tetraplex structures of the muscle-specific gene sequences. Hence, the dissociation constant of the complex of MyoD-E47N heterodimer with E-box DNA was 6.8–19.0-fold lower than Kd values of its complexes with the various tetraplex DNA structures (Fig. 6 and Table II). Interestingly, the relative binding of dimers of the bHLH domain of MyoD to the different DNA structures was more similar to that of the MyoD-E47N heterodimer than to homodimeric MyoD. Results presented in Fig. 4 indicate that E-box DNA was bound by bHLH at an ∼10-fold higher efficiency than by full-length MyoD. Conversely, bHLH bound bimolecular tetraplex integrin 26 DNA at an ∼2-fold lower efficacy than the full-length protein. The in vitro generated bimolecular tetraplex structures of the integrin 26 and sMtCK DNA oligomers cannot exist in vivo as each sequence is represented by a single copy in the genome. However, guanine-tetrad-stabilized tetraplex structures could potentially be formed by the pairing of two hairpin structures of two different adjacent guanine-rich sequences in single-stranded DNA. The feasibility of such a scenario was demonstrated by the generation of a bimolecular tetraplex involving the 26- and 29-mer integrin promoter sequences that are located 85 bases away from one another in the genome (19Yafe A. Etzioni S. Weissman-Shomer P. Fry M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2887-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, bimolecular-like tetraplex structures may potentially be formed in vivo when two such adjacent sequences fold in single-stranded stretches of regulatory regions of DNA. If indeed bimolecular-like tetraplex structures are generated in vivo in regulatory regions of muscle-specific genes, what role could they play in the regulation of transcription? Whereas homodimers of MyoD were found to be weak activators of transcription, binding of MyoD heterodimers with E12 or E47 proteins to the E-box motif is the major stimulator of muscle-specific gene transcription (14Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 23Bengal E. Flores O. Rangarajan P.N. Chen A. Weintraub H. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6221-6225Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Competition of MyoD homodimers with its heterodimers on E-box occupancy could diminish the timed gene activation during muscle differentiation. Trapping of homodimeric MyoD by tetraplex DNA structures could act to limit its association with the E-box element and thus prevent untimely or inefficient expression of muscle-specific genes. A recent study suggested that the association of MyoD in myoblasts with histone deacetylase 1 was involved with the silencing of the myogenin gene (49Mal A. Harter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1735-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It could be that MyoD homodimers bind to tetraplex DNA in complex with histone deacetylase 1. Such association could further minimize the ability of homodimeric MyoD to activate transcription. When heterodimers of MyoD and an E protein are formed, the association of the protein with the tetraplex DNA is weakened and the protein is allowed to bind tightly to E-boxes and to initiate activation of gene transcription. The formation of the heterodimers could also lead to the release of associated histone deacetylase 1 and to recruitment of histone acetylases to the heterodimer-bound myogenic promoters. It is tempting to speculate that the release of homodimeric MyoD from its complex with tetraplex DNA might be affected by specialized DNA helicases (20Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 39Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Maizels N. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the dynamics of these events during cell differentiation and how chromatin of an entire gene locus responds to signal transduction processes.

Epigenetic processes involve the establishment of patterns of gene expression via the coordinated and heritable alterations in chromatin structure. These alterations involve a change in the covalent modification of histone N-terminal tails as well as global reorganization of chromatin architecture, all of which is driven by sequence-specific transcription factors recruiting the enzymatic machinery performing these reactions. Such histone tail modifications are not only able to alter the charge or biochemical surface of the chromatin fiber, but also serve as “docking” sites for transcription factor and chromatin remodeling complexes, thus stabilizing the interaction of such complexes with chromatin templates (1Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). High levels of gene expression go along with an increase in the accessibility of the chromatin of extended genomic regions to nuclease digestion and hyperacetylation of the histone tails of all core histones.

An interesting feature of histone methylation is the fact that, although the same enzyme modifies the histone tails, H3K4 residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated, and such differences are of functional consequence. It was recently shown that di- and trimethylated lysines, but not monomethylated lysines, bind the chromatin-remodeling complex ISWI with high affinity (5Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In turn, it was shown that the presence of any H3K4 methyl mark inhibits the binding of heterochromatic silencing factors (6Santos-Rosa H. Bannister A.J. Dehe P.M. Geli V. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47506-47512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this context several observations are noteworthy. In yeast it was shown that the Set1 methyltransferase enzyme that modifies H3K4 is recruited by the RNA-polymerase II complex and thus leaves a trail of trimethylated histone behind even when transcription has ceased (7Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This is also seen in higher eukaryotes (8Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Myers F.A. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Kouzarides T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the K4-dimethyl mark seems to be regulated differently, because this appears also on non-transcribed genes and may indicate a poised chromatin state. Little is known about the role of H3K4 monomethylated histones at genes of higher eukaryotes and the functional significance of this modification. Our laboratory has been investigating the interplay between developmental gene locus activation, active histone marks, and transcription factor occupancy. As a model system we have adopted the chicken lysozyme locus, which is expressed in myeloid cells. The chicken lysozyme gene is located within a generally DNase I-sensitive chromatin domain that spans 24 kb (9Jantzen K. Fritton H.P. Igo-Kemenes T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6085-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Sippel A.E. Schafer G. Faust N. Saueressig H. Hecht A. Bonifer C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and contains two differentially regulated genes in close proximity: the highly tissue-specific clys gene and the ubiquitously expressed gas41 gene (11Chong S. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, a high level of general DNase I sensitivity at both genes is only observed in lysozyme-expressing cells, and the reason for this puzzling finding is not clear. Constitutive expression of the gas41 is driven by a CpG island with dual origin/promoter function. Lysozyme gene expression in macrophages is controlled by at least five tissue-specifically active cis-regulatory elements, three enhancer elements situated 6.1, 3.9, and 2.7 kb upstream of the transcription start site, a silencer element at –2.4 kb and a complex promoter (12Bonifer C. Jagle U. Huber M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26075-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Priming of chromatin structure as indicated by selective demethylation of DNA, a partial accessibility to transcription factor binding, and changes in DNA topology occurs already in multipotent precursor cells, which do not yet express the gene (13Kontaraki J. Chen H.H. Riggs A. Bonifer C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2106-2122PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Tagoh H. Melnik S. Lefevre P. Chong S. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Blood. 2004; 103: 2950-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis for this observation is unknown. Lysozyme gene expression is first observed in granulocyte-macrophage precursors and in mature macrophages is rapidly induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). As judged by DNase I-hypersensitive site (DHS) mapping, enhancer and promoter elements are only fully active in LPS-treated mature macrophages where maximum level gene expression is observed. At each successive step of the developmental activation of the lysozyme locus, levels of histone H3 (K9 and K14) acetylation at the enhancers are increased and levels of histone H3 (K9) methylation are decreased (14Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, up to date, H3K4 methylation levels were not studied and the dynamics of histone methylation levels at the cis-elements regulating the two juxtaposed gene loci is not known. In the study presented here, we addressed this issue and we also examined how histone methylation levels and chromatin architecture of the entire locus respond to the induction of differentiation and high level expression by external signals. We studied dynamic alterations in chromatin accessibility, linker histone distribution, and the histone methylation status within the lysozyme chromatin domain in lysozyme non-expressing multipotent precursor cells as well as BM2 cells representing monoblast cells, which represent committed macrophage precursor cells. The latter express the lysozyme gene at a low level, can be differentiated into monocytes by treatment with PMA, and can be further differentiated into macrophages by LPS stimulation. Both stimuli are required for maximal lysozyme gene expression. Monomethylation of histone H3K4 in the lysozyme regulatory region is found in undifferentiated monoblasts. Cell differentiation and induced gene expression leads to high levels of H3K4 trimethylation over the coding region. Interestingly, already in lysozyme non-expressing precursor cells histone H1 is depleted at the promoter and is further depleted in a locus-wide fashion in response to PMA, but not LPS treatment. Cell Culture—The chicken monocytic BM2 cell line (16Bagnis C. Cosset F.L. Samarut J. Moscovici G. Moscovici C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 737-743PubMed Google Scholar), HD50 MEP, and HD37 cells (17Graf T. McNagny K. Brady G. Frampton J. Cell. 1992; 70: 201-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 8% fetal calf serum, 2% chicken serum, 75 μg/ml conalbumin (Sigma), 0.03 units/ml insulin, 10–4m β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. When indicated the BM2 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) for 48 h and/or 5 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) for 4 h. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment. First-strand cDNA synthesis from RNA samples was carried out using oligo(dT)15 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 20 μl. PCRs were performed using real-time quantitative PCR (ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with SYBR green. Relative expression was calculated as a ratio of lysozyme or gas41 to β-actin. Primers were designed using Primer Express 1.5 software and primer sequences for the different genes are shown in Supplemental Table 2B. In Vivo Footprinting Analysis—In vivo dimethyl sulfate (DMS) treatment was performed by incubating cells in 0.2% DMS in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K) overnight at room temperature, and genomic DNA was purified by treatment with RNase, organic extractions, and ethanol precipitation. DMS-modified guanines were then cleaved by treatment with piperidine at 0.1 m for 10 min at 90 °C, followed by three lyophilizations in water. DNase I treatment was performed as follows: suspension cells were spun down, whereas the adherent differentiated BM2 cells were first detached with trypsin and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold ψ buffer (11 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 108 mm KCl, 22 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended at 108 cells per ml in ψ buffer containing 1 mm ATP. To 100 μl of this cell suspension, 104 μl of ice-cold buffer, consisting of 77% ψ buffer containing 1 mm ATP, 0.38% Nonidet P-40, and various amounts of DNase I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) was added. After 6 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer and incubated overnight, and DNA was purified. In vitro DNase I samples were generated by essentially the same procedure on purified genomic DNA, except that lower amounts of DNase I were used and incubation was performed on ice for 3 min. For all samples, 1 μg from DMS-treated DNA and 1.5 μg from DNase I-treated DNA were used for LM-PCR. LM-PCR on DMS-treated and DNase I-treated DNA was performed exactly as described previously (14Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Tagoh H. Melnik S. Lefevre P. Chong S. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1721-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, a primer extension reaction with biotinylated primers was carried out using Vent exo-DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Primer extension products were then ligated to linker LP25–21, which consists of a 25-mer (GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC) annealed to a 21-mer (GAATTCAGATCTCCCGGGTCA). After ligation, specific biotinylated products were bound to streptavidin paramagnetic beads (DYNAL) and washed as described by the manufacturer and then subjected to PCR amplification using a nested specific primer and the linker primer (LP25). Primer extension and PCR conditions were optimized for each primer set using a robotic workstation (Biomek 2000, Beckman) and a gradient PCR machine as described in precise detail in a previous study (19Ingram R. Tagoh H. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e1Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PCR products were labeled by primer extension using γ-32P-labeled nested primers and were analyzed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. To analyze the lysozyme promoter, LM-PCR was performed using gene-specific nested primers P1–P3 and P351–P353. LM-PCR on MNase-treated material was performed on a robotic workstation as described in detail before (19Ingram R. Tagoh H. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e1Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA obtained as input samples for ChIP was phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase and directly ligated to the linker, LP25–21. Primer extension was performed by using biotinylated gene-specific primers. Primer extension products were bound to magnetic beads and then amplified by LM-PCR as described above. Primers P1–P3 and P351–P353 and β-actin promoter-specific primers are shown in Supplemental Table 2A. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays and Real-time PCR Analysis—Chromatin immunoprecipitation using sonicated material was performed exactly as previously described (14Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using MNase treated material is described before (20Lefevre P. Bonifer C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). After preclearing, 50 μl of the chromatin preparation was kept as control (Input), and 500 μl was incubated with 1 mg of rabbit IgG (Upstate Biotechnology, 12-370) to estimate the background level for each amplicon (data not shown), anti-histone H3 C-terminal (Abcam ab1791), anti-histone H3 1me-, 2me-, or 3me-Lys-4 (Abcam ab8895, ab7766, and ab8580), histone H1 (Abcam ab7789–250) or anti-histone H3 1me- or 2me-Lys-9 (Abcam ab9045 and ab7312) antibodies. Primers were designed using Primer Express 1.5 software and tested against a standard curve of sonicated genomic DNA. Primer sequences are shown in Supplemental Table S1. PCR signals from immunoprecipitated material were first calculated in percentage of the Input for all primers. To correct for the variation of the quality of different batches of chromatin from different cells and for varying background signals generated by different antibodies, signals were normalized to those obtained with internal control primers such as the hepatocyte-specific gene VLD-Lapo2 primers or primers specific for the coding region of the β-actin gene. Non-normalized data are shown in Supplemental Fig. S2 for five different primers, including primers specific for the control genes. Maximal Expression of the Chicken Lysozyme Gene Requires Both PMA-mediated Monocytic Differentiation and LPS Signaling—In previous studies we measured transcription factor occupancy and chromatin structure in retrovirally transformed cell lines representing different stages of myeloid differentiation (16Bagnis C. Cosset F.L. Samarut J. Moscovici G. Moscovici C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 737-743PubMed Google Scholar, 17Graf T. McNagny K. Brady G. Frampton J. Cell. 1992; 70: 201-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Beug H. von Kirchbach A. Doderlein G. Conscience J.F. Graf T. Cell. 1979; 18: 375-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and identified the transcription factors binding to the different cis-regulatory elements by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and in vivo footprinting experiments. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 1A. Fig. 1B depicts the cell models used in this study. These include multipotent progenitor cells (HD50 MEP) as well as HD37 representing a non-macrophage cell type (erythroblasts). HD50 myl cells represent bi-potent granulocyte-macrophage precursors. BM2 cells are v-myb-transformed committed macrophage precursors (monoblasts). BM2 cells grow in suspension and differentiate into adherent monocytes after treatment with PMA and can be further differentiated to activated macrophages after treatment with LPS. We measured lysozyme and gas41 mRNA expression in the different cell types by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C). gas41 was expressed at low level in all cell types analyzed. In contrast, lysozyme mRNA was not detected in HD37 erythroblasts and HD50 MEP progenitor cells. Un-stimulated BM2 cells showed a low level of expression, which was not significantly increased by treatment with PMA alone, whereas stimulation with LPS alone up-regulated mRNA levels. Treatment with both agonists leads to a synergistic increase in mRNA levels, indicating that both signals are required for high levels of lysozyme gene expression. Developmental Regulation of Histone H3 Lysine 9 and Lysine 4 Methylation Patterns—We next examined the distribution of histone H3K9 methylation and H3K4 methylation across the lysozyme chromatin domain. Using sonicated chromatin, we had previously measured the distribution of Histone H3K9 methylation by ChIP using an antibody that did not distinguish between mono (1me)-, di (2me)-, or tri (3me)-methylated K9. These experiments showed that H3K9 methylation levels were high in HD37 erythroblasts and HD50 MEP progenitor cells, but dramatically decreased in mature macrophages (14Lefevre P. Melnik S. Wilson N. Riggs A.D. Bonifer C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4386-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we asked the question at which stage of macrophage differentiation the H3K9 methyl mark was lost, and we also examined whether H3K9 methylation levels were altered during the differentiation of BM2 monoblasts to activated macrophages. This question is of importance, because the H3K9 methyl mark is very stable (22Bannister A.J. Schneider R. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2002; 109: 801-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and PMA-treated differentiating cells cease proliferating (data not shown). To answer these questions we used antibodies against 1me, 2me, and 3me Lys-9. To increase resolution without having to purify mononucleosomes, we prepared cross-linked chromatin from the indicated cell types (HD37, HD50 MEP, untreated BM2 cells, and BM2 cells treated with LPS, PMA, and PMA plus LPS) and then digested such chromatin preparations with micrococcal nuclease. It has been shown before that this avoids nucleosome movement during the preparation of native chromatin while generating chromatin fragments of mostly nucleosome length (23Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (an example for such a digestion profile can be seen later in Fig. 5D). To be able to normalize signals and to precisely measure the relative representation of each amplicon, this material (input) was subjected to a real-time PCR analysis using 13 primer pairs across the lysozyme chromatin domain, plus different internal control primers. The results of a ChIP experiment with an antibody against H3 1meK9 are depicted in Fig. 2A and show that histones in the lysozyme cis-regulatory elements have already lost most of the H3 1meK9 mark in undifferentiated BM2 cells. The same results were obtained with an antibody against the H3 2meK9 (data not shown), and methylation levels remained low during further differentiation. Significant histone H3K9 methylation was still observed between cis-elements at all stages of differentiation. We could not detect any H3 3meK9 anywhere across the locus (data not shown). No histone H3K9 methylation was seen at the gas41 CpG island, whereas the histones at the promoter of the liver-specific VLDLapo2 gene, which is inactive in all examined cell types, were highly methylated at H3K9 (Supplemental Fig. S2D).Fig. 2ChIP assay using MNase-treated chromatin and examining histone H3 1meK9 (A), H3 1meK4 (B), and H3 3meK4 (C) status during myeloid differentiation. The top part of the figure presents the map of the lysozyme locus with DNase I-hypersensitive sites in white arrows for the cis-regulatory elements and in black for the constitutive DHS corresponding to the gas41 CpG island. A dotted arrow marks the –7.9-kb constitutive DHS. Amplicons are represented by gray and white rectangles for flanking/coding region and cis-regulatory elements, respectively, with the exception of the silencer element which is shown in black. Each chart contains results obtained with one or two different amplicons and with the cells indicated on the x-axis as HD37 (1), HD50 MEP (2), and BM2 (3), and PMA-treated BM2 (4), LPS-treated BM2 (5) and PMA- and LPS-treated BM2 (6). Data are expressed as precipitate/Input (IP/Input) of test amplicons versus precipitate/input for control amplicons (IPc/Inputc) as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” The antibody used is indicated on the left. Results represent the average of at least two independent chromatin preparations assayed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next analyzed H3K4 methylation and performed ChIP assays with antibodies against 1me, 2me, and 3me H3K4. No H3 1meK4 was observed anywhere across clys in lysozyme non-expressing cells (Fig. 2B), but it was present across the entire 5′ regulatory region in lysozyme-expressing cells (even at the far-upstream amplicon at –10 kb), and increased slightly upon cell differentiation. H3 1meK4 levels in the lysozyme coding region were low, and it was absent in the gas41 gene and absent in the 5′ coding region of the β-actin gene (data not shown). H3 2meK4 and 3meK4 patterns were similar to each other, but different to the H3 1meK4 patterns (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, some H3 3meK4 could be found in HD50 MEP cells, but not in HD37 cells, and levels increased during cell differentiation at and in between the cis-elements. H3 3meK4 levels in the coding regions increased parallel to the increase in mRNA levels, which were consistently higher in cells treated with LPS (Fig. 1C). Irrespective of the cell type, H3 3meK4 levels at the gas41 CpG island were significantly higher than in the lysozyme gene and within the lysozyme gene were highest in the coding region. Macrophage Maturation Leads to Site-specific Alterations in Chromatin Architecture and a Gene-wide Depletion of Histone H1—In macrophages, the chicken lysozyme locus is organized in a DNase I-sensitive domain that also harbors the gas41 gene (10Sippel A.E. Schafer G. Faust N. Saueressig H. Hecht A. Bonifer C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously mapped nucleosome positions at low resolution using micrococcal nuclease digestion and have observed a significant reorganization of nucleosomal architecture at specific cis-regulatory elements after the activation of gene expression (24Huber M.C. Kruger G. Bonifer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1443-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the experiments described here we wanted to further investigate this finding and also test whether the increase in general DNase I sensitivity goes along with a loss of the linker histone H1. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig. 3. In the ChIP experiments described above we noticed that not all amplicons were equally represented in the input fraction, indicating significant differences in MNase accessibility and chromatin architecture across the lysozyme locus. Fig. 3A depicts an analysis of the relative representation of input material of cross-linked and MNase-digested chromatin as measured by real-time PCR. From the results depicted in Fig. 3A it is obvious that sequences within the DNase I-hypersensitive cores of the enhancers and the promoter, but not the flanking or coding regions, were becoming progressively under-represented in the Input material the higher the gene was expressed (compare amplicons depicted in white or black to amplicons depicted in gray). The promoter was highly MNase-sensitive over more than 100 bp as measured by looking at two juxtaposed amplicons (–75 to –156 bp (black) and –190 to –255 bp (white)). Interestingly, this under-representation was not seen at the gas41 CpG island, even though this element harbors a constitutive DHS. Control experiments using amplicons in the inactive VLDLapo2 promoter or the active β-actin gene did not yield differences in relative amplicon representation between cell types (Supplemental Fig. S2A). Because it has been documented that MNase can generate single strand cuts on a nucleosomal template (25Modak S.P. Beard P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2665-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the question arose whether this loss of material in the input fraction was due to an increased accessibility within nucleosomes or to nucleosome loss. To this end, we prepared chromatin by sonication and performed a ChIP assay with an antibody against the C terminus of histone H3 (Fig. 3B). Here, input signals for specific fragments were similar for all cell types (Supplemental Fig. S1). This analysis yielded a different picture to that of MNase-digested chromatin. Progressive and significant nucleosome loss as indicated by a decrease in precipitated chromatin with increased expression level was observed at the –6.1-kb enhancer and the –2.7-kb enhancer. This was less prominent at the other cis-elements or was not observed at all (including the VLDLapo2 promoter (Supplemental Fig. S2B)). Interestingly, although we observed a strong reduction of input signal at the promoter after MNase digestion (Fig. 3A), with the same amplicon no difference in H3 content was observed between cell types. This indicated that, although histone H3 was partly removed from a subset of enhancers, the promoter and other elements retained their nucleosomal structure. The reduction in input signal at these elements therefore had to originate from an enhanced accessibility of these nucleosomes to nuclease digestion. Our analysis of linker histone distribution in the different cells types is described in Fig. 3C. These experiments showed that H1 levels at the gas41 CpG island were consistently low. Except for the far-upstream amplicon, a"

Variable subunits dictate subcellular localization and substrate specificity of the PP2A holoenzyme. The Bβ regulatory subunit gene is mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 12, and one of its splice variants, Bβ2, targets PP2A to mitochondria to promote apoptosis in PC12 cells (Dagda, R.

Here, we report that Bβ2 is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane by a novel mechanism, combining a cryptic mitochondrial import signal with a structural arrest domain. Scanning mutagenesis demonstrates that basic and hydrophobic residues mediate mitochondrial association and the proapoptotic activity of Bβ2. When fused to green fluorescent protein, the N terminus of Bβ2 acts as a cleavable mitochondrial import signal. Surprisingly, full-length Bβ2 is not detectably cleaved and is retained at the outer mitochondrial membrane, even though it interacts with the TOM22 import receptor, as shown by luciferase complementation in intact cells. Mutations that open the C-terminal β-propeller of Bβ2 facilitate mitochondrial import, indicating that this rigid fold acts as a stop-transfer domain by resisting the partial unfolding step prerequisite for matrix translocation. Because hybrids of prototypical import and β-propeller domains recapitulate this behavior, we predict the existence of other similarly localized proteins and a selection against highly stable protein folds in the mitochondrial matrix. This unfolding-resistant targeting to the mitochondrial translocase is necessary but not sufficient for the proapoptotic activity of Bβ2, which also requires association with the rest of the PP2A holoenzyme.

The major catalytic (Cα) and scaffolding (Aα) subunits, the α4 regulatory subunit, as well as members of the B, B′, and B″ subunit families are indispensable for mammalian cell viability (4Strack S.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in a non-coding, presumed promoter region of the human Bβ gene, PPP2R2B (13Holmes S.E. O'Hearn E.E. McInnis M.G.

Ross C.A. Margolis R.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 391-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), indicating that proper regulation of Bβ expression is critical for neuronal survival. The Bβ gene gives rise to several N-terminal splice variants, including Bβ1 and Bβ2 (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Schmidt K. Kins S. Schild A. Nitsch R. Hemmings B. Gotz J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2039-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We previously reported that Bβ2 is induced during postnatal brain development. The alternative N terminus of Bβ2 was found to target the PP2A heterotrimer to mitochondria in neuronal cells. Furthermore, transient or stable expression of Bβ2, but not Bβ1, potentiated apoptosis in growth factor-deprived PC6-3 cells (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), a subline of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (15Pittman R.N. Wang S. DiBenedetto A.J. Mills J.C. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3669-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we report that Bβ2 is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) by a previously undescribed mechanism. The N-terminal 26 residues of Bβ2 are sufficient to import green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the mitochondrial matrix, with conserved basic and hydrophobic amino acids playing critical roles. Full-length Bβ2 interacts with the mitochondrial import complex but is arrested at the OMM, unless its β-propeller domain is unraveled by small deletions that disrupt the “Velcro closure” between the first and last propeller blade. A chimeric protein consisting of the matrix import sequence of cytochrome oxidase subunit VIII (COX8) and the prototypical β-propeller of Gβ5 behaves identically, demonstrating that unfolding-resistant translocase targeting may be a general mechanism by which proteins with thermodynamically stable tertiary structures can be directed to the surface of mitochondria. Mitochondrial import of essential proteins appears not be compromised by overexpression of proteins targeted in this manner, judging by a lack of effect on mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability. Our results also constrain the types of tertiary folds that can be adopted by nucleus-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis and Fusion Protein Construction—All deletion and amino acid substitution mutations in Bβ2 were generated by PCR using mutagenic primers harboring restriction sites. PCR products were ligated into unique sites flanking the Bβ2 N terminus (residues 1-35) in the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). Most of the mutations incorporated to the Bβ21-35-GFP fusion protein were transferred into full-length Bβ2-GFP fusion proteins by restriction digest and ligation. N-terminal fusions of GFP with the import sequence of human COX8 (residues 1-31) (16Van Kuilenburg A.B. Muijsers A.O. Demol H. Dekker H.L. Van Beeumen J.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the OMM anchor sequence of yeast MAS70 (residues 1-29) (17McBride H.M. Millar D.G. Li J.M. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were similarly generated by PCR using nested primers encoding the targeting sequences.The cDNA of the Gβ5 short isoform (18Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Rory Fisher (University of Iowa). The full-length coding sequence of Gβ5, the Gβ5 coding sequence lacking the last 8 amino acids (Gβ5ΔC), and the β-propeller domain of Bβ2 (residues 28-447) were inserted between COX81-31 and GFP following PCR with primers carrying unique restriction sites to generate COX8-Gβ5-GFP, COX8-Gβ5ΔC-GFP, and COX8-Bβ-GFP, respectively. MAS70-Bβ was created by insertion of Bβ228-447 between MAS701-29 and GFP. Internal (Δ27-34) and C-terminal deletions (residues 1-311 and 1-437) of Bβ2 with and without N-terminal alanine substitutions (K2A and IL18AA) were created similarly. For luciferase complementation, fusions of an N-terminal fragment (residues 2-416) of Photinus luciferase to the C terminus of Bβ2 (wild-type and K2A mutant) and fusions of the C-terminal luciferase fragment (residues 398-550) to the N terminus of PP2A/Aα and TOM22 were constructed and ligated into pcDNA3.1, featuring an intervening poly(Gly-Ser) linker sequence as described by Luker et al. (19Luker K.E. Smith M.C. Luker G.D. Gammon S.T. Piwnica-Worms H. Piwnica-Worms D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12288-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). All PCR-amplified sequences were verified by automated DNA sequencing.Antibodies—The Bβ2 N terminus-directed polyclonal antibody was previously described (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-FLAG tag, mouse anti-FLAG tag (M2) conjugated to agarose, and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), Sigma, and BD Biosciences, respectively.Confocal Microscopy—PC6-3 cells were cultured in 2-well chambered slides (Nunc) and transfected with deletion and alanine substitution mutants in the context of Bβ21-35-GFP using Lipofectamine 2000 (BD Biosciences) as described previously (9Dagda R.K.

After 2 days, cells were stained with 100 nm MitoTracker dye (Molecular Probes) and imaged “live” with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope at the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Facility.To quantify colocalization of N-terminal Bβ2 mutants with mitochondria, 7-10 randomly selected images (each containing 4-8 transfected cells) were analyzed blind to the identity of the mutant. Each transfected cell was assigned a GFP/mitochondria colocalization score from 0 to 4 (0 = mutual exclusion; 4 = perfect overlap) (20Strack S. McNeill R.B. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23798-23806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Luciferase Complementation—COS-M6 cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with varying ratios of plasmids expressing N- and C-terminal luciferase fragment fusion proteins using Lipofectamine 2000. After 3 days, cells were gently scraped into 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mm d-luciferin. Light emission from the cell suspensions was measured with a tube luminometer (Berthold Sirius). Cells were then lysed and immunoblotted to compare expression levels of the transfected fusion proteins. Cells expressing single luciferase fragments displayed background luminescence.Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay—PC6-3 cells cultured in 2-well chambered slides were loaded 3 days post-transfection with 50 nm of the potential sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Red and green channel confocal images were acquired, and TMRM fluorescence in transfected cells was quantified using National Institutes of Health Image software, dividing the average pixel intensity of the mitochondria-containing cytosol by the background intensity measured within the nucleus (21Frieden M.

Two days post-transfection, cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 and cultured for an additional 24 h in the absence of serum. To include floating cells in the analyses, the chambered slides were centrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 × g prior to fixation of cells with 3.6% paraformaldehyde and staining with the DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml; Sigma).Proteolytic Processing Assay—PC6-3 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-GFP fusion proteins using Lipofectamine 2000 were lysed 3 days later in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine. Lysates were briefly sonicated with a probe tip sonicator and cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min), and expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG tag antibody followed by immunoblotting for GFP. Digital densitometry was performed using National Institutes of Health Image software, dividing the band intensity of the major proteolytic fragment by total GFP immunoreactivity.Mitochondrial Import Assay—Native PC6-3 cells or a PC6-3 cell line that inducibly overexpresses Bβ2 with a C-terminal tandem affinity purification tag (22Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) were transfected with FLAG-GFP fusion proteins and, in the case of the inducible cell line, treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Three days after transfection and/or induction, cells were disrupted by N2 cavitation (1200 p.s.i., 15 min) in disruption buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mmEDTA, and 2 mm EGTA. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by two consecutive centrifugations (800 × g, 5 min). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at high speed (20,000 × g, 15 min) to obtain a crude mitochondrial pellet, which was washed once in disruption buffer. Resupended mitochondrial fractions were incubated with increasing concentrations of trypsin in the presence or absence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in disruption buffer for 25 min at 22 °C with intermittent shaking. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer. In some experiments, cell homogenates were directly digested with trypsin ± Triton X-100 without prior isolation of mitochondria. In this case, reactions were stopped by addition of immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and fusion proteins were isolated with FLAG tag-directed antibodies conjugated to agarose. Mitochondrial fractions or immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for GFP.RESULTSDeterminants of Mitochondrial Localization—A fusion protein of the first 35 residues of Bβ2 to the N terminus of GFP (Bβ21-35-GFP) localizes to mitochondria (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To further delineate critical regions, we carried out a systematic deletion and site-directed mutagenesis screen of the Bβ2 N terminus. The first 26 amino acids of Bβ2, which include the alternatively spliced region plus 2 amino acids shared with Bβ1, were sufficient to accurately localize GFP to MitoTracker-labeled mitochondria of transiently transfected PC6-3 cells. Representative confocal images are shown in Fig. 1A, and quantification of GFP and MitoTracker colocalization from three experiments is graphed in Fig. 1B. Bβ21-19-GFP displayed partial mitochondrial targeting, whereas an additional truncation by 5 amino acids resulted in localization indistinguishable from GFP alone. Deleting residues 1-4 or 3-5 also abrogated colocalization with mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that targeting information is distributed over the length of the divergent sequence of Bβ2.An alignment of Bβ2 orthologs from rainbow trout (Gen-Bank™ accession number CA376753) and mammals (e.g. Gen-Bank™ AY251277) was used as a guide for an alanine scan of the N terminus (Fig. 1C). We found that individual mutations of two conserved basic residues (K2A and R6A) greatly reduced the mitochondrial localization score of the GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 1, A and C). Neutralizing a more C-terminal arginine (R13A), on the other hand, had relatively modest consequences (Fig. 1C). Significantly, alanine or serine substitutions of the conserved Cys3 showed wild-type colocalization scores, ruling out a possible palmitoylation of this residue as contributing to membrane anchoring. The N terminus of Bβ2 is relatively hydrophobic (10 of 24 residues). Replacing single hydrophobic residues with alanine (F4A, Y7A, L8A, Y10A, I11A, and F12A) had little if any effect on mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1C). However, combining mutations of two or three hydrophobic residues (YL7AA, YIF10AAA, IL18AA) strongly impaired mitochondrial association (Fig. 1C). The T17A and LS19AA substitutions also confounded targeting significantly. A triple alanine substitution of residues 3-5 (CFS3AAA) showed only marginally worse targeting than the individual alanine substitutions, but deleting this region altogether (Δ3-5) reduced localization to levels of GFP alone (Fig. 1, A and C). We confirmed the colocalization results by subcellular fractionation, showing that mutating Lys2, but not Cys3, to Ala significantly reduced copurification of Bβ21-35-GFP with mitochondria (Fig. 2A). In aggregate, these experiments reveal the importance of properly spaced basic residues (Lys2 and Arg6), as well as polar and multiple hydrophobic residues.Fig. 2Proteolytic processing of Bβ2 N terminus fusion proteins. A, cytosolic (cyt) and mitochondrial fractions (mito) of PC6-3 cells transiently expressing Bβ21-35-GFP wild-type (w.t.) and substitution mutants were probed with the indicated antibodies. The position of the 31-kDa molecular mass marker is shown. B, the indicated fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates and probed for GFP. In A and B, solid and open arrowheads point to the full-length and major processed fusion protein band, respectively. C, positive correlation (r = 0.93) between mitochondrial localization (data from Fig. 1C) and proteolysis of Bβ2 fusion proteins. Cleavage was quantified by densitometry of GFP blots (see B) and expressed relative to Bβ21-35-GFP wild-type (means ± S.E. from three to four independent experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mitochochondrial Association Determines Proapoptotic Activity—We have previously shown that transient or inducible expression of Bβ2 potentiates apoptosis when PC6-3 cells are deprived of serum (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Bβ1 and a Bβ2 mutant unable to recruit the rest of the PP2A holoenzyme were inactive in this assay. To assess whether the apoptotic activity of Bβ2 depends on the ability of Bβ2 to localize to mitochondria, we introduced several of the alanine substitutions described above into the full-length Bβ2 coding sequence fused to the N terminus of GFP. All Bβ2 mutants could be transiently expressed to levels similar to the endogenous Bα subunit in PC6-3 cells (data not shown). 24 h following serum withdrawal, nuclei of transfected cells were scored for apoptotic morphology (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained when apoptotic cells were detected by annexin-V staining (data not shown). When apoptotic sensitization of each mutant is plotted against its mitochondrial localization score, a positive correlation is apparent (r = 0.74, Fig. 1D). Among the 10 mutants analyzed, the only exception to this rule was Bβ2 CFS3AAA, which localized fairly well to mitochondria but had no detectable proapoptotic activity. Therefore, mitochondrial association is prerequisite for the ability of Bβ2-containing PP2A holoenzymes to promote apoptosis.The Bβ2 N Terminus Is a Cryptic Import Signal—The net positive charge (+4) of the Bβ2 N terminus, as well as the observation that basic and hydrophobic residues are important for mitochondrial targeting, led us to speculate that the N-terminal tail of Bβ2 is a matrix import signal. Most nucleus-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix contain cleavable N-terminal presequences characterized by basic and hydrophobic residues (23Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These presequences are initially recognized by two receptor components of the TOM complex, TOM22 and TOM20, resulting in transfer of the preprotein through the pore-forming subunit TOM40 and the translocase of inner membrane (TIM) complex into the matrix, where presequences are cleaved by the matrix processing peptidase (MPP) (24Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14473-14476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Import is driven by the strongly negative membrane potential of mitochondria acting on the positively charged presequence and by ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by matrix heat shock protein 70 (mtHSP70) to partially unfold the imported protein.Indeed, the MITOPROT signal prediction algorithm (25Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar) assigns a high score to the Bβ2 N terminus and predicts cleavage by MPP after Pro15. Consistent with this prediction, we noted that transiently expressed Bβ21-35-GFP migrates as a doublet of 36 and 34 kDa and that the faster migrating band is enriched in a mitochondrial fraction. Only the upper band that migrates close to the predicted size of the fusion protein is recognized by an antibody raised against the extreme N terminus of Bβ2 (Fig. 2A). Because the Bβ2 N terminus is devoid of internal translation start sites, these data strongly suggest that the lower band is the product of N-terminal cleavage by MPP. Arguing against nonspecific degradation by cytosolic proteases, we observed that only mutants of Bβ21-35-GFP that scored high for mitochondrial colocalization underwent significant proteolytic processing (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantifying N-terminal proteolysis, we found a strong correlation to mitochondrial targeting of the Bβ2 mutants (r = 0.91, Fig. 2C). Positive and negative controls for signal peptide processing by MPP included the import signal of COX8 and the OMM anchor of MAS70, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C).Full-length Bβ2 Is Arrested at the OMM—In contrast to Bβ21-35-GFP, full-length Bβ2 consistently migrates as a single protein species that is immunoreactive with both N and C terminus-directed antibodies (9Dagda R.K. Zaucha J.A. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24976-24985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To resolve this conundrum, we carried out trypsin protection assays to determine the submitochondrial localization of ectopically expressed fusion proteins. Mitochondrial fractions were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. The processed (34-kDa) form of Bβ21-35-GFP is completely resistant to trypsinolysis, unless mitochondria are lysed by the detergent. This result confirms that the Bβ2 N terminus is a mitochondrial import signal. However, even without detergent permeabilization, trypsin degrades the full-length Bβ2 protein as readily as OMM-anchored MAS70-GFP (Fig. 3). Thus, Bβ2 is targeted to mitochondria via an N-terminal import signal but is somehow prevented from entering the matrix.Fig. 3Submitochondrial localization of full-length Bβ2 and Bβ21-35-GFP. Mitochondrial fractions of PC6-3 cells expressing the indicated proteins were incubated ± 1% Triton X-100 and the listed concentrations of trypsin, followed by probing with antibodies directed to GFP (top two panels) and the FLAG tag (Bβ2, bottom panel). The processed form of Bβ21-35-GFP is protected from trypsinolysis of intact mitochondria, whereas full-length Bβ2 and the OMM protein MAS70-GFP are degraded.

The interaction of the translocase with its cargo is necessarily weak and transient and depends on the precise geometry of binding sites distributed over multiple integral membrane proteins. Therefore, rather than coimmunoprecipitation, we employed luciferase complementation as a sensitive in vivo protein-protein interaction assay (19Luker K.E. Smith M.C. Luker G.D. Gammon S.T.

Because under physiologic conditions the two forms are almost equally populated, investigation of thrombin function must address the contribution from the S and F forms and the molecular origin of their differential recognition of ligands. Using a panel of 79 Ala mutants, we have mapped for the first time the epitopes of thrombin recognizing a macromolecular ligand, hirudin, in the S and F forms. Hirudin binding is a relevant model for the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen and PAR1 and is likewise influenced by the allosteric S→F transition. The epitopes are nearly identical and encompass two hot spots, one in exosite I and the other in the Na+ site at the opposite end of the protein. The higher affinity of the F form is due to the preferential interaction of hirudin with Lys-36, Leu-65, Thr-74, and Arg-75 in exosite I; Gly-193 in the oxyanion hole; and Asp-221 and Asp-222 in the Na+ site. Remarkably, no correlation is found between the energetic and structural involvements of thrombin residues in hirudin recognition, which invites caution in the analysis of protein-protein interactions in general.

The serine protease thrombin is a member of the large class of enzymes activated by monovalent cations (1Di Cera E. C. R.

The partitioning of thrombin between these two forms is of physiologic importance because the Na+-bound F form accounts for the procoagulant (cleavage of fibrinogen) and prothrombotic/signaling (cleavage of PAR1 and platelet activation) roles of the enzyme, whereas the Na+-free S form is responsible for the anticoagulant (cleavage of protein C) role (3Dang O.D.

The Na+-dependent allosteric regulation of catalytic activity is shared by other clotting proteases, such as activated protein C (6He X. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

Na+ binding to thrombin increases both the rate of substrate diffusion into the active site and the rate of substrate acylation (2Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 11Krem M.M. Prasad S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40260-40264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The result is that the F form interacts with chromogenic substrates, fibrinogen, and PAR1 with significantly higher kcat/Km compared with the S form (4Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of the S and F forms have helped rationalize this difference (12Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Na+ binding causes rearrangements of residues close to the Na+ site and located up to 15 Å away such as the catalytic Ser-195. The long-range communication of the Na+ effect is ensured by a network of water molecules that embed the Na+ site, the primary specificity pocket, and the active site. Asp-189 at the bottom of the primary specificity pocket is optimally oriented for substrate binding in the F form, but not in the S form. Likewise, Ser-195 is within H-bonding distance of its catalytic partner His-57 in the F form, but not in the S form, which ensures optimal substrate acylation. Whether such changes around Asp-189 and Ser-195 are also responsible for the higher specificity of the F form toward fibrinogen and/or PAR1 remains to be demonstrated. One of the most peculiar features of thrombin and related clotting enzymes is that the strategy of macromolecular substrate recognition involves extended regions of the enzyme, in addition to the active site moiety, where small chromogenic substrates bind (4Di Cera E. Chest. 2003; 124: 11S-17SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Krishnaswamy S. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The observation that the F form cleaves fibrinogen and PAR1 with higher kcat/Km compared with the S form raises the possibility that these other regions contribute to the difference. Ideally, one would like to address this problem using a molecular probe that makes extensive contacts with the surface of thrombin, including regions involved in fibrinogen and PAR1 recognition, and returns information on the conformational changes that accompany the S→F transition. The potent natural inhibitor hirudin binds to thrombin with a Ki in the fm range (14Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and covers >20% of the water-accessible surface area of the enzyme (15Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The high affinity of the interaction makes hirudin a particularly suitable probe for site-directed mutagenesis studies because it can retain significant specificity even in the presence of highly disruptive mutations. The interaction is driven by both electrostatic (16Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Karshikov A. Bode W. Tulinsky A.

Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and nonpolar (21Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9848-9853Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) residues. The compact N-terminal domain of the inhibitor occludes the active site of the enzyme and contacts the 60-loop, the aryl binding site, and the Na+ site (22Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4557-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Wallace A. Dennis S. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 10079-10084Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These are the same regions probed by fibrinogen and PAR1 upon binding to thrombin (24Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18875-18880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Last, but not least, hirudin binding to thrombin is positively linked to Na+ binding (19Ayala Y.M.

Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hence, hirudin mimics important physiologic substrates in their interaction with thrombin, and, at the same time, it is sensitive to structural changes between the F and S forms that are at the basis of the procoagulant, prothrombotic, and signaling functions of the enzyme. In this study we define the boundaries of the epitopes of thrombin recognizing hirudin in the F and S forms using a panel of 79 Ala mutants of residues located in exosite I, exosite II, the S1–S4 sites, the 60-loop, and the Na+ binding site. The results reveal unexpected determinants of recognition and identify residues responsible for the higher affinity of the F form. A total of 79 single Ala mutants of human thrombin were expressed, purified, and tested for activity as described previously (24Ayala Y.M. Cantwell A.M. Rose T. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E.

The new mutants, L99A and I174A, were prepared in this study to target the residues flanking Trp-215 in the aryl binding site and added to the existing panel of 77 mutants used in previous studies (12Pineda A.O.

Both mutants had normal affinity toward Na+, with Kd values of 13 and 11 mm, respectively, compared with 15 mm for wild-type (12Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W.

Highly pure hirudin (HV variant CGP39393, unphosphorylated) was received as a generous gift from Ciba Geigy and Novartis. The chromogenic substrate H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide was obtained from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). For each mutant, the equilibrium dissociation constant Ki for hirudin binding was determined from analysis of progress curves of substrate hydrolysis as a function of inhibitor concentration started by addition of thrombin (14Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 26Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Binding of hirudin to thrombin was measured under conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 8.0, at 25 °C. The value of Ki depends on [Na+] according to the linkage expression (26Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 29Di Cera E.

The value of Ki,S was derived in the presence of 200 mm choline chloride. The value of Ki,F was derived in the presence of 200 mm NaCl using a rearrangement of Eq. 1, i.e.1Ki,F=1Ki+(1Ki−1Ki,S)Kd[Na+](Eq. 2) where Ki refers to 200 mm NaCl, Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for Na+ binding measured for all mutants as reported previously (12Pineda A.O.

Six progress curves of substrate hydrolysis by thrombin were measured in the presence of different concentrations of hirudin, typically in the range of 0–200 nm, depending on the affinity. The concentration of enzyme was typically 100 pm, and the concentration of substrate was 60 μm. The expression used in the analysis of product (P) formation as a function of time (t) was as follows (30Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Cha S. Biochem.

The values of Etot and Itot were determined from direct titrations (32Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. J. Protein Chem. 1994; 13: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and fixed in the data analysis. When these values were floated by allowing for stoichiometric factors (14Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4622-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 30Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1976; 25: 2695-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), they changed minimally from the determined values, and the estimated Ki was within the 5–10% error range of the fit. For each mutant, the values of Km and kcat for the hydrolysis of H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide were determined independently under the same solution conditions used for the hirudin binding assays, using progress curves analyzed by direct integration and correction for product inhibition (33Krem M.M. Di Cera E. Biophys. Chem. 2003; 100: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The values of Km ranged from 0.3 to 10 μm. The parameters γ and λ in Eq. 3 are given by the expressionsγ=EtotItot(1−v∞v0)2(Eq. 6) λ=k111+[S]Km{Etot+Itot+Ki(1+[S]Km)}2−4EtotItot(Eq. 7) where k1 is the second-order rate constant for hirudin binding to thrombin. Eq. 3 contains two independent parameters, k1 and Ki. The value of Ki could be resolved for all mutants, whereas measurements of k1 were not possible for mutants that lacked a transient evolution of the progress curve from the initial value of the velocity v0 to the steady-state value v∞. The parameter Ki was necessary and sufficient to map the functional epitopes of thrombin recognizing hirudin in the S and F forms. The epitopes of hirudin binding to the S and F forms of thrombin were mapped using the strategy recently applied to the study of thrombin interaction with Na+ (12Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A.

Caccia S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7956-7961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The strategy exploits the linkage between binding and site-directed mutation to identify residues that are energetically involved in the recognition process (34Greenspan N.S. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Di Cera E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 59-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ala substitution of a given residue provides an “adiabatic” perturbation that shaves the side chain down to the Cβ atom while retaining the chirality (with the exception of Gly) (36Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Under this assumption, the functional epitope revealed by Ala scans should overlap with the structural epitope determined by crystallographic investigation. In the case of thrombin, mapping of relevant epitopes has so far returned boundaries that are consistent with those defined from x-ray studies (27Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Xu H. Bush L.A. Pineda A.O. Caccia S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7956-7961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent structures of Ala mutants of thrombin have revealed perturbations that are confined to the site of mutation (37Pineda A.O. Chen Z.W. Caccia S. Cantwell A.M. Savvides S.N.

The epitopes for hirudin binding to the S and F forms of thrombin were mapped from measurements of Ki,S and Ki,F for a panel of 79 single Ala mutants. Comparison of these parameters with the values obtained for wild-type returned a map of the residues of thrombin that affect hirudin recognition in the two allosteric forms of the enzyme. Mutations that affected predominantly the S or F form were identified from their perturbation of the value of c (26Ayala Y. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 733-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Guinto E.R. Vindigni A. Ayala Y.M. Dang Q.D. Di Cera E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11185-11189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). When c increases relative to the value seen in the wild-type, the mutation affects a residue that is more important for hirudin recognition by the S form. On the other hand, when c decreases relative to the value seen in the wild-type, the mutation affects a residue that is more important for hirudin recognition by the F form. Seventy-nine residues of thrombin located in exosite I, exosite II, the 60-loop, the specificity sites S1–S4, and the Na+ binding site were targeted by mutagenesis. For each mutant, the value of Ki for hirudin binding was determined in the S and F forms (Table I and Fig. 1 using Eq. 2 and the values of Kd for Na+ binding reported elsewhere (12Pineda A.O.

A structural rendition of the epitopes for hirudin binding is given in Fig. 2. Previous mutagenesis work on hirudin indicated that the inhibitor makes energetically significant contacts with exosite I and the entrance to the active site of the enzyme (20Braun P.J. Dennis S.

No well-defined hot spot for hirudin recognition emerged from these studies, but that could have been precluded by the relatively small number of hirudin residues targeted by mutagenesis. Our mutagenesis study expands the pioneering work by Stone and collaborators (20Braun P.J. Dennis S. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R.

Residues affected by Ala replacement are color-coded based on the log change in the value of Ki for hirudin binding (see Fig. 1): cyan, -0.5/0.5 unit (0.33- to 3-fold); green, 0.5/1.5 unit(s) (3- to 30-fold); yellow, 1.5/2.5 units (30- to 300-fold); orange, 2.5/3.5 units (300- to 3000-fold); and red, >3.5 units (>3000- fold). Residues not subject to Ala scanning mutagenesis are in gray. Note the basic similarity of the epitopes in the S and F forms. In either conformation, thrombin recognizes hirudin mainly at two hot spots, one in exosite I and the other in the 220-loop region. The regions around the active site and the interior of the primary specificity pocket (center) make modest contributions to hirudin binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several regions of thrombin participate in hirudin recognition and, with notable few exceptions, the contributions are energetically similar in the S and F forms of the enzyme. This observation is a further testimony to the basic similarities of the two allosteric forms of thrombin (12Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.-W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Exosite I makes large contributions to binding with the buried ion-quartet Arg-67/Lys-70/Glu-77/Glu-80 standing out in the profile as a hot spot (Fig. 1). The quartet stabilizes the 70-loop (40Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and plays a crucial role in the interaction of thrombin with thrombomodulin (27Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the buried location of the quartet, no appreciable contacts with hirudin are seen in the crystal structure, therefore suggesting that the Ala mutation of any residue in the quartet produces indirect effects by changing the orientation of other residues on the surface of exosite I. In the case of thrombomodulin, mutation of the quartet produced effects similar to mutation of Tyr-76 or Ile-82 that sit right on top of the 70-loop (27Pineda A.O. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32015-32019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the case of hirudin, however, mutations in the quartet are significantly more deleterious than those of Tyr-76 or Ile-82, suggesting that destabilization of the 70-loop extends beyond those residues and that hirudin probes exosite I differently than thrombomodulin. Of the residues in exosite I that make contacts with hirudin, Arg-73, Thr-74, Arg-75, Tyr-76, and Arg-77a together account for 61 of the 70 total contacts < 4 Å (15Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Yet, with the exception of Tyr-76, Ala mutation of any of those residues produces a <100-fold drop in affinity for hirudin, which is significantly smaller than the 10,000-fold drop caused by mutation of Arg-67 and Glu-80 that make no direct contacts with the inhibitor. That is consistent with mutagenesis studies of hirudin that reported only modest (<10-fold) drops in affinity upon mutations of negatively charged residues of the C-tail (16Betz A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, the ionic interactions of the hirudin C-tail with exosite I of thrombin contribute modestly to recognition, whereas hydrophobic interactions involving Tyr-76 correctly stabilized by the ion-quartet buried beneath the surface of the 70-loop provide a more significant portion of the binding free energy. The 60-loop (Trp-60d and Lys-60f) and the adjacent 30-loop (Phe-34, Lys-36, and Glu-39) make 39 contacts < 4 Å with hirudin (15Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, the contacts contribute modestly to recognition (Fig. 1) because Ala mutation of these residues produces a <100-fold drop in affinity. Among all thrombin residues, Trp-60d contributes the largest number of contacts with hirudin (23 total), but Ala replacement of Trp-60d produces a change in affinity of only 20-fold. Although the change is obviously significant, it is well below the level expected from the crystal structure for such large number of contacts and is comparable to that seen upon mutation of residues such as Ser-171 or Arg-187 that make no contacts at all with the inhibitor. Overall, the contribution of the 30- and 60-loops to hirudin recognitio"

How the change in P2X7R permeability is regulated is not known. Here we report that extracellular Cl– (Cl–o) regulates the outward current, whereas extracellular Na+ (Na+o) regulates the inward current of large molecules by P2X7Rs. The P2X7R-mediated current was measured in parotid acinar and duct cells of wild type and P2X7R–/– mice and in HEK293 cells expressing the human or mouse P2X7R isoforms. In symmetrical NaCl, triethylammonium chloride, and NMDG+ chloride solutions, the P2X7R current followed a linear current/voltage relationship. In symmetrical NaCl, removal of Cl–o reduced the inward Na+ current by ∼35% and the outward Na+ current by only 10%. By contrast, in the absence of Na+i and the presence of Na+o or NMDG+o, the removal of Cl–o reduced the inward Na+ or NMDG+ currents by 35% but the outward NMDG+ current by >95%. The effect of Cl–o was half-maximal at ∼60 mm. Reducing Cl–i from 150 to 10 mm did not reproduce the effects of Cl–o. All currents were eliminated in P2X7R–/– cells and reproduced by expressing the P2X7Rs in HEK cells. These findings suggest that Cl–o primarily regulates the outward P2X7R current of large molecules. When cells dialyzed with NMDG+ were stimulated in the presence of Na+o, subsequent removal of Na+o resulted in a strongly outward rectifying NMDG+ current, indicating maintained high selectivity for Na+ over NMDG+. During continuous incubation in Na+-free medium, the permeability of the P2X7Rs to NMDG+ gradually increased. On the other hand, when the cells were incubated in symmetrical NMDG+ and only then stimulated with ATP, the NMDG+ current by P2X7Rs followed a linear current/voltage relationship and did not change with time. These findings suggest that the P2X7R has a “Na+o memory” and that Na+o regulates the inward permeability of P2X7Rs to large molecules. The novel regulation of P2X7R outward and inward permeability to large molecules by Cl–o and Na+o, respectively, may have an important protective function, particularly in secretory epithelial cells.

Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). P2X7Rs participate in several cell functions. Activation of P2X7Rs in hematopoietic cells leads to cytokine release, cell permeabilization, and apoptosis (2Bulanova E. Budagian V. Orinska Z. Hein M. Petersen F. Thon L. Adam D. Bulfone-Paus S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3880-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In bone P2X7Rs have been implicated in the generation of osteoclasts (3Gartland A. Buckley K.A. Hipskind R.A. Bowler W.B. Gallagher J.A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2003; 13: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in epithelial cells they may modulate secretory and growth function (4Dehaye J.P. Moran A. Marino A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: S39-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 5Bradford M.D. Soltoff S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, after prolonged activation with ATP, the P2X7Rs become permeable to large molecules with molecular weights as high as 1000 (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Association between increased permeability to large molecules and induction of apoptosis was reported in several cell types (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells of secretory glands secrete ATP to both the basal and luminal spaces (6Feranchak A.P. Fitz J.G. Semin. Liver Dis. 2002; 22: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Leipziger J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) that can activate the P2 receptors in the respective membranes. Furthermore, neutrophils and epithelial cells (8Brogden K.A. Ackermann M. McCray Jr., P.B. Tack B.F. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2003; 22: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), including salivary glands (9Murakami M. Ohtake T. Dorschner R.A. Gallo R.L. J. Dent. Res. 2002; 81: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), synthesize and secrete the antimicrobial cathelicidins. The cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide LL37 appears to be an activator of the P2X7Rs (10Elssner A. Duncan M. Gavrilin M. Wewers M.D. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4987-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Hence, activation of the P2X7Rs can play an important role in the inflammatory response observed in epithelial autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome (11Yamamoto K. Autoimmun. Rev. 2003; 2: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Understanding the function and regulation of P2X7Rs in epithelial cells is of intrinsic interest and may also impact the understanding of tissue function in normal and pathological states. Like many epithelial cells (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar, 7Leipziger J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F419-F432Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), parotid acinar and duct cells express P2X7Rs (5Bradford M.D. Soltoff S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gibbons S.J. Washburn K.B. Talamo B.R. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 2001; 21: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently, we immunolocalized the P2X7Rs in the luminal membrane of parotid acinar and duct cells (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Similar localization was reported in the pancreatic duct (14Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and uterine epithelial cells (15Slater N.M. Barden J.A. Murphy C.R. Histochem. J. 2000; 32: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas P2X7Rs were found at the basal pole of outer hair cells (16Szucs A. Szappanos H. Toth A. Farkas Z. Panyi G. Csernoch L. Sziklai I. Hear. Res. 2004; 196: 2-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The P2X7Rs showed remarkable cell-specific behavior in native cells (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For example, the first activation of P2X7R current by ATP proceeds very slowly in parotid acinar cells, but duct cells from the same gland respond very rapidly to the first application of ATP. The P2X7Rs appear to interact differentially with the cytoskeleton in parotid acinar and duct cells (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the P2X7Rs in both cell types show similar pharmacology, such as similar activation by ATP, sensitivity to external divalent ions, permeability to Na+, and inhibition by Brilliant Blue G, Cu2+, and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid tetrasodium (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cell-specific behavior of the receptors further highlights the need to understand the function and regulation of the P2X7Rs in native tissues. A central function of salivary glands is Ca2+-stimulated fluid secretion fueled by transcellular ion transport (17Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R.

Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Salivary gland acinar cells secret isotonic NaCl-rich fluid. The duct modifies the electrolyte composition and osmolarity of the secreted fluid by absorbing the Na+ and Cl– and secreting K+ and HCO3− (17Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Textbook of Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1061-1117Google Scholar, 18Melvin J.E. Yule D. Shuttleworth T. Begenisich T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 445-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The function of both cell types is mediated by Cl– and K+ channels. It is well established that the channels in acinar cells are activated by the M3 receptors, which increase [Ca2+]i. However, activation of P2X7 and other P2 receptors expressed in these cells also increases [Ca2+]i, which can then activate the Cl– and K+ channels (4Dehaye J.P. Moran A. Marino A. Arch. Oral Biol. 1999; 44: S39-S43Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Luo X. Zheng W. Yan M. Lee M.G. Muallem S. Am. J.

Diaz J. Zhao H. Muallem S. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ductal secretion is controlled by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is activated by a β-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in cAMP (17Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W.

Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) express additional Cl– and K+ channels that may also be activated by P2 receptors to participate in electrolyte and fluid transport by acinar and duct cells. In this respect, it was reported recently that the stimulation of parotid acinar cells with high concentrations of ATP or 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP activates an apparent Cl– current with a pharmacology different from that of P2X7Rs and from any known Cl– channel, leading to the conclusion that parotid acinar cells express a novel Cl– channel that is activated by high concentrations of ATP (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As part of our effort to understand the role of P2X7Rs in salivary gland physiology, we re-examined the effect of ATP on cation and anion currents in parotid acinar and duct cells of WT and P2X7R–/– cells and in HEK293 cells transfected with the hP2X7Rs and mP2X7Rs. We report that a high concentration of ATP activates only cation current by native P2X7Rs in parotid acinar and duct cells and by recombinant P2X7Rs expressed in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, we discovered novel regulation of P2X7R permeability to large molecules by Cl–o and Na+o, which may have a particular significance in the secretory epithelia that modify the Cl– concentration and osmolarity of the secreted fluid. Materials—The hP2X7R clone was generously provided by Dr. George Dubiak (Case Western University, Cleveland, OH), and the mP2X7R clone was from Dr. Friedrich Haag (Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, Hamburg, Germany). Na+-ATP and Tris-ATP were from Sigma. The following solutions were used in these experiments. The standard bath solution, solution A, contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). ATP was added as 5 mm Na+-ATP. Na+-free bath solution was prepared by replacing all Na+ salts in solution A with NMDG salts, and ATP was in the form of Tris-ATP. Cl–-free media were prepared by replacing all Cl– salts with the respective gluconate salts. Solutions containing various anions were prepared by replacing all Cl– salts with the respective anion salts. The solutions containing tetraethyl ammonium (TEA) were prepared as reported by Arreola and Melvin (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to contain 140 mm TEACl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mmd-mannitol, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, with tonicity of 375 mosmol. The TEA pipette solution contained 140 mm TEACl, 20 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, with tonicity of 335 mosmol. The standard pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The Na+-containing and Na+-free pipette and bath solutions for recording of Na+ or NMDG+ currents, respectively, were identical and contained 150 mm NaCl or 10 mm NMDGCl, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH or NMDGOH). Osmolarity values of all solutions were adjusted to 310 mosmol with the major salt. The P2X7R–/– mice were generously provided by Dr. Christopher Gabel (Pfizer, Groton, Connecticut) and were maintained on standard mice chow per National Institutes of Health regulations. All animal protocols were approved by the animal use committee of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Culture and Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were cotransfected with hP2X7Rs or mP2X7Rs and a plasmid coding for green fluorescent protein. Green fluorescent protein fluorescence was used to identify the transfected cells. Transient transfection was by Lipofectamine. Cells were used 36–48 h post-transfection. Preparation of Single Parotid Acinar and Duct Cells—Parotid acinar and duct cells were prepared by a standard enzymatic digestion as was done previously (23Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I.

Mouse parotid glands were minced and treated with 0.025% trypsin for 7 min at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was terminated by washing the cells with a solution containing 1.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Then the tissue was digested for 20 min at 37 °C with 70 units/ml collagenase CLSPA. The cells were washed, suspended in solution A containing 1.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and kept on ice until use. Current Recording—Current was recorded using the whole cell mode of the patch-clamp technique at the conditions described previously (23Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R.

Tight seals were formed on the cell surface, and the whole cell configuration was obtained by gentle suction. Current was recorded using the Axopatch 200B patchclamp amplifier. Data were collected at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. During whole cell recording the membrane potential was held at –60 or at 0 mV, as specified. The membrane conductance was probed by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of 0 mV to membrane potentials between –80 and +80 mV at 10-mV steps for 200 msec with 500-msec intervals between steps. Current recording and analysis was performed with pClamp 6.0.3 software, and Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were prepared with Origin 7.5.Fig. 2Effect of Cl–o on current by P2X7Rs expressed in HEK cells.

In panels A and C the cells were exposed to different external Cl– concentrations, whereas in panels B and D medium Cl– was replaced with the indicated anions at 150 mm, i.e. gluconate (Glu–), Br–, I–, NO3−, and formate–, and with 90 mm SO4−. The effects of different Cl– concentrations and of the anions are displayed in a 5× expanded current scale.

The current was attributed to Cl–, because the cells and bath solution contained TEA as the major cation and Cl– as the only anion. It was concluded that the Cl– current was not mediated by the P2X7Rs present in these cells based on inhibition of the ATP-activated Na+ current and not of the apparent Cl– current by Cibacron blue 3GA (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We re-examined the current activated by a high concentration of ATP in the same cell type and in parotid duct cells obtained from WT and P2X7R–/– mice. Fig. 1, A and B recapitulate the findings of Arreola and Melvin (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), showing activation by 5 mm ATP of an outward current in parotid acinar cells held at +80 mV and incubated in symmetrical TEACl solutions. Fig. 1, C and D show that similar current can be measured in parotid duct cells. Notably, Fig. 1 also shows that the current measured under these conditions was not present in P2X7R–/– cells, providing the first evidence that the current is mediated by P2X7Rs. The current observed in Fig. 1 can be mediated by the P2X7Rs or by another channel that is activated by the P2X7Rs. To distinguish between these possibilities we tested whether expression of recombinant human and mouse P2X7Rs will result in current with the same characteristics. In preliminary experiments using HEK293 cells transfected with hP2X7Rs and mP2X7Rs and incubated in symmetrical NaCl solutions, we found that the kinetic of activation of the hP2X7Rs and mP2X7Rs by ATP is different and resembles the kinetics that we found in the parotid acinar and duct cells, respectively (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, the first exposure of hP2X7Rs to ATP resulted in slow current activation, but subsequent removals and additions of ATP caused rapid inhibition and activation of the current, as was found in parotid acinar cells (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mP2X7R was rapidly activated upon the first application of ATP, as was found in the parotid duct cells (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that similar behavior is evident when the HEK293 cells expressing hP2X7Rs (panels A and B) or mP2X7Rs (panels C and D) were incubated in symmetrical TEACl solutions and stimulated with ATP. Other observations of note in Fig. 2 are that expression of the P2X7Rs activated an outward current similar to that found in WT cells and that removal of Cl–o partially reduced the outward current (Fig. 2C), as was found in parotid acinar cells (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the findings in Figs. 1 and 2 we conclude that the outward current observed under the conditions of Figs. 1 and 2 and in the previous studies (22Arreola J. Melvin J.E. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) is carried by the P2X7Rs. P2X7Rs Are Not Permeable to Cl–—P2X7Rs function as a non-selective monovalent cation channels. However, shortly after activation they became permeable to large molecules like NMDG+ and YO-PRO-1 (1North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar). P2XRs may also conduct anions, as was reported recently for the permeability of P2X5Rs to Cl– (25Bo X. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. Kim M. Burnstock G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the outward current recorded in the presence of TEACl in parotid acinar and duct cells and in HEK293 cells expressing P2X7Rs can be carried by TEA+ or Cl–. The protocol in Fig. 3 was designed to distinguish between these possibilities. Parotid acinar and duct cells were dialyzed and incubated in the same solution containing 150 mm NaCl, held at –60 mV, and stimulated with ATP. Acinar and duct cells showed the typical slow and fast current activation, respectively, upon the first application of ATP (13Li Q. Luo X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47554-47561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Removal and re-addition of external Na+ (Na+o) showed that under these conditions most of the current was carried b"

Recently, it has been reported that nuclear localization of LIMKs can mediate suppression of cyclin D1 expression. Using immunofluorescence monitoring of enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged LIMK2 in combination with photobleaching techniques and leptomycin B treatment, we demonstrate that LIMK2 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in endothelial cells. Sequence analysis predicted two PKC phosphorylation sites in LIMK2 but not in LIMK1. One site at Ser-283 is present between the PDZ and the kinase domain, and the other site at Thr-494 is within the kinase domain. Activation of PKC by phorbol ester treatment of endothelial cells stimulated LIMK2 phosphorylation at Ser-283 and inhibited nuclear import of LIMK2 and the PDZ kinase construct of LIMK2 (amino acids 142–638) but not of LIMK1. The PKC-δ isoform phosphorylated LIMK2 at Ser-283 in vitro. Mutational analysis indicated that LIMK2 phosphorylation at Ser-283 but not Thr-494 was functional. Serum stimulation of endothelial cells also inhibited nuclear import of PDZK-LIMK2 by protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-283. Our study shows that phorbol ester and serum stimulation of endothelial cells inhibit nuclear import of LIMK2 but not LIMK1. This effect was dependent on PKC-δ-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-283. Since phorbol ester enhanced cyclin D1 expression and subsequent G1-to-S-phase transition of endothelial cells, we suggest that the PKC-mediated exclusion of LIMK2 from the nucleus might be a mechanism to relieve suppression of cyclin D1 expression by LIMK2.

Other studies showed that cell cycle progression depends on the regulated activity of the LIMK-cofilin system (7Amano T. Kaji N. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

The kinase activity of LIMKs is regulated by members of the RhoGTPase family, Rho, Rac, and CdC42, via their downstream protein kinases Rho kinase and p21-activated kinases 1 and 4. These kinases phosphorylate LIMK1 at Thr-508 in the activation loop of the kinase domain (9Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 354: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that LIMKs also have a function in the nucleus. LIMK1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus, when the cells are treated with the CRM1-dependent export inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB) (14Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mouse tissues, various splice forms of LIMK2 have been reported that display an unique cellular localization (15Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Okano I. Mizuno K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ikebe C. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LIMK2a (full-length) and LIMK2b containing only one LIM domain are localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (17Osada H. Hasada K. Inazawa J. Uchida K. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Takahashi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 582-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, tLIMK2 (testis-specific LIMK2 splice form) lacking both LIM domains was found to be preferentially localized in the nucleus (18Takahashi H. Koshimizu U. Miyazaki J. Nakamura T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the LIMK2 knock-out mouse showed a defect in spermatogenesis, suggesting a nuclear function of tLIMK2 in testis (18Takahashi H. Koshimizu U. Miyazaki J. Nakamura T. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of LIMKs has a unique basic amino acid-rich motif between subdomains VII and VIII. The basic nature of this motif suggests that this may function as a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Moreover, LIMK1 has two export signal sequences within the PDZ domain (14Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The NLS and NES might explain the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of LIMK1. A recent study shows that the nuclear localization of LIMKs can mediate suppression of Rac/Cdc42-mediated cyclin D1 expression. This effect of LIMKs was independent of cofilin phosphorylation and regulation of actin dynamics (19Roovers K. Klein E.A. Castagnino P. Assoian R.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 273-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the question of whether LIMK2 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in endothelial cells and explored possible mechanisms of regulation of LIMK2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. We found that LIMK2 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in endothelial cells and discovered that PKC inhibits the nuclear import of LIMK2 by phosphorylating the enzyme at Ser-283. PKC-mediated exclusion of LIMK2 from the nucleus might relieve suppression of cyclin D1 expression, leading to G1 phase cell cycle progression. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and LMB were from Sigma. The recombinant PKCs and the PKC inhibitors Go6976 and Go6983 were from Merck Biosciences GmbH. Anti-cofilin antibody (ACFL02) was from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Anti-phospho-cofilin (Ser-3) antibody, anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate antibody, anti-LIMK1, anti-LIMK2, and anti-phospho-LIMK1/LIMK2 (Thr-504/Thr-508) antibodies, and anti-cyclin D1 antibody were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-EGFP antibody was kindly gifted by Dr. Hans Faix, (Institute of Cell Biology, University of Munich, Munich, Germany). Protein A-Sepharose (P-3391) was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The Pichia pastoris expression kit was from Invitrogen. Construction of the Expression Plasmids—The pUC-SRα-LIMK2 vector containing full-length cDNA of LIMK2 was kindly provided by Prof. Mizuno (Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan). The full-length coding sequence of LIMK2 was amplified by PCR with pUC-SRα-LIMK2 as a template. The PCR-amplified product was cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to obtain LIMK2 fused with EGFP. The full-length cDNA of LIMK1 was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool of human umbilical vein endothelial cell total RNA. The following constructs of LIMK2 and LIMK1 were cloned into EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector: ΔLIM1-LIMK2 (amino acids 69–638), ΔLIM2-LIMK2 (amino acids 72–124 deleted in full-length), PDZ kinase (amino acids 142–638, PDZK), and kinase domain (amino acids 315–638) of LIMK2 and PDZ kinase (amino acids 146–647, PDZK) of LIMK1. The mutants of pEGFP-PDZ kinase (S283A, S283EE, T494A) were generated by the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions. To express recombinant His-tagged LIMK2 in P. pastoris, the PCR-amplified full-length LIMK2 was cloned into pPICZ expression vector by using EcoR1 and NotI sites. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Agowa GmbH Berlin, Germany). Expression of Recombinant LIMK2 in P. pastoris—Expression plasmid pPICZ-LIMK2 was electroporated in P. pastoris strain GS115, and the clone with the highest protein expression was selected as per the manufacturer's instructions. The selected colony of transformed cells was grown in 300 ml of BMGY medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0,1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10–5 (w/v) biotin, and 1% (v/v) glycerol). After 30–36 h of incubation at 28 °C, the cells were pelleted at 1000 × g and were resuspended in BMMY medium (BMGY medium in which the glycerol was replaced by 1% (v/v) methanol) to induce protein expression, and the cells were harvested 24 h later by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed once with ice-cold breaking buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol) and resuspended in breaking buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. An equal volume of acid-washed chilled glass beads (0.5 mm in diameter) was added to the suspension, and cells were disrupted by vigorous vortexing 10 times for 1 min, with intervening 1 min of incubation on ice. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 75,000 × g for 10 min. The clear supernatant was bound to the pre-equilibrated Protino Ni 2000 prepacked (Macherey-Nagel) poly-histidine tag purification column at 4 °C, and His-tagged LIMK2 was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were obtained and cultured as described previously (20Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells harvested from umbilical cords were plated onto collagen-coated (room temperature, 75 μg/ml collagen G; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) plastic culture flasks and were cultured at 5% CO2, and 37 °C in complete endothelial growth medium (Promo Cell, Heidelberg, Germany). In all experiments, human umbilical vein endothelial cells up to third passage were used. Transient transfection of endothelial cells was performed by electroporation as described previously (21Ear T. Giguere P. Fleury A. Stankova J. Payet M.D. Dupuis G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 257: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were grown up to 90% confluency, harvested by trypsin/EDTA (Sigma) treatment, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (1.4 × 106 cells/400 μl) were suspended in electroporation buffer (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm d-glucose, pH 7.0). Plasmid (20 μg in 30–60 μl of electroporation buffer) was mixed with the cell suspension. The cells were incubated for 10 min (room temperature) and then transferred into a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 1000 microfarads and 210 V (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser), 400 μl of complete endothelial growth medium (without antibiotics) was added, and cells were transferred to collagen-coated glass bottom Petri dishes that are designed for confocal microscopy (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). The cells were grown in fresh complete endothelial growth medium for 24 h to obtain subconfluency (washing and replenishment after 1 and 12 h). The transfection efficiency was 30–60%. Immunoprecipitation—Unstimulated and PMA-stimulated endothelial cells washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in an equal volume of 2× immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, Complete mini protease inhibitor, 1 tablet/5 ml (Roche Applied Science), phosphatase mixture 1:100, and 0.1% SDS) for 45 min on ice. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and then 40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry was added to the supernatants and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C to preclear the supernatant. Protein A-Sepharose was prepared by incubating the beads in swelling buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% NaN3) containing 2% bovine serum albumin to block unspecific binding. Precleared supernatants were incubated overnight with anti-LIMK2 antibody (1:50 dilution) followed by the addition of 80 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 25 s and then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold 1× immunoprecipitation lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were further processed for immunoblot analysis. In Vitro Phosphorylation of LIMK2 by PKC—EGFP-LIMK2 and mutant S283A of EGFP-LIMK2 were immunoprecipitated from transfected endothelial cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with PKC kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2). LIMK2 immunoprecipitates or recombinant His-LIMK2 (0.5 μg) were incubated with 0.3 units of different PKC isoforms/ml at 30 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 100 μm ATP, 0.03% Triton X-100, 100 μg of phosphatidylserine/ml, and 20 μg of diacylglycerol/ml. After incubation for 10 min, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling the mixtures for 5 min. The phosphorylation of LIMK2 was analyzed after immunoblotting with antiphospho-Ser PKC substrate antibody. Western Blot Analysis—Unstimulated and stimulated endothelial cells or immunoprecipitate samples were dissolved in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli buffer. Equal amounts of proteins in the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 200 mAmp for 60 min at 4 °C using the Mini Trans-Blot electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk and incubated with the respective primary and secondary antibodies. The dilutions of the primary antibodies were: anti-cofilin (1:12,000) and anti-phospho-cofilin, anti-LIMK2, anti-phospho-LIMK, anti-phospho-Ser PKC substrate antibodies and anti-cyclin D1 antibody (1:1000). The dilution of the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) was 1:5000. The membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). The films were scanned into TIF format using a ScanJet 5300C (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA). Densitometric analysis of the proteins was done using the public domain NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j) software. The calibration to an optical density scale of the scanner was done by using the Kodak step tablet (optical density 0.0–3.0) as a reference image. The densitometric values of phosphorylated proteins were divided by the corresponding values of unphosphorylated proteins, respectively. Absorption of proteins in unstimulated control samples was set to 100%. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. S-phase Analysis of Endothelial Cells—Endothelial cells were growth-arrested in G0/G1 phase by serum starvation (endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.4% serum) for 48 h. The 0-h value refers to the percentage of cells in S phase at this time point. The cells (0.1 × 106cells/well) were plated into a 6-well plate in endothelial cell complete medium (Promocell) or endothelial basal medium containing 5% serum or 200 nm PMA. The cells were harvested at various time points and fixed in ice-cold methanol at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% FCS, and the final pellet was resuspended in buffer (20 μg/ml propidium iodide, 10 μg/ml RNase, 0.1% Triton-X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) and incubated for 1 h. The cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using the cellQuest™ software (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Confocal Microscopy—After 24 h of transfection, cells were transferred into phenol red-free OPTI-MEM®I medium (Invitrogen) and kept for 1–2 h in an incubator. Unstimulated and PMA-stimulated cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The cells were kept under the microscope at 37 °C. The argon laser (488 nm) was used as a light source for EGFP excitation. The microscope function was controlled by a light manager through the software LSM 510 META. For Z-stacking, the top and the bottom positions were selected, and 8–15 slices were determined according to the pinhole size and scanning time. The area and the mean intensity of the EGFP were measured by LSM 510 META software. The measurements were carried out in three independent experiments with 20 cells randomly selected in each experiment. Mean ± S.E. was calculated for each experiment. FRAP and FLIP Analysis—Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) analysis was performed with the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope as described previously (22Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 21.1.1-21.1.24Google Scholar). Briefly, an argon laser with a maximum output of 25 milliwatts was used at 25% capacity. During normal imaging, it was used at 4%. Each image was composed of an average of 4–6 scans. After capture of four initial images, photobleaching was carried out at 100% laser transmission with 20–40 iterations. For FRAP analysis, the entire nucleus was photobleached. The recovery of fluorescence intensity was measured in every 30 s in 12-bit fashion (4,096 gray tones). The average of the area of measurement and intensity was calculated, and the highest value of the four initial images before photobleaching was set to 100% intensity. For FLIP experiments, the settings for image capture were the same as for the FRAP experiments, and images were recorded every 30 s. An area of cytoplasm was repeatedly bleached with 40 iterations at 100% laser transmission. The relative fluorescence in the nucleus of the bleached cell and an adjacent cell (unbleached control) was then measured. LIMK2 Shuttles between the Cytoplasm and the Nucleus—To investigate the intracellular distribution of LIMK2 in endothelial cells, cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding full-length LIMK2 tagged with EGFP. As control, the empty vector EGFP-C1 encoding EGFP protein was transfected into the cells. The EGFP protein was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 1A, panel a), reflecting the unfacilitated diffusion of EGFP (∼27 kDa) through the nuclear pore. The EGFP-LIMK2 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, panel b), and only a small fraction was in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). To determine whether LIMK2 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in endothelial cells, EGFP-LIMK2-transfected endothelial cells were treated with LMB (10 ng/ml), which inhibits the CRM1-dependent export of proteins from the nucleus (23Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 24Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). After LMB treatment, EGFP-LIMK2 localized exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, panel d). The cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP was not affected by the LMB treatment (Fig. 1A, panel c). These results indicated that the cytoplasmic EGFP-LIMK2 continuously enters the nucleus and that CRM1 transports EGFP-LIMK2 actively and continuously out of the nucleus. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of LIMK2 was directly visualized by photobleaching techniques in living endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were transfected with the EGFP-PDZ kinase domain construct of LIMK2 (EGFP-PDZK), which distributes equally between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Analysis by FRAP and FLIP showed that EGFP-PDZK shuttled between nucleus and cytoplasm. Specifically, FRAP analysis after photobleaching of the nucleus showed that EGFP-PDZK entered the nucleus. The time for 50% recovery (τ½) of fluorescence was 205 s (supplementary Fig. 1). These results suggested that the NLSs within the kinase domain drive the EGFP-PDZK into the nucleus. To study whether EGFP-PDZK was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the FLIP analysis was used. An area of the cytoplasm of a cell expressing EGFP-PDZK was photobleached, and fluorescence intensity in the nucleus of the photobleached cell was monitored. As control, the fluorescence intensity in the nucleus of an adjacent unbleached cell was measured. The level of nuclear fluorescence in the photobleached cell gradually decreased over time. In contrast, the nuclear fluorescence in the adjacent cell (unbleached) was unaffected (supplementary Fig. 2). This indicated that EGFP-PDZK was exported from the nucleus in endothelial cells. LIM Domains Regulate the Cytoplasmic Localization of LIMK2, Not LIMK1—Previously, it has been reported that LIM domains interact with the kinase domain of LIMK1 (25Nagata K. Ohashi K. Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since LIMK2 is found mainly in the cytosol of resting endothelial cells, the putative NLS of LIMK2 in the kinase domain might be masked by the interaction with the LIM domains. To investigate this, different constructs of LIMK2 were made with EGFP in which either one or both LIM domains were deleted. The nuclear localization of ΔLIM1-LIMK2 (LIM1 domain deleted) was ∼2 times higher than the wild type EGFP-LIMK2 (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicated that LIM1 plays a role in the cytoplasmic localization of LIMK2. In contrast, the ΔLIM2-LIMK2 protein (LIM2 domain deleted) was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, similarly to the full-length EGFP-LIMK2 protein, suggesting that the LIM2 domain alone does not affect the subcellular localization of LIMK2. EGFP-PDZK of LIMK2 (both LIM domains deleted) was drastically increased in the nucleus (to 40% of the total protein; Fig. 2B). These results suggested that both LIM domains contribute to the cytoplasmic localization of LIMK2. Also, EGFP-LIMK1 was mainly present in the cytoplasm, and after LMB treatment, it was exclusively localized in the nucleus of endothelial cells (data not shown), COS cells, and Hela cells (27Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to LIMK2, deletion of the two LIM domains of LIMK1 did not affect the subcellular distribution of LIMK1. The EGFP-PDZK of LIMK1 was still localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, A and B). This indicated that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of LIMK1 and LIMK2 is regulated by different mechanisms. LIM domains might either inhibit the nuclear import or accelerate the nuclear export of LIMK2. To distinguish between these two mechanisms, the kinetics of nuclear accumulation of EGFP-LIMK2- and EGFP-PDZK-LIMK2-transfected endothelial cells were compared after the addition of LMB to inhibit nuclear export. We found that the nuclear fluorescence of EGFP-PDZK-LIMK2 increased twice as rapidly (from 40 ± 6 to 95 ± 4%; mean ± S.E.) as the nuclear fluorescence of EGFP-LIMK2 (from 6 ± 2to35 ± 7%; mean ± S.E.) 20 min after LMB addition. These results indicated that the LIM domains reduced the rate of the nuclear import of LIMK2; they were, however, unable to inhibit nuclear accumulation of LIMK2 when cells were treated for 1 h with LMB (Fig. 1A, panel d). Effect of PMA on the Subcellular Localization of LIMK2— Analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed two potential PKC phosphorylation sites in LIMK2; one site at Ser-283 is located between the PDZ and the kinase domain (Fig. 3A), and a second site is at Thr-494 in the kinase domain of LIMK2. There was no potential PKC phosphorylation site in LIMK1. To explore whether PKC activation affects the nuclear localization of LIMK2, the subcellular distribution of EGFP-LIMK2, EGFP-PDZK, and EGFP kinase of LIMK2 in endothelial cells was studied before and after stimulation with PMA, a potent PKC activator. Within 30 min of stimulation with PMA, the amount of nuclear EGFP-LIMK2 (6 ± 2%) decreased to barely detectable levels (1 ± 0.5%, p < 0.05; Fig. 3B, panels a and e, and 3C). Nuclear EGFP-PDZK of LIMK2 was shifted to the cytoplasm in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 3B, panels b and f, and 3C). There was no effect of PMA on the nuclear localization of EGFP kinase of LIMK2 (Fig. 3B, panels c and g). These results indicated that PKC activation inhibits the nuclear localization of LIMK2 and suggested that Ser-283 between the PDZ and kinase domain may be the target for PKC phosphorylation, whereas the second potential phosphorylation site, Thr-494 in the kinase domain, does not seem to be involved in the regulation of LIMK2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The subcellular localization of EGFP-PDZK of LIMK1 was not affected by PMA stimulation, indicating that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of LIMK1 is not regulated by PKC activation (Fig. 3B, panels d and h). To confirm that the PMA-induced exclusion of LIMK2 from the nucleus is regulated by PKC, two specific PKC inhibitors were used, Go6983 and Go6976 (28Peterman E.E. Taormina II, P. Harvey M. Young L.H. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 43: 645-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Gschwendt M. Dieterich S. Rennecke J. Kittstein W. Mueller H.-J. Johannes F.-J.

https://openalex.org/W1973867920,"Stimulated emission of radiation has not been directly observed in astrophysical situations up to this time. Here we demonstrate that photons from pulsar B1641-45 stimulate pulses of excess 1720-megahertz line emission in an interstellar hydroxyl (OH) cloud. As this stimulated emission is driven by the pulsar, it varies on a few-millisecond time scale, which is orders of magnitude shorter than the quickest OH maser variations previously detected. Our 1612-megahertz spectra are inverted copies of the 1720-megahertz spectra. This ""conjugate line"" phenomenon enables us to constrain the properties of the interstellar OH line-producing gas. We also show that pulsar signals undergo significantly deeper OH absorption than do other background sources, which confirms earlier tentative findings that OH clouds are clumpier on small scales than are neutral hydrogen clouds."

Phosphorylated phosphoinositides play a crucial role in a variety of distinct cellular processes including cell signaling, cell growth, membrane trafficking, transcription, and actin cytoskeletal arrangement (1Fruman D.A.

Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4249) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, IP3 binds to specific receptors and induces the release of calcium from intracellular stores, whereas diacylglycerol activates PKC (7Nishizuka Y. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that PIP2 is directly involved in the maintenance of actin cytoskeleton organization and in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling (8Takenawa T. Itoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 9Audhya A. Loewith R. Parsons A.B. Gao L. Tabuchi M. Zhou H. Boone C. Hall M.N. Emr S.D.

We have been studying the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because this system is amenable to genetic analysis and has many advantages in terms of its relevance to higher systems. We have developed a genetic screen that utilizes the immunosuppressant drug FK506 and searched for its mutations that display immunosuppressant- and temperature-sensitive phenotypes. By this genetic screen in our previous study, we have isolated its3+ gene that encodes a PIP5K (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol.

In addition, overexpression of Its3 in wild-type cells resulted in a significant increase in the level of PIP2 (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J.

To unravel the signaling pathway regulated by the Its3 PIP5K, we searched for a novel phenotype of the its3-1 mutant and found that the mutant was sensitive to micafungin, a (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase inhibitor, suggesting a cell wall integrity defect. In this study, we found that there is a lack of GFP-tagged Rgf1 Rho-GTPase exchange factor localization at the cell tips in its3-1 mutant, suggesting a defective Rgf1/Rho pathway. Overexpression of the plc1+ gene encoding a phospholipase C, but not that of other genes encoding putative components downstream of PIP5K, suppressed the phenotypes of the its3-1 mutant. Unexpectedly, PKCs are not involved in the suppression. Further analysis revealed that the phospholipase activity of Plc1 is essential for the suppression of the mutant phenotypes and for the viability of the its3-1 mutant. These findings suggest that Its3 regulates cell integrity through a Plc1-mediated PKC-independent pathway, in addition to the Rgf1/Rho pathway.

Expression was repressed by the addition of 4 μg/ml thiamine to EMM and induced by washing and incubating the cells in EMM lacking thiamine. Tagged or non-tagged genes were subcloned into pREP1 or pREP41 vectors to express the gene at various levels. Maximum expression of the fused gene was obtained using pREP1, whereas pREP41 contained the attenuated version of the nmt1 promoter (19Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K.

Plc1E486A was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In the amplification reaction, the mutant primers 5′-GC-TGC-AAG-TGT-ATT-GCA-ATC-GAT-TGC-TGG-GA-3′ and 5′-TC-CCA-GCA-ATC-GAT-TGC-AAT-ACA-CTT-GCA-GC-3′ were used to change Glu486 (GAA) into Ala (GCA). This mutation was constructed by analogy to the lipase-deficient mutant Plc1 E341A (22Ellis M.V. James S.R. Perisic O. Downes C.P. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol.

The its3-1 Mutant and PKC Mutants Showed Hypersensitivity to Cell Wall-damaging Agents—The its3-1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to micafungin, an inhibitor of (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase (27Carver P.L. Ann. Pharmacother. 2004; 38: 1707-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), suggesting a defect in cell wall integrity. PIP5K is the enzyme that generates PIP2 (which is a substrate for phospholipase C), yielding IP3 and diacylglycerol, which activates PKC in higher eukaryotes in combination with Ca2+ (7Nishizuka Y. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 15: 3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and PKCs have been shown to be involved in cell integrity regulation in lower eukaryotes (28Sayers L.G. Katayama S. Nakano K. Mellor H. Mabuchi I. Toda T. Parker P.J. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this light, we then examined the effect of micafungin on the mutants of putative downstream components of PIP5K signaling, phospholipase C (Δplc1), and PKCs (Δpck1 and Δpck2) (Fig. 1B). At a low concentration of micafungin (0.3 μg/ml), the growth of Δpck2 and its3-1 mutant cells was markedly inhibited as compared with the growth of Δpck1 cells, which were significantly inhibited, but to a lesser extent. On the other hand, the growth of Δplc1 and wild-type cells was not affected by 0.3 μg/ml micafungin. At higher concentrations of micafungin (0.6 and 1.2 μg/ml), the growth of Δpck1, Δpck2, and its3-1 mutant cells was completely inhibited, whereas the Δplc1 strain evidently grew, but it did so at a slower rate compared with wild-type cells. Similar results were obtained with aculeacin A, another inhibitor of (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase (29Yamaguchi H. Hiratani T. Baba M. Osumi M. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 29: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and with BE49385A, an inhibitor of Its8 fission yeast homolog of Mcd4 and Pig-n involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis (30Yada T.

Sensitivity of its3-1 and Other Mutants of the Putative Downstream Components of PIP5K Signaling to Various Agents—As described above, the mutants of the putative downstream components of PIP5K signaling showed differential sensitivities to micafungin, a (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase inhibitor. Then we examined the sensitivities of these mutants to various other chemical agents (Table III). One agent tested was the immunosuppressive drug FK506. The its3-1 and bgs1-i2 mutant strains showed sensitivity to FK506, consistent with their original isolation as its mutants (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Next, the effect of the immunosuppressive drug FK506 plus MgCl2 was examined. As shown in our previous study, wild-type cells were non-viable in the presence of both FK506 and 0.15 m MgCl2, and gene deletion of the Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase or PKC pathway suppressed the phenotype (31Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M. Kuno T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Δpck2 cells, but not the Δplc1 strain, grew well in the presence of both FK506 and 0.15 m MgCl2. Another agent tested was ZnSO4. Various phenotypes of the Δplc1 strain have been reported (16Andoh T. Yoko T. Matsui Y. Toh A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 32Andoh T. Kato Jr., T. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 258: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, we found that most of these phenotypes were not very evident when the auxotrophic markers were eliminated. Instead, we found that the Δplc1 strain, unlike the other mutants tested, was hypersensitive to ZnSO4.Table IIISensitivity of the its3-1 and other mutants of putative genes downstream of PIP5K signaling to various agentsStrainSensitivity of strainFK506 (0.5 μg/ml)FK506 + 0.15 m MgCl2ZnSO4 (9 mm)YPD at 36 °Cwt+-++its3-1--+-Δplc1+--+Δpck1+-++Δpck2++++bgs1-i2--+- Open table in a new tab The above-mentioned results showed that the mutants of the putative downstream components of PIP5K signaling exhibited differential sensitivities to various agents, and among these mutants, only the bgs1-i2 mutant showed phenotypes similar to those of the its3-1 mutant, including temperature sensitivity (Table III). bgs1-i2, a Mutant Allele of the (1,3)-β-d-Glucan Synthase Gene, Was Synthetically Lethal with its3-1 Mutation—Because its3-1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to several inhibitors of (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase, as mentioned earlier, and because similar phenotypes were observed in both its3-1 and bgs1-i2 mutants, we examined the genetic interaction between its3-1 mutation and the bgs1+ gene that encodes (1,3)-β-d-glucan synthase. Consistently, bgs1-i2, a mutant allele of the bgs1+ gene isolated as an its mutant showing immunosuppressant- and temperature-sensitive phenotypes in our genetic screening (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was synthetically lethal with its3-1 mutation (Table IV). In light of these findings, we examined the localization of GFP-Bgs1 in its3-1 mutant. Fig. 2A showed that in wild-type cells, GFP-Bgs1 localized to the septum during cytokinesis and to one or both tips during cell growth, in agreement with the study by Cortes et al. (21Cortes J.C. Ishiguro J. Duran A. Ribas J.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4081-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However in its3-1 mutant cells, GFP-Bgs1 was observed only at the ring area and was no longer observed at the cell tips (Fig. 2A).Table IVColony-forming ability of the double mutation between its3-1 mutant and the corresponding strainStrain crossedColonyGenetic interaction27 °C31 °CControl (its3-1)++Δplc1--Yesbgs1-i2--YesΔpck1++NoΔpck2+-Yes Open table in a new tab Lack of Rgf1-GFP Localization at the Cell Tips in its3-1 Mutant—Previous works in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that PIP2 is required for proper localization of Rom2, a GTPase exchange factor for Rho1, which binds PIP2 through its PH domain to establish its normal functions (33Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Also, the primary structure of S. pombe Rgf1 shows high homology to S. cerevisiae Rom2, including its PH domain. Our previous study showed that its3-1 mutant cells contained only about 10% of the amount of PIP2 found in wild-type cells (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that the cell integrity defect of its3-1 mutant is caused by the low level of PIP2 resulting in dysregulation of Rho-GTPase signaling pathway. To examine the localization of Rgf1 in its3-1 mutant, GFP-tagged Rgf1 was constructed. In wild-type cells, Rgf1-GFP localized to the septum ring and cell tips (Fig. 2B). In its3-1 mutant cells, in contrast, although Rgf1-GFP could be detected in the ring area, it was hardly observed at the cell tips. The PH domain of the phospholipase C δ1 is known to bind PIP2 (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), so we overexpressed the PH domain of mammalian phospholipase C and examined the localization of Rgf1-GFP in cells overexpressing the PH domain. Results showed that whereas Rgf1-GFP fluorescence was still detected at the ring area (Fig. 2C), the fluorescence at the cell tips disappeared upon overexpression of the PH domain, suggesting that PIP2 levels are sufficiently down-regulated to displace the protein from the tip into the cytoplasm upon overexpression of the PH domain. This also suggests that there are PIP2-dependent and -independent interactions that differentially determine tip and ring localization. The aberrant localization of the Rho-GTPase exchange factor is consistent with the aberrant Rom2 localization in budding yeast mss4 mutant (33Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Plc1, but Not That of PKCs, Suppressed the its3-1 Mutant Phenotypes—To further characterize the role of the its3+ gene, we tested the ability of the putative downstream components of PIP5K signaling to suppress phenotypes of its3-1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3A, its3-1 mutants grew equally well as compared with wild-type cells at 27 °C, but they showed high temperature sensitivity at 33 °C and could not grow on the plate containing FK506 (0.5 μg/ml) or micafungin (0.6 μg/ml) at 27 °C. The overexpression of Plc1, but not that of Pck1 or Pck2, suppressed these phenotypes (Fig. 3A). In addition, overexpression of Rho1, Rho2, Rgf1, or Pck1/Pck2 failed to suppress these mutant phenotypes (Fig. 3B). Other phenotypes of its3-1 mutant, such as defects in cell polarity, actin organization, and cytokinesis, were suppressed by overexpression of Plc1, but not by that of the other putative downstream components of PIP5K signaling (data not shown). Similar to the its3-1 mutant (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), an aberrant cell polarity was also reported in Δpck2 cells (34Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This prompted us to examine actin reorganization after heat treatment in its3-1 mutant and Δpck2 cells. In its3-1 mutant cells, the actin patches were partially polarized at 27 °C, and the polarization was completely lost upon temperature upshift to 33 °C (Fig. 3C), consistent with our previous study showing a defective actin reorganization in the mutant (10Zhang Y. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Asami M. Maeda T. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35600-35606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In Δpck2 cells, a shift from 27 °C to 36 °C caused a transient heat-induced disorganization of actin patches, but further incubation at 36 °C restored the normal actin patch distribution (Fig. 3C), suggesting that actin reorganization is not impaired in Δpck2 cells. Because overexpression of Plc1 suppressed the phenotypes of the its3-1 mutant, we further examined the genetic interaction between these two genes. We performed tetrad analysis by crossing its3-1 mutant with plc1+ deletion (Δplc1) (Fig. 3D; Table IV). Results showed that no double mutant was obtained, indicating that its3+ mutation and plc1+ deletion are synthetically lethal. These genetic interactions prompted us to examine GFP-Bgs1 and Rgf1-GFP localization in Δplc1cells. Similar to wild-type cells, GFP-Bgs1 and Rgf1-GFP localized at the cell tips as well as at the septum ring in Δplc1cells (Fig. 2, A and B). PKCs Are Not Downstream of Plc1 in Fission Yeast—As described above, overexpression of Plc1, but not that of PKCs, suppressed the mutant phenotypes of its3-1 mutant, suggesting that PKCs are not downstream of Plc1 in fission yeast. To test this hypothesis, we performed the following experiments. First, we examined whether overexpression of Plc1 could suppress the micafungin-sensitive phenotype of Δpck2 and whether overexpression of the PKCs could suppress the zinc-sensitive phenotype of Δplc1 (i.e. whether these two genes interact with each other). Results showed that there was no suppression of the phenotype in each case (Table V). Likewise, in a study by Toda et al. (34Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reporting that Δpck2 cells showed aberrant cell polarity as described above, overexpression of Plc1 also failed to suppress the aberrant cell polarity phenotype of Δpck2 as shown in Fig. 4A.Table VSensitivity of the Δplc1 and Δpck2 mutants to ZnSO4 and micafungin, respectivelyStrainSensitivity of strain carrying plasmidVectorplc1+pck1+pck2+Δplc1 (9 mm ZnSO4)-+--Δpck2 (0.3 μg/ml micafungin)--++ Open table in a new tab In the study by Toda et al. (34Toda T. Shimanuki M. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1987-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it was reported that Pck2 hyperactivity causes toxicity in wild-type cells. We then examined whether or not Pck2 overexpression would cause toxicity in Δplc1 and its3-1 mutant cells. Results showed that overexpression of Pck2 (Fig. 4B, Pck2 OP) caused growth defects in Δplc1 as well as in its3-1 mutant cells to the same extent as that observed in wild-type cells. Lastly, we examined the effect of overexpression of Plc1, Pck2, and Pck1 on the micafungin sensitivity of the Δpck2Δplc1 double mutant. The micafungin sensitivity of the Δpck2 single mutant and that of the Δpck2Δplc1 double mutant were nearly identical (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4C, the micafungin sensitivity of the Δpck2Δplc1 double mutant was strongly suppressed by overexpression of Pck2 and also significantly suppressed by overexpression of Pck1. However, with overexpression of Plc1, no change in the micafungin sensitivity of the double mutant was observed. These findings support our hypothesis that PKCs are not downstream of Plc1 in fission yeast. Deletion of Pck1 or"
https://openalex.org/W2042747866,"The G protein-coupled receptors in excitable cells have prominent roles in controlling Ca2+-triggered secretion by modulating voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. In pituitary lactotrophs, spontaneous voltage-gated Ca2+ influx is sufficient to maintain prolactin release high. Here we show that endothelin in picomolar concentrations can interrupt such release for several hours downstream of spontaneous and high K+-stimulated voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. This action occurred through the Gz signaling pathway; the adenylyl cyclase-signaling cascade could mediate sustained inhibition of secretion, whereas rapid inhibition also occurred at elevated cAMP levels regardless of the status of phospholipase C, tyrosine kinases, and protein kinase C. In a nanomolar concentration range, endothelin also inhibited voltage-gated Ca2+ influx through the G i/o signaling pathway. Thus, the coupling of seven-transmembrane domain endothelin receptors to Gz proteins provided a pathway that effectively blocked hormone secretion distal to Ca2+ entry, whereas the cross-coupling to G i/o proteins reinforced such inhibition by simultaneously reducing the pacemaking activity."
https://openalex.org/W2038892333,"Thin films often present domain structures whose detailed evolution is a subject of debate. We analyze the evolution of copper films, which contain both rotational and stacking domains, on ruthenium. Real-time observation by low-energy electron microscopy shows that the stacking domains evolve in a seemingly complex way. Not only do the stacking boundaries move in preferred directions, but their motion is extremely uneven and they become stuck when they reach rotational boundaries. We show that this behavior occurs because the stacking-boundary motion is impeded by threading dislocations. This study underscores how the coarse-scale evolution of thin films can be controlled by defects."
https://openalex.org/W2063137955,"The tumor suppressor p53 regulates its own stability by transcriptionally activating Mdm2, Pirh2, and COP1, which target p53 for degradation. However, whether such a negative feedback mechanism exists to regulate the stability of p73, the structural and functional homologue of p53, is unclear. Unlike p53, p73 is not mutated in cancers, but its expression is significantly elevated. Thus, we have investigated the regulation of p73 turnover. Our data suggest the existence of a negative feedback mechanism for p73 degradation. p73 mutants with compromised transactivation activity are generally more stable than the full-length TAp73 form. TAp73 appears to promote its own turnover as well as that of other p73 forms, including the ΔNp73 that lacks the amino-terminal transactivation domain, in a transactivation-dependent manner. This degradation-inducing property of TAp73 was inhibited only by p73 mutants that also inhibit the transactivation activity TAp73 but not by mutant p53, highlighting the specificity in the regulation of p73 stability. Moreover, regions in the amino and carboxyl termini of p73 confer both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on the protein, independent of its transactivation ability. Finally, we have identified the regions between amino acids 56 and 248 of p73 as being the region required for p73-mediated and for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Taken together, the data suggest that p73 turnover is tightly regulated in a transactivation-dependent and -independent manner, resulting in the controlled expression of the various p73 forms. The tumor suppressor p53 regulates its own stability by transcriptionally activating Mdm2, Pirh2, and COP1, which target p53 for degradation.

Taken together, the data suggest that p73 turnover is tightly regulated in a transactivation-dependent and -independent manner, resulting in the controlled expression of the various p73 forms. p73 belongs to a family of tumor suppressors, including p53 and p63, that are structurally and functionally similar (1.Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and has homology with p53 in the transactivation, tetramerization, and DNA binding domains (2.Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, unlike p53, p73 is present in multiple isoforms because of alternate splicing at the carboxyl terminus, giving rise to at least six isoforms for p73 (p73α–ϕ), which are known as the TA forms (1.Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2.Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev.

Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In addition, the presence of promoter sequences in the intron of the gene results in the expression of an amino-terminal truncated version of p73 that lacks the transactivation domain, known as the ΔN form, which acts as dominant negative inhibitor of the full-length protein (1.Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2.Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).Functionally, TAp73 forms are similar to p53, and they are able to induce apoptosis when overexpressed (4.Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Moreover, both TAp73α and TAp73β have been shown to transactivate many p53-responsive promoters, although the relative efficiencies vary on different promoters (5.Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). Cell death induced by overexpression of TAp73 occurs in the absence of p53, and both TAp73α and TAp73β have been shown to suppress foci formation in p53 null cells (3.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annic-chiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of p73 was shown to result in resistance to apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and other stress signals (6.Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7.Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 546-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, p73 null mice do not develop spontaneous tumors like their p53 null counterparts, indicating that although p73 is structurally similar to p53, it might not be as potent as p53 in its tumor-suppressive activities (8.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). In support of this, it was shown that TAp73 has reduced ability to activate some of the common p53 target genes, suggesting that p73 might be the weaker of the two (5.Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Lee C.W. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4171-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This also raises the possibility that p73 may be differentially regulated compared with p53, thereby leading to differential effects on target gene activation and cellular physiology.p73 also differs from p53 at the biochemical level. p53 is a short-lived protein whose stability is regulated by an auto-regulatory negative feedback loop (10.Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This feedback loop consists of several targets that are induced by p53, such as Mdm2, Pirh2, and COP1, which possess ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activities and have been shown to degrade p53 (11.Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar, 12.Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Moreover, the role of Pirh2 and COP1 in p73 turnover is not well understood. On the other hand, several proteins have been shown to affect p73 stability, including the mismatch repair protein PMS2, tyrosine kinase c-Abl, AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun, Hect ubiquitin-protein ligase Itch, p300, PML, NEDL2, and cyclin G (17.Shimodaira H.

Of these, p300, cyclin G, PML, and c-Abl have been shown to also cause an increase in p53 levels when co-expressed (22.Ohtsuka T. Ryu H. Minamishima Y.A. Ryo A. Lee S.W.

Thus, distinct mechanisms exist in differentially regulating p53 and p73 stability.Despite the functional similarities between p53 and p73, the latter gene is rarely mutated in human cancers (29.Kovalev S. Marchenko N. Swendeman S. LaQuaglia M. Moll U.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 897-903PubMed Google Scholar). However, both TAp73 and ΔNp73 were shown to be overexpressed in many cancers (30.Zaika A.I. Kovalev S. Marchenko N.D. Moll U.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3257-3263PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Zaika A.I. Slade N. Erster S.H. Sansome C. Joseph T.W. Pearl M. Chalas E. Moll U.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 765-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This intriguing observation has led to the suggestion that ΔNp73 might be inhibiting both TAp73 and p53 functions, thereby negating the functional consequence of an activated TAp73 (31.Zaika A.I. Slade N. Erster S.H. Sansome C. Joseph T.W. Pearl M. Chalas E. Moll U.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 765-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, regulatory mechanisms controlling p73 stability in cancer cells have not been addressed. By contrast, many studies show that p53 overexpressed in tumors is generally mutated (32.Iacopetta B. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mutated p53 is unable to activate Mdm2, leading to the breaking of the auto-regulatory negative feedback loop, resulting in accumulation of the mutant p53 (33.Zauberman A. Barak Y. Ragimov N. Levy N. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2799-2808Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Hitherto, whether such auto-regulatory negative feedback loops exist that regulate p73 stability is not clear. A recent report (34.Wu L. Zhu H. Nie L. Maki C.G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4032-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested that the transactivation activity of TAp73 was associated with its turnover. Consistently, we and others (19.Toh W.H. Siddique M.M. Boominathan L. Lin K.W. Sabapathy K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44713-44722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35.Ishimoto O. Kawahara C. Enjo K. Obinata M. Nukiwa T. Ikawa S.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3418-3424PubMed Google Scholar) have noted that the ΔN forms of p73 are generally more stable than the TAp73 forms, suggesting the existence of a p73 transactivation-dependent self-degradation mechanism in operation. We have thus investigated the structural requirements for p73 turnover, and we show the existence of a transactivation-dependent auto-regulatory negative feedback loop. Moreover, p73 stability is also regulated in a transactivation-independent manner. Detailed results are presented.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Transfections—The p53 null human lung cancer cell line H1299 (ATCC), human osteosarcoma cell line Saos2 with the tetracycline-inducible p73β, and mdm2–/–p53–/– mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum, as described (19.Toh W.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44713-44722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). p73β was induced in the Saos2-p73β cells by addition of tetracycline as described (38.Blint E. Phillips A.C. Kozlov S. Stewart C.L. Vousden K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3529-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). H1299 cells stably expressing the various p53 hot spot mutants were generated as described (39.Vikhansyaka F. Siddique M.M. Lee K.M. Broggini M. Sabapathy K. Clin. Cancer. Res. 2005; 11: 4348-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).2 × 105 cells (in 6-well dishes) were used in transfection experiments using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent, as per the manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene). Cells were transiently transfected with the various plasmids as indicated in the figure legends. Generally, 100 and 500 ng of expression plasmids were used for luciferase assays and immunoblotting, respectively, unless otherwise stated. Total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized with appropriate amounts of pCDNA3 vector in all cases. Cells were collected 24 h after transfection, and cell extracts were prepared and used for immunoblots.Plasmid Construction—pCDNA3-based expression plasmids for TAp73α, TAp73β, ΔNp73α, and ΔNp73β have been described (19.Toh W.H.

Point mutations of TA and ΔNp73α and p73β as well as p53 mutant plasmids were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The various p73 deletion constructs used were generated by PCR cloning using primers as follows: Δ2-9-Fwd, 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGATGGGGGCACCACGTTTGAG-3′; Δ2-23-Fwd, 5′-AAAGGATCCATGCCAGACAGCACCTACTTCGAC; Δ2-40-Fwd, 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGTGGTGGGCGGAACGGATTCC-3′; Δ2-56-Fwd, 5′-AAAGGATCCATGACTACATCTGTCATGGCC-3′, together with p73β-Rev, 5′-TATCTCGAGTCAGGGCCCCCAGGTCCTGACGAGGCTGGGGTC-3′, and 1–425-p73 was generated using p73β-Fwd, 5′-AAAGGATCCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCCCAGTCCACCGCCACCTCC-3′, and 1–425-Rev, 5′-TATCTCGAGTCAGGGCAGCTTGTTCATGCC-3′. Deletion mutants were inserted at BamHI and XhoI sites of pCDNA 3.1(+) vector. Some of the plasmids were also tagged with FLAG or HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; Egfp, enhanced green fluorescent protein. tags, as indicated in the figure legends. Other plasmids used were generous gifts from Drs. Levrero and Melino (see Ref. 40.Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G.

For normalizing transfection efficiency, 0.5 μg of plasmid encoding the β-galactosidase gene was transfected into each well. Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase assays were performed as described (19.Toh W.H. Siddique M.M. Boominathan L. Lin K.W. Sabapathy K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44713-44722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—Cells lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described (19.Toh W.H.

Proteins were separated on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The antibodies used in this study are as follows: anti-p73α (ER15; Oncogene), anti-p73β (GC15; Oncogene), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Stratagene), anti-actin (Sigma), and anti-Egfp (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The specificity of the p73 antibodies is described by Lin et al. (7.Lin K.W. Nam S.Y. Toh W.H. Dulloo I. Sabapathy K. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 546-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Generally, 50 μg of total cell lysate was used from transfected cells to monitor steady-state levels of proteins. Detection was performed by using enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce).In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—H1299 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding human TAp73α, TAp73β, ΔNp73β, and p73 mutants and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (gift from Dr. Yukiko Gotoh) for 24 h. Cells were harvested with RIPA buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% deoxycholate, and 0.025% SDS). For detection of ubiquitinated species, the blot was probed with anti-FLAG antibody.Half-life Determination—H1299 cells were transfected with corresponding plasmids in 6-well plates. Cells were then treated with 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide 24 h post-transfection and were harvested at different time points. Lysates were prepared and were immunoblotted as described. The percentage of p73 remaining was quantified by PhosphorImaging and was normalized to Egfp loading.RESULTSBoth DNA Binding and Amino-terminal Transactivation Domains Contribute to p73 Stability—We and others (19.Toh W.H.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3418-3424PubMed Google Scholar) have noted previously that the steady-state levels of ΔNp73 were higher than TAp73. In order to confirm these observations, we performed transient transfection experiments to determine the steady-state levels of the various p73 forms. All experiments described here were performed in the presence of the Egfp plasmid, which was used to monitor transfection efficiency, as described (19.Toh W.H. Siddique M.M. Boominathan L. Lin K.W. Sabapathy K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44713-44722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Transfection of equal amounts of FLAG-tagged, pCDNA3-based expression plasmids in p53 null H1299 cells resulted in the ΔNp73α or ΔNp73β forms being more abundantly expressed than the TAp73α or TAp73β forms, respectively (Fig. 1A, compare with Egfp levels). Similar results were obtained with untagged proteins (data not shown). Moreover, the steady-state levels of the DNA-binding point mutants of p73, 292p73α, or 292p73β were higher than their respective wild-type forms (Fig. 1B). We thus evaluated if the combined loss of both DNA binding and transactivation properties would have a synergistic effect on p73 steady-state levels. As shown in Fig. 1C, 292p73β appeared to be slightly less abundant than the ΔNp73β form. However, the ΔN292p73β mutant was the most abundant, and its levels were more than that of ΔNp73β, suggesting that both the DNA binding and transactivation properties and/or domains contribute to the regulation of p73 levels.We assessed the half-lives of the variants in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which has been used in many previous studies analyzing p73 stability and half-life (20.Rossi M.

TAp73β had the shortest half-life, followed by 292p73β, ΔNp73β, and ΔN-292p73β (Fig. 1D). 50% of TAp73β remained at around 1.5 h post-cycloheximide treatment compared with >80% of 292p73β (Fig. 1E). However, more than 90% of ΔNp73β and ΔN-292p73β remained at this time point. Extended analysis indicated that at 8 h after cycloheximide treatment, 80% of ΔNp73β remained, whereas about 95% of ΔN-292p73β was still present (Fig. 1E). Taken together, the results suggest that both the DNA binding and amino-terminal transactivation domains of p73 contribute to the regulation of p73 stability.Inhibition of p73 Transactivation Activity Results in Extended p73 Half-life—We next sought to investigate the role of transactivation activity in regulating p73 stability. Co-transfection of mdm2luc (luciferase gene driven by the p53/p73-responsive mdm2 promoter) in H1299 cells with the various p73 expression plasmids indicated that all the p73 mutants had no significant transactivation activity (Fig. 2, A and B, p73β and p73α, respectively). Co-expression of TAp73α or TAP73β with the various p73 mutants resulted in the abrogation of transactivation activity for TAp73α or TAp73β, indicating all of the p73 variants tested were capable of inhibiting TAp73 transactivation activity (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Inhibition of p73 transactivation activity by p73 mutants stabilizes p73. A and B, p73 mutants inhibit p73-mediated transactivation activity. H1299 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid expressing the firefly luciferase gene under the transcriptional control of the mdm2 promoter together with the indicated plasmids (100 ng each). In each case, total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized with pCDNA3 vector. Luciferase activity was analyzed as described 48 h post-transfection. Transfections were carried out in triplicate, and the standard errors are indicated. C, steady-state levels of TAp73β in the presence of various p73 mutants. H1299 cells were transfected with 100 ng of TAp73β in the absence or presence of the indicated p73 mutants as described, and the p73 levels were determined by immunoblotting. * indicates FLAG-TAp73β that migrates slower, in lanes showing both FLAG-TAp73β and 292p73β.

CHX, cycloheximide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Co-expression of ΔNp73β with low levels of FLAG-tagged TAp73β(100 ng) resulted in an increase of TAp73β steady-state levels, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG or anti-p73β(GC15) antibodies (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 6). Moreover, co-expression of 292p73β, ΔN292p73β, and p73DD (which contains p73 tetramerization domain) also led to an increase in TAp73β levels (Fig. 2C, compare lane 1 with lanes 7–9). Furthermore, analysis of TAp73β stability indicated that co-expression of the ΔNp73β, 292p73β, and p73DD led to an increase in the half-life of TAp73β (Fig. 2, D and E). The half-life of TAp73β that was about 1.5 h was extended to about 3.5 and 3–4 h in the presence of ΔNp73β and 292p73β, respectively, and it was almost not degraded up to 6 h in the presence of p73DD (Fig. 2, D and E, and Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained with TAp73α (data not shown). Taken together, the results demonstrate that the inhibition of TAp73 transcriptional activity by the various p73 mutants resulted in a concomitant stabilization of the TAp73 protein and hence suggest that the transactivation activity of TAp73 contributes to the regulation of its own stability.Role of the Amino-terminal Domain in Regulating p73 Stability—We next explored if the amino-terminal region of p73 has any other transactivation-independent role in the regulation of p73 stability. To this end, we generated several amino-terminal deletion mutants of TAp73β, as indicated in Fig. 3A. Analysis of transactivation activity of these mutants indicated that Δ2-9p73β had significant transactivation activity, whereas the other mutants (i.e. Δ2-23, Δ2-40, and Δ2-56) were compromised in their activity, similar to ΔNp73β (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Role of the amino terminus in regulating p73 stability. A, schematic representation of the various p73 amino-terminal mutants used in the study. B, transactivation activity of the various p73 amino-terminal mutants was determined by using the Mdm2 promoter-luciferase construct as described.

CHX, cycloheximide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of the steady-state levels indicated that regions between amino acids 2 and 9 and 23 and 40 had a stabilizing effect on p73β, as deletion mutants Δ2-9 and Δ2-40, but not Δ2-23, were less abundant than TAp73β (Fig. 3C, compare lane 2 with lanes 4–6). Moreover, Δ2-56p73β was as abundant as ΔNp73β, together suggesting that regions between amino acids 9 and 23 and 40 and 56 probably conferred a destabilizing effect on the protein (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 2–5 and lane 7). The half-lives of these mutants were consistently variable. Δ2-56p73β was the most stable, similar to ΔNp73 (Fig. 3, D and E). Δ2-23p73β was slightly more stable than TAp73β, but Δ2-9p73β and Δ2-40p73β were less stable than TAp73β (t½ (h): TAp73β versus ΔNp73β versus Δ2-56p73β versus Δ2-40p73β versus Δ2-23p73β versus Δ2-9p73β → 2 versus ≥8 versus >8 versus 1 versus 3 versus 1) (Fig. 3, D and E). The data together suggest that the amino terminus of p73 contains regions that would affect p73 stability. Moreover, these regions also appear to regulate p73 stability in a manner independent of its transactivation activity, as the transcriptionally active Δ2-9p73β and conversely transcriptionally inactive Δ2-40p73β were less stable than TAp73β.Role of the Carboxyl-terminal Domain in Regulating p73 Stability—Sim"
https://openalex.org/W2046633880,"FXYD domain-containing proteins are tissue-specific regulators of the Na,K-ATPase that have been shown to have significant physiological implications. Information about the sites of interaction between some FXYD proteins and subunits of the Na,K-ATPase is beginning to emerge. We previously identified an FXYD protein in plasma membranes from shark rectal gland cells and demonstrated that this protein (FXYD10) modulates shark Na,K-ATPase activity. The present study was undertaken to identify the location of the C-terminal domain of FXYD10 on the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase, using covalent cross-linking combined with proteolytic cleavage. Treatment of Na,K-ATPase-enriched membranes with the homobifunctional thiol cross-linker 1,4-bismaleimidyl-2,3-dihydroxybutane resulted in cross-linking of FXYD10 to the α-subunit. Cross-linking was not affected by preincubation with sodium or potassium but was significantly reduced after pre-incubation with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog β,γ-methyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMP-PCP). A peptic assay was developed, in which pepsin treatment of Na,K-ATPase at low pH resulted in extensive cleavage of the α-subunit while FXYD10 was left intact. Proteolytic fragments of control and cross-linked preparations were isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. A proteolytic fragment containing FXYD10 cross-linked to a fragment from the α-subunit could be localized on SDS gels. Sequencing of this fragment showed the presence of FXYD10 as well as a fragment within the A domain of the α-subunit comprising 33 amino acids, including a single Cys residue, Cys254. Thus, regulation of Na,K-ATPase by FXYD10 occurs in part via cytoplasmic interaction of FXYD10 with the A domain of the shark α-subunit.

The enzyme consists of a catalytic α-subunit that contains substrates and inhibitor binding sites and a glycosylated β-subunit that is important for proper expression and function of the overall Na,K-ATPase activity (2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Recently, considerable attention has been directed at studying the role of pump-interacting proteins in the regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity. In kidney, the kinetic properties of Na,K-ATPase are modulated by interaction with the γ-subunit (Refs. 3Arysratkhova E. R Wetzel K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol.

Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To date, five of these members have been shown to regulate Na,K-ATPase in different tissues, mainly by modulating the apparent ion affinity of the pump (Refs. 12Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoum S.

STKE 2003. 2003; 166: RE1Google Scholar for reviews). The regulation of Na,K-ATPase by interaction with FXYD proteins is tissue-specific as evidenced from their heterogeneous expression patterns and tissue distribution. Of particular interest is the fact that interaction of the different FXYD family members with the α-subunit at the cytoplasmic face does not lead to a unique functional effect on Na,K-ATPase (20Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar), possibly owing (in part) to the significant dissimilarities found in the C-terminal domains of these proteins (11Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 20Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously identified and characterized an FXYD protein called FXYD10 (PLMS) that associates with and modifies the activity of shark Na,K-ATPase in vitro through interactions mediated by its transmembrane and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (22Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The functional effects of the C-terminal domain of FXYD10 on shark Na,K-ATPase were studied by using a preparation of Na,K-ATPase in which the C-terminal domain of FXYD10 is specifically cleaved by mild trypsin treatment, and it was demonstrated that FXYD10 is important in the phosphorylation and potassium deocclusion reactions, which are known to be controlled by A domain movements (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consequently, we suggested that FXYD10 interacts with the A domain of the shark α-subunit (19Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Little is known about the functional sites of interaction between FXYD proteins and Na,K-ATPase. Indeed, transmembrane domains of FXYD2 and FXYD4 were shown to be important in structural association with the α-subunit of Na,K-ATPase (24Lindzen M. Aizman R. Lifshitz Y. Lubarski I. Karlish S.J. Garty H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18738-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutational and expression studies have indicated the importance of transmembrane domain 9 (TM9) of the α-subunit in the stable association with some FXYD proteins as well as in functional interactions affecting ion affinities (25Li C. Grosdidier A. Crambert G. Horisberger J.-D. Michielin O. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38895-38902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, Fuzesi et al. (26Fuzesi M. Kay-Eberhard Gottschalk K.-E. Lindzen M. Shainskaya A. Kuster B. Garty H. Karlish S. J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18291-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have demonstrated interaction of the C terminus of FXYD2 with the S5 stalk segment of the pig kidney α-subunit in studies employing different cross-linking agents combined with protein fragmentation and mutational analyses. The aim of the present study was to isolate and sequence cross-linked fragments from FXYD10 and the shark α-subunit to obtain information about the spatial interaction of FXYD10 and the α-subunit. We developed a proteolytic cleavage assay that allowed us to preferentially cleave the α-subunit, leaving FXYD10 intact, which is important in localizing the cross-linked fragments. This proteolytic assay was used to produce a minimum α·FXYD10 cross-linked proteolytic fragment that could be subjected to sequence analysis. It was found that the C-terminal Cys74 of FXYD10 associates with the A domain of the α-subunit at Cys254 (numbering according to the shark α-subunit sequence, GenBank™ accession number AJ781093) upstream of the S3 stalk segment of the shark α-subunit. Materials—1,4-Bismaleimidyl-2,3-dihydroxybutane (DMDB) was from Pierce. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), AMP-PCP, dl-cysteine, and pepsin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes, enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, protein A-Sepharose beads, and [32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Na,K-ATPase Preparation—Purified Na,K-ATPase-containing membranes from the rectal gland of the shark Squalus acanthias were purified as described previously (27Skou J.C. Esmann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined as described previously (28Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7114) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. PKA Phosphorylation—PKA phosphorylation was performed in a typical assay mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm Tris-ATP containing 0.3 μCi/pmol [32P]ATP, 5–10 μg of protein, and 3 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP, allowed to proceed for 20 min at 24 °C, and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of electrophoresis sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein fragments were separated using Tricine-based SDS-PAGE (3% stacking gel, 8% intermediate, and 15% resolving gel). For the detection of 32P-assisted kinase phosphorylation, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then analyzed by autoradiography. For immunoblotting, proteins in SDS gels were transferred to PVDF membranes, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% Tween 20, and incubated overnight at room temperature with the primary antibody. Thereafter the membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline as above and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h. After the final washings, the proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. For the detection of the α-subunit fragments from shark rectal gland, the antibody NKA1002–1016 was used (a generous gift of Jesper V. Møller, Institute of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Aarhus). The FXYD10-specific antibody was developed as described previously (30Møller J.V. Ning G. Maunsbach A.B. Fujimoto K. Asai K. Juul B. Lee Y.-J. de Garcia A.G. Falson P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29015-29032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This antibody detects the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein as it binds to the N-terminal part after cleavage of the C terminus with mild trypsin treatment, and localization studies suggested that the antibody binds at the intracellular side of the membrane (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that the antibody binds at the motif K46CRCK of FXYD10. This has also been indicated from the fact that the FXYD10 antibody binds to FXYD1 from rabbit skeletal muscle (data not shown), which has an identical sequence at this part of the protein and a completely different sequence at the C-terminal region (20Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of FXYD10 to the Shark α-Subunit—The cleavable cross-linker DMDB (spacer arm length, 10 Å) was used. Cross-linking was performed in a mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 12 μg of protein, and 0.10 mm DMDB (from a 20 mm stock dissolved in Me2SO). The reaction was performed such that the volume of Me2SO did not exceed 2% of the total volume. The reaction was started by adding the cross-linker for 25 min at 24 °C and terminated with the addition of the same volume of dithiothreitol (DTT) sample buffer containing 200 mm DTT, 4% SDS, 0.1% sodium azide, and 20% glycerol. The mixture was subjected to brief incubation at 37 °C before loading onto SDS gels. Cross-linked products in sample buffer were loaded onto SDS-Tricine gels as described above. In some other experiments, mercaptoethanol was used instead of DTT. Prior to the proteolytic assays (see below), cross-linking was terminated with 10 mm Cys (dissolved in 20 mm histidine, pH 7.0, containing 25% glycerol and freshly prepared each time) instead of DTT sample buffer. For measuring the effect of ligands on cross-linking, membranes were pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of sodium, potassium, or AMP-PCP (as indicated in Fig. 2) for 5 min at 24 °C before the addition of the cross-linker. Control experiments were run in parallel where the same volume of Me2SO was added instead of the cross-linker. Additional negative control experiments were also performed in which cross-linking was carried out in the presence of 5–10 mm Cys added prior to addition of the cross-linker or using membranes pretreated with 2% SDS prior to cross-linking, where the native functional conformation of the enzyme is lost. Pepsin Digestion of Cross-linked Proteins—Before proteolytic digestion, control and cross-linked membrane-bound shark Na,K-ATPase were washed with 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, and homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 5.0, 25% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The proteolytic reaction (300 μl) was performed in Tris buffer, pH 2.6, in the presence of 20 mm KCl and 5 mm EDTA. Proteolysis was started with the addition of pepsin (pepsin/protein ratio of 1:100), allowed to proceed for 1–2 h at 37 °C, and terminated with the addition of 2 μl of 5 n NaOH, bringing the pH of the mixture to about 8.5, which irreversibly inhibits pepsin activity (31Rajagopalan T.G. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4940-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of Cross-linked Proteolytic Fragments—Based upon the fact that FXYD10 is not cleaved by pepsin under the conditions described above (see “Results”), proteolytic fragments produced after pepsin treatment were purified using pull-down experiments with protein A-Sepharose using an FXYD10-specific antibody. Post-proteolytic mixtures were mixed with solubilizing buffer containing (final concentrations) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% Nonidet 40. Solubilized protein fragments were mixed with prewashed complexes containing protein A-Sepharose beads equilibrated with the FXYD10 antibody followed by incubation for 16 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with solubilizing buffer, two times with solubilizing buffer containing 1 m NaCl, and two times with 20 mm histidine, pH 7.22. Dry beads were either suspended in histidine buffer prior to PKA phosphorylation or treated with SDS mix prior to loading on SDS gels. Sequence Analysis—Protein fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation at the protein structure Core Facility, University of Nebraska Medical Center. Mass spectroscopic analysis was performed at Alphalyse, Odense, Denmark. Homology Modeling of Shark α-Subunit Sequence—A homology model of the shark Na,K-ATPase α-subunit was built based on an alignment of the shark α-subunit sequence with that of the rabbit SERCA 1a. The shark α-subunit sequence was modeled onto the three-dimensional crystal structure of the rabbit SERCA 1a in the E1 conformation (Protein Data Bank code 1SU4, Ref. 32Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) using Swiss-Model in the “alignment mode” (33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of FXYD10 and the α-Subunit—The C-terminal end of FXYD10 contains three Cys residues (Cys43, Cys45, and Cys74) (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which could be possible targets for thiol cross-linkers. The presence of a Cys residue in the α-subunit in close proximity to one of the Cys residues of FXYD10 would allow covalent cross-linking of the two proteins. Therefore, the thiol cross-linking agent DMDB was used to test possible cross-linking between the α-subunit and FXYD10. DMDB is cleaved with periodate thus making it useful in positive control experiments following cross-linking and proteolytic cleavage. As seen in Fig. 1A, an immunoblot using an α-specific antibody showed that incubation of shark rectal gland membranes with DMDB resulted in the appearance of a band with higher molecular mass (about 100 kDa, lane 2) in addition to the native α-subunit normally running at 92 kDa in SDS gels (lane 1). A specific FXYD10 antibody detected only the upper 100-kDa band (Fig. 1B, lane 2), showing that the 100-kDa band represents an α·FXYD10 complex. In the lower part of the gel the 15-kDa FXYD10 band is noted together with a 22-kDa band representing oligomeric FXYD10 (22Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which is stabilized by the intermolecular cross-linking. The efficiency of cross-linking was about 40%, as estimated from the measured area intensity of the scanned bands. Similar cross-linking efficiency has also been reported for cross-linking of FXYD2 to renal Na,K-ATPase after optimization of cross-linking (26Fuzesi M. Kay-Eberhard Gottschalk K.-E. Lindzen M. Shainskaya A. Kuster B. Garty H. Karlish S. J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18291-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was found to decrease at increasing temperatures, being maximal at 10–24 °C and decreased at 37 °C (data not shown). DMDB in concentrations up to 500 μm was found not to influence the maximum hydrolytic activity of shark Na,K-ATPase (data not shown). Prolonged incubation of the membranes with the cross-linker (up to 2 h) did not further increase the efficiency of cross-linking. Cross-linking was abolished in membranes pretreated with 2% SDS or 5–10 mm Cys (data not shown), indicating that cross-linking is occurring in functional enzyme preparations, where the native interaction between FXYD10 and the α-subunit is preserved. Further experiments in which membranes were solubilized with the non-ionic detergent octaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (10 mm) (employed to exclude nonspecific intermolecular cross-links resulting from protein diffusion in the membrane) showed the same cross-linking pattern observed in Fig. 1 (data not shown). Finally, cross-linking at different enzyme dilutions also gave similar results (data not shown). The possibility of nonspecific cross-linking after solubilization of the membranes with SDS prior to gel electrophoresis was not likely because the cross-linking reactions were quenched with 5–10 mm DTT or Cys. Effect of Na,K-ATPase Substrates on Cross-linking—The effect of Na,K-ATPase ligands on cross-linking was studied by pre-incubating the purified membranes with sodium, potassium, or the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PCP prior to cross-linking. As seen in Fig. 2, pre-incubation of the Na,K-ATPase with increasing concentrations of either sodium (panel A) or potassium (panel B) did not affect the level of cross-linking of FXYD10 to the α-subunit. However, AMP-PCP significantly reduced cross-linking (Fig. 2C). Thus, incubation with 3 mm AMP-PCP reduced cross-linking by ∼70%, in accordance with previous functional studies demonstrating that the regulatory effects of FXYD10 on the Na,K-ATPase are reduced at high ATP concentrations (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Cross-linked Cysteine(s) in FXYD10 —The C terminus of FXYD10 can be specifically cleaved after incubation of shark rectal gland membranes with low concentrations of trypsin (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study the cleavage pattern of FXYD10 was studied by mass spectroscopy, which indicated that cleavage occurred C-terminal to Lys51. This cleavage will leave the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein (containing Cys43 and Cys45) associated with the membrane, whereas the soluble C-terminal fragment including Cys74 will be removed from the membranes by centrifugation. To test whether FXYD10 is cross-linked at Cys74 or at either Cys43/Cys45 we tested the ability of the C-terminally truncated FXYD10 to cross-link with the α-subunit. As seen in Fig. 3, cleaved FXYD10 does not cross-link with the α-subunit, strongly indicating that Cys74 in native FXYD10 is the site of cross-linking under the conditions used in this study. Proteolytic Assays—Cross-linking of FXYD10 to the shark α-subunit indicates the existence of two closely associated domains in α and FXYD10, each containing a Cys residue. We initially anticipated that extensive trypsin digestion of cross-linked preparations would result in a fragment containing the C terminus of FXYD10 cross-linked to a fragment from the α-subunit. However, initial attempts to produce an α·FXYD10 cross-linked fragment using extensive trypsin digestion were unsuccessful because of extensive fragmentation of the C terminus of FXYD10, in contrast to the single-site cleavage previously observed after treatment of the membranes with a low trypsin concentration (23Mahmmoud Y.A. Cramb G. Maunsbach A. Cutler C.P. Mieschke L. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37427-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As an alternative, we investigated the suitability of pepsin to cleave the α·FXYD10 complex in the hope that cleavage of FXYD10 at the Lys- and Arg-rich C-terminal phosphorylation motif could be avoided. Pepsin preferentially cleaves C-terminally to Phe, Leu, and Glu residues. After incubation of the membranes with pepsin (see “Experimental Procedures”) extensive cleavage of the α-subunit occurred (Fig. 4A), and no intact α could be detected on the gel. Also the 19-kDa C-terminal fragment, which is resistant to tryptic cleavage in the presence of potassium, was almost completely degraded by the pepsin treatment. Surprisingly, immunoblots probed with the anti-FXYD10 antibody still detected the 15-kDa band indicating the presence of intact FXYD10 (Fig. 4B), even after incubation with pepsin for up to 2 h (data not shown). Thus, incubation of the α·FXYD10 cross-linked complex with pepsin should result in extensive digestion of the α-subunit and produce two FXYD10 populations, free FXYD10 and FXYD10 cross-linked to a fragment of the α-subunit initially cross-linked with DMDB. Pepsin treatment of the pig kidney enzyme (which contains FXYD2) confirmed the suitability of the procedure for other FXYD-containing proteins because FXYD2 was also resistant to cleavage by pepsin (data not shown). Pepsin may thus be generally useful in experiments designed for isolation of cross-linked proteolytic fragments of other FXYD proteins with subunits of the Na,K-ATPase. Isolation of an α·FXYD10 Cross-linked Proteolytic Fragment—To isolate an α·FXYD10 cross-linked fragment, control and DMDB cross-linked preparations were treated with pepsin at pH 2.6 to obtain extensive cleavage of the α-subunit (see above), and the peptic fragments were purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified fragments were detected either with an FXYD10 antibody after SDS-PAGE or by phosphorylation of FXYD10 with PKA in the presence of [32P]ATP prior to gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 5, pepsin treatment of control and DMDB-cross-linked proteins resulted in three bands that reacted with the anti-FXYD10 antibody: monomeric FXYD10 running at 15 kDa, a band running at 22 kDa representing FXYD10 oligomers described previously (Ref. 22Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35969-35977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and Fig. 1B), and a third intermediate band running at 19 kDa that was present only in the cross-linked preparation but not in controls (Fig. 5A, right lane). This 19-kDa band was also phosphorylated after incubation with PKA, confirming the presence of FXYD10 (Fig. 5B, right lane). Pre-incubation of the pepsin cleavage products with NaIO4 prior to PKA phosphorylation and gel electrophoresis resulted in the disappearance of this 19-kDa band (data not shown). Thus, the 19-kDa fragment represents an α·FXYD10-fragment complex initially cross-linked with DMDB. Sequencing of the 19-kDa cross-linked proteolytic fragment by Edman degradation revealed, in addition to the FXYD10 sequence, the presence of the following fragment from the shark α-subunit: TRN246IAFFST... G261VVXYT (Fig. 5C and Table I). The sequence was identified to constitute a segment from the A domain of the shark α-subunit that includes a single highly conserved Cys residue, Cys254 (Cys244 in the rat α1 isoform). This Cys residue is present upstream to the S3 stalk segment of the α-subunit. In this area, potential cleavage sites for pepsin exist, among which the most likely are Leu242 or Glu243 and Leu275, producing the 33- or 34-amino acid α-fragment.Table IN-terminal sequences of the cross-linked trypsin-dige"

https://openalex.org/W2134989582,"Several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) serve as co-receptors for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into target cells. Here we report that a synthetic peptide derived from the NH2-terminal extracellular region of an orphan GPCR, GPR1 (GPR1ntP-(1-27); MEDLEETLFEEFENYSYDLDYYSLESC), inhibited infection of not only an HIV-1 variant that uses GPR1 as a co-receptor, but also X4, R5, and R5X4 viruses. Among these HIV-1 strains tested, viruses that can utilize CXCR4 as their co-receptors were preferentially inhibited. Inhibition of early steps in X4 virus replication was also detected in the primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes. GPR1ntP-(1-27) directly interacted with recombinant X4 envelope glycoprotein (rgp120). This interaction was neither inhibited nor enhanced by the soluble CD4 (sCD4) but inhibited by the anti-third variable (V3) loop-specific monoclonal antibody and heparin known to bind to the V3 loop. Although the conformational changes in gp120, including the V3 loop, have been reported to be required for its interaction with a co-receptor after binding of gp120 to CD4, it has also been reported that the V3 loop is already exposed on the surface of virions before interaction with CD4. We found that GPR1ntP-(1-27) blocked binding of virus to the cells, and this peptide equally bound to rgp120 in the presence or absence of sCD4. Because we detected the binding of GPR1ntP-(1-27) to the highly purified virions even in the absence of sCD4, GPR1ntP-(1-27) probably recognized the V3 loop exposed on the virions, and this interaction was responsible for the anti-HIV-1 activity of GPR1ntP-(1-27). Several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) serve as co-receptors for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) into target cells. Here we report that a synthetic peptide derived from the NH2-terminal extracellular region of an orphan GPCR, GPR1 (GPR1ntP-(1-27); MEDLEETLFEEFENYSYDLDYYSLESC), inhibited infection of not only an HIV-1 variant that uses GPR1 as a co-receptor, but also X4, R5, and R5X4 viruses. Among these HIV-1 strains tested, viruses that can utilize CXCR4 as their co-receptors were preferentially inhibited. Inhibition of early steps in X4 virus replication was also detected in the primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes. GPR1ntP-(1-27) directly interacted with recombinant X4 envelope glycoprotein (rgp120). This interaction was neither inhibited nor enhanced by the soluble CD4 (sCD4) but inhibited by the anti-third variable (V3) loop-specific monoclonal antibody and heparin known to bind to the V3 loop. Although the conformational changes in gp120, including the V3 loop, have been reported to be required for its interaction with a co-receptor after binding of gp120 to CD4, it has also been reported that the V3 loop is already exposed on the surface of virions before interaction with CD4.

CD4 glycoprotein as a receptor and GPCRs as co-receptors are required for the entry of HIV-1, and the cell tropism of HIV-1 is mainly determined by its ability to use co-receptors expressed on the target cells (3D'Souza M.P. Harden V.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 12: 1293-1300Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The major co-receptor for R5 viruses is CCR5, of which ligands are CC chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted), MIP1α, and MIP1β. On the other hand, the major co-receptor for X4 viruses is CXCR4, of which ligand is the CXC chemokine SDF-1. Dualtropic viruses (R5X4 viruses) can efficiently utilize both of these co-receptors (4Alkhatib G. Combadiere C. Broder C.C. Feng Y. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A.

In addition, primary human brain-derived fibroblast-like cells (BT-cells) are isolated from microvessel segments derived from autopsy of human brain tissue, are positive for CD4 and highly susceptible to HIV-1 variants, but are resistant to R5, X4, and R5X4 HIV-1 strains (10Takeuchi Y.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). BT-cells are thought to be originated from smooth muscle cells or pericytes. We have previously shown that the substitution of Pro to Ser at the Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg sequence in the V3 loop of envelope glycoprotein (gp120) is responsible for the BT-cell tropism of the HIV-1 variants (10Takeuchi Y.

Virol. 1994; 68: 6130-6135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified orphan GPCRs, GPR1 and RDC1, as co-receptors for the HIV-1 variants in vitro (13Shimizu N. Soda Y. Kanbe K.

Virol. 2000; 74: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Not only HIV-1 variants, but also several strains of HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus have been shown to utilize GPR1 and RDC1 as their co-receptors (13Shimizu N. Soda Y. Kanbe K. Liu H.Y.

During the course of our previous experiments to generate anti-GPR1 antibody (α-GPR1) by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from the NH2-terminal extracellular region (NH2-ECR) of GPR1 (GPR1ntP-(1-27)), we found unexpectedly that not only α-GPR1 but also GPR1ntP-(1-27) was able to block GPR1-mediated infection of BT-cells with HIV-1 variants. Because it has been demonstrated that the NH2-ECRs of the co-receptors play an important role in the interaction with gp120 and a subsequent infection steps (16Dragic T. Trkola A. Lin S.W.

Virol. 2001; 82: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we speculated that GPR1ntP-(1-27) might inhibit interaction of gp120 (HIV-1 variants) with its co-receptor, GPR1, on target cell membrane. In the present study, we tested anti-HIV-1 activity of GPR1ntP-(1-27) by several assays, including focal infectivity assay, HIV-1 p24 Gag detection assay, PCR assay, and syncytium formation assay. These assays all demonstrated an inhibitory activity of GPR1ntP-(1-27) against HIV-1 infection. Surprisingly, anti-HIV-1 activity of GPR1ntP-(1-27) was detected not only in HIV-1 variants that utilize GPR1 as a co-receptor, but also in genetically diverse isolates, including X4, R5, and R5X4 viruses. Our findings suggest that synthetic peptides derived from the NH2-ECR of GPR1 are novel candidates for the development of GPCR-based and peptide-based agents to inhibit HIV-1 infection. Cells—NP-2 cells were derived from a human glioma and kindly provided by Dr. T. Kumanishi (Niigata University, Niigata, Japan).

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of healthy subjects by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation. PBLs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin prior to HIV-1 infection and cultured in RPMI/FCS and 100 units/ml of recombinant interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. HIV-1 Strains—The GUN-1WT strain is a clinical isolate and can infect both T-cell lines and macrophages, but not BT-cells (10Takeuchi Y. Akutsu M. Murayama K. Shimizu N. Hoshino H. J.

Similar to the variant of GUN-1WT strain, GUN-1Ser strain, which had been prepared by the ligation and transfection of cloned HIV-1 (GUN-1WT) DNA fragments containing a mutation of proline to serine made by the site-directed mutagenesis at the GPGR sequence in the V3 loop, can infect BT-cells as well as T-cell lines (10Takeuchi Y.

The sheep antibody against soluble CD4 (sCD4) was obtained from the AIDS Reagent Project of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (Potters Bar, United Kingdom). The mAb to human CD4 (NU-TH/I), which inhibits HIV-1 gp120 binding to human CD4 and recognizes a discontinuous conformational epitope corresponding to the complementary-determining region 2 and 3 (CDR2 and CDR3) of CD4 (32Oravecz T.

Namely, NP-2/CD4 cells expressing one of GPCRs were seeded at 2 × 104 per well into 24-well tissue culture plates (Corning, Acton, MA), infected with 200 μl of the virus (1,000-2,500 focus-forming units per ml) in the presence or absence of one of the synthetic peptides. After 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed, fresh culture medium was added, and the cultures were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and then incubated with anti-HIV-1 sera from AIDS patients diluted 1:300 with 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS (blocking buffer A) for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody to human IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:200 with blocking buffer A for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and rinsed with Tris-buffered saline. To develop the color, cells were reacted in the dark with a solution of aminoethyl carbazol (Sigma) and H2O2 in acetate buffer (pH 5.0) for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed with water, air dried, and examined under a microscope. To determine the inhibitory activity of peptide to HIV-1 infection (inhibition (%)), the following formula was used: [(the number of foci with no peptide - the number of foci with peptide)/the number of foci with no peptide] × 100%. To examine the effect of GPR1ntP-(1-27) on the infectivity of HIV-1 primary isolates, the level of p24Gag protein in culture supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described elsewhere (38Mckeating J. Karn J. The Practical Approach Series, HIV Volume 1. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 117-126Google Scholar). Azido-3′-deoxythymidine was purchased from Sigma. PCR Assay to Detect Reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA—The virus preparation (IIIB strain) was treated with RNase-free DNase I (10 units/ml, Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C to remove contaminating viral DNA or cellular DNA. DNase I-treated IIIB virus was incubated with one of the synthetic peptides for 1 h at 37 °C, and inoculated onto MOLT-4 cells (5 × 105) or PBLs (5 × 105) for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed, and fresh medium was added. After incubation for 20 h, the cells were washed and lysed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.45% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 0.45% Tween 20 (Sigma), and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma). The cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 52 °C, heated for 10 min at 96 °C to inactivate proteinase K, and used as templates for the subsequent PCR analysis to detect the formation of reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA within the cells. PCR was performed with HIV-1 gag-specific primers, SK38 and SK39 (39Quiros E. Garcia F. Maroto M.C. Bernal M.C. Cabezas T. Piedrola G. J. Med.

The human β-globin gene primers, KM29 and KM38 (nucleotide sequence: KM29, 5′-GGTTGGCCAATCTACTCCCAGG-3′; KM38, 5′-TGGTCTCCTTAAACCTGTCTTG-3′) (40Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) were used as an internal control. DNA amplification was performed in the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 9 min, 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. HIV-1 Cell Binding Assay—HIV-1-cell binding assay was essentially done according to the protocol described by Valenzuela et al. (41Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MOLT-4 cells (6 × 106) were incubated with HIV-1 (IIIB strain) (200 ng of p24Gag) for 1 h at 37 °C in RPMI/FCS (final volume, 0.5 ml). When indicated, viral preparation was incubated with GPR1ntP-(1-27), GPR1ntP-(Y/A), 0.5β, or heparin, while the cells were incubated with anti-CD4 mAb, NU-TH/I, before binding. After incubation of the cells with HIV-1, the cells were washed once with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and twice with RPMI/FCS. Then, the cells were lysed with 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml of aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. Then, the concentration of HIV-1 p24Gag in the supernatants was determined by ELISA. The amount of p24Gag in these cell extracts was expressed as the total amount of viral p24Gag associated with the cells as described by Valenzuela et al. (41Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), because this value showed both viral p24Gag bound to the surface of cells and viral p24Gag that has entered the cells. To detect only HIV-1 that entered MOLT-4 cells, extracellular bound virus was removed. For this, cells were treated with 2.5 mg/ml of trypsin in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA for 40 s at room temperature after the cells were washed with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Then, the cells were washed twice with RPMI/FCS, lysed, and the concentration of intracellular p24Gag was determined by ELISA. As compared with a T-cell line, CEM cells, which have been reported to be treated with trypsin for 5 min (41Valenzuela A. Blanco J. Krust B. Franco R. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MOLT-4 cells were treated with it for 40 s because they were highly sensitive to trypsin. Syncytium Formation Assay—MOLT-4/IIIB cells and C8166 cells were suspended in RPMI medium at 1 × 105 cells per ml and 5 × 105 cells per ml, respectively. Before addition of 50 μl of C8166 cell suspension to each well of a U-bottom 96-well plate (Corning), MOLT-4/IIIB cells (50 μl per well) were incubated with 100 μl of RPMI medium containing one of the synthetic peptides or the medium alone for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation at 37 °C for 17 h, the number of syncytia per well was counted by light microscope observation (42Clapham P.R. Blanc D. Weiss R.A. Virology. 1991; 181: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of peptide to syncytium formation (inhibition (%)) was calculated using the following formula: [(the number of syncytia with no peptide - the number of syncytia with peptide)/the number of syncytia with no peptide] × 100%. Association of GPR1ntP-(1-27) with HIV-1 Virions—To concentrate virus particles (IIIB strain), the culture supernatant (10 ml) of MOLT-4/IIIB cells was layered onto a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion (2.5 ml) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C using a Hitachi SRP28 rotor (Hitachi Koki Co., Tokyo, Japan). The viral pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), layered onto the top of a continuous sucrose gradient (20-60% (w/v) sucrose in TNE) (43Bess Jr., J.W. Powell P.J. Issaq H.J. Schumack L.J. Grimes M.K. Henderson L.E. Arthur L.O. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 840-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Dettenhofer M. Yu X.-F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions (700 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient, and the density of each fraction was determined. An aliquot from each fraction (50 μl) was mixed with 50 μl of TNE buffer containing 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 56 °C, and the HIV-1 p24Gag protein was detected by dot blotting as described below. The fractions that contained HIV-1 virions were pooled, concentrated again by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C using an RP55S rotor (Hitachi Koki Co.), suspended in TNE buffer, and used for detection of the association of synthetic peptides (GPR1ntP-(1-27) or X4ntP-(1-28)) with the HIV-1 virions. The viral suspension (100 μl) was incubated with one of peptides (5 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C, subjected to sucrose density gradient sedimentation, and then fractionated. The dot blotting was carried out to detect the presence of the HIV-1 p24Gag protein and peptides in each fraction using anti-p24Gag mAb and anti-peptide antibodies, respectively. Dot Blotting—The HIV-1 lysates prepared after sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a Minifol-Microsample Filtration Manifold (Schleicher & Schuell). They were then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (w/v) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) (PBST) (blocking buffer B) for 2 h at 37 °C. The membranes were then probed with α-p24Gag mouse mAb diluted 1:1000 with blocking buffer B, or anti-peptide antibodies (α-GPR1 or α-CXCR4; 2 μg/ml in blocking buffer B) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed three times with PBST, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody to mouse or rabbit IgG (DAKO) diluted 1:1000 with blocking buffer B for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times. Immunoreactive spots were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Detection of Binding of rgp120 to GPR1 Peptides by ELISA—The recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp120) of HIV-1 (IIIB strain) produced in a baculovirus expression system, >90% pure, was obtained from the AIDS Reagent Project of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (Potters Bar, United Kingdom). ELISA to detect peptide-rgp120 or sCD4-rgp120 interaction was based on the protocol as described (45Van Opstal O. Fabry L. Francotte M. Thiriart C. Bruck C. Karn J. The Practical Approach Series, HIV Volume 2. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 105-122Google Scholar), with a few modifications. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning) were coated with GPR1ntP-(1-27) or its fragment or mutant peptides (0.015-5 μm in PBS) for overnight at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and blocked with blocking buffer A for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, rgp120 (0.016 μm) in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBST. To detect bound rgp120, anti-HIV-1 sera from AIDS patients diluted 1:2000 with 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBST (blocking buffer C) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBST. Then horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody to human IgG diluted 1:5000 with blocking buffer C was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBST, and rinsed with PBS. To develop color, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Bio-Rad) as a substrate was added for 20 min at room temperature, and 1 n H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction. Then the optical densities (A) at 450 nm were determined. For detection of interaction of sCD4 with GPR1ntP-(1-27), microtiter wells were coated with GPR1ntP-(1-27) as described above. Then, sCD4 (0.016 μm), which was obtained from the AIDS Reagent Project of the United Kingdom Medical Research Council, was added for 2 h at room temperature. Bound sCD4 w"
