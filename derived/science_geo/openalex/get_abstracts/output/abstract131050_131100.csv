In contrast to IgA1, the glycosylation of IgG has been well characterized, and its interaction with various Fc receptors (FcγRs) has been well studied. In this paper, we have analyzed the glycosylation of IgA1 and IgA1 Fab and Fc as well as three recombinant IgA1 molecules, including twoN-glycosylation mutants. Amino acid sequencing data of the IgA1 Fc O-glycosylated hinge region indicated thatO-glycans are located at Thr228, Ser230, and Ser232, while O-glycan sites at Thr225 and Thr236 are partially occupied. Over 90% of the N-glycans in IgA1 were sialylated, in contrast to IgG, where <10% contain sialic acid. This paper contains the first report of Fab glycosylation in IgA1, and (in contrast to IgG Fab, which contains only N-linked glycans) both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides were identified. Analysis of the N-glycans attached to recombinant IgA1 indicated that the Cα2 N-glycosylation site contained mostly biantennary glycans, while the tailpiece site, absent in IgG, contained mostly triantennary structures. Further analysis of these data suggested that processing at one FcN-glycosylation site affects the other. Neutrophil FcαR binding studies, using recombinant IgA1, indicated that neither the tailpiece region nor the N-glycans in the Cα2 domain contribute to IgA1-neutrophil FcαR binding. This contrasts with IgG, where removal of the Fc N-glycans reduces binding to the FcγR. The primary sequence and disulfide bond pattern of IgA1, together with the crystal structures of IgG1 Fc and mouse IgA Fab and the glycan sequencing data, were used to generate a molecular model of IgA1. As a consequence of both the primary sequence and S–S bond pattern, the N-glycans in IgA1 Fc are not confined within the inter-α-chain space. The accessibility of the Cα2N-glycans provides an explanation for the increased sialylation and galactosylation of IgA1 Fc over that of IgG FcN-glycans, which are confined in the space between the two Cγ2 domains. This also suggests why in contrast to IgG Fc, the IgA1N-glycans are not undergalactosylated in rheumatoid arthritis.

Serum IgA, produced in bone marrow, consists predominantly of monomeric IgA1 (1Delacroix D.L. Dive C. Rambaud J.C. Vaerman J.P. Immunology. 1982; 47: 383-385PubMed Google Scholar). IgA interacts with specific Fcα receptors (FcαR) 1The abbreviations used are: FcαR, receptor for the Fc region of IgA; FcγR, receptor for the Fc region of IgG; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GF, gel filtration; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NIP, 3-nitro-4-hydroxy-5-iodophenylacetate; NP-HPLC, normal phase high performance liquid chromatography; WAX, weak anionic exchange; 2-AB, 2-aminobenzamide; gu, glucose unit; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F. The nomenclature for describing oligosaccharide structures is as follows: An (wheren = 1, 2, 3, or 4) indicates the number of antennae linked to the trimannosyl core; Gn (where n= 0–4) indicates the number of terminal galactose residues in the structure; F, core fucose; Fo, outer arm fucose attached α1–3 to GlcNAc; B, bisecting GlcNAc; S, sialic acid (indicated within brackets are the specific linkages (6 or 3), and subscript numbers after these parentheses indicate the number of these residues in the specific linkage; M or Man, mannose; GalNAc, reducing terminalN-acetyl galactosamine of mucin-like O-linked glycans. present on granulocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, which can mediate phagocytosis, superoxide generation, enzyme release, and the clearance of immune complexes (2Morton H.C. van Egmond M. van de Winkel J.G.T. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 423-440PubMed Google Scholar). IgA antibody molecules lack the C1q binding site present on IgG (3Duncan A.R. Woof J.M. Partridge L.J. Burton D.R. Winter G. Nature. 1988; 332: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and do not activate the classical complement pathway (4Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar, 5Russell M.W. Mansa B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1989; 30: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The activation of the alternative complement pathway by IgA remains controversial. A study avoiding artificial aggregation and chemical modification has shown that chimeric IgA1 bound to C3, but no C3b was generated (6Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, using chimeric IgA2, binding to C3 leads to C3b formation and the terminal complement complex (7Zhang W. Lachmann P.J. Immunolgy. 1994; 81: 137-141PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the reported anti-inflammatory activity of IgA1 antibodies (8Nikolova E.B. Tomana M. Russell M.W. Scand. J. Immunol. 1994; 39: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Jarvis G.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1962-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 10Russell M.W. Reinholdt J. Kilian M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Human IgA1 contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites in each α-chain (Asn263 and Asn459), while the IgA2 subclass contains an additional two (IgA2m(1)) or three (IgA2m(2)) conserved N-glycans. In addition, Putnam and colleagues identified an N-glycosylation acceptor sequon in the variable region of the Bur myeloma α-chain of IgA1 (11Toraño A. Tsuzukida Y. Liu Y.-S.V. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2301-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which was not present in either the IgA2 subclass (12Toraño A. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 966-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or IgA1 isolated from other myeloma patients (13Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7260-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-glycans of myeloma IgA1 have been reported as biantennary complex-type structures with sialic acids attached exclusively in the α2–6 linkage (13Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7260-7269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first detailed structural analysis of the glycans of normal serum IgA1 was published by Field et al. (14Field M.C. Amatayakul S. Rademacher T.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, as with other studies (15Endo T. Mestecky J. Kulhavy R. Kobata A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the analysis was carried out on the desialylated glycan pool from intact IgA1 and sialylated glycans were not directly analyzed. The N-glycans identified by Field et al. (14Field M.C. Amatayakul S. Rademacher T.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were predominantly of the biantennary complex type with a core Fuc, bisecting GlcNAc, or both, and were generally similar to those reported for myeloma IgA1. In addition, approximately 13.6% of tri- and tetraantennary structures were reported. IgA1 contains a proline-rich hinge sequence between the Fab and Fc regions of the glycoprotein (Fig. 1). Within this sequence, there are nine potential O-glycosylation sites/α-chain (18 sites/molecule). The occupancy of these sites in normal serum IgA1 is not known. In myeloma serum IgA1, the sites ofO-glycosylation were located at the five serine residues (16Baenziger J. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7270-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, both serine and threonine residues areO-glycosylated in the hinge region of serum IgD (17Mellis S.J. Baenziger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11557-11563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and secretory IgA1 (18Pierce-Cretel A. Pamblanco M. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), although in the latter case no experimental data was presented. These differences in O-glycan site occupancy as well as the finding that the O-glycans of secretory IgA1 are larger and more heterogeneous than in myeloma IgA1 (18Pierce-Cretel A. Pamblanco M. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Pierce-Cretel A. Decottignies J.P. Spik G. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Wieruszeski J.M. Euro. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 457-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) may reflect tissue-specific glycosylation. IgA N-glycosylation is required for the intracellular stability and secretion of mouse IgA (20Taylor A.K. Wall R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Hickman S. Kulczycki Jr., A. Lynch R.G. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4402-4408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that this is not the case for either human IgA1 (6Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar) or human IgA2 (7Zhang W. Lachmann P.J. Immunolgy. 1994; 81: 137-141PubMed Google Scholar). The IgA1 study also indicated a role forN-glycosylation in antigen binding, suggesting that the secretion of glycosidases by bacteria may aid their survival in the host. In addition, certain species of bacteria may avoid an immune response by secreting IgA1-specific proteases. These proteases cleave the highly stable O-glycosylated hinge region of IgA1, thereby separating the two monomeric antigen-binding regions from the effector region of the antibody. These IgA1 protease-producing bacteria include the three leading agents of bacterial meningitis as well as other clinically important bacterial infections of the genitourinary and respiratory tracts (reviewed in Ref. 22Kilian M. Reinholdt J. Lomholt H. Poulsen K. Frandsen V.G. APMIS. 1996; 104: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Interestingly, theO-glycosylation status of the immunoglobulin is known to affect the activity of some of the proteases (23Reinholdt J. Tomana M. Mortensen S.B. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1186-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IgA1 glycans have been implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases including IgA nephropathy (24Allen A.C. Harper S.J. Feehally J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 100: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 25Mestecky J. Tomana M. Hashim O.H. Brown R. Kulhavy R. Julian B.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9 (A74): A74Google Scholar, 26Rudd P.M. Fortune F. Patel T. Parekh R.B. Dwek R.A. Lehner T. Immunology. 1994; 83: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar, 27Andre P.M. Le P.P. Chevet D. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1990; 4: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study of pooled serum IgA1, we have (a) determined the sialylation of the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides; (b) defined the sites ofO-glycosylation in the proline-rich hinge region of IgA1; (c) provided the first report that the Fab region of IgA1 is glycosylated, identifying both N- and O-glycans; (d) compared the N-glycosylation of wild-type recombinant IgA1 and N-glycan deletion mutants to determine whether occupancy of one Fc N-glycosylation site affects processing at the other; and (e) explored the location and orientation of the IgA1 N-glycans in a molecular model of IgA1, constructed from the crystal structures of human IgG1 Fc fragment (28Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), mouse Fab fragment (29Suh S.W. Bhat T.N. Navia M.A. Cohen G.H. Rao D.N. Rudikoff S. Davies D.R. Proteins Struct. Func. Genet. 1986; 1: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the analytical data obtained in this study. This model suggested some possible explanations for the differences in the composition of the glycan populations in IgA1 and IgG and in their structural and functional roles. In IgG, the conserved Fc N-glycans are situated in the interstitial region between the CH2 domains and, as a consequence, are incompletely galactosylated and sialylated. Binding to C1q is reduced upon degalactosylation (30Tsuchiya N. Endo T. Matsuta K. Yoshinoya S. Aikawa T. Kosuge E. Takeuchi F. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. J. Rheumatol. 1989; 16: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar) or deglycosylation (31Tao M.-H. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar), and, although the glycans are not required for binding to protein A (32Leatherbarrow R.J. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Woof J.M. Clarke A. Burton D.R. Richardson N. Feinstein A. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), they are necessary to maintain the conformation of the Fc region to allow binding to FcγR (30Tsuchiya N. Endo T. Matsuta K. Yoshinoya S. Aikawa T. Kosuge E. Takeuchi F. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. J. Rheumatol. 1989; 16: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that IgA1 Fc N-glycans may play a similar structural role to those in IgG Fc by comparing the binding of carbohydrate-deficient IgA1 mutants to the neutrophil FcαR with that of wild-type recombinant IgA1. Goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgA fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate was purchased from Caltag (Bradsure Biologicals, UK). ProSorb cartridges were obtained from Perkin-Elmer Ltd. (Applied Biosystems Division, Warrington, UK). Glycan sequencing HPLC columns (GlycoSep-C and GlycoSep-N) were purchased from Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd. Enzymes were obtained as follows: PNGase F from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, UK); Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase, almond meal α-fucosidase, Newcastle disease virus Hitchner B1 strain neuraminidase, and bovine testes β-galactosidase from Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd.; jack beanN-acetyl β-hexosaminidase, Charonia lampasα-fucosidase, and jack bean α-mannosidase from Oxford Glycobiology Institute. Pooled human serum IgA1 was prepared as previously reported (14Field M.C. Amatayakul S. Rademacher T.W. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified IgA1 (2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) was incubated for 36 h at 37 °C with the extracellular bacterial protease secreted by C. ramosum(33Fujiyama Y. Iwaki M. Hodohara K. Hosoda S. Kobayashi K. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Fc and Fab fragments (Fig. 1) were purified by gel filtration (GF)-HPLC (TSK SW3000GW; 21.5 × 600 mm; 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m sodium chloride, pH 7.2). Fractions containing Fc and Fab were identified by molecular weight (SDS-PAGE), pooled appropriately, and purified to homogeneity by repetitive GF-HPLC. The purity of the isolated fragments was confirmed by reducing SDS-PAGE (12.5%), GF-HPLC, and N-terminal sequencing. The purified Fc fragment (15 μg) was denatured by boiling for 10 min in 4 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. After cooling, 2 μl of 5% Nonidet P-40 was added followed by the 6 μl of PNGase F (3000 units), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. All samples were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 470A protein sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). The Fc fragment was analyzed using an elevated temperature (48 °C) to facilitate quantitative cleavage of the prolyl residues from the peptide chain during Edman reaction. Samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane prior to sequencing using ProSorb cartridges (Perkin-Elmer). A wild-type plasmid vector based on pEE6.hCMV (34Whittle N. Adair J. Lloyd C. Jenkins L. Devine J. Schlom Raubitschek A. Colcher D. Bodmer M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and containing the human α1 gene downstream of a mouse Vnp domain has been described previously (4Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of an expression vector for the IgA1 mutant Pterm455, in which the entire tailpiece was deleted, involved replacing the first tailpiece residue (proline) with a stop codon (35Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the Asn263 to Ala263mutant (N263A, lacking the Asn263 N-glycan acceptor site) the wild-type IgA1 expression vector was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Mutagenesis was performed using a 3′-primer annealing to a unique restriction site (SalI; as described by Atkin et al. (35Atkin J.D. Pleass R.J. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar)) and a 5′-mismatch primer (5′-CTGCACCGACCGGCCCTCGAGACCTGCTCTTAGGTTCAGAAGCGGCCCTCACGTGCACACTGACC-3′) annealed across a unique restriction site (XhoI) and in which the codon AAC (coding for Asn263) was replaced with GCC (coding for Ala). Following digestion with XhoI andSalI, polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into the XhoI/SalI-digested α1 expression vector, replacing the wild-type sequence in this region. Restriction analysis confirmed that the insert was correctly oriented. DNA sequencing (36Chen E.Y. Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1985; 4: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) confirmed that the predicted mutation had been incorporated and that no misincorporations had occurred during polymerase chain reaction amplification. Transfections of IgA1 heavy chain expression vectors into CHO-K1 cells previously transfected with a compatible light chain were performed as described (4Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones expressing high levels of IgA, as assessed by antigen-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were selected and expanded in culture (4Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant antibodies were purified from supernatants of CHO-K1 transfectants by affinity chromatography on NIP-Sepharose (4Morton H.C. Atkin J.D. Owens R.J. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4743-4752PubMed Google Scholar). N-Glycans were released from the purified glycoproteins (IgA1, 1065 μg; Fab fragment, 610 μg; Fc fragment, 280 μg; recombinant IgA1 wild type, 120 μg; N263A, 84 μg; and Pterm455, 200 μg) by hydrazinolysis at 95 °C using a GlycoPrep1000 (Oxford GlycoSciences) optimized for maximum recovery (∼85%) of glycans (37Patel T. Bruce J Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jacques A. Parekh P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). IgA1, Fab, and Fc were cryogenically dried over activated charcoal at −196 °C (<0.1 pascal) and incubated with double vacuum-distilled hydrazine at 60 °C for 4 h according to standard procedures (37Patel T. Bruce J Merry A. Bigge C. Wormald M. Jacques A. Parekh P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) to release O-glycans preferentially with minimal degradation. During peptide removal by descending chromatography, the retention of GalNAc was compared against authentic GalNAc visualized with alkaline silver nitrate (38Chaplin M.F. Chaplin M.F. Kennedy J.F. Carbohydrate Analysis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1986: 15Google Scholar). Glycans were recovered from the first 13 cm from the origin of the chromatography paper by elution with water through a 0.45-μm filter, evaporated to dryness, and stored at −20 °C in water (100 μl) until labeled. All released glycan pools were fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB; Oxford GlycoSciences Signal Labeling Kit), and excess reagent was removed by ascending paper chromatography using acetonitrile as the solvent. The sugars were eluted with water, filtered, and stored at −20 °C. High performance anion exchange chromatography was carried out using a GlycoSep-C column (Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd.) according to the conditions described (39Guile G.R. Wong S.Y.C. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The column was calibrated by the analysis of 2-AB-labeled sialylated glycans from bovine fetuin. Normal phase HPLC was carried out using the 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.4, buffer system on a GlycoSep-N column over 180 min, as described previously (40Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The column was calibrated using 2-AB-labeled dextran hydrolysate, the elution positions of which were used to obtain the NP-HPLC glucose unit (gu) values for each glycan. Enzyme digests were performed at 37 °C for 16–24 h in 100 mmcitrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.2 mm zinc acetate, 0.15m sodium chloride in 10-μl volumes. The enzymes were used either together in various combinations (termed an enzyme array) or alone, as specified in the appropriate figure legend. After incubation, proteins were removed by filtration through nitrocellulose (Pro-Spin, Radleys, UK) as described (41.Mattu, T. S., The Glycosylation of the IgA 1 MoleculePh.D. thesis, 1996, University of Oxford.Google Scholar). An aliquot of the aqueous sample (∼25 pmol) was mixed with acetonitrile in the ratio 30:70 and applied to the NP-HPLC column. Conditions for the digestions are as described previously (42Rudd P.M. Morgan B.P. Wormald M.R. Harvey D.J. van den Berg C.W. Davis S.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7229-7244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The cleavage positions for the exoglycosidases are shown in Fig. 2 b. Rosette assays were performed (43Krugmann S. Pleass R.J. Atkin J.D. Woof J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 224-249Google Scholar) using NIP-derivatized RBC sensitized with wild-type or mutant IgA1. Coating levels for each antibody were found to be equivalent by reactivity with goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgA fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate as assessed by flow cytometry. Rosetting of sensitized RBC to neutrophils was performed in V-bottomed microtiter plates. An effector cell with three or more RBC attached was scored as a rosette. Molecular modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics Indigo II computer using the Insight 95 and Discover software package (Biosys Tech, Inc., San Diego, CA). Initially, the Fab and Fc structures were modeled separately, linked to give a model of the entire antibody, and then minimized. The model of the human IgA1 Fab was based on the mouse IgA Fab crystal structure (29Suh S.W. Bhat T.N. Navia M.A. Cohen G.H. Rao D.N. Rudikoff S. Davies D.R. Proteins Struct. Func. Genet. 1986; 1: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), while the human IgA1 Fc model was based on the human IgG1 Fc (28Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Protein crystal coordinates were obtained from the Brookhaven data base (44Bernstein F. Kaetzle T. Williams G. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8194) Google Scholar). Both the sequence alignment (45Feinstein A. Beale D. Glynn L.E. Steward M.W. Immunochemistry: An Advanced Textbook. John Wiley, and Sons, Inc., New York1977: 263-306Google Scholar) and inspection of the protein tertiary structure determined the location of sequence insertions and deletions. In all cases, insertions and deletions could be made in loops or linker regions between the domains; these regions were reconstructed using structural homology searches. The structure of the proline-rich hinge region (Val222 to Pro240) was modeled as an extended peptide sequence with all proline residues in thetrans conformation (46Pao Y.-L. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Lellouch A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The tailpiece (residues 454–472) was also modeled as an extended peptide.

Immunochemistry: An Advanced Textbook.

After each step, the resulting model was optimized by energy minimization. Initial unfavorable nonbonded contacts that resulted in energy conflicts were adjusted by altering the side chain torsion angles. Subsequent optimization of nonbonded and bond geometries were carried out using the steepest descent energy minimization (minimum of 500 steps/cycle) with the AMBER force field parameters (50Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comp. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar). All minimizations were carried out in vacuo, using a dielectric constant of 80. The final model of the IgA1 Fc fragment was obtained by firstly attaching the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides as preminimized intact units to the IgA1 Fc structure and optimizing the model by energy minimization. This was followed by attaching the Fab fragment to each heavy chain after which the model was again optimized by energy minimization. The structures for the individual domains resulting from the insertions, deletions, and point replacements were verified by examination of the amino acid distribution within the individual domains. In all cases, hydrophobic residues were found in the core of the domains or in the domain interfaces (VH:VL, Cα1:CL, Cα3:Cα3), with charged residues on or proximal to the protein surface. The disulfide linkage pattern in the Cα2 domain consists of the conserved Ig domain disulfide (Cys266–Cys323), one additional intra-Cα2 domain disulfide (Cys242–Cys301), and two inter-Cα2 domain disulfide bridges (Cys241 and Cys299). The inter-Cα2 domain disulfide at Cys299 is located within the N-linked glycosylation sequon of IgG1 Fc, and for this bond to form in IgA1, the Cα2 domain had to be displaced. The Cα2-Cα3 domain linker peptide was sufficiently flexible to enable the displacement to be performed without changes in the structure of either Ig domain. A further consequence of the altered disulfide pattern in IgA1 is the steric crowding around the N termini of the Cα2 domains. Affinity-purified IgA1 was fractionated by GF-HPLC to remove polymeric immunoglobulins and contaminating C1 esterase. The final yield was 0.6 mg/ml serum. The IgA1 was >98% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE, immunoprecipitation, and N-terminal sequencing. The preparation gave two bands on reducing SDS-PAGE at 58 kDa (heavy chain) and 25 kDa (light chain; Fig.3 a, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation confirmed the presence of IgA1, while other immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA2) were not detected. No N-terminal sequence was detected apart from the sequence for IgA. Exhaustive proteolysis of affinity-purified IgA1 by C. ramosum protease released the expected Fc- and Fd-light chain heterodimer (Fab) fragments. The digest"

A variety of dsRNA molecules generated during viral infection, specific single-stranded RNAs, and various agents, such as heparin, activate PKR from its latent form. Upon activation, PKR displays two known activities: autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its physiological substrate, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α). eIF-2α phosphorylation impairs its ability to recycle and thus inhibits protein synthesis at the level of initiation (3Pain V.M.

As a consequence, activated PKR inhibits viral replication (5Meurs E.F. Watanabe Y. Kadereit S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. J.

This observation is ascribed to a trans-dominant inhibitory effect of the mutant enzyme on the endogenous wild-type PKR and implicates PKR as a tumor suppressor gene (11Koromilas A.E. Roy S.

PKR is also implicated in the transcriptional regulation of dsRNA-activated genes, such as interferon β, by activation of nuclear transcription factor κB (NFκB) by phosphorylating its inhibitor, IκB, in response to dsRNA (15Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 16Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Polypeptide chain synthesis is initiated when the ternary complex of heterotrimeric eIF-2, GTP, and initiator met-tRNA bind the 40S ribosomal subunit to generate a 43S preinitiation complex (for reviews, see Refs. 3Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar and 4Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Subsequently, mRNA binds and the 60S ribosomal subunit joins to form the 80S initiation complex with the concomitant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. For eIF-2 to promote another round of initiation, GDP bound to eIF-2 must be exchanged for GTP, a reaction catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (eIF-2B). Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF-2 (eIF-2α) stabilizes the eIF-2·GDP·eIF-2B complex. Because eIF-2B is obligatory for the exchange of GTP for bound GDP and because eIF-2B exists in cells in relatively low molar quantities with respect to eIF-2, the exchange process can be inhibited when only a fraction (i.e.10–20%) of eIF-2α is phosphorylated (18Safer B. Cell. 1983; 33: 7-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of eIF-2α is part of a key regulatory process that is proposed to result in the quantitative sequestering of eIF-2B that can virtually shut down protein synthesis initiation. TNFα is an inflammatory cytokine that, upon binding to its receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2, initiates signaling pathways that play important roles in cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis, a physiologically controlled process important in development and pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases (for review, see Ref. 19Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Upon binding of TNFα, TNFR1 becomes trimerized and recruits the adapter protein, TNF receptor-associated death domain, which subsequently recruits Fas-associating protein with death domain to activate the interleukin-1 converting enzyme family of cysteine proteases that induce an apoptotic signal. TNFα provides an antiviral function for the host by targeting virus-infected cells for apoptotic cell death (20Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1839) Google Scholar, 21Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 22Wong G.H.W. Kamb A. Goeddel D.V. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factor: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. Raven Press, New York1992: 371-381Google Scholar). In addition, upon trimerization of TNFR1, TNFR-associated factor is recruited to lead to activation of NFκB through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, IκB. Activation of NFκB induces the expression of survival genes. Because PKR is implicated in dsRNA-activation of NFκB through phosphorylation of its inhibitor, IκB (16Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J.

Williams B.R.G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and because PKR induces apoptosis in the context of a vaccinia virus infection (6Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), we studied the ability of PKR to induce programmed cell death in response to TNFα by analyzing fibroblasts expressing atrans-dominant negative K296P mutant PKR to inhibit the PKR signaling pathway(s). Our results indicate that PKR can induce apoptosis through phosphorylation of eIF-2α. NIH3T3 cell lines that were transfected and selected for expression of the catalytically inactive K296P mutant PKR were previously described (23Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with the pEDmtxrVA− empty vector and pSV2Neo, selected for G418 resistance, pooled, and used as a control. NIH3T3 cells transfected and selected for wild-type and S51A mutant eIF-2α expression were previously described (24Ramaiah K.V.A. Davies M.V. Chen J.-J. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin in 100-mm tissue culture dishes (for cell cycle and DNA fragmentation analysis) or on coverslips (for fluorescence microscopy). Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TNFα or in the presence of 10% FBS or 0.1% FBS for times indicated in the figure legends. Where indicated, cells were treated with interferon α (1000 units/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 h and then treated with poly(I)·poly(C) (100 μg/ml; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 6 h prior to analysis by phase contrast microscopy. Cells were collected and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% SDS). Lysates were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. After extraction with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and reextraction with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, the DNA was precipitated by addition of 1 volume of isopropanol at −70 °C overnight. Precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min, washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.0), and treated with RNase (DNase free, 20 μg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim). DNA samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.6% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Band intensities of DNA fragments (size ranging between 200 and 600 base pairs) were quantified using the National Institutes of Health Image 1.55b program. NIH3T3 cell lines were co-transfected with the NFκB-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid (4xκB-CAT; provided by Dr. Gary Nabel, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, MI; 25) and a Rous sarcoma virus promoter-driven luciferase construct (to measure transfection efficiency) by the DEAE-dextran method (26Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At 48 h posttransfection, cells were treated either with poly(I)·poly(C) (100 μg/ml; Pharmacia) or TNFα (10 ng/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 h at 37 °C. Cell extracts were harvested by freeze-thawing, and CAT and luciferase activities were measured essentially as described in the Promega Protocol and Applications Guide (Madison, WI). COS-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding either wild-type PKR, K296P mutant PKR, the dsRNA binding domain of PKR (amino acid residues 1–243), wild-type eIF-2α, S51A eIF-2α, or S51D eIF-2α contained in the pMT2VA− expression vector (27Kaufman R.J.

Korsmeyer (Howard Huges Medical Institute, St. Louis, MO). Transfections were performed in the presence of an equal amount of DNA encoding the jellyfish green fluorescence protein (GFP) (expression vector psynGFPS65T (29Haas J. Park E.-C. Seed B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 315-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar)) to identify transfected cells. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, mounted on slides, and visualized using an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope. Cells were incubated for the indicated times in the presence or absence of TNFα or in the presence of 10% FBS or 0.1% FBS. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and fixed in 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Cells were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with RNase (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) for 30 min. DNA content was analyzed using a FACStar Flow Cytometer (Immunocytometry System, Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Cells were analyzed for scatter-gated fluorescence to prevent scoring of dead cells and debris. Green fluorescence was measured using a 530/30-nm bandpass filter, and red fluorescence was measured using a 625/35-nm bandpass filter. eIF-2α phosphorylation was measured by [32P]phosphate incorporation as described (23Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or by Western blot analysis. Steady state levels of eIF-2α and phosphorylated eIF-2α were measured in cell extracts by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and electroblotting to nitrocellulose. Filters were sequentially incubated and developed with rabbit anti-phosphopeptide antibody specific to phosphorylated eIF-2α (kindly provided by Gary Krause, Wayne State University) and then with anti-eIF-2α monoclonal antibody (provided by Dr. Henshaw). After incubation with antibody, the filters were washed and developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIAzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA samples (10 μg) were analyzed by RNA Northern blot hybridization following electrophoresis on formaldehyde-formamide 1% agarose gels (30Thomas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar, 31Derman E. Krauter K. Walling L. Weinberger C. Tay M. Darnell Jr., J.R. Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and baked at 80 °C under vacuum. The blots were prehybridized, hybridized to either 32P-labeled c-fos or 32P-labeled c-jun cDNA (provided by Dr. Tom Kerpolla, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, MI) probes prepared by [α-32P]dCTP labeling using the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Corp.) and washed two times with 0.1× SSC (1× = 150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate) for 15 min. As a control for loading equal amounts of RNA, the blots were treated with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 95 °C and rehybridized to a 32P-labeled β-actin probe. Band intensities were quantified using the National Institutes of Health Image 1.55b program. Total RNA (150 ng) was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) primer and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction volume essentially as described by the supplier. PCR was performed using 2 μl from each cDNA reaction with primer sets for detecting Fas mRNA (5′-CATCTCCGAGAGTTTAAAGCTGAGG and 5′-GTTTCCTGCAGTTTGTATTGCTGGTTCC) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC). Control experiments demonstrated that the PCR was performed in the linear range to detect Fas and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNAs. The requirement for a functional PKR pathway in apoptosis was studied in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with empty vector alone or in NIH3T3 cells expressing mutant K296P PKR. The expression of K296P mutant PKR in these cells was previously characterized (23Srivastava S.P. Davies M.V. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16619-16624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TNFα- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis were studied by TNFα treatment or growth in 0.1% FBS. Both of these conditions induced characteristic ladders of DNA fragments in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with empty vector alone that were not observed in a cells that overexpress mutant PKR (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained with three additional independently isolated clones expressing K296P PKR (data not shown), implying a requirement for a functional PKR pathway in both of these apoptotic responses. The resistance to TNFα- or serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in mutant PKR-expressing cells was further confirmed by quantitating the percentage of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector alone contained a range of 2–4 n DNA representing cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Following TNFα treatment or serum deprivation, the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle decreased in parallel to the appearance of a peak of cells containing hypodiploid DNA (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, cells that express mutant PKR showed a reduced number of cells containing hypodiploid DNA following TNFα (6%) or serum deprivation (8%). These results support the involvement of PKR in TNFα- and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Recently, dsRNA (poly(I)·poly(C)) was shown to induce apoptosis in a PKR-dependent manner using mouse embryo fibroblasts from PKR wild-type and PKR knockout mice (32Der S.D. Yang Y.-Y. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the requirement for PKR in apoptosis mediated by interferon and poly(I)·poly(C) treatment in NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with empty vector or NIH3T3 cells transfected with K296P mutant PKR were treated with interferon, poly(I)·poly(C), or poly(I)·poly(C) in combination with interferon. Under these experimental conditions, interferon or poly(I)·poly(C) alone did not induce significant morphological changes in either cell line (Fig.2). However, poly(I)·poly(C) in combination with interferon induced significant cell death in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with empty vector, whereas NIH3T3 cells that were overexpressing mutant PKR were protected under identical conditions. It is most likely that poly(I)·poly(C) alone did not affect NIH3T3 cells due to their low levels of PKR. These results are in agreement with previous observations (32Der S.D. Yang Y.-Y. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 33Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and support the idea that dsRNA is toxic to NIH3T3 cells that have a functional PKR pathway. Whether PKR function was abrogated in the cells expressing the trans-dominant negative mutant PKR was tested by analyzing the dsRNA-dependent activation of NFκB because previous studies support the idea that PKR is required in this signaling (16Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 34Kumar A. Yang Y.-L. Flati V. Der S. Dakereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Control and mutant PKR-expressing NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with an NFκB-specific CAT reporter plasmid (25Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1529-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In control cells, CAT activity was induced 5-fold in an NFκB-dependent manner in response to poly(I)·poly(C). Mutation of the NFκB binding sites within the vector prevented the induction (Fig. 3). Cells expressing thetrans-dominant negative mutant PKR did not respond to poly(I)·poly(C), and in addition, the basal transcription of the NFκB-dependent promoter in these cells was reduced compared with control NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3). In this experiment, the transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with a luciferase expression vector. The amount of luciferase activity varied less than 10% between different plates of transfected cells. The defective dsRNA response was specific, because both control and thetrans-dominant negative mutant PKR-expressing cells responded to TNFα as indicated by induction of NFκB-dependent CAT activity by 29- and 27-fold, respectively (Fig. 3). The greater response of these cells to TNFα compared with poly(I)·poly(C) may reflect the inefficient delivery of poly(I)·poly(C) to the cells or differences in the general responsiveness of these two different signal transduction pathways. These results are consistent with a specific abrogation of PKR signaling by expression of mutant K296P PKR. Results of recent studies suggest that PKR-mediated Fas mRNA induction may be one mechanism for PKR-mediated cell death in response to a variety of stresses (32Der S.D. Yang Y.-Y. Weissmann C.

Esteban M Virology. 1997; 231: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We therefore measured Fas mRNA levels in response to TNFα, poly(I)·poly(C), and interferon with poly(I)·poly(C) using reverse transcription-PCR with Fas mRNA-specific primers. After treatment with any of these agents, an increase in Fas mRNA level either in NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector or cells transfected with mutant PKR was not detected (data not shown). The results demonstrated that apoptosis in response to either TNFα or dsRNA with interferon is not secondary to an induction of Fas mRNA. Previous studies suggested that induction of the early response genes requires a functional PKR pathway (15Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, 2-aminopurine, an adenosine analog that is known to inhibit PKR, was shown to inhibit serum induction of early response genes (15Zinn K. Keller A. Whittemore L.-A. Maniatis T. Science. 1988; 240: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether the early response gene transcriptional induction is mediated through PKR, we studied induction of c-fos and c-jun in response to serum or PDGF addition to growth-arrested, serum-depleted control NIH3T3 cells or NIH3T3 cells expressing K296P mutant PKR. Analysis of total RNA by Northern blot hybridization demonstrated that c-fos and c-jun mRNAs were induced in response to the addition of either serum or PDGF to serum-starved control NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4, comparelanes 1, 3, and 5), as well as in serum-starved NIH3T3 cells expressing K296P mutant PKR (Fig. 4, lanes 7, 9, and 11). Importantly, addition of 2-aminopurine inhibited c-fos and c-jun induction by serum and PDGF in both control (Fig. 4, lanes 2, 4, and 6) and mutant PKR-expressing cells (Fig. 4, lanes 8, 10, and12). These results indicate that a functional PKR pathway is not required for the immediate early response and that 2-aminopurine inhibition of the immediate early response is likely a consequence of inhibiting a PKR-independent pathway. The observation that PKR is not required for the immediate early response is in contrast to the findings of Mundschau and Faller (36Mundschau L.J. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), who used antisense oligonucleotides to suppress PKR levels in BALB/c 3T3 cells to show a defect in the serum/PDGF-mediated transcriptional induction of c-fos and c-myc. Further studies are required to determine whether the observed differences in the apparent requirement for PKR in the immediate early response are due to the different cell culture systems or due to the different methods utilized to inhibit the PKR pathway. Our results, showing that c-fos and c-jun transcriptional induction were not inhibited by mutant PKR expression, demonstrate that apoptotic response and not the serum growth response requires a functional PKR pathway. This also indicates that protection from apoptosis in these mutant PKR-expressing cells is specific and not due to general dysfunction of signal transduction pathway(s). To elucidate whether TNFα-induced apoptosis is mediated through phosphorylation of eIF-2α by PKR, in vivo analysis of eIF-2α phosphorylation was performed in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress wild-type eIF-2α or S51A mutant eIF-2α, the site of PKR phosphorylation (27Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The expression of wild-type and S51A mutant eIF-2α in these NIH3T3 cells was previously characterized (24Ramaiah K.V.A. Davies M.V. Chen J.-J. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4546-4553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of eIF-2α from [32P]phosphate-labeled NIH3T3 cells that overexpress wild-type eIF-2α detected [32P]phosphate incorporation into eIF-2α (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). Treatment with TNFα increased the [32P]phosphate incorporation into wild-type eIF-2α by 2.5 fold (Fig. 5 A, lane 3). In contrast, cells that express the S51A mutant eIF-2α did not exhibit increased [32P]phosphate incorporation in response to TNFα (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and 5). Cells treated with TNFα showed increased background labeling, as is evident by the use of an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6 and7). The increase in eIF-2α phosphorylation upon TNFα treatment was also demonstrated by Western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated eIF-2αP (Fig.5 B). Previous detailed characterization of the anti-eIF-2α antibody demonstrated that it specifically reacts with phosphorylated eIF-2α and not with nonphosphorylated eIF-2α (37DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas TNFα treatment increased the relative amount of phosphorylated eIF-2α by approximately 2-fold in cells expressing wild-type eIF-2α, there was no increase in cells expressing the S51A mutant eIF-2α. These results support the idea that TNFα induces eIF-2α phosphorylation. The requirement for eIF-2α phosphorylation for TNFα-induced apoptosis was analyzed by TNFα treatment of NIH3T3 cells expressing either wild-type or S51A mutant eIF-2α. Flow cytometry analysis of DNA content (Fig. 6 A), as well as the DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig. 6 B), demonstrated that expression of the phosphorylation-resistant S51A mutant eIF-2α partially protected cells from apoptosis upon TNFα treatment. We expect that the incomplete protection may be due to the presence of endogenous wild-type eIF-2α, which may become phosphorylated and act in a do"

We report an interaction between integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domain and Rack1, a Trp-Asp (WD) repeat protein that has been shown to bind activated protein kinase C. The Rack1-binding site on integrin β2subunit resides within a conserved, membrane-proximal region. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, WD repeats five to seven of Rack1 (Rack1-WD5/7) interact with integrin β1, β2, and β5 cytoplasmic domain. In eukaryotic cells, Rack1 co-immunoprecipitates with at least two different β integrins, β1 integrins in 293T cells and β2 integrins in JY lymphoblastoid cells. Whereas Rack1-WD5/7 binds integrins constitutively, the association of full-length Rack1 to integrinsin vivo requires a treatment with phorbol esters, which promotes cell spreading and adhesion. These findings suggest that Rack1 may link protein kinase C directly to integrins and participate in the regulation of integrin functions.

Integrins are αβ heterodimeric adhesion receptors that mediate attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and specific cell counter-receptors (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Various extracellular stimuli have been shown to affect the adhesiveness of integrins and regulate attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar). This process known as an activation-dependent cell adhesion is best illustrated in leukocytes where the attachment of integrin LFA1 1The abbreviations used are: LFA1, leukocyte function antigen-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PKC, protein kinase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; mAb, monoclonal antibody(ies); GST-Rack1, GST-tagged Rack1; WD, Trp-Asp.(αLβ2) to intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) substrates can be promoted by cross-linking T cell receptors or stimulating cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (3Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Upon binding to the extracellular matrix, integrins induce signals required for the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and the formation of focal adhesion complexes (4Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 5Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 6Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). The adhesion-dependent clustering of integrins leads to the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the stimulation of inositol lipid metabolism, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and pH, and the activation of PKC (4Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 7Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Each subunit of integrins consists of a large extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain that lacks any enzymatic activity. Although the cytoplasmic domains of α subunits are variable in size and sequence, the cytoplasmic domains of β subunits are more conserved in size and sequence. In particular, three conserved regions, termed cyto-1, cyto-2, and cyto-3, found in β integrin cytoplasmic domains have been implicated in the recruitment of integrins to the focal adhesion plaques and the regulation of adhesive functions of integrins (9Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 10O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although both integrin subunits are required for the ligand binding, the interaction between intracellular proteins and integrin cytoplasmic domain can occur in the absence of subunit association. Studies have shown that chimeric molecules composed of the β integrin cytoplasmic domains and the extracellular domain of the interleukin-2 receptor can be directed to the focal adhesion plaques and activate focal adhesion kinase in the absence of ligand binding (12LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been hypothesized that the integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domain provides binding sites for proteins involved in the regulation of integrin functions. Proteins that have been shown to directly interact with β subunit cytoplasmic domains include known cytoskeletal proteins α-actinin (13Otey C.A. Vasquez G.B. Burridge K. Erickson B.W. J. Biol.

In this study, we report a direct association of receptor for activated protein kinase C (Rack1) to the integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domain. Rack1 consists of seven repeating units of WD motifs presumed to be involved in a protein-protein interaction (2Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar, 21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Deletion studies indicate that the C-terminal three WD motifs (WD-5, WD-6, and WD-7) of Rack1 interact with the conserved membrane-proximal region of β subunit cytoplasmic domain. Interestingly, interaction of Rack1 with integrins in vivo requires a treatment with PMA, which promotes cell spreading and integrin-dependent cell adhesion (3Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

Our finding suggests a direct linkage between integrins and PKC through Rack1 and further implicates PKC in integrin-mediated cell signaling. The anti-β1integrin antibody producing hybridoma cell line, TS2/16, was generously provided by Dr. M. Hemler (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The mouse hybridoma cell line TS1/18 producing anti-β2integrin antibody was obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The mAb TS2/16 and TS1/18 recognize the extracellular domains of β1 and β2 integrins, respectively. Anti-Rack1 antibody was purchased from Transduction Labs. The anti-αL antibody, directed against the integrin αL cytoplasmic domain, was described previously (20Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 293T cells, a derivative of human kidney embryonal fibroblast containing SV40 T antigen, were obtained from Dr. K. Shuai (University of California at Los Angeles) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker). JY cells, an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoid cell line, were obtained from Dr. T. Springer (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and cultured in RPMI + 10% fetal calf serum. The yeast genetic screening for the isolation of proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of β2 integrin was carried out essentially as described previously (20Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 46 amino acids (724–769) of the β2 integrin were cloned in frame into LexA coding sequence to generate a “bait” plasmid, pNlex-β2cyto. pNlex-β2cyto and a JY cDNA library in the pJG45 yeast expression vector (23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) were introduced into a yeast strain containing a chromosomal copy of the Leu2 gene (EGY48 (Matα trp1 ura3–52 leu2::pLeu2-lexAop6(ΔUAS leu2)) and an episomal β-galactosidase gene (as a JK103 plasmid) under the control of a synthetic promoter with LexA-binding sites (23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were selected for the formation of blue colonies on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside indicator plates with leucine. The interacting cDNA clones were rescued from the selected yeast transformants as described previously (23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Rack1-ΔBH1 was constructed by cloning the C-terminal BamHI fragment of Rack1 (amino acids 204–317) into the pJG45 vector (23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The β1 and β5 integrin cytoplasmic domain and the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pNLex vector. All constructs used in this study were verified by direct DNA sequence analysis. For in vitro GST interaction assays, the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 724–769), a truncation mutant β2(E16) (amino acids 750–769), and the αL integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain were individually expressed as GST fusion proteins using the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 911-919Google Scholar). Rack1-WD5/7 was synthesized in vitro using a co-transcription/translation system (Promega) and added to approximately 2 μg of GST fusion proteins and incubated overnight at 4 °C in NET (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mmNaCl, 3 mm EDTA) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). The beads were washed twice in the binding buffer and twice in 0.05% Triton X-100 in NET. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The filter membrane was probed with an anti-Rack1 antibody (0.06 μg/ml) and then developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Corp.). A full-length Rack1 cDNA was obtained from a JY cDNA library using a polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pEBG (20Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into 293T cells by using a calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 911-919Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in TBSM (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. When indicated, the cells were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml, stock solution 1 mg/ml in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to lysis. Detergent insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. 500 μg of the cleared lysates were mixed with an equal volume of TBSM and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed with TBSM + 0.25% Nonidet P-40 once and TBSM alone three times. Co-precipitation of β1 integrins with the bound GST-Rack1 was analyzed by immunoblotting with the mAb TS2/16 (anti-β1 integrin). Immunoprecipitation of β1 integrins was carried out by incubating the lysates with 4 μg/ml of the mAb TS2/16 for 3 h at 4 °C, in the presence of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). JY cell lysates were prepared as above, and LFA1 was immunoprecipitated using the mAb TS 1/18 (anti-β2 integrin). Co-immunoprecipitation of Rack1 with the integrins was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Rack1 antibody. The yeast two-hybrid assays were used to identify cellular proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β2integrin. A bait construct, pNLex-β2cyto, which contains the entire cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 724–769) of β2 subunit was introduced into EGY48, a yeast strain harboring Leu2 and β-galactosidase genes under the control of a synthetic promoter with LexA-binding sites (23Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was used as a host for transformation with a human B cell (JY cells) cDNA library in the pJG45 yeast expression vector. From ∼8 × 105 primary transformants, four overlapping cDNAs were found to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of β2integrin but not with the control baits containing unrelated sequences (data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that all four clones encode overlapping regions of the C-terminal portion of the heterotrimeric Gβ superfamily protein, Rack1. Rack1 is composed of 7 repeating units of WD motif (21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Like Gβ proteins, Rack1 is expected to form a β-propeller structure, where each WD repeat composed of four anti-parallel β strands make up a blade of the propeller (25Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 26Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The four overlapping Rack1 cDNA clones isolated in yeast two-hybrid screening all contained WD-5 through WD-7, suggesting these three C-terminal WD repeats are sufficient for the binding to the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain (Fig.1). A deletion of 22 additional amino acids corresponding to the N-terminal portion of WD-5 (Rack1-ΔBH1) completely abolished the interaction. Therefore, we conclude that WD-5 is necessary for the integrin binding. The 22 amino acids deleted in Rack1-ΔBH1 includes the fourth β strand and the loop that are located on the solvent exposed outer surface of the β-propeller (21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar,26Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Interestingly none of the isolated Rack1 clones contained the WD motifs N-terminal to WD-4. The full-length Rack1 failed to interact with the baits containing the β integrin cytoplasmic domains in yeast, raising a possibility that the interaction between the full-length Rack1 and the β integrins may be regulated. In a converse set of experiments we delineated the Rack1-binding site on the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain by testing the interaction between Rack1-WD5/7 (amino acids 182–317) and various β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain mutants (Fig.2). A C-terminal deletion of the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain up to amino acid 744 (β2Δ744), which removes the major phosphorylation sites at Ser756 and three adjacent threonines at 758–760, did not affect the binding of Rack1-WD5/7. However, a small deletion of 4 amino acids in the membrane-proximal portion of β2integrin cytoplasmic domain (β2B) or a replacement of the corresponding KALI to KEEE (β2ALI/EEE) completely abolished the interaction, suggesting the Rack1-binding site resides within a 20-amino acid region (amino acids 724–743) of the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain. The membrane-proximal region of the β integrin cytoplasmic domains is highly conserved, and not surprisingly, Rack1-WD5/7 was able to interact with two other integrins, β1 and β5. To confirm the interaction between integrin β subunit and Rack1 observed in yeast, Rack1-WD5/7 was synthesized in vitro and incubated with GST fusion proteins containing the β integrin cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 3). Rack1-WD5/7 associated with a GST fusion protein encoding the complete cytoplasmic domain of integrin β2 (GST-β2A, amino acids 724–769, Fig. 3, lane 2) but not with GST fusion proteins encoding truncated forms of integrin β2cytoplasmic domain (GST-β2B, amino acids 728–769, and GST-β2(E16), amino acids 750–769, Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3) or a GST fusion protein encoding the cytoplasmic domain of integrin αL (Fig. 3, lane 4). The results of in vitro binding assays were identical to the findings in the yeast two-hybrid interaction studies. To demonstrate the interaction of Rack1 and integrinsin vivo, Rack1-WD5/7 or a full-length Rack1 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in 293T cells. The transfected cells were lysed in a buffer containing nonionic detergent and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads to purify GST-Rack fusion proteins. The binding of β1 integrins to the GST-Rack fusion proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the mAb TS2/16 (anti-β1). The β1 integrins were co-precipitated with GST-Rack1-WD5/7 (Fig.4 A, lane 2) but not with GST alone used as the controls (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Expression of equivalent amounts of the GST fusion proteins in 293T cells was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody (Fig.4 A, bottom panel). In two-hybrid screening, only partial Rack1 clones, none of which contained the WD motifs N-terminal to the WD-4, were isolated. We subsequently confirmed that the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain does not interact with the full-length Rack-1 in yeast (see Fig.1). These results indicate that the presence of Rack1 WD-1 to WD-3 may interfere with the integrin binding. In view of the previous report that Rack1 binds PKC only in the presence of Ca2+ and lipid to activate PKC (21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the binding of full-length Rack1 to integrins in vivo is conditional and may require activation of PKC. As in yeast, we failed to detect association of integrins with the transfected GST-Rack1 in 293T cells (Fig.4 A, lane 4). However, upon stimulation with PMA, a complex formation between the β1 integrins and GST-Rack1 became readily detectable (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). In a converse set of experiments, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3/Rack1, and the complex formation between Rack1 and β1 integrins was tested by immunoprecipitation with the mAb TS2/16 (anti-β1) followed by a Western analysis using anti-Rack1 antibody (Fig. 4 B). As suggested in GST interaction assays, Rack1 and β1 integrins formed a complex following a PMA treatment (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). In the unstimulated state, there was no detectable association between the two (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). The amount of background Rack1 precipitated by control antibodies did not change significantly upon PMA stimulation (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3 and 4). Furthermore, focal adhesion kinase or Paxillin, two proteins known to co-localize with integrins to the focal adhesion plaques, were not detected in the immune complex formed by anti-β1 antibody (data not shown). To demonstrate that Rack1 can associate with different β subunits, as suggested in the yeast two-hybrid assay, we conducted the immune complex analysis in JY cells that expresses LFA1 (αLβ2). The association of Rack1 with LFA1 can be clearly seen only after PMA treatment (Fig.5, lane 1 and 2). Immunoprecipitation of equivalent amounts of LFA1 was confirmed by re-probing the blot with anti-αL antibody (Fig. 5,bottom panel). These results clearly demonstrate a specific association of Rack1 with different β integrins in response to a stimulus that is known to enhance integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Integrins have been proposed as crucial transmembrane proteins linking cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Numerous studies have demonstrated that integrin-dependent cell adhesion is regulated in response to extracellular stimuli. In platelets, agonist stimulation induces conformational changes in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, leading to an affinity state (7Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). A similar affinity modulation has not been clearly demonstrated for other integrins. Nonetheless, integrin-dependent cell adhesion of many cell types is enhanced when cell spreading is augmented by a PMA treatment (3Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar, 22Stewart M.P. Cabanas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 30Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Both of these responses require integrin cytoplasmic domains, suggesting that the interaction between integrins and cellular proteins plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion. To gain insights into cell adhesion regulation, we sought to identify cellular proteins that directly associate with integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domains. In the present study, we report isolation of Rack1 as an integrin-binding protein. Our evidence for the interaction of Rack1 with integrins is based on (i) the interaction of the two proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay, (ii) the binding ofin vitro translated C-terminal portion of Rack1 to bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain, and (iii) the detection of a complex between Rack1 and integrins in vivo. Rack1 is a member of Gβ superfamily, composed exclusively of seven WD repeats forming an overall β propeller structure (27Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). WD repeats represent structural motifs formed by four anti-parallel β strands and have been implicated in protein-protein interaction (25Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of Rack1 is not known, Rack1 binds to PKC in the presence of Ca2+ and lipid in vitro and has been proposed as an intracellular receptor for activated protein kinase C responsible for subcellular localization of PKC (21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Overlapping cDNA isolates from initial yeast screening indicated that the WD repeats 5–7 are sufficient for its interaction with β integrins. Rack1-ΔBH1, lacking a part of WD repeat 5, failed to bind β2 integrin. The region deleted in Rack1-ΔBH1 corresponds to the outer exposed surface of the β propeller that would be available to make contacts with other proteins. The region of the integrin β2 cytoplasmic domain responsible for the Rack1 binding lies within the membrane-proximal 20-amino acid region (residues 724–743). This region is conserved among different β subunits, and not surprisingly, Rack1 interacts with at least two other β subunits, β1 and β5. The presence of three apolar residues immediately following a Lys residue at the membrane-cytoplasm interface appears to be critical for the Rack1 binding. Either a 4-amino acid deletion in this region or a substitution of KALI to KEEE prevented the Rack1 interaction. Several functions, including localization of β1 integrins to the focal adhesion plaques (9Reszka A.A. Hayashi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and affinity regulation of β3 integrins (28Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Bio. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), have been assigned to the membrane-proximal region. It will be of interest to determine whether these known integrin functions require Rack1. The most intriguing finding of our study is that the association between Rack1 and integrins in vivo is inducible and requires a PMA treatment. Integrin β subunits are known to undergo phosphorylation on serines and threonines upon PMA treatment (29Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We, however, do not favor the possibility that the phosphorylation of β cytoplasmic domain is responsible for the recruitment of Rack1 because Rack1-WD5/7 binds integrins constitutively both in vitro andin vivo, and the deletion of major phosphorylation sites on β cytoplasmic domain does not affect this interaction. Based on a previously reported function of Rack1 as a cytoplasmic receptor of activated PKC (21Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that upon a PMA treatment, activated PKC binds and phosphorylates Rack1, allowing subsequent recruitment of Rack1 to the integrin cytoplasmic domain. Cell stimulation with PMA or receptor activation frequently increases integrin avidity and promotes cell spreading (22Stewart M.P. Cabanas C. Hogg N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1810-1817PubMed Google Scholar, 30Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1307-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of integrin-Rack1 association remains to be seen. In addition to Rack1, two other proteins, α-actinin (31Pavalko F.M. LaRoche S.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3795-3807PubMed Google Scholar) and calreticulin (32Coppolino M. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Dedhar S. Wilkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), have been shown to bind integrin cytoplasmic domain in an inducible manner. α-Actinin through linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton may function to modulate integrin avidity. Calreticulin, unlike Rack1 or α-actinin, which bind to β subunit cytoplasmic domains, interacts with α subunits through a high conserved short KXGFFKR motif (33Rojiani M. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The precise function of calreticulin remains to be seen. However, functional knock-out of calreticulin by introducing anti-calreticulin antibody into cells or gene disruption interferes with integrin-dependent cell adhesion (32Coppolino M. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Dedhar S. Wilkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Coppolino G.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple putative protein-protein interaction WD domains may allow Rack1 to function as a scaffold protein to recruit PKC and/or other proteins to the membrane at the site of membrane-cytoskeletal junction by its ability to bind integrin cytoplasmic domain. Rack1 may therefore be an integral player in this membrane-cytoskeletal association and participate in regulation of cell adhesion. We are grateful to R.

https://openalex.org/W2160253297,"Antidepressant-sensitive serotonin (5-hydroxytrypta-mine, 5HT) transporters (SERTs) are responsible for efficient synaptic clearance of extracellular 5HT. Previously (Qian, Y., Galli, A., Ramamoorthy, S., Risso, S., DeFelice, L. J., and Blakely, R. D. (1997) <i>J.

In the present study, we report that PKC activators rapidly, and in a concentration-dependent manner, elevate the basal level of hSERT phosphorylation 5–6-fold. Similarly, protein phosphatase (PP1/PP2A) inhibitors down-regulate 5HT transport and significantly elevate hSERT <sup>32</sup>P incorporation, effects that are additive with those of PKC activators. Moreover, hSERT phosphorylation induced by β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is abolished selectively by the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide I, whereas hSERT phosphorylation induced by phosphatase inhibitors is insensitive to these agents at comparable concentrations. Protein kinase A and protein kinase G activators fail to acutely down-regulate 5HT uptake but significantly enhance hSERT phosphorylation. Basal hSERT and okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation were insensitive to chelation of intracellular calcium and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitors. Together these results reveal hSERT to be a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation state is likely to be tightly controlled by multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways that may also influence the transporter's regulated trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2141894346,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) putative core protein has displayed many intriguing biological properties. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays an important role in controlling viral infection, in this study the effect of the core protein was investigated on the TNF-alpha induced apoptosis of human breast carcinoma cells (MCF7). HCV core protein when expressed inhibited TNF-alpha-induced apoptotic cell death unlike the control MCF7 cells, as determined by cell viability and DNA fragmentation analysis. Additionally, HCV core protein blocked the TNF-induced proteolytic cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from its native 116-kDa protein to the characteristic 85-kDa polypeptide. Results from this study suggest that the HCV core protein plays a role in the inhibition of TNF-alpha-mediated cell death. Thus, the ability of core protein to inhibit the TNF-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway may provide a selective advantage for HCV replication, allowing for evasion of host antiviral defense mechanisms."

Treatment with the dihydroxy bile acids chenodeoxycholate and deoxycholate resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in the production of prostaglandin E2(PGE2). Enhanced synthesis of PGE2 was associated with a marked increase in the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein, with maximal effects at 8–12 and 12–24 h, respectively.

Nuclear run-off assays and transient transfections with a human COX-2promoter construct showed that induction of COX-2 mRNA by chenodeoxycholate and deoxycholate was due to increased transcription. Bile acid-mediated induction of COX-2 was blocked by inhibitors of PKC activity, including calphostin C and staurosporine.

In contrast, the gene forCOX-2 is an early-response gene that, like c-fosand c-jun, is induced rapidly following stimulation of quiescent cells. The expression of COX-2 is stimulated by growth factors, cytokines, oncogenes, phorbol esters, and carcinogens and by overexpression of PKC (2Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W.

The different responses of the genes forCOX-1 and COX-2 reflect, in part, differences in the regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking regions of the two genes (10Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). A large body of data from a variety of experimental systems suggest that COX-2 is important for tumor formation. Oshima et al.(11Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar) have reported, for example, that a null mutation of COX-2 is associated with a marked reduction in the number and size of intestinal polyps in ApcΔ716 (adenomatouspolyposis coli) knockout mice, which are a model for human familial adenomatous polyposis. Treatment with a selective inhibitor of COX-2 also reduced the number of polyps in ApcΔ716 mice (11Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). COX-2 deficiency also appears to protect against the formation of tumors in other epithelia becauseCOX-2 knockout mice develop fewer chemically induced skin papillomas than control mice (12Tiano H. Chulada P. Spalding J. Lee C. Loftin C. Mahler J. Morham S. Langenbach R. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 1727Google Scholar). Although the exact causal link(s) between the activity of COX-2 and carcinogenesis remain uncertain, there are several different mechanisms that can account for this linkage (13Prescott S.M. White R.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 783-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Prostaglandins, e.g. PGE2, affect cell proliferation and inhibit immune surveillance; thus, overproduction of prostaglandins could favor malignant growth (14Goodwin J.S. Ceuppens J. J. Clin. Immunol. 1983; 3: 295-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Overexpression of COX-2 inhibits apoptosis and increases the invasiveness of malignant cells (15Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar, 16Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gut. 1987; 28: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Given these data, a reasonable strategy for inhibiting carcinogenesis is to suppress the expression of COX-2 (22Mestre J.R.

Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2890-2895PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore becomes important to identify the factors that modulate the expression of COX-2. In this regard, bile acids are known promoters of gastrointestinal cancer in vivo and enhance cell transformation in vitro (24Reddy B.S. Wynder E.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 50: 1437-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 25Narisawa T. Magdie N.E. Weisburger J.H. Wynder E.L. J. Natl.

The precise mechanism(s) by which bile acids promote tumor formation is not known. But like tumor-promoting phorbol esters (29Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar), bile acids activate PKC (30Fitzer C.J. O'Brian C.A. Guillem J.G. Weinstein I.B.

Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1996; 17: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The latter effect may be especially important because inhibitors of AP-1-mediated transcription have anti-cancer properties (34Huang C. Ma W.-Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To further examine the mechanism by which bile acids promote tumor formation, we have examined their effects as inducers of COX-2. The rationale for this approach to defining the bile acid-cancer connection is that phorbol esters are prototypic inducers of COX-2 (2Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J.

Cellular cytotoxicity was assessed by measurements of cell number, release of lactate dehydrogenase, trypan blue exclusion, and MTT assay. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase release were measured in the supernatants used for PGE2 analyses. MTT assay was performed according to the method of Denizot and Lang (36Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4322) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For trypan blue analysis, following treatment with bile acid for 12 h, cells were combined 1:1 with 0.4% trypan blue and examined for dye exclusion. Cells (1 × 104/well) were plated in 24-well dishes and grown to 60% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 1% FCS and vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or bile acids (400 μm) for 12 h. At the end of the treatment period, the culture medium was collected to determine the amounts of PGE2 secreted spontaneously by these cells. Fresh DMEM containing 1% FCS and 10 μm sodium arachidonate was then added. After 30 min, the medium was collected for analysis of PGE2. The levels of PGE2 released by the cells were measured by enzyme immunoassay (7Subbaramaiah K. Telang N. Ramonetti J.T. Araki R. DeVito B. Weksler B.B. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4424-4429PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of production of PGE2 were normalized to protein concentrations. Lysates for the detection of COX-2 and COX-1 were prepared by treating cells with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Tween 20, 50 mm diethyl dithiocarbamate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates for the detection of the phosphorylated form of c-Jun were prepared by treating cells in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were sonicated for 20 s on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to sediment the particulate material. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets as detailed by Towbinet al. (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 antiserum, polyclonal anti-COX-1 antiserum, or a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated c-Jun. The blots were probed with the corresponding secondary antibodies to IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were probed with the ECL Western blot detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell monolayers using an RNA isolation kit from QIAGEN Inc. 10 μg of total cellular RNA/lane was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon-supported membranes. After baking, membranes were prehybridized overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer (SSPE), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA and were then hybridized for 12 h at 42 °C with a radiolabeled human COX-2 cDNA probe. After hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 20 min in 2 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS at room temperature, twice for 20 min in the same solution at 55 °C, and twice for 20 min in 0.1 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Washed membranes were then subjected to autoradiography. To verify equivalency of RNA loading in the different lanes, the blot was stripped of radioactivity and rehybridized to determine the levels of 18 S rRNA. COX-2 and 18 S rRNA probes were labeled with [32P]CTP by random priming. Cells (1 × 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes. Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS until ∼60% confluent. The medium was then replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1% FCS and vehicle (0.1% ethanol), CD (400 μm), or DC (400 μm) for 8 h. Nuclei were isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen. For the transcription assay, nuclei (1.0 × 107) were thawed and incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8), 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.3 m KCl) containing 100 μCi of uridine 5′-[α-32P]triphosphate and 1 mmunlabeled nucleotides. After 30 min, labeled nascent RNA transcripts were isolated. The human COX-2 and 18 S rRNA cDNAs were immobilized onto nitrocellulose and prehybridized overnight in hybridization buffer (10 mm TES, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 0.6 m NaCl). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C for 24 h using equal cpm/ml of labeled nascent RNA transcripts for each treatment group. The membranes were washed twice with 2 × SSC for 1 h at 55 °C and then treated with 10 mg/ml RNase A in 2 × SSC for 30 min at 37 °C, dried, and autoradiographed. The COX-2 promoter construct (−327/+59) was a gift of Dr. Tadashi Tanabe (National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Osaka, Japan) (10Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The humanCOX-2 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Stephen M. Prescott (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). pSV-βgal was obtained from Promega. SK-GT-4 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104/well in 6-well dishes and grown to 50–60% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FCS. For each well, 1.8 μg of COX-2-luciferase construct and 0.2 μg of pSV-βgal were cotransfected into SK-GT-4 cells at a 1:4 ratio of DNA to Lipofectin following the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FCS for 24 h. The cells were then treated with DMEM containing 1% FCS and vehicle (0.1% ethanol), CD (400 μm), or DC (400 μm). The activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase were measured in cellular extract 8 h later (22Mestre J.R. Subbaramaiah K. Sacks P.G. Schantz S.P. Tanabe T. Inoue H. Dannenberg A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1081-1085PubMed Google Scholar). To adjust for differences in transfection efficiencies, the luciferase values were normalized using β-galactosidase. SK-GT-4 cells were treated with DMEM containing 1% FCS and vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or CD for 2 or 6 h, respectively. Cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (40Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). For binding studies, an AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide was used: 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (sense) and 3′-GCGAACTACTCAGTCGGCCTT-5′ (antisense). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The annealed oligonucleotide was phosphorylated at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The binding reaction was performed by incubating 2 μg of nuclear protein in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 300 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in a final volume of 10 μl for 10 min at 25 °C. The labeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for an additional 20 min at 25 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Comparisons between groups were made by Student's t test. A difference between groups ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. Fig. 1 shows the effects of several bile acids and bile acid conjugates on the production of PGE2. CD and DC caused ∼3- and 10-fold increases in the spontaneous production of PGE2, respectively. Cholic acid and all conjugated bile acids, however, had no effect on rates of spontaneous synthesis of PGE2. To examine the synthesis of PGE2 in more detail, we also measured the effect of bile acids on the production of PGE2when an excess of arachidonic acid was added to the system. This experiment was done because PGE2 production can be affected by changes in the activity of phospholipase A2, which provides the substrate for COX-catalyzed reactions. Adding excess arachidonate minimizes any contribution of phospholipase A2activity to the rate of production of PGE2. As for rates of spontaneous synthesis of PGE2, treatment with CD or DC induced an ∼10-fold increase in the synthesis of PGE2 in the presence of excess arachidonate (Fig. 1). Neither cholic acid nor the conjugated bile acids affected the production of PGE2in the presence of excess arachidonic acid. Cytotoxicity in these experiments was assessed by cell number, lactate dehydrogenase release, MTT assay, and trypan blue exclusion. No evidence of cellular toxicity was detected (data not shown). Western blotting was carried out to determine whether the above differences in PGE2 production were related to differences in amounts of COX-2. We found that treatment with CD caused a dose-dependent induction of COX-2 protein with a peak effect at 400 μm CD (Fig.2). Moreover, CD and DC were the only bile acids that induced COX-2 protein (Fig.3), which is consistent with their effects on the production of PGE2 (Fig. 1). We also compared the time course for induction of COX-2 by CD versusPMA. Maximal induction of COX-2 protein occurred after 12–24 h of treatment with CD (Fig. 4). In contrast, COX-2 was induced maximally by PMA after 8–12 h of treatment (Fig. 4). COX-1 was not detectable in this cell line by Western blotting under basal or stimulated conditions (data not shown).Figure 3Dihydroxy bile acids induce COX-2.SK-GT-4 cells were treated for 12 h with vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or with 400 μm cholic acid (CA), taurocholate (TC), CD, glycochenodeoxycholate (GCD), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCD), DC, or taurodeoxycholate (TDC). Cellular lysate protein (30 μg) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with antibody specific for COX-2. Ovine Cox-2 was used as a standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4CD and PMA cause prolonged induction of COX-2. SK-GT-4 cells were treated for 4–36 h with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), CD (400 μm), or PMA (50 ng/ml). Cellular lysate protein (30 μg) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with antiserum specific for COX-2. Ovine Cox-2 was used as a standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further elucidate the mechanism responsible for the changes in amounts of COX-2 protein, we measured the steady-state levels of COX-2 mRNA by Northern blotting. CD and DC stimulated the formation of COX-2 mRNA; maximal induction of COX-2 mRNA was observed after treatment for ∼8 h (Fig. 5). Bile acid-mediated induction of COX-2 mRNA was still apparent after 24 h of treatment, which is consistent with the effects detected by Western blotting. Differences in the levels of mRNA could reflect altered rates of transcription or stability of mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays were performed to distinguish between these possibilities. As shown in Fig. 6, we detected higher rates of synthesis of nascent COX-2 mRNA after treatment with CD or DC, consistent with the differences observed by Northern blotting. To further investigate the importance of bile acids in modulating the expression of COX-2, transient transfections were performed with a human COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct. Treatment with CD or DC led to approximately a doubling of COX-2promoter activity (Fig. 7).Figure 7Bile acids increase COX-2promoter activity. SK-GT-4 cells were cotransfected with 1.8 μg of human COX-2 promoter construct (−327/+59) and 0.2 μg of pSV-βgal. After transfection, cells were treated with 400 μm CD or DC or with vehicle (0.1% ethanol). Reporter activities were measured in cellular extract 8 h later. Luciferase activity represents data that have been normalized with β-galactosidase activity. Six wells were used for each of the three conditions. The columns are the means, and thebars are the S.D. *, p < 0.001 compared with control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bile acids have been reported to activate PKC. Therefore, to elucidate the signaling mechanism by which bile acids activate the transcription ofCOX-2, we measured the induction of COX-2 by CD in the presence of known inhibitors of PKC. Staurosporine and calphostin C were used as inhibitors. Both agents blocked the induction of COX-2 by bile acids (Fig. 8, A andB). Dexamethasone also blocked the induction of COX-2 by CD and PMA (Fig. 8 C). Because activators of PKC modulate gene expression via AP-1, we determined the effects of CD on the phosphorylation state of c-Jun and AP-1 DNA-binding activity (Fig.9). Treatment with CD increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 9 A). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed increased binding of AP-1 to DNA following treatment with CD (Fig. 9 B).Figure 9CD enhances the phosphorylation of c-Jun and induces AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Cells were treated with CD (400 μm) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for 2 or 6 h. InA, cellular lysate protein (30 μg/lane) was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody directed toward the phosphorylated form of c-Jun. InB, 2 μg of nuclear protein was incubated with a32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing an AP-1 consensus site. The protein-DNA complex that formed was separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bile acids are known tumor promoters that activate PKC, which may be the mechanism of bile acid-induced carcinogenesis (31Guillem J.G.

Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1996; 17: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dihydroxy bile acids are more effective in activating PKC than mono- and trihydroxy bile acids (32Huang X.P. Fan X.T. Desjeux J.F. Castagna M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which bile acids change the activity of PKC is uncertain. However, bile acids increase the activity of PKC, in part, by inducing the translocation of selected isoforms from cytosol to membrane fractions (31Guillem J.G. O'Brian C.A. Fitzer C.J. Johnson M.D. Forde K.A. LoGerfo P. Weinstein I.B. Arch. Surg. 1987; 122: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is also known, in the context of the tumor-promoting effects of bile acids, that dihydroxy bile acids stimulate the release of PGE2 by colonic epithelium (41Rampton D.S. Breuer N.F. Vaja S.G. Sladen G.E. Dowling R.H. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1981; 61: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); but, as for the underlying specific carcinogenic events modulated by PKC, the basis for the up-regulation of PGE2 synthesis by bile acids remains uncertain.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1276-1280PubMed Google Scholar) provide evidence that COX-2, which is a PKC-dependent gene (9Miller B.W. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C130-C136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is important for the genesis of cancer. Hence, there is evidence to link the activity of PKC to carcinogenesis, in part, via the induction of COX-2 and overproduction of prostaglandins. This work adds to this evidence by showing that bile acids up-regulate the expression of COX-2. Moreover, we found that only CD and DC induced COX-2, which is consistent with the greater effect of these two bile acids on activation of PKC versus cholic acid or conjugated bile acids (32Huang X.P. Fan X.T. Desjeux J.F. Castagna M. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

Bile acid-mediated induction of COX-2 can be important for tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal tract because the products of COX-2 activity, e.g. prostaglandins, inhibit apoptosis, diminish immune surveillance, and increase the invasiveness of malignant cells (14Goodwin J.S. Ceuppens J. J. Clin. Immunol. 1983; 3: 295-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 15Tsujii M. DuBois R.N.

These conclusions are consistent with evidence that inhibitors of COX-2 are chemopreventive against cancers of the colon and upper gastrointestinal tract in experimental animals (45Rao C.V.

Krush A.J. Piantodosi S. Hylind L.M. Celano P. Booker S.V. Robinson R.C. Offerhaus G.J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar, 50Funkhouser E.M. Sharp G.B. Cancer (Phila.). 1995; 76: 1116-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). With regard to the mechanism by which bile acids induce COX-2, it is known that the human COX-2 promoter contains a cyclic AMP response element and sites for AP-2, NF-IL6 and NF-κB (10Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Xie and Herschman (51Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) showed that the AP-1 transcription factor complex is important for activation of the murine Cox-2 promoter via a cyclic AMP response element. This is consistent with other reports that AP-1 transcription factors can modulate transcription via a cyclic AMP response element (52Pedraza-Alva G. Zingg J.-M. Jost J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current data show too that bile acids increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an event known to be downstream from activation of the PKC signaling pathway (53Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). This is important because enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun could potentiate its ability to activate transcription of COX-2. Suppression of bile acid-mediated induction of COX-2 by dexamethasone is consistent with prior reports that AP-1 activity can be regulated negatively by glucocorticoids (29Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). AP-1 sites are only one of several cis-elements that mediate the effects of PKC. Other PKC-responsive cis-elements include the AP-2 recognition site (54Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar) and the NF-κB-binding site (55Lenardo M. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the exact mechanism, however, the results reported above suggest that inhibitors of PKC could be useful for down-regulating COX-2 and thereby preventing and/or treating cancer. Although relatively high concentrations of bile acids were required to induce COX-2, similar concentrations of bile acids are found in bile (56Matoba N. Une M. Hoshita T. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the aqueous phase of the fecal stream (57McJunkin B. Fromm H. Sarva R.P. Amin P. Gastroenterology. 1981; 80: 1454-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It will therefore be worthwhile to investigate whether bile acids also induce COX-2in vivo. Further studies are also needed to confirm that induction of COX-2 by bile acids is mediated via AP-1 and to identify the responsible COX-2 promoter element(s). Given the already demonstrated effects of bile acids on the activity of PKC, it also becomes important to identify the specific isoforms of PKC that mediate the effects of bile acids on COX-2. A more detailed understanding of the precise mechanism(s) by which bile acids induce COX-2 should facilitate the development of chemopreventive strategies to diminish the risk of carcinogenesis within regions of the gastrointestinal tract exposed to bile acids.

https://openalex.org/W2161954973,"Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide-bound glutamine residues. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that the transamidating activity of tTG requires calcium and is inhibited by GTP. To investigate the endogenous regulation of tTG, a quantitative in situtransglutaminase (TG) activity assay was developed. Treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with retinoic acid (RA) resulted in a significant increase in tTG levels and in vitro TG activity. In contrast, basal in situ TG activity did not increase concurrently with RA-induced increased tTG levels. However, stimulation of cells with the calcium-mobilizing drug maitotoxin (MTX) resulted in increases in in situ TG activity that correlated (r 2 = 0.76) with increased tTG levels. To examine the effects of GTP on in situ TG activity, tiazofurin, a drug that selectively decreases GTP levels, was used. Depletion of GTP resulted in a significant increase in in situ TG activity; however, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with a combination of MTX and tiazofurin resulted in significantly lessin situ TG activity compared with treatment with MTX alone. This raised the possibility of calcium-dependent proteolysis due to the effects of tiazofurin, because in vitro GTP protects tTG against proteolysis by trypsin. Studies with a selective membrane permeable calpain inhibitor indicated that tTG is likely to be an endogenous substrate of calpain, and that depletion of GTP increases tTG degradation after elevation of intracellular calcium levels. TG activity was also increased in response to activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which increases intracellular calcium through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation. The results of these experiments demonstrate that selective changes in calcium and GTP regulate the activity and levels of tTGin situ. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide-bound glutamine residues. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that the transamidating activity of tTG requires calcium and is inhibited by GTP. To investigate the endogenous regulation of tTG, a quantitative in situtransglutaminase (TG) activity assay was developed. Treatment of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with retinoic acid (RA) resulted in a significant increase in tTG levels and in vitro TG activity. In contrast, basal in situ TG activity did not increase concurrently with RA-induced increased tTG levels. However, stimulation of cells with the calcium-mobilizing drug maitotoxin (MTX) resulted in increases in in situ TG activity that correlated (r 2 = 0.76) with increased tTG levels. To examine the effects of GTP on in situ TG activity, tiazofurin, a drug that selectively decreases GTP levels, was used. Depletion of GTP resulted in a significant increase in in situ TG activity; however, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with a combination of MTX and tiazofurin resulted in significantly lessin situ TG activity compared with treatment with MTX alone. This raised the possibility of calcium-dependent proteolysis due to the effects of tiazofurin, because in vitro GTP protects tTG against proteolysis by trypsin. Studies with a selective membrane permeable calpain inhibitor indicated that tTG is likely to be an endogenous substrate of calpain, and that depletion of GTP increases tTG degradation after elevation of intracellular calcium levels. TG activity was also increased in response to activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, which increases intracellular calcium through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation. The results of these experiments demonstrate that selective changes in calcium and GTP regulate the activity and levels of tTGin situ.

Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 2Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). As a member of the transglutaminase family, tTG catalyzes a calcium-dependent acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide of a peptide-bound glutamine residue and the ε-amino group of a peptide-bound lysine, or the primary amino group of a polyamine, yielding either an isopeptide bond or a (γ-glutamyl)polyamine bond, respectively (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). This transamidating activity of tTG is inhibited by GTP, an effect that is reversed by an intrinsic GTPase activity of tTG (3Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 1370-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTP-bound tTG was subsequently shown to function as a signal-transducing GTP-binding protein (Gαh), which couples activated receptors to phospholipase Cδ, resulting in stimulation of this effector enzyme (2Nakaoka H.

Thus, this intriguing protein can serve the cell in two apparently unrelated capacities, its role apparently determined by incompletely characterized intracellular regulators. tTG is found in many different mammalian cells and tissues and has been implicated as a participant in a vast array of physiological and pathological processes. In its capacity as a transamidating enzyme, tTG has been proposed to play an important role in bone development (6Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), axonal growth and regeneration (7Eitan S. Schwartz M.

Invest. 1996; 75: 637-645PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have begun to elucidate the specific roles of tTG in these different biochemical processes. For example, tTG is likely to be involved in the activation of both midkine, a heparin-binding growth/differentiation factor, and interleukin 2 by catalyzing the formation of stable dimers (7Eitan S. Schwartz M. Science. 1993; 261: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Eitan S. Solomon A. Lavie V. Yoles E. Hirschberg D.L. Belkin M. Schwartz M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that tTG contributes to the transforming growth factor-β activation process by cross-linking the large latent transforming growth factor-β complex to the extracellular matrix (16Nunes I. Gleizes P.-E. Metz C.N. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are data to indicate that tTG is involved in stabilizing tissue during wound healing by cross-linking anchoring fibrils and, more specifically, collagen VII (17Raghunath M. Hopfner B. Aeschlimann D. Luthi U. Meuli M. Altermatt S. Gobet R. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Steinmann B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1174-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to catalyzing the formation of isodipeptide bonds, tTG in its role as a transamidating enzyme covalently incorporates polyamines into substrate proteins. Protein-polyamine conjugates have been detected in several tissues and cell lines (18Piacentini M. Martinet N. Beninati S. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3790-3794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Beninati S. Folk J.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 250: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in vitro tTG incorporates polyamines into numerous proteins (20Hohenadl C. Mann K. Mayer U. Timpl R. Paulsson M. Aeschlimann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23415-23420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Miller M.L. Johnson G.V.W. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18817-18824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although functional changes resulting from tTG-catalyzed incorporation of polyamines into proteins have not been well defined, previous studies have shown that in vitro the covalent incorporation of polyamines into phospholipase A2 increases activity (23Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Beninati S. Mukherjee A.B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In its capacity as a signal transducing GTP-binding protein tTG has been designated Gαh, a protein that forms noncovalent heterodimers with a 50-kDa protein (2Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 24Baek K.J. Das T. Gray C.D. Desai S. Hwang K.-C. Gacchui R. Ludwig M. Im M.-J. Biochem. J. 1996; 35: 2651-2657Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gαh has been shown to couple to α1-adrenoreceptors and thereby mediate the activation of phospholipase Cδ (2Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 5Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that in the heart the α1-adrenoreceptor couples to Gαh, and in cardiomyopathic heart tissue the intrinsic activity of Gαh is decreased (25Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sweet W.E. Moravec C.S. Im M.-J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The reason for the decrease in Gαh activity and GTP binding in the failing heart is unknown; however, it has been suggested that other proteins, such as the 50-kDa protein that binds Gαh in a GTP-dependent manner, may be involved (24Baek K.J. Das T. Gray C.D. Desai S. Hwang K.-C. Gacchui R. Ludwig M. Im M.-J. Biochem. J. 1996; 35: 2651-2657Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because tTG is apparently involved in multiple cellular processes, its expression and activation are likely to be tightly regulated processes. Interleukin 6 has been shown to induce tTG expression in hepatocytes (26Suto N. Ikura K. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7469-7473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cAMP induces expression in cerebellar granule cells (27Perry M.J.M. Mahoney S.-A. Haynes L.W. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In many, but not all, cell types, retinoids are effective inducers of tTG expression (28Davies P.J. Murtaugh M.P. Moore Jr., W.T. Johnson G.S. Lucas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5166-5174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Piacentini M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Oliverio S. Piredda L. Biedler J.L.

Nagy et al. (32Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A.S. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4355-4365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the mouse tTG promoter is activated by retinoid activation of either retinoic acid receptor-retinoid X receptor heterodimers or retinoid X receptor homodimers. Retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor are highly regulated and exhibit specific temporal, spatial, and tissue-specific expression patterns (33Chambon P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and therefore are likely to be important determinants in tTG expression. The in vitroregulation of tTG transglutaminating activity by calcium and GTP has been well documented (4Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Folk J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). However, the in situmodulation of tTG by these and other factors has not been thoroughly examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the modulation of tTG by calcium and GTP in situ. N,N-Dimethylated casein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), retinoic acid (RA), ionomycin, carbachol, putrescine dihydrochloride, Tween 20, Bisbenzamide (Hoescht), poly-d-lysine (30,000–70,000 daltons), ando-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride were purchased from Sigma; thapsigargin was from Alexis; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, SDS, and FITC-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; [1,4-3H]putrescine dihydrochloride (1 mCi/ml) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Amersham Corp.; 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin, and BCA protein assay reagents were purchased from Pierce; andN-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-tyrosine diazomethyl ketone (Cbz-LLY-DMK) was from Molecular Probes. Calpain I, Nonidet P-40, and Bay K8644 were purchased from Calbiochem, and Tiazofurin was a gift from NCI, National Institutes of Health. RPMI 1640 was purchased from Cellgro; penicillin/streptomycin and horse serum were from Life Technologies, Inc.; and fetal clone II was purchased from Hyclone. The tTG monoclonal antibody 4C1 was produced by the Hybridoma Core Facility at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (36Johnson G.V.W. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); the monoclonal antibody to type I TG was from Biomedical Technologies; the monoclonal tTG antibody CUB 7402 was from Neomarkers; and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Fura-2 was from TefLabs, andN-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was from Bachem. For these experiments, maitotoxin (MTX) was purchased from Calbiochem. However, it should be noted that the potency of MTX varies significantly depending on the vendor; therefore, initial experiments to determine the effective doses of the drug should be carried out. All other reagents were from Sigma. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained on Corning dishes in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5% fetal clone II serum, and 10% horse serum. For differentiation, the percentage of fetal clone II serum and horse serum in the media were reduced to 1 and 4%, respectively. To initiate differentiation, cells were grown in the low serum medium containing 20 μm RA. The differentiating medium supplemented with 20 μm RA was replaced every 48 h. All experiments were carried out on subconfluent cultures. To evaluate the expression level of tTG in cells during differentiation, extracts from cells were prepared and quantitatively immunoblotted. Cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a homogenizing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a 10 μg/ml concentration each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and sonicated on ice. Protein concentrations of the homogenates were determined using the BCA method and diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml with 2 × reducing stop buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, and 10% glycerol with bromphenol blue as the tracking dye). Samples (25 μg of protein) were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with 1–2 μg/ml anti-tTG monoclonal antibody 4C1 in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were rinsed once with TBST and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were rinsed three times for 30 min with TBST, followed by four quick rinses with distilled water, and developed with ECL. The immunoblots were analyzed using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer and normalized to an internal standard to eliminate blot to blot variation in staining intensity. Data were expressed as a percentage of the maximal level of tTG ± S.E. In vitrotTG activity was measured in cell extracts using a modification of the procedure of Hand et al. (11Hand D. Campoy F.J. Clark S. Fisher A. Haynes L.W. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as described previously (36Johnson G.V.W. Cox T.M. Lockhart J.P. Zinnerman M.D. Miller M.L. Powers R.E. Brain Res. 1997; 751: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For in situ tTG activity measurements, SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine, a biotinylated polyamine, and incorporation of the reagent into proteins was determined (27Perry M.J.M. Mahoney S.-A. Haynes L.W. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 1063-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prior to treatment with the indicated drugs or appropriate vehicles (controls), cells were incubated for 1 h with 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine which was prepared as a 100 mm stock in 50 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. MTX, carbachol, and tiazofurin were dissolved in water; ionomycin and thapsigargin were dissolved in Me2SO; and Bay K8644 was dissolved in ethanol. The maximal Me2SO or ethanol concentration to which the cells were exposed was 0.1%. Cells were treated with the drugs as indicated and then harvested and lysed as described above. Ten micrograms of homogenate protein was diluted to 50 μl with coating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) and added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Falcon), and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Two hundred microliters of 5% BSA, 0.01% SDS, 0.01% Tween 20 in borate-buffered saline (BBS; 100 mmboric acid, 20 mm sodium borate, 80 mm NaCl) was added to each well, and the incubation continued for 2 h at 37 °C. The mixture was removed, and each well was rinsed once with 1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 in BBS. One hundred microliters of HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) in 1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were rinsed four times with 1% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 in BBS, and then 200 μl of substrate solution (0.4 mg ofo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride/ml of 0.05 msodium citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5.0) was added to each well. After incubating 10–20 min at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 3 n HCl to each well, and the presence of proteins into which 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine had been incorporated was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). All measurements were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. The activity of tTG in situ was calculated as a percentage of basal activity (i.e. no drug additions) within a given group of samples. Data were analyzed using Student's t test, and values were considered significantly different when p < 0.05. To visualize the proteins into which the 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine had been incorporated, 2 μg of the homogenates was resolved on a 8% polyacrylamide SDS gel; transferred to nitrocellulose; blocked in 5% BSA, 0.05% SDS, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 in BBS for at least 2 h at room temperature; and incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:2000) in 1% BSA, 0.05% SDS, 0.01% Nonidet P-40 in BBS for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were rinsed three times for 30 min each with the same buffer followed by four quick rinses with distilled water. The blots were then developed following the standard ECL protocol. Except where indicated, studies were carried out on cells that had been treated with RA for 6 days. For cytochemical analysis, SH-SY5Y cells were replated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine and subsequently treated with 1 nm MTX for 20 min. Cells not exposed to MTX served as controls. After treatment, SH-SY5Y cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, incubated for 1.5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and rinsed three times for 5 min each with PBS, prior to incubation with 3% BSA in PBS for 30 min to reduce the background. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with the tTG monoclonal antibody CUB 7402 (diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA), rinsed three times for 5 min each with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with FITC-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:100 in PBS and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG diluted 1:50 in PBS. Cells were counterstained with the nuclear dye Hoescht (5 μg/ml) for the evaluation of the cell number, and coverslips were washed extensively in PBS prior to mounting. Controls contained either no primary antibody or no 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine. Cells were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot 300 epifluorescence microscope, and images were captured with a Photometric CH250 CCD camera; digitally stored images were combined and displayed with the IP Lab Spectrum software. The levels of GTP in the cells were determined using reverse phase HPLC as described previously (37Payne S.M. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 123: 151-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were rinsed once with PBS and collected into 1m formic acid. The samples were vortexed and spun at 16,000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were lyophilized, and the pellets were used for protein determinations. The lyophilized samples were resuspended in HPLC grade water, injected onto a C-18 column (Vydac, 250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), and eluted with a 4–42% acetonitrile gradient. Nucleotide standards were used to determine the position at which GTP eluted. All data were normalized to mg of protein in each sample. Intracellular calcium levels were measured in cultured cells using Fura-2 essentially as described previously (38Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Guttmann R.P. Elce J.S. Bell P.D. Isbell J.C. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2005-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. In brief, cells were grown on coverslips, and prior to experimentation they were loaded with a 5 μm concentration of the acetoxymethyl ester form of Fura-2. Coverslips were placed in an imaging chamber (Warner Instrument Co.) and mounted in a heater platform on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a Ringer's solution for the duration of the experiments. Images were obtained using an Ionoptix ICCD camera (Ionoptix Corp., Milton, MA) and processed with the IonWizard software program. Intracellular calcium concentrations were determined from the ratio of fluorescence using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Background fluorescence was taken from regions not containing cells and subtracted from the cell images at each wavelength. The ratio of fluorescence in the digitized images is a direct indicator of intracellular calcium concentrations. The system was calibrated following standardized protocols (40Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Calpain activity was measured in SH-SY5Y using the membrane-permeable, calpain-selective fluorescent peptide,N-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-tyrosine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin as described previously (41Xie H.Q. Johnson G.V.W. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1020-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the media was used as a quantitative measure of cell viability. The measurement of LDH was carried out as described previously (42Decker T. Lohmann-Matthes M.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 115: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The percentage of LDH released was defined by LDH activity in the media divided by total LDH activity. Previously, it had been demonstrated that treatment of human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells with RA increased tTG gene expression and tTG protein levels (29Piacentini M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Oliverio S. Piredda L. Biedler J.L. Melino G. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 271-27820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine if this was also the case for SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, the cells were treated with 20 μm RA, and the level of tTG expression was determined at various times for 12 days. The levels of tTG increased rapidly after RA treatment. In Fig. 1, a representative immunoblot shows that prior to RA treatment the levels of tTG are virtually undetectable, but after RA treatment tTG levels increase rapidly for 3 days and remain elevated for 12 days. A quantitation of the increase in tTG levels in RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells is shown in Fig.2. Type 1 (keratinocyte) TG was not detected in naive or RA-treated cells (data not shown). In vitro measurements of TG activity were carried out to determine if the increased levels of tTG correlated with increased activity (Fig.2). RA treatment of SH-SY5Y cells also resulted in a rapid increase inin vitro TG activity that correlated (r 2 = 0.959) with the increased expression levels of tTG. The TG activity in cells treated with RA for 9 days was approximately 10-fold higher than the activity measured in untreated cells.Figure 2Quantitative analysis of the effects of RA treatment on the expression of tTG (•) and in vitro TG activity (▴). Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with RA for the times indicated resulted in a concomitant increase in both the expression of tTG and in vitro TG activity. The graph is logarithmic.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if basal in situTG activity also correlated with the increases in tTG expression, 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine was used as a probe for endogenous tTG activity. TGs react with free glutamine residues in substrate proteins releasing ammonia, and then the enzyme-substrate intermediate reacts with an appropriate nearby primary amine. This can be either the ε-amino group of lysine in an adjacent protein, resulting in an ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isodipeptide bond, or the primary amino group of a polyamine, resulting in the covalent incorporation of the polyamine into the protein by a (γ-glutamyl)polyamine bond (1Gre"
https://openalex.org/W2080323034,"Cells that are sensitive to the channel-forming toxin aerolysin contain surface glycoproteins that bind the toxin with high affinity. Here we show that a common feature of aerolysin receptors is the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, and we present evidence that the anchor itself is an essential part of the toxin binding determinant. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored T-lymphocyte protein Thy-1 is an example of a protein that acts as an aerolysin receptor. This protein retained its ability to bind aerolysin when it was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, but could not bind the toxin when expressed in Escherichia coli, where the GPI anchor is absent. An unrelated GPI-anchored protein, the variant surface glycoprotein of trypanosomes, was shown to bind aerolysin with similar affinity to Thy-1, and this binding ability was significantly reduced when the anchor was removed chemically. Cathepsin D, a protein with no affinity for aerolysin, was converted to an aerolysin binding form when it was expressed as a GPI-anchored hybrid in COS cells. Not all GPI-anchored proteins bind aerolysin. In some cases this may be due to differences in the structure of the anchor itself. Thus the GPI-anchored proteins procyclin ofTrypanosoma congolense and gp63 of Leishmania major did not bind aerolysin, but when gp63 was expressed with a mammalian GPI anchor in Chinese hamster ovary cells, it bound the toxin.

The first described was the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) fromTrypanosoma brucei brucei, which protects the surface of the bloodstream form of the parasite (4Ferguson M.A.J. Low M.G. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14547-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then a great many mammalian proteins have been shown to be anchored to the cell surface in the same way as VSG (3Hirose S. Knez J.J. Medof M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 582-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins are enzymes, such as placental alkaline phosphatase (5Low M.G. Futerman A.H. Ackerman K.E. Sherman W.R. Silman I. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (6Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas others appear to be involved in cell adhesion, complement regulation, or even in transport (1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Still others are thought to play roles in communication between cells (7Pu M. Ma L. Ohkusu K. Isobe K.

Thus macrophages and neutrophils are activated by antibody cross-linking of CD14 (lipopolysaccharide receptor) and CD16 (Fc-γRIIIB), which leads to cytokine expression and oxidative burst (12Lee J.D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Mackman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shevach E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 159: 716-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 16Kroczek R.A. Gunter K.C. Seligmann B. Shevach E.M. J.

Hanaoka K. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 355-362PubMed Google Scholar). So far the structures of the GPI anchors of only a few proteins have been determined. All of the anchors contain a core of ethanolamine-HPO4-6Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcNα1–6-myo-inositol-1HPO4-diacylglycerol (or alkylacylglycerol or ceramide; Ref. 1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Other sugars may be added to the glycan core. For example the metazoan anchors contain one or two ethanolamine phosphates attached to the mannoses in the core (1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The inositol can be substituted with an additional fatty acid; this is a feature of human erythrocyte GPI-anchored proteins such as acetylcholinesterase but not of bovine acetylcholinesterase (6Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), an indication that within cell types anchors may have some degree of species-specific structure. Within species, there appear to be variations in anchor structure between cell types (19Brewis I.A. Ferguson M.A.J. Mehlert A. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22946-22956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and some of these variations may affect the affinity of ligand binding as has been reported for the folate receptor (20Wang X. Jansen G. Fan J. Kohler W.J. Ross J.F. Schornagel J. Ratnam M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16305-16312Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin is a 52-kDa protein secreted by Aeromonas sp., which has been shown to be required for the virulence ofAeromonas hydrophila (reviewed in Ref. 21Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Once released, the protoxin is activated by proteolytic nicking. Aerolysin binds to sensitive cells and oligomerizes, inserting into the membrane and forming discrete channels that breach the permeability barrier. We have shown that sensitive cells contain receptors that bind both proaerolysin and aerolysin with high affinity (K d approximately 10−9m; Ref. 22Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian erythrocytes, the receptor is a 47-kDa glycoprotein that has N-terminal sequence homology to a group of recently characterized proteins that are involved in ADP-ribosylation reactions (23Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber M.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the major surface glycoprotein Thy-1 is a receptor for aerolysin in mouse T-lymphocytes (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The erythrocyte aerolysin receptor (EAR) and Thy-1 are apparently unrelated to each other in primary structure and in function. Although both proteins are N-glycosylated, we have found that theN-linked sugars are not required for toxin binding. However, Thy-1 and EAR do share one remarkable feature, both are attached to the cell surface with GPI anchors. This is also true of an 80-kDa aerolysin-binding protein in baby hamster kidney cells. 2L. Abrami, M. Fivaz, R. G. Parton, and F. G. van der Goot, submitted for publication.2L. Abrami, M. Fivaz, R. G. Parton, and F. G. van der Goot, submitted for publication. In this paper we show that this is not a coincidence, and we provide evidence that the anchor itself is required for aerolysin binding. Escherichia coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3)/pLysS (Novagen) were used as hosts for plasmid amplification and gene expression, respectively. Both strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and 300 rpm using a rotary shaker. Where appropriate, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin were added at concentrations of 100, 34, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) and the monkey kidney cell line (COS) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Murine lymphocyte cell lines AKR1 (Thy-1+) and AKR1 (Thy-1− d; a class d mutant; Ref 26Evans G.A. Hyman R. Lewis K. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), as well as EL4 (Thy-1+) and EL4 (Thy-1− f; a class f mutant) were generously provided by Dr. R. Hyman (Salk Institute). CHO-K1 cells were grown in F-12 nutrient mixture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), whereas AKR1, EL4, and COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium. Both media were supplemented with bovine fetal clone I serum (10%, v/v), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). All cell lines were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The PCR primers GGGAATTCCATATGCAGAAGGTGACCAGCC and CCGGAATTCAACACTTGACCAGTTTGTCTC were used to isolate the DNA sequence encoding the mature peptide of Thy-1 from the mouse cDNA clone pTZ18U.TM8.5 (Ref. 27Hedrick S.M. Cohen D.I. Nielsen E.A. Davis M.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar; also a gift from Dr. R. Hyman). The primers were designed so that the cloned gene began with an added methionine codon (ATG) to initiate translation and ended with an added stop codon (TGA). The PCR product was ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET29a (Novagen), to obtain plasmid pM42 which was amplified in JM109, isolated, and retransformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS. Expression of the cloned gene was performed according to the protocol provided by Novagen. Three hours after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were collected by centrifugation, and aliquots of resuspended cell pellets were used for the sandwich Western blotting procedure described below. BL21(DE3)/pLysS containing pET29a served as a control. For expression of human Thy-1 in tissue cell lines, the cDNA encoding human Thy-1 (pThy-1H, a gift from Dr. R. Kay, University of British Columbia) was amplified by PCR using primers AAGCTTGCTGCAGCAGCGGAAGAC and TCTAGAGGATCCCACCAGTCACAGGGAC and then subcloned into the eucaryotic expression vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen) to obtain pRc-Thy-1. The plasmid construct of the chimeric GPI-anchored form of human cathepsin D (CD; a gift from Dr. E. Ogier-Denis, Faculté de Médecine de Xavier Bichat, Paris) has been reported earlier (28Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Couvineau A. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 221: 935-942Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). It contains the human CD cDNA (29Horst M. Hasilik A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) fused with the GPI anchor signal sequence of human 5′-nucleotidase (30Misumi Y. Ogata S. Ohkubo K. Hirose S. Ikehare Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into CHO-K1 cells for stable expression using a CaCl2 precipitation method (31Kingston R.E. Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, 1988: 9.1.4-9.2.5Google Scholar) or into COS cells for transient expression using a DEAE-dextran and chloroquine method (32Cullen B.R. Lomedico P.T. Ju G. Nature. 1984; 307: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To select CHO-K1 transfectants, 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the growth medium. Transfected cells were collected 3 days after transfection and washed once with 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3, containing 137 mmNaCl and 2.7 mm KCl. Aliquots of resuspended cell pellets were then used to detect proaerolysin-binding proteins by sandwich Western blotting as described below. The entire insert sequence in pRc-Thy-1 and pM42 was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the chain termination method and the Sequenase kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sandwich Western blotting was used to detect proaerolysin-binding proteins as described previously (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell or protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with proaerolysin, followed by polyclonal anti-aerolysin antibody and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. The surface protein gp63 expressed in CHO cells and in Leishmania major samples was detected with a monoclonal anti-gp63 antibody and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase. The gp63 samples and the antibody were generously provided by Dr. R. McMaster (University of British Columbia). Their preparation has been described previously (33Morrison C.J. McMaster W.R. Piret J.M. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1997; 53: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For the aerolysin sensitivity assay, 1 ml of 5 × 105 cells/ml were treated with 200 milliunits of PI-PLC (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 37 °C rotating end over end. Cells were then pelleted by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 1 ml of growth medium. Aerolysin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 nm, and corresponding control samples were incubated without aerolysin for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following incubation, samples were diluted 1:2 in 0.1% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA, and live/dead cell counts were performed using a hemocytometer. COS transfectants expressing the GPI form of CD were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The washed cells were treated with 350 milliunits of PI-PLC in 150 μl of the same buffer for 2 h at 37 °C, with end-over-end rotation. Control samples were incubated without enzyme. Cells were pelleted at 90,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Airfuge. Aliquots of cells and supernatants were used for the Western blotting procedure. Mouse brain homogenate, prepared as described previously (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), was treated with PI-PLC and centrifuged. A 10-μl sample of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume ofN-glycosidase incubation buffer (40 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), and the mixture was boiled for 2 min. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, 3.3 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (0.6 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, 120 μm leupeptin, and 12 μm pepstatin A) was added, followed by 2.5 μl of 10% octylglucopyranoside and 7.5 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (Oxford Glycosystems), containing 1.5 units of the enzyme. A control incubation was also carried out in which 7.5 μl of buffer was added in place of the enzyme. After 18 h at 37 °C, sample buffer was added, and aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE and sandwich Western-blotted. Thy-1 was purified from deoxycholate extracts of pig brain using a modification of the procedure of Letarte-Muirheadet al. (34Letarte-Muirhead M. Barclay A.N. Williams A.F. Biochem. J. 1975; 151: 685-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and incorporated into carboxyfluorescein-entrapped liposomes as reported earlier (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Pronase was added to 500 μl of the liposomes (0.35 μmol of lipid) to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Liposomes incubated under the same conditions without Pronase were used as a control. The liposomes were separated from free carboxyfluorescein as well as from the fragmented protein and the Pronase by passing them over a Sephacryl S-300 column. Aerolysin-induced channel formation was monitored by measuring carboxyfluorescein release spectrofluorimetrically, as described before (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The GPI anchor of purified VSG was chemically cleaved from the protein by treatment with aqueous HF, following the procedure of Ferguson et al. (35Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The VSG was a kind gift from Dr. Terry Pearson (University of Victoria). The glycoprotein (150 μg) was incubated with 100 μl of 50% aqueous HF at 0 °C for 48 h. A control sample was incubated with water under the same conditions. The HF was neutralized by adding the sample to frozen saturated lithium hydroxide, and the precipitate of lithium fluoride was removed by centrifugation. The pellet was washed twice with 50 μl of distilled water, and the aqueous portions were combined and desalted over a PD-10 (G-25) column equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES , pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. Proaerolysin binding was assessed following Western blotting, after SDS-PAGE of the void volume fraction. Anchor removal was confirmed using a commercial antibody that detects the presence of the GPI anchors (anti-cross-reacting determinant; Oxford Glycosystems, Ref. 36Zamze S.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Collins R. Dwek R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Proaerolysin binding was compared using an ELISA-based assay as we have described before (37Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured according to Markwell et al.(38Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5279) Google Scholar). Total lipid phosphorus was determined following the procedure of Ames and Dubin (39Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that Thy-1 binds aerolysin with high affinity and that liposomes containing incorporated Thy-1 are much more sensitive to the toxin (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have also found that EL4 cell lines that cannot add GPI anchors to membrane proteins resist aerolysin's action, and we had assumed that this was because they lacked Thy-1 (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We were therefore surprised to discover that the mouse mutant T-lymphocyte cell line AKR1 (Thy-1− d), which does not express Thy-1 (26Evans G.A. Hyman R. Lewis K. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was almost as sensitive to aerolysin as was the parent strain (Fig.1). This led us to consider the possibility that aerolysin may bind to more than one GPI-anchored protein in T-lymphocytes. The sensitivity of the AKR1 (Thy-1− d) cell line to the toxin could then be attributed to the presence of other GPI-anchored receptors, all of which would be missing from the mutant EL4 cells we studied earlier. This explanation was supported by the results of treating cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which selectively removes GPI-anchored proteins from their surfaces. It may be seen in Fig. 1 that both AKR1 cell lines became less sensitive to aerolysin after treatment with the enzyme. Sandwich Western blotting of mouse brain homogenate revealed that in addition to Thy-1, there is a 110-kDa membrane-associated protein that binds proaerolysin (lane 3, Fig. 2). Like Thy-1, this protein was solubilized by treating the homogenate with PI-PLC, indicating that it too is GPI-anchored (lanes 1 and 6). A literature search for known GPI-anchored proteins of comparable size suggested that the brain protein might be either neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM; Ref. 40Mukasa R. Umeda M. Endo T. Kobata A. Inoue K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or contactin (41Peles E. Nativ M. Campbell P.L. Sakurai T. Martinez R. Lev S. Clary D.D. Schilling J. Barnea G. Plowman G.D. Grumet M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1995; 82: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). There was only a small decrease in the size of this protein when it was treated withN-glycosidase (lane 2, Fig. 2). Two bands corresponding to much smaller proteins are also visible in lane 2 after N-glycosidase treatment. The lower corresponds to completely de-N-glycosylated Thy-1, and the upper may represent partially deglycosylated Thy-1 as we have discussed previously (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), or it may represent another GPI-anchored protein. The 110-kDa aerolysin-binding protein was unambiguously identified as contactin by determining its N-terminal sequence after purifying the protein, which had been liberated from the membrane by treatment with PI-PLC. 3K. L. Nelson and J. T. Buckley, manuscript in preparation. The observation that T-cells contain at least one GPI-anchored protein in addition to Thy-1 that binds proaerolysin, and that the erythrocyte aerolysin receptor (23Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber M.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and contactin are also GPI-anchored proteins, pointed to the remarkable possibility that the anchors themselves may be involved in proaerolysin binding. The VSG ofT. brucei brucei was the first GPI-anchored protein to be characterized (35Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Aside from its anchor, it seems to be unrelated to either Thy-1 or contactin, and it is unlikely to have any sequence homology with EAR, which appears to be a member of a small family of ADP-ribosyltransferases (23Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber M.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, VSG has a similar, though not identical GPI anchor to Thy-1, so we felt it possible that it too could bind proaerolysin if the anchor is a binding determinant. Using samples of purified VSG and an ELISA-based assay, we compared proaerolysin binding to VSG with binding to purified Thy-1. The results in Fig.3 show that the toxin also bound the trypanosomal protein. We were easily able to detect VSG by sandwich Western blotting (not shown) in amounts comparable with the amounts of Thy-1 we have detected previously (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To obtain more direct evidence that the GPI anchor itself was involved in proaerolysin binding, we took two approaches. In the first, we compared protoxin binding to Thy-1 expressed in E. coli, which is not capable of adding GPI anchors, with binding to Thy-1 expressed in CHO cells, where we would expect processing to be normal (28Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Couvineau A. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 221: 935-942Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4 show that proaerolysin could easily detect Thy-1 expressed in the eucaryotic cell, whereas there was no evidence of specific binding to Thy-1 expressed in the bacteria, even though, as was clear from a comparison of Coomassie-stained samples, far more Thy-1 was present in theE. coli samples we used. It is worth emphasizing that the far Western blotting procedure we used can detect less than 1 ng of native Thy-1 (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Of course as well as lacking the anchor, the Thy-1 expressed in the bacteria would lack the N-linked carbohydrate that is normally present in the eucaryote. However this could not account for the difference in binding we observed, since as noted above, we have shown that the N-linked sugars apparently are not required for proaerolysin binding (24Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the second approach, we took advantage of the fact that HF can selectively remove nearly the entire GPI anchor from proteins without destroying the polypeptide chain (35Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The results in Fig.5 show that treatment of VSG with HF led to a very large reduction in proaerolysin binding measured using sandwich Western blotting or the ELISA assay. The results also show that binding of a commercial antibody directed against the GPI determinant, which we used as a positive control of anchor removal, was also reduced. A number of groups have successfully produced hybrid proteins by fusing the DNA encoding the anchor signal for a GPI-anchored protein such as decay-accelerating factor or Thy-1 to the DNA encoding a protein that is normally not anchored in this way (27Hedrick S.M. Cohen D.I. Nielsen E.A. Davis M.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar,42Clissold P.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 43Lublin D.M. Coyne K.E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Many of these hybrid proteins appear to behave like normal GPI-anchored proteins, finding their way to the exterior surface of the cell's plasma membrane. An example is CD, which was converted from a soluble to a surface exposed GPI-anchored protein by Ogier-Deniset al. (28Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Couvineau A. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 221: 935-942Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3 show that proaerolysin has no affinity for the normal water soluble form of human CD (obtained from Sigma), nor could the soluble form of the protein be detected by sandwich Western blotting (not shown).

Specifically, the presence of 1 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 in phosphatidylcholine vesicles results in a 20-fold increase in the binding affinity of cPLA2. This increased affinity is accompanied by an increase in substrate hydrolysis of a similar magnitude. The binding studies and kinetic analysis indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 binds to cPLA2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The magnitude of the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is unique among anionic phospholipids and larger than that for other polyphosphate phosphatidylinositols. The effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the activity of cPLA2 is at least an order of magnitude larger than the concomitant changes in the fraction of the enzyme associated with lipid membranes. Striking parallels between the interaction of cPLA2 with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the interaction of the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase Cδ1 with PtdIns(4,5)2 combined with sequence analysis of cPLA2 lead us to propose the existence and location of a pleckstrin homology domain in cPLA2. We further show that the very nature of the interaction of proteins such as cPLA2 with multiple ligands incorporated into membranes follows a specific model which necessitates the use of an experimental methodology suitable for a membrane interface to allow for a meaningful analysis of the data.

Current widespread interest in the cytosolic phospholipase A2 stems from its putative role as a key enzyme involved in the inflammatory response, a provider of arachidonic acid, the precursor for prostaglandins and leukotrienes (3Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Novel Approaches to Anti-inflammatory Therapy. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel1995: 65-76Google Scholar). This enzyme was also implicated in the regulation of several other processes such as platelet activation, cell proliferation, and the generation of several second messengers (3Goetzl E.J. An S. Smith W.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Kramer R.M. Sharp J.D. Pruzanski W. Vadas P. Novel Approaches to Anti-inflammatory Therapy.

A mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was implicated in the translocation of cPLA2 to cellular membranes resulting in the subsequent specific liberation of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipids (6Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). This scenario of activation of cPLA2 was validated by the discovery that the N terminus of this enzyme contains an autonomous calcium and lipid binding domain, CaLB (7Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) of protein kinase C and several other proteins shown to associate with lipid membranes in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (7Clark J.D.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15718-15722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the native enzyme and its CaLB domain were shown to associate with fragments of cellular membranes and synthetic lipid vesicles at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations (6Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, the CaLB domain is the only recognized regulatory domain of cPLA2 (5Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). It was noted early on (12Leslie C.C. Channon J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that several anionic phospholipids including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) activated cPLA2. This stimulatory effect was hypothesized to result from an enhancement of the partitioning of cPLA2 into lipid membranes caused in general by all anionic lipids. We have now employed an approach that was specifically designed for the characterization of proteins that bind to membranes through multiple attachment points to demonstrate that cPLA2 binds in a 1:1 stoichiometry with high affinity and specificity to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in lipid vesicles, and the effect is quite distinct from that of other anionic lipids. Furthermore, the resulting increase in membrane affinity is accompanied by a quantitative increase in enzymatic activity. In addition, an apparent functional similarity between cPLA2 and phospholipase Cδ1 (PLCδ1) now allows us to propose the location of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in cPLA2. It is now recognized that many of the key proteins involved in signal transduction possess multimodular structures (13Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Already hundreds of multimodular proteins have been identified that contain domains such as the PH (14Musacchio A. Gibson T.

These modules can specifically bind certain membrane proteins (src homology-2,src homology-3, C2, and PH domains) and specific membrane lipids (C1, C2, and PH domains). This fact highlights the need for studies of multimodular membrane-binding proteins that take into account the specific properties of the interactions occurring within the two-dimensional surface of cellular membranes (17Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) as demonstrated here for cPLA2.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (20Wang D.-S. Chen C.-S. J. Org.

The association of cPLA2 with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (pore diameter 0.2 μm) was quantitated in a sucrose-loaded vesicle assay originally devised for the study of PLCδ1 (21Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In brief, LUVs were produced by extrusion (22Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) in 170 mm sucrose, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The lipid composition varied depending on the experiment. Subsequently, the LUVs were suspended in 5 volumes of solution containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8 (referred to hereafter as the “standard binding solution”), and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in KCl/PIPES buffer. Enzyme (0.5 μg/ml) and lipid vesicles (0.1 to 1 mm total lipid) were suspended in KCl/PIPES buffer with 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm EGTA and CaCl2 at a concentration required to achieve the desired concentration of free ion, calculated according to a published algorithm (23Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). This suspension was allowed to equilibrate for 10 min and was then centrifuged again for 15 min at 25 °C at 150,000 ×g. The contents of each tube were separated into a top (75% total volume) and a bottom fraction. To ensure identical conditions during deposition of the sample on the Immobilon-P membrane, both fractions were restored to the original volume (0.75 ml) and the composition of the original sample, including the lipid but not the enzyme content. Equal aliquots of these fractions, as well as of several protein suspensions of known concentration, 0.30 ml each, were spotted on an Immobilon-P membrane and subsequently immunoblotted and detected according to a standard enhanced chemiluminescence protocol (Amersham Corp.). The signal was quantitated by scanning densitometry and converted into protein mass using cPLA2 standards included in the same Immobilon-P membrane. The amount of protein associated with vesicles was calculated as described elsewhere (24Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As quantitated by liquid scintillation counting of 14C-labeled PAPC, routinely included in all lipid mixtures, approximately 95% of the lipid was found in the bottom fraction. The apparent membrane affinity of cPLA2, K app, used to quantitate the association of this enzyme with vesicles is defined as the reciprocal of the total lipid concentration at which 50% of the protein is associated with vesicles. Due to a large excess of lipid over protein in the experiments reported here, this quantity can be treated as a molar partition coefficient of the protein into lipid (25Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson D. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 227-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The activity of cPLA2 toward PAPC was quantitated in a modified Dole assay (26Zhang Y.Y. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 456-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as described previously (27Conde-Frieboes K. Reynolds L.J. Lio Y. Hale M. Wasserman H.H. Dennis E.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5519-5525Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). LUVs were prepared by extrusion, using the same procedure as described in the binding assay, using either standard binding solution (with the addition of BSA at 1 mg/ml) or “standard micelle assay solution” depending on the comparisons necessary; however, they contained a larger fraction of 14C-labeled PAPC, to ensure approximately 200,000 cpm per assay sample. Triton X-100/phospholipid mixed micelles were prepared by adding an appropriate aliquot of the detergent to a suspension of multilamellar lipid vesicles to achieve the final total (lipid + detergent) concentration of 4 mm in the assay. Unless indicated otherwise, the reaction was carried out at 40 °C in a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Cleland's reagent), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, the standard micelle assay solution. The dependence of the activity on the cPLA2 concentration was found to be linear in both vesicles and micelles. The kinetics of cPLA2 activity were analyzed using the dual phospholipid kinetic model, Equation 1 (17Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Deems R.A. Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

When the concentration of the substrate in the interface is far below saturation (X s ≪ K m) this model can be simplified to Equation 2,ν=EffXaXsEquation 2 where the enzymatic efficiency E ff =V max/K m and the fraction of the enzyme associated with micelles, X a =S/(K s + S). The secondary structure was predicted using three different algorithms incorporated into the program DNAsis (Hitachi Software Engineering America, Ltd., San Francisco, CA) or using the service offered by the Protein Design Group, EMBL (Heidelberg, Germany). Unless indicated otherwise, experiments were performed in two independent sets, each in duplicate. Results are presented as the mean ± S.D. (not shown when the bar size is smaller than the symbol). Kinetic and binding models were fitted to the data with a weighted least-squares procedure. All other lines shown were smoothed curves through the data to allow for ready visual comparisons. Although all results are internally consistent for each figure and table, the range of PtdIns(4,5)P2 activation of cPLA2 varies between Tables II and III and Fig. 6 for several reasons.

(iii) PtdIns(4,5)P2 also degrades over storage time and is light-sensitive. (iv) Some experiments resulted in as high as 25% substrate depletion due to the dramatic activation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 which tended to lower the apparent fold activation.Table IIEffect of added phospholipid on the cPLA2 activity toward PAPC/Triton X-100 mixed micellesPAPCPhospholipidActivityIncreasemmnmol/μg/min-fold1.000.143 ± 0.00510.960.04 mmPtdIns(4,5)P217.1 ± 0.21200.960.04 mm PtdIns(3,4)P210.8 ± 0.3760.960.04 mm PtdIns(3,4,5)P39.8 ± 0.3690.960.04 mm PtdIns(4)P2.50 ± 0.0117.50.960.04 mm PtdIns(3)P0.767 ± 0.0095.40.800.20 mm PA1.44 ± 0.0510.10.800.20 mm PI0.418 ± 0.0072.90.800.20 mm PS0.240 ± 0.0081.70.800.20 mm PG0.224 ± 0.0061.60.800.20 mm PE0.100 ± 0.0050.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIIEffect of inositol polyphosphates on cPLA2 activity toward PAPC/Triton X-100 mixed micelles in the absence and presence of PtdIns(4,5)P2PAPCPtdIns(4,5)P2Inositol polyphosphateActivityIncreasemmmmnmol/μg/min-fold1.000.142 ± 0.00511.000.40 mmIns(1,4,5)P30.186 ± 0.0031.31.000.20 mm Ins(1,3,4,5)P40.269 ± 0.0051.90.960.048.5 ± 0.7600.960.040.40 mm Ins(1,4,5)P38.2 ± 0.4580.960.040.20 mmInst(1,3,4,5)P48.7 ± 0.561 Open table in a new tab We investigated the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) on the association of recombinant human cPLA2 with LUVs composed primarily of PAPC. From among this group of lipids, PtdIns(4,5)P2 proved to be particularly effective at increasing vesicle association. To avoid alterations in the chemical composition of the vesicles over the time course of the binding experiment, binding studies were performed using a Ser-228 → Ala mutant of cPLA2, which is devoid of enzymatic activity (19Sharp J.D. Pickard R.T. Chiou X.G. Manetta J.V. Kovacevic S. Miller J.R. Varshavsky A.D. Roberts E.F. Strifler B.A. Brems D.N. Kramer R.M. J. Biol.

The affinity of this mutant for PAPC vesicles with or without 0.3 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 was the same as the native protein (data not shown). Fig. 1demonstrates that as little as 0.1 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 was sufficient to cause a measurable increase in the association of the enzyme with LUVs. Furthermore, at higher mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2, the ratio of membrane-bound to free enzyme increased linearly with the mole fraction of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membrane, i.e. 1 order of magnitude increase in mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 was accompanied by a numerically identical increase in the membrane affinity. This suggests that the enzyme and PtdIns(4,5)P2 form a 1:1 complex at the membrane interface. The simplest model of binding to a specific ligand at the interface (25Kim J. Blackshear P.J. Johnson D.

A fit of Equation 3 for to the dependence of membrane association of cPLA2 on mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1) yielded a K d of 0.05 ± 0.02 mol %. In other words, just 1 molecule of PtdIns(4,5)P2 per 2,000 lipid molecules in the membrane (∼360,000 lipid molecules per LUV) is sufficient to double the affinity of cPLA2 for the lipid bilayer. Inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate, a polar moiety of PtdIns(4,5)P2 liberated in the cell by PLC-catalyzed hydrolysis (31Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar), had no apparent effect on the PtdIns(4,5)P2-induced increase in membrane affinity for up to a 10-fold molar excess over this phospholipid (data not shown). As illustrated in Table I, the high affinity binding of cPLA2 to PtdIns(4,5)P2 was sufficient to cause a measurable association with PAPC/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicles in the presence of EGTA ([Ca2+] <2 nm). As in the presence of Ca2+, the affinity of cPLA2 for PAPC/PtdIns(4,5)P2 vesicles increased linearly with mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2. In contrast to PtdIns(4,5)P2, PI displayed little effect on the association of the enzyme with lipid vesicles even at a 10-fold higher mol % than PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Table I). Lack of any appreciable effect of a mono-anionic lipid, PI, on the Ca2+-induced association of cPLA2 with lipid membrane was consistent with the lack of the effect of another anionic lipid, PS, on the Ca2+dependence of cPLA2 binding to lipid vesicles reported earlier (11Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have decided to compare the effect of PS on the association of cPLA2 under experimental conditions identical to those used in characterization of the interaction of this phospholipid with the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (24Mosior M.

As illustrated in Fig. 2, the fraction of vesicle-bound enzyme declined with an increasing mol % PS. Thus, in contrast to the case with PtdIns(4,5)P2, the mono-anionic lipids, PI and PS, displayed little or even an opposite effect on the association of cPLA2 with lipid vesicles. Surprisingly, under the same experimental conditions, the membrane affinity of cPLA2 for vesicles composed of a 1:1 mixture of PAPC:PE was about 6-fold that of vesicles composed entirely of PAPC (Table I). We have also tested the effect of PtdIns(4,5)P2, PI, PS, and PE on the activity of the enzyme toward PAPC in the same vesicles as used in the binding assay (Fig.3). The presence of modest mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 in lipid vesicles resulted in a substantial increase of enzymatic activity of cPLA2 (Fig. 3). Notably, this increase was much higher than could result solely from a PtdIns(4,5)P2-induced increase in the fraction of the enzyme associated with lipid vesicles. The percentage of membrane-associated enzyme rose from about 30% to about 95% when the mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 rose from 0 to 3%. In contrast, the activity rose by a factor of 55 (Fig. 3). At Ca2+ levels approximating those of a quiescent cell, 70 nm, 1 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 caused an increase in cPLA2activity from 7 ± 2 to 260 ± 80 nmol/min/mg. This increase was equally dramatic as that seen at 2 μmCa2+ (Fig. 3). The presence of 1 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 was sufficient to elicit measurable enzymatic activity in the absence of exogenous Ca2+ (Fig.4 A). The activity under these conditions was linear with time. In contrast, at 2 μmfree Ca2+ the linear character of the activity was sustained only for the first few minutes of the reaction (Fig.4 B). Note, however, that as was the case for PtdIns(4,5)P2, the Ca2+-induced increase in enzymatic activity of cPLA2 (Fig. 4, A versus B) was about 10-fold larger than the increase in the percentage of membrane-bound enzyme, from about 10 to just over 90% (Table I and Fig. 1). The same time course was observed at a 20 times lower enzyme concentration (data not shown).Figure 4Hydrolysis at low and high [Ca2+]. Hydrolysis was measured using the standard binding solution with 0.5 mm EGTA ([Ca2+] <2 nm) (A) or 2 μm free Ca2+ (B) at 25 °C and 1 mm total lipid, 1:99 PtdIns(4,5)P2:PAPC in the forms of LUVs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, the rate of hydrolysis did not diminish continuously over time. For times longer than 10 min, the rate appeared to achieve another steady value at approximately 1/3 that of the rate in the first 2 to 3 min. Nevertheless, the experimental condition-dependent activity made it difficult to study the kinetics and lipid specificity in the activation of cPLA2. Fortunately, as demonstrated in Fig. 5, the time course was linear even at high activity conditions when the phospholipids were dissolved in Triton X-100 to form detergent/lipid mixed micelles. This linearity suggests also that cPLA2does not preferentially hydrolyze PtdIns(4,5)P2 over PAPC. Fig. 6 A demonstrates that in the presence of approximately 1 molecule of PtdIns(4,5)P2per micelle (0.75 mol % of total lipid + detergent), the initial rate of hydrolysis of PAPC by cPLA2 was essentially linear with the molar percentage of PAPC and about 40 times higher than in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, a similar percentage of PI displayed little effect on the hydrolysis of PAPC (Fig. 6 B). The non-linear character of the kinetics observed at the lower percentage of PAPC and in the absence of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (Fig. 6 B) is consistent with the dual phospholipid kinetic model (17Carman G.M.

An increase in the mol % substrate increases both the fraction of the enzyme associated with the micelles and the rate of catalysis, since the enzyme is far from being saturated by the substrate.

Vitamin A deficiency during embryonic development results in congenital malformations or lethality, and in adults, it results in disturbances in vision and reproduction and metaplasia of epithelial tissues. Vitamin A excess during embryonic development results in malformations in neural tube-derived structures and limb duplications (13Means A.L. Gudas L.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 201-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because the developmental consequences of retinoid deficiency, as well as toxicity, are severe, the mechanisms that regulate RA levels in tissues are critical. In vertebrates, the effects of RA are mediated primarily through gene transcription, via several members of the steroid/thyroid/vitamin D superfamily of nuclear receptors: the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which each comprise three different subtypes (α, β, and γ) and which bind RA and 9-cis-RA, respectively, with high affinity. RARs and RXRs have been shown to bind as heterodimers to RA response elements of RA target genes (14Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the nuclear receptor heterodimers are essential for RAR-mediated RA signaling (15Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell.

Although much progress has been made in understanding how RA mediates its biological effects, the functions of RA synthesis and metabolism in RA signaling remain unclear.

In the breast cancer-derived epithelial cell line MCF-7, metabolic activity and P450RAI mRNA are closely correlated at various times after RA treatment, whereas the nonmalignant, nontransformed breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A has neither P450RAI expression nor RA metabolic activity following RA treatment (28White J.A.

These findings strongly implicate P450RAI as a key participant in RA-inducible metabolism, which may act in limiting cellular RA levels. To address the role of RA metabolism in RA signaling and cell differentiation, we cloned the murine P450RAI counterpart, assessed its metabolic activity by expressing it in COS-1 cells, and studied its expression in the F9 murine embryonal carcinoma cell line, which differentiates into primitive, parietal, or visceral endoderm depending on the RA treatment conditions and is known to have RA-inducible RA metabolic activity (29Strickland S.

In our present study, we used F9 wild-type, RARα−/−, RARγ−/−, RXRα−/−, RXRα−/−/RARγ−/−, and RXRα−/−/RARα−/− cell lines and a number of receptor-specific synthetic retinoids to establish whether P450RAI was responsible for RA-induced RA metabolism and which receptors were involved in its regulation. The mouse homolog of P450RAI was isolated from a RA-induced P19 teratocarcinoma cDNA library in λ Unizap XR (Stratagene). A total of 106 independent plaques were plated and screened using a32P-labeled random-primed full-length humanP450RAI probe. Hybridization conditions were as described previously (28White J.A.

In brief, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glucose (4.5 g/liter), 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone, and gentamycin. For general maintenance, cells were split every other day, seeded into gelatinized tissue culture plates, and incubated in a humidified, 37 °C atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments involving treatment with RA, cells were plated at 1.3 × 106 cells per 100-mm tissue culture plate, grown overnight, and treated with all-trans-RA at 1 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide or with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide only. RA treatments were done under reduced light conditions. For removal of RA from the medium, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of fresh medium. Following cell treatment, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as outlined by the manufacturer. Gel electrophoresis and Northern blotting onto nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Corp.) were performed as described by White et al. (27White J.A. Guo Y. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J.

Radiolabeled mouse P450RAI cDNA probes were prepared by random priming of cDNA using the Stratagene Prime-It kit. Following hybridization in Quick-Hyb (Stratagene) and membrane washings as described by the manufacturer, blots were exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR or BIOMAX MR film at −70 °C. To control for quantitation between RNA samples, blots were probed with 32P-labeled 36B4 cDNA, a ribosomal phosphoprotein, the expression of which is not altered by treatment with RA (32Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with either mouse P450RAI in expression vector pRC/CMV or empty vector control DNA, along with ferridoxin and ferridoxin reductase expression vectors, as described previously (27White J.A.

Briefly, media from treated cells incubated with 575 pm all-trans-[11,12-3H]RA (23.1 Ci/mmol) for 4 h were acidified to pH 6.1 with glacial acetic acid (0.1%). Lipid-soluble and aqueous-soluble metabolites in the media were separated using a modified Bligh and Dyer total lipid extraction (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1957; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42411) Google Scholar). Conversion of all-trans-[11,12-3H]RA to total aqueous-soluble metabolites was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the aqueous-soluble extract. Lipid-soluble extracts were evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 93.5:5:1:0.5, hexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanol/acetic acid. Metabolites were separated by HPLC using Zorbax-CN (6 μm, 4.6 mm inner diameter × 25 cm) column eluted with a solvent system of 93.5:5:1:0.5, hexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. RNA preparation, RT-PCR, and Southern blotting were performed as described previously (19Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The PCR primers were as follows: 36B4, 5′CAGCTCTGGAGAAACTGCTG-3′ (nucleotides 290–309) and 5′GTGTACTCAGTCTCCACAGA-3′ (nucleotides 826–845) (36Krowczynska A.M. Coutts M. Makrides S. Brawerman G.

The amplifications were done for 17 or 19 cycles, aliquots were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and samples were transferred onto Hybond N membranes. The blots were hybridized to the corresponding random primed mouse P450RAI- or 36B4-labeled cDNA probes. Transcript levels were quantified using a BAS 2000 BioImaging analyzer and normalized to corresponding 36B4 mRNA levels.

Treatments of F9 cells with synthetic retinoids were for 24 h. A cDNA library derived from RA-treated P19 in Unizap XR (Stratagene) was screened with a full-length cDNA probe from human P450RAI according to procedures previously described. Out of 16 clones isolated, 1 cDNA encoding the full open reading frame was obtained and was found to be 93% identical to the human P450RAI and 68% identical to the zibrafish P450RAI at the amino acid level (Fig. 1). Regions previously identified as having a high degree of homology between human and zibrafish P450RAIs were almost identical between human and mouse cytochromes, with most differences clustered elsewhere in the cDNA. The genomic sequence of both the mouse and human P450RAIs has also been determined, and there is very close homology in location, size, and sequence of the introns and in the proximal promoter. 3B. Beckett, J. White, and M. Petkovich, unpublished observations. The high degree of homology among these P450RAIs from different species, their catabolic activities, and their location on syntenic chromosomal regions suggests that these genes are homologous. 4White, J. A., Beckett, B., Scherer, S. W., Herbrick, J.-A., and Petkovich, M. (1998) Genomics, in press. To determine whether the mouse P450RAI had similar RA metabolizing activity to its human and zibrafish counterparts, we cloned the full-length mouse P450RAI into the expression vector pRC/CMV, in which transcription is driven by the CMV promoter. COS-1 cells were transfected with the expression vector containing mouse P450RAI or with the empty vector as a control, using methods previously described (28White J.A. Beckett-Jones B. Guo Y.D. Dilworth F.J. Bonasoro J. Jones G. Petkovich M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18538-18541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). RA metabolism in the transfected cells was measured by HPLC analysis of the lipid-soluble components of the media after incubation with either all-trans[11,12-3H]RA (575 pm) or unlabeled all-trans RA (1 μm). In addition, the aqueous-soluble fraction of the media from cells incubated with 3H-labeled RA was counted by liquid scintillation. The pattern of metabolism was the same using this cytochrome P450 as with the human and zibrafish P450RAIs (27White J.A. Guo Y. Baetz K. Beckett-Jones B. Bonasoro J. Hsu K.E. Dilworth F.J. Jones G.

Cells treated with all-trans-[11,12-3H]RA and transfected with pRC/CMV-P450RAI (Fig.2 A) showed a decrease in the amount of RA substrate compared with cells transfected with empty vector and production of metabolites that eluted at 9.5 and 11.5 min, corresponding to the elution positions of 4-OH-RA and 4-oxo-RA standards. In the case of the 3H-labeled substrate, products were measured by collecting and counting fractions, and the broad peaks observed may also contain other metabolites, such as 18-OH-RA, which has been identified as a metabolic product in microsomes from rat testis incubated with RA (23Fiorella P.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The counts in the aqueous-soluble fraction, which may represent glucuronide conjugates and/or products representing further metabolism of RA, are significantly increased in the mouse P450RAI transfectants compared with control cells (Fig. 2 B). With the unlabeled RA substrate (Fig. 2 C), there was also a decrease in the amount of substrate in cells transfected with mouse P450RAI compared with controls. Three metabolites with spectral properties characteristic of retinoids were observed, co-migrating with 18-OH-, 4-OH-, and 4-oxo-RA standards at 9.3, 9.6, and 11.5 min, respectively. An additional uncharacterized peak, present in the culture medium and lacking the characteristic retinoid UV spectrum, was observed at 10.5 min with both P450RAI-transfected and control samples. F9 cells have previously been shown to exhibit RA-inducible RA metabolism (26Williams J.B. Napoli J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4658-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 41Gubler M.L. Sherman M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9552-9558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Boylan J.F. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the RA metabolic activity in F9 cells could be accounted for by P450RAI expression, we assessed P450RAI mRNA expression in F9 cells treated with RA for various lengths of time. In these experiments, we used a plating density (1.3 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish) that was found to give optimal expression of P450RAI (data not shown). Levels of P450RAI mRNA were higher in RA-treated cells plated at lower density (0.6–1.3 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish) at all time points tested than in cells plated at higher density (2.5–5 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish). To study the role of retinoid receptors in RA induction ofP450RAI, we compared expression in wild-type F9 cells with expression in several F9 derivatives in which various RARs, RXRs, or combinations of these receptor genes had been knocked out by homologous recombination. In wild-type F9 cells, a high level ofP450RAI expression was seen in cells continuously treated with 10−6m all-trans-RA for 24, 36, and 48 h (Fig. 3 A). There was little apparent difference between the induction profile of P450RAI mRNA in RARα−/− and in wild-type cells. In contrast, there were markedly decreased levels of P450RAI expression in RARγ−/− and RXRα−/− cell lines at all time points. In the RXRα−/−/RARγ−/− double knockout cell line, there was no detectable expression of P450RAI. Because of the effect of cell plating density on P450RAI expression (see above), we performed this experiment at several different plating densities, with similar results (data not shown). We note that those knockout cell lines that poorly differentiate into primitive endoderm following RA treatment (RARγ−/−, RXRα−/−, and RXRα−/−/RARγ−/−) are also the lines in which P450RAI message and RA metabolism were only weakly induced (19Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).2 Following a 48-h incubation period in RA, we analyzed the abilities of these different F9 cell lines to metabolize [3H]RA. Aqueous-soluble and lipid-soluble extracts were prepared from the media of cultured cells exposed to all-trans-[3H]RA for 4 h. Radioactivity recovered from aqueous- and lipid-soluble fractions of the cells pretreated with 1 μm RA or with DMSO vehicle alone averaged 81% of total radioactivity added. The aqueous-soluble counts shown in Fig. 3 B demonstrate that RA treatment of wild-type and RARα−/− cells resulted in a large increase in aqueous-soluble radioactivity compared with DMSO-treated control cells. RARγ−/− and RXRα−/− cell lines also showed an increase in aqueous-soluble radioactivity relative to untreated controls, but the counts were significantly lower than in wild-type and RARα−/− cells. RA treatment of RXRα−/−/RARγ−/− cells resulted in no increase in aqueous-soluble counts. Although 4-OH-RA, 18-OH-RA, and 4-oxo-RA were detectable with all of the F9 derivatives except for the RXRα−/−/RARγ−/− cell line (data not shown), the levels were much lower than those observed in P450RAI-transfected COS cells (Fig.2, A and C). This may reflect more efficient downstream processing of hydroxylated RA in F9 cells. The percentage of total recovered counts in the RA substrate peak after HPLC analysis was also determined for all cell lines. Fig. 3, A andC, shows that the RA recovered is inversely proportional to the level of P450RAI mRNA expression in all the cell lines tested. Thus, in both wild-type and mutant F9 cells, metabolic activity as measured both by generation of water-soluble products and by disappearance of substrate parallels expression of P450RAI mRNA. RNA from F9 cells was reverse transcribed, and P450RAI mRNA levels were measured by PCR analysis, to corroborate and extend the results obtained by Northern blot analysis and to study the effects of receptor-specific retinoids on P450RAI expression. Results similar to those observed in Northern blot analysis were obtained. The level of P450RAI message in RARγ−/− cell line was less than that observed in wild-type F9 (Fig.4 A and B, lanes 1–4 and 21–24). In RARα−/− cells,P450RAI was expressed at a higher level than in wild-type cells at all time points measured (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1–4 and 17–20); this was also seen, though not as clearly, with Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). The RT-PCR analysis included an additional cell line, RXRα−/−/RARα−/−, which also clearly exhibited a compromised response to RA as measured by the lower level of induction ofP450RAI compared with wild-type. This experiment also showed that 96 h after RA treatment of F9, P450RAI mRNA levels remained elevated. Because there was a high rate of metabolism in RA-induced F9 cells (Fig. 3 C), this suggested the possibility of RA-independent expression of P450RAI. To test this hypothesis, wild-type F9 cells were exposed to 1 μm RA for 24 h, followed by the removal of RA from the medium by washing (Fig. 5). The expression of P450RAI mRNA remained at"

JAK2 activation by GH is believed to facilitate initiation of various pathways including the Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase, STAT, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase systems. In the present study, we explore the biochemical and functional involvement of the Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2, in GH signaling. GH stimulation of murine NIH 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, cells that homologously express GHRs, resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. As assessed specifically by anti-SHP-2 coimmunoprecipitation and by affinity precipitation with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein incorporating the SH2 domains of SHP-2, GH induced formation of a complex of tyrosine phosphoproteins including SHP-2, GHR, JAK2, and a glycoprotein with properties consistent with being a SIRP-α-like molecule. A reciprocal binding assay using IM-9 cells as a source of SHP-1 and SHP-2 revealed specific association of SHP-2 (but not SHP-1) with a glutathione S-transferase fusion incorporating GHR cytoplasmic domain residues 485–620, but only if the fusion was first rendered tyrosine-phosphorylated. GH-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was also observed in murine 32D cells (which lack IRS-1 and -2) stably transfected with the GHR. Further, GH-dependent anti-SHP-2 coimmunoprecipitation of the Grb2 adapter protein was detected in both 3T3-F442A and 32D-rGHR cells, indicating that biochemical involvement of SHP-2 in GH signaling may not require IRS-1 or -2. Finally, GH-induced transactivation of a c-Fos enhancer-driven luciferase reporter in GHR- and JAK2-transfected COS-7 cells was significantly reduced when a catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant (but not wild-type SHP-2) was coexpressed; in contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive SHP-1 mutant allowed modestly enhanced GH-induced transactivation of the reporter in comparison with that found with expression of wild-type SHP-1.

In particular, the role(s) played by the SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, in modulating signaling have attracted attention. SHP-1 has been implicated as a negative regulator (signal attenuator) in various signaling systems, including the erythropoietin receptor (28Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is thought to be important in its ability to regulate receptor signaling.Herein we explore the potential roles of SHP-2 in GHR signaling. We observe in cell lines biochemical evidence of SHP-2 involvement in GH signaling, in the settings of both homologous and heterologous expression of the GHR. Further, by comparing wild-type SHP-2 and a catalytically inactive SHP-2 mutant, we uncover a positive effect of SHP-2 on GH-induced gene activation. Both the biochemical and functional aspects of the involvement of SHP-2 in GH signaling that we observe appear to be independent of IRS proteins.DISCUSSIONGH, like various other peptide hormones and cytokines, initiates transmembrane signaling by causing the activation of a complex of molecules, the nidus of which is the dimeric GHR itself. We now know some details of the physical and functional architecture of this array of GHR-associated molecules. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, JAK2, is a critical component of the GHR signaling complex; intact JAK2 enzymatic activity is required for GH signaling (9Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.R.

Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the stability of the complex may be affected by GH treatment (5Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Yang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), association of the GHR and JAK2 does not appear to require either JAK2 activation or GHR dimerization (6Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the major interaction between the GHR and JAK2 via the receptor's Box 1 region and region(s) in the amino-terminal one-half of JAK2 is non-phosphotyrosine-dependent (6Frank S.J. Gilliland G. Kraft A.S. Arnold C.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2228-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Frank S.J. Yi W. Zhao Y. Goldsmith J.R. Gilliland G. Jiang J. Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14776-14785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Other signaling molecules activated by GH appear to at least transiently form associations with the GHR-JAK2 complex. For example, we have observed a low basal degree of association of STAT3 and STAT5b with the GHR. In this case, the degree of association between STAT5b, in particular, and the receptor is markedly enhanced by JAK2-catalyzed GHR tyrosine phosphorylation (19Yi W. Kim S.-O. Jiang J. Park S.-H. Kraft A.S. Waxman D.J. Frank S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1425-1443PubMed Google Scholar), which apparently allows this STAT to itself become a better target for JAK2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation as a transcriptional activator. While less completely understood, the physical association of IRS molecules with the GHR-JAK2 complex has been speculated to be largely via JAK2 (26Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers Jr., M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Argetsinger L.S. Norstedt G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29415-29421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); the dependences for GH stimulation or for tyrosine phosphorylation of either JAK2 or of IRS-1 or -2 for their physical associations to occur are currently unknown.Our present data implicate another important signaling molecule, SHP-2, as a functional component of the GHR-JAK2-associated signaling complex. We observe both in 3T3-F442A cells homologously expressing the receptor and in 32D cells heterologously expressing the GHR an acute and pronounced GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2, the kinetics of which are consistent with being catalyzed by JAK2. One question that arises pertains to the nature of SHP-2's interaction with the GHR-JAK2 complex. Is SHP-2 directly physically interacting with either the GHR or JAK2, and if so, is the interaction(s) phosphotyrosine-dependent? While we do not yet have complete answers to these questions, several results favor the interactions being somewhat complicated and mixed. Previous detailed mapping studies in COS cells overexpressing JAK2 and SHP-2 indicated a specific non-phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction of the two molecules mediated by a region of SHP-2 C-terminal to the SH2 domains and the amino terminus of JAK2 (47Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Such data would favor the likelihood that SHP-2 might associate basally to some degree with the inactive GHR-JAK2 complex via this interaction with JAK2. 6A similar situation has been observed for SHP-1 and JAK2 in that a non-phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction of the N-terminal SH2 domain-containing region of that phosphatase with JAK2 has been mapped (56Jiao H. Berrada K. Yang W. Tabrizi M. Platanias L.C. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6985-6992Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar); indeed, our GST fusion binding data (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and 4) reflected this interaction in that a low level of non-GH- and non-phosphotyrosine-dependent association between GST/SHP-1-SH2 (but not GST/SHP-2-SH2) and JAK2 was observed.Our data indicate, however, that additional GH- and phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between SHP-2 and the GHR-JAK2 complex can occur via the SH2-containing region of SHP-2. We do not yet have definitive evidence as to whether this interaction is directly between SHP-2 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR or whether it is less direct and mediated by tyrosine-phosphorylated SIRP-α-like molecules or other molecules. We think it unlikely that significant GH-dependent direct interaction between SHP-2 and tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 occurs, given that the JAK2-SHP-2 mapping studies referred to above (47Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in which no GHR or other cytokine receptor was expressed, gave no evidence of a phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between the two molecules. Our finding that a GST fusion incorporating the tyrosine-phosphorylated C-terminal 40% of the GHR cytoplasmic domain (residues 485–620), but not an unphosphorylated version of the same fusion, specifically interacted with SHP-2 (and not SHP-1) from extracts of IM-9 cells argues that at least part of the SHP-2 interaction with the GHR-JAK2 complex may be mediated via the receptor's distal tail; further studies in which mutagenized receptors are reconstituted will be required to confirm and extend this finding.Although a relatively significant amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR was recovered in a GST/SHP-2-SH2 precipitate of GH-stimulated 3T3-F442A cells, we also note that much less was recovered in the anti-SHP-2 precipitate of the same extract and that this relative decrease was at the expense of the potential SIRP-α-like tyrosine-phosphorylated glycoprotein enriched in the immunoprecipitate. Similar findings were observed in 32D-rGHR cells with regard to the basally tyrosine-phosphorylated diffuse protein at roughly 115 kDa enriched in anti-SHP-2 precipitates. This 115-kDa protein may be similar to a glycoprotein (referred to as p135) recently described by Gu et al. (64Gu H. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16421-16430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in anti-SHP-2 precipitates of murine factor-dependent cells. In our work, this tyrosine phosphoprotein, by virtue of its significant basal tyrosine phosphorylation, can be differentiated from the GHR, which only became significantly tyrosine-phosphorylated in the 32D-rGHR cells in response to GH. It has been noted by others that SHP-2 in some systems may exhibit a higher affinity for SIRPα-like proteins than for receptors (such as tyrosine-phosphorylated epidermal growth factor or insulin receptors) whose function is influenced by SHP-2 (58Yamauchi K. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17716-17722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 69Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14871-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our finding that the tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR is more readily detected in GST-SHP-2-SH2 precipitates than in anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitates may reflect the relatively less stable SHP-2-GHR association in these cells in the presence of a more pronounced SHP-2-SIRPα-like protein association. Further studies with direct reacting antibodies that detect SIRP-α-like proteins and p135 may shed light on whether the complex of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coprecipitated with anti-SHP-2 from 3T3-F442A and 32D-rGHR cells might indeed include such molecules.While GH has been clearly shown to elicit IRS-1 and -2 tyrosine phosphorylation and consequent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (26Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers Jr., M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 27Argetsinger L.S. Norstedt G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29415-29421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), our results in 32D-rGHR cells indicate that IRS-1 and -2 are not necessary for GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 or its association with Grb2. Since at least transient inclusion of SHP-2 in a complex containing the GHR and JAK2 probably underlies SHP-2's ability to undergo this tyrosine phosphorylation, we also conclude that such a complex can form in the absence of IRS-1 and -2 proteins. We are currently investigating whether expression of these proteins, however, can affect the degree or stability of GHR-JAK2-SHP-2 complex(es).At a functional level, the results of our studies comparing expression of wild-type versus catalytically inactive SHP-2 in the context of cotransfection of the GHR and JAK2 indicate that intact SHP-2 catalytic activity contributes positively to GH-induced transcriptional activation of a c-fos enhancer-driven luciferase reporter gene. In these experiments, enhancement of this GH-induced signal by transfection of wild-type SHP-2 was variable; COS-7 cells have ample endogenous SHP-2, 7S. O. Kim, J. Jiang, W. Yi, G. S. Feng, and S. J. Frank, unpublished observations. which probably couples to the transfected GHR and JAK2. However, substitution of the CS SHP-2 for the wild-type SHP-2 in the transfection mix substantially reduced the GH-induced transactivation. A similar degree of inhibition of ligand-induced transactivation of a c-fos SRE-driven luciferase reporter was recently reported to occur with substitution of a catalytically inactive SHP-2 for wild-type SHP-2 in the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (a G protein-coupled receptor whose activation results in SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation) signaling system (70Yu Z. Ahmad S. Schwartz J.-L. Banville D. Shen S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7519-7524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent studies of prolactin receptor signaling have also implicated a positive role for SHP-2 in that catalytically inactive or SH2 domain mutant SHP-2 molecules also exhibited a roughly 50–65% decrease in prolactin-induced transactivation of a reporter driven, in that case, by the β-casein gene promoter (presumably at least partially dependent on STAT5 signaling) (38Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.-J. Vogel W. Dharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).We do not yet know the biochemical basis for the positive role for SHP-2 in GH signaling that we observe. Given that COS-7 cells do not have immunologically detectable IRS-1 or -2,7 this effect of SHP-2 does not appear to depend on either of those proteins. We do note that the enhancer driving our luciferase reporter contains both the c-fos SRE and SIE regions and might thus be affected by various GH-induced signaling intermediates, including members of the MAP kinase and STAT1/3 activation pathways. Indeed, expression of catalytically inactive SHP-2 has been shown to result in diminished insulin-induced MAP kinase activation (35Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21239-21243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We think it unlikely, based on published studies (47Yin T. Shen R. Feng G.-S. Yang Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1032-1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and our unpublished preliminary results, that JAK2 itself is a significant target for SHP-2 catalytic activity and that changes in overall JAK2 activation status underlie the defective signaling conferred by the catalytically inactive SHP-2. It is appealing to speculate, however, that the inclusion of SHP-2 in a physical complex with the GHR and JAK2 that we have observed herein may have a role in allowing its enzymatic activity to discretely influence signaling through the complex. Further studies that identify relevant targets of activated GHR-JAK2 complex-associated SHP-2 will undoubtedly help decipher the mechanism of its positive influence.

Recent developments have allowed significant understanding of the initiating steps in GH-induced signal transduction in various target cells and tissues. The GH receptor (GHR) is a single membrane-spanning glycoprotein in the hematopoietin receptor superfamily that has a ligand-binding external domain and a 350-residue cytoplasmic domain, which is required for GH signaling (2Leung D.W.

We describe here the characterization in vitro of a second interaction, involving the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of α1A and showing specificity for the β4 (and to a lesser extent β2a) isoform.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels have been classified into five groups, based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. L-type channels are ubiquitous, present particularly in skeletal and cardiac muscle, where they play an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling. T-type channels are important for cardiac pacemaker activity and the oscillatory activity of several thalamic neurons, while N- and P/Q-type channels are important in the control of neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and the role of R-type channels remains unclear. Two of these channels have been purified to homogeneity, the skeletal muscle L-type channel and the brain N-type channel (1Flockerzi V. Oeken H.-J. Hofmann F. Pelzer D. Cavalie A. Trautwein W. Nature. 1986; 323: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Sakamoto J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pragnell M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Science. 1993; 261: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although these channels differ dramatically in function, their subunit compositions are very similar, the core subunit composition of a high voltage-activated channel consisting of an α1 subunit, the ionic pore of the channel, and two auxiliary subunits, β and α2δ, that confer native biophysical and pharmacological properties to the channel. These subunits are encoded by at least six α1, four β, and one α2δ gene, for which numerous splice variants have been identified (3Snutch T.P. Reiner P.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The β subunit is a cytoplasmic protein of 52–78 kDa that, when coexpressed with the α1 subunit, results in an increase (of up to 100-fold) in current amplitude, alteration of both the kinetics and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and an apparent increase in recognition sites for channel-specific toxins (e.g. see Refs. 4Stea A.

Although β regulation seems to be highly conserved from β1 to β4 and on α1S to α1E, some important differences between these various isoforms have nevertheless been noted. The different β subunits produce consistently different channel inactivation behaviors, β3 producing fast inactivation, β2 slow channel inactivation, and β1 and β4 more intermediate behaviors (9Perez-Reyes E.

The β effect also appears to be α1 isoform-dependent; the β-induced shift in voltage dependence of inactivation has been reported for non-L-type channels, A, B, and E (4Stea A. Dubel S.J. Pragnell M.

Recent studies have identified complementary interaction domains on the α1 and β subunits (17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P.

AID 1The abbreviations used are: AID, α1 subunit interaction domain; BID, β subunit interaction domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: AID, α1 subunit interaction domain; BID, β subunit interaction domain; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(α1 subunit interactiondomain), a highly conserved region in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II, interacts with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with BID (β subunit interactiondomain), a 30-residue region in the second conserved domain of the β subunit (domain IV in Fig. 5 A). AID and BID appear to be essential for the subunit interaction and regulation by β subunits (17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Point mutations in AID and BID that disrupt this primary interaction also totally inhibit channel regulation by β, suggesting that it acts as an important anchoring site, due to its very high affinity (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest, however, that, despite its importance in channel regulation, the AID-BID attachment site does not account for all of the regulatory potential of the β subunit. The deletion approach used to identify the BID site revealed that it may not carry all the current stimulatory function of β, the change in inactivation kinetics (17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), nor the shift in voltage dependence of inactivation. 2M. De Waard, unpublished data.2M. De Waard, unpublished data.It is also interesting that BID represents only 30 residues in a region that shows 78% identity between β subunits over 200 residues and that, in addition, toward the amino-terminal of β there exists another highly conserved region (65% identity, over more than 100 residues) (17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence conservation is indicative of evolutionary constraint, suggesting that these regions are of functional importance. The remaining three less conserved domains (I, III, and V) undergo splicing and may also be functionally relevant to β-specific changes in inactivation as suggested by several studies (19Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Viewed together, the inability of BID to account for all of the functional effects of the β subunit and the high level of conservation elsewhere in the sequence lead to the hypothesis that there may exist secondary sites of interaction between the α1 and β subunits. Such sites would be dependent on the initial, highest affinity, essential interaction between AID and BID, and therefore need not be of high affinity themselves. The current work concerns the identification and characterization of interaction sites for the β subunit in the carboxyl-terminal domain of α1A, which is the largest of the cytoplasmic regions and shows considerable degeneracy of sequence homology between α1 subunit types and splice variants. We demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal sequence of β4 specifically interacts with this region of rabbit α1A (BI-2) and is required for a proper regulation of channel inactivation. Regions of the rabbit brain α1A cDNA (BI-2) (21Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) corresponding to residues 1889–2126, 2090–2424, 2275–2424, 2070–2275, 2070–2196, 2120–2196, and 2197–2275 were amplified by PCR, and, with the aid ofBamHI and EcoRI or XbaI restriction sites included in the primers, subcloned into these sites in pGEX2TK or pGEXKG (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The resulting recombinant plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The newly purified fusion proteins are referred to as, for example, GST-1889–2126A. GST alone and a GST fusion protein of the AID region of α1A (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) were prepared in the same way. β subunit cDNA clones used were rat β1b (L11453), rabbit heart β2a (X64297), rabbit heart β3 (M88751), and rat brain β4 (A45982). Truncated derivatives of β4 were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding regions of cDNA and subcloning into pCDNA3, usingHindIII and BamHI sites (added to the PCR primers), with the addition of a Kozak (22Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar) sequence and initiation codon (ACCATGG) or termination codon (TGA) as necessary. For construction of a chimera between β3 (1–360) and β4 (402–519), a two-step PCR approach was used with the following primers: β3, forward: 5′-ACGTAAGCTTACCATGGATGACGACTCGTAGGTGCCC-3′, reverse: 5′-GCTTGTGTGGGTGGCGCGCCAGTAAACCTCTAGGTA-3′; and β4, forward: 5′-GAGGTTTACTGGCGCGCCACCCACACAAGCAGTAGC-3′, reverse: 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAAAGCCTATGTCGGGAGTCATGGCTGCATCC-3′. The reverse primer for β3 and the forward primer for β4contain complementary sequences, allowing annealing of the two PCR products to give the template for the second round of amplification, using the β3 forward and β4 reverse primers. Restriction sites HindIII and BamHI were included in the external primers, allowing subcloning into pCDNA3. 35S-Labeled β subunits were synthesized in vitro using the TNTTM coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Nonincorporated [35S]methionine was removed by purification on a PD10 column (Pharmacia). Purified GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) by incubation for 30 min, before addition of the translation mixture (approximately 500 pmfinal concentration). Binding assays were carried out in a final volume of 200 μl, in Tris-buffered saline (0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), at 4 °C, for 6 h, unless otherwise stated. Beads were washed four times in binding buffer, and then analyzed either by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or by scintillation counting. A peptide corresponding to the AID site of α1A(RQQIERELNGYMEWISKAE from Genosys) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (154 mm NaCl, 40 mmNa2HPO4, 11.5 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 500 μm and added to binding reactions at 100 μm final concentration. Since addition of phosphate-buffered saline to the binding reactions introduced slight changes in binding affinity, an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline was added to control reactions. Stage V and VIXenopus oocytes were injected with BI-2-specific mRNA (400 ng/μl) in combination with β4-specific mRNA (100 ng/μl) or truncated β4ΔC mRNA (100 ng/μl). Cells were incubated for 3 days in defined nutrient oocyte medium as described previously (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Whole cell recordings were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C) using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp configuration of a GeneClamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The extracellular recording solution was of the following composition (in mm): Ba(OH)2 40, NaOH 50, KCl 3, HEPES 5, niflumic acid 1, pH 7.4 with methane sulfonic acid. Electrodes filled with 500 mm cesium acetate, 10 mm EGTA, 3 mm KCl, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, had resistances comprised between 0.5 and 2 megohms. The bath solution was clamped to a reference potential of 0 mV. Current records were filtered at 1 kHz, leak-subtracted on-line by a P/6 protocol, and sampled at 2–4 kHz. Data were analyzed using pCLAMP version 6.02 (Axon Instruments). All values are mean ± S.D. Purified GST fusion proteins carrying amino acids 1889–2126 (GST-1889–2126A) and 2090–2424 (GST-2090–2424A) of the α1A subunit carboxyl-terminal region were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads at a concentration of 5 μm and assayed for interaction with a35S-labeled in vitro translated rat β4 subunit (Fig. 1). GST-1889–2126A showed no significant binding, as seen for the control GST protein alone, while GST-2090–2424A showed a significant level of interaction, comparable to that seen for a 500 nm, saturating (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) concentration of a GST fusion protein carrying the AID region of α1A(GST-AIDA). Analysis of the binding of various concentrations of GST-2090–2424A to 35S-β4 (Fig.2 A) demonstrates that binding is saturable; specific binding appears at about 25 nm and saturates at 500 nm. Comparison of the saturation curve of GST-2090–2424A binding to β4 to the dose-response curve of GST-AIDA reveals a dissociation constant (K d) of 93 nm for GST-2090–2424A, which is an approximately 30-fold lower affinity compared with the GST-AIDA-β4interaction. Association kinetics (Fig. 2 B) are relatively slow compared with those previously seen for the AID-BID interaction (11De Waard M. Campbell K.P. J. Physiol. 1995; 485: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), with a half-time of association of approximately 120 min at 5 μm compared with 20 min at 500 nmGST-AIDA. We next tested whether the AID-BID interaction had any effect on the interaction between GST-2090–2424A and β4. In the presence of a 21-amino acid synthetic peptide containing the AID sequence of α1A, specific binding of β4 to GST-AIDA is diminished by over 90%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the peptide. The same peptide had no significant effect on the binding of GST-2090–2424A to β4 (Fig. 2 C), however, indicating that the BID region is not implicated in this interaction. The peptide did not modify the maximum binding of GST-2090–2424A, indicating that, at least in vitro, binding of AID to the β subunit does not induce conformational changes capable of favoring (or indeed disfavoring) this interaction. This was further investigated by analyzing the effects of AIDA peptide on the binding to β4 at various concentrations of GST-2090–2424A (Fig. 2 D). The data show that the peptide also had no significant effect on the affinity of β4 for GST-2090–2424A. To identify the region of the carboxyl-terminal domain that interacts with β4, we constructed a series of smaller GST fusion proteins encoding smaller fragments of this region (Fig.3 A) and compared their binding to 35S-labeled β4 (Fig. 3 B). Within the region from residue 2120 to the carboxyl terminus of the molecule, a whole series of subcloned fragments maintained an ability to interact with 35S-β4. Further investigations suggested, however, that these interactions occur with a weaker affinity than GST-2090–2424A. For example, we found a K d of 225 nm for GST-2070–2196A binding to β4 (data not shown), i.e. 2-fold lower. These data indicate that a series of “microsites” are responsible for the binding activity of the α1A carboxyl terminus, perhaps together forming a binding pocket, although dependence on overall conformation of the binding domain appears to be limited. This further contrasts with the β interaction to AID, which relies on only three crucial AID residues (14De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All four β subunit isoforms show a fairly similar affinity for AID. However, the functional effects of coexpression of these isoforms vary considerably and also depend on the α1 subunit tested. Functional differences among β subunits may be a reflection of the differing capacities of β isoforms to form secondary interactions with the α1 subunit concerned. We therefore tested whether the interaction observed between β4 and GST-2090–2424A also existed for other β subunits translated in vitro. Fig. 4shows a comparison of binding of 35S-β subunits to three different concentrations of GST-2090–2424A, to GST alone, and to a GST fusion protein expressing AIDA, at a concentration expected to yield maximal binding. β4interacts with GST-2090–2424A with a high affinity, showing maximal binding at 1 μm fusion protein concentration. β2a binds with a much lower affinity, showing only limited binding at 10 μm fusion protein concentration, while binding of β3 and β1bis insignificant even at this concentration of fusion protein. The differences in interaction affinity observed for different β subunits and the fact that the main regions of sequence divergence among β subunits are the carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions (Fig.5 A) suggested that one of these regions was responsible for the interaction. We investigated this possibility (Fig. 5 B) by deleting either or both regions from the β4 cDNA. We assayed the capacity of the resulting in vitro translated proteins to bind to two fusion proteins, GST-2070–2275A and GST-2275–2424A, which represent approximately the two halves of the region of α1A under investigation (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of the amino-terminal 48 amino acids of β4 had no effect on the binding of GST-2070–2275A and GST-2275–2424A. In contrast, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 109 amino acids of β4 drastically interferes with its capacity to interact with either fusion proteins. Residual weak binding of both fusion proteins seemed to be present. To check whether this residual binding was due to the amino terminus, we tested the binding of these fusion proteins to the double mutant β4ΔN,C. The results show that there was no difference between β4ΔC and β4ΔN,C, confirming the absence of a binding function for the amino terminus. The importance of the carboxyl-terminal region was confirmed by constructing a chimera in which the carboxyl-terminal region of β3 was replaced by the corresponding region of β4 (Fig. 5 B). The inability of β3 to interact with either α1A fusion protein was successfully “rescued” by replacement of this region, resulting in a binding capacity approaching that of the full-length β4 subunit. Interestingly, the results obtained with the full-length, truncated, and chimera β4 were very similar for the two fusion proteins assayed. This further suggests that the carboxyl terminus of α1A forms a single binding site and not several sites that would interact independently with diverse regions of β4. Since deletion of carboxyl-terminal sequences of the α1Cchannel induces important modifications in channel gating and opening probability, we determined the functional importance of this α1A-β4 interaction by expression inXenopus oocytes. Comparison of the effects of the full-length β4 and β4ΔC revealed that the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit had little influence on the biophysical properties of the α1A channel with the exception of a role in the control of inactivation kinetics (Fig.6 A). There were no noticeable differences in current amplitude between α1Aβ4 and α1Aβ4ΔC-injected cells with average peak amplitudes of 898 ± 686 nA (n = 5) and 626 ± 413 nA (n = 6), respectively. In addition, no differences were detected in activation parameters with half-activation potentials of 1.5 ± 5.5 and 3.2 ± 3.5 mV, and slope values of 4.9 ± 1 and 5.2 ± 0.9 mV for α1Aβ4 and α1Aβ4ΔC-injected cells, respectively. We also found no statistical difference in the voltage dependence of inactivation with half-inactivation potentials of −24.6 ± 5.8 mV (n = 5, α1Aβ4) and −28.1 ± 4.7 mV (n = 6, α1Aβ4ΔC). Interestingly, there was a small but significant change in the rate of inactivation kinetics produced by the β4 carboxyl-terminal deletion. Cells injected with α1Aβ4 cRNAs inactivated rapidly after depolarization. The decay in current represents the sum of three components at all voltages (Fig. 6 B), two of which are exponential, a fast decaying current with an average time constant of 51 ± 5 ms (25.7 ± 2.9% of total current at 20 mV), and a slow inactivating component with a time constant of 241 ± 30 ms (69.7 ± 6% at 20 mV) and a noninactivating current (4.5 ± 4.3%). The truncated β4ΔC increased the overall rate of inactivation by two essential modifications: (i) a decrease in the fast time constant to 43 ± 4.7 ms at 20 mV instead of 51 ms (Fig.6 C) and (ii) a change in the ratio between fast and slow inactivating components from 25.7 to 36 ± 5% (fast) and from 69.7 to 60.7 ± 4.2% (slow) (Fig. 6 D). Although these effects were small, they were statistically significant and contributed to the overall average increase in channel inactivation as described in Fig. 6 E. These results suggest that the carboxyl terminus of β4 may actually contribute to a slowing in inactivation kinetics upon association to the carboxyl terminus of α1A. We describe here the identification of a new interaction site between the α1A calcium channel subunit and the β4 subunit. The interaction is of low affinity compared with that between the AID site on the I-II cytoplasmic loop of α1 subunits and the BID site of β subunits. This and the fact that mutations in AID or BID disrupt the interaction between the two subunits in expression experiments (17De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 18Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) suggest that such an interaction would be of a secondary nature, dependent on formation of the initial AID-BID interaction to bring the interaction sites into close proximity, or to introduce conformational constraints that favor the interaction. The alternative possibility, that two β subunits would be associated to a single α1 (e.g. as proposed by Tareilus et al. (20Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)), seems unlikely for several reasons. First, the molar ratio between α1 and β subunits is 1:1 in purified channels (2Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Sakamoto J. Franzini-Armstrong C. Pragnell M. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Science. 1993; 261: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 23Jay S.D. Sharp A.H. Kahl S.D. Vedvick T.S. Harpold M.M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3287-3293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, studies of the AID-BID interaction revealed that β subunits with affinities lower than 100 nm for AID do not associate with α1 upon coexpression in oocytes (14De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), although, of course, it cannot be ruled out that in native conformation the affinity between the two carboxyl-terminal sequences is higher than that predicted from in vitro experience. Third, and most important, expression of β subunits containing disruptive BID mutations fail to modify channel properties, ruling out additional interactions in these conditions. The carboxyl-terminal tails of α1 subunits play various roles in channel function. In the α1C subunit, deletion of the distal regions of the carboxyl terminus results in increased channel opening probability (24Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the more proximal EF-hand domain plays a role in Ca2+-induced inactivation (25De Leon M. Wang Y. Jones L. Perez-Reyes E. Wei X. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Yue D.T. Science. 1995; 270: 1502-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal tail is also known to undergo post-translational modifications in the form of phosphorylation and proteolysis, in some cases essential to channel function (26Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Breeze L.J. Wang K.K. Chavkin C. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there are many phoshorylation sites present in both the α1Acarboxyl-terminal and β4 carboxyl-terminal sequence that may be of functional relevance. In β4 several of these phosphorylation sites are unique to this subunit. These data point to the functional importance of this region in channel regulation and may also provide the key to the main function of the subunit interaction site we describe here. We show that, at least in vitro, β4 shows a much greater affinity for the carboxyl-terminal region of α1A than does β2a, while no interaction is detected for β1b or β3. These differences in affinity suggest a functional significance that may help to explain the differences in functional effects seen for different combinations of α1 and β subunits. In light of this, it is interesting that β4 is coexpressed in the same brain regions as is α1A, particularly in the cerebellum (21Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar,27Ludwig A. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is the major β subunit associated with the α1Asubunit in the P/Q channel-type (16Liu H.Y. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13804-13810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A similar interaction has recently been reported between an α1E splice variant and β2a (20Tareilus E. Roux M. Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether this interaction also displays a specificity for a particular subset of β subunits. The advantage of a form of subunit specificity in the α1-β association remains largely to be investigated. Our data suggest that a secondary interaction site that favors β4 association to BI-2 rather than β3, the other predominant β in brain (28Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), could be determinant in underlying subtle kinetic differences induced by the various β subunits. Besides obvious functional differences, specific α1-β associations may be determinant in various aspects of channel biosynthesis such as channel targeting. Brice et al. (29Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and Chien et al. (30Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) have indeed demonstrated that β subunits are crucial to cell surface localization of α1. Alternatively, it is possible that the carboxyl-terminal sequences of both subunits contribute to the process of channel clustering known to occur in voltage-dependent calcium channels, with the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the β subunit interacting with the carboxyl terminus of an α1 subunit other than the one that it is attached to via its BID site. Channel clustering is known to occur in various ion channels and has best been characterized for the shaker K+ channel for which clustering is produced by the PSD-95 proteins (31Hsueh Y. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Calcium channel clustering is probably induced by a third party protein because the carboxyl-terminal interaction described herein may be of insufficient affinity to be the primary cause of such a clustering behavior. Besides the existence of separate genes encoding Ca2+channel subunits, alternative splicing is another process by which diversity can be introduced. The functional significance of alternative splicing in Ca2+ channel subunits is still largely unknown. Splicing can occur in several regions of the α1 protein, including the amino terminus (32Marubio L.M. Roenfeld M. Dasgupta S. Miller R.J. Philipson L.H. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar), the IS6 transmembrane sequence, the cytoplasmic linkers between domain I and II and between domain II and III (32Marubio L.M. Roenfeld M. Dasgupta S. Miller R.J. Philipson L.H. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 243-251PubMed Google Scholar), transmembrane segment IVS3, and the carboxyl-terminal sequences (21Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 33Hofmann F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Particularly pertinent to the data presented here is the existence of two splice alternatives in α1Adescribed by Mori et al. (21Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) that result in an almost total divergence of sequence from residue 2230 onward, i.e.concerning the majority of the sequence responsible for the interaction studied here. It is therefore likely that the carboxyl terminus of the other α1A splice variant, BI-1, may not interact with β4. Generally, it remains to be seen whether the splicing occurring in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the α1 subunit plays a role in the specificity of the secondary α1-β interaction. Two case scenarios can be discussed. The first is that any deletion or insertion may modify the regulatory input of the associated β subunit at that location without modifying the type of β subunit associated. The second possibility is that splicing modifies the α1-β interaction specificity and that it favors the association of another type of β subunit, presumably to specify a different membrane targeting of the channel. In the case of α1A, it would be interesting to see whether the carboxyl terminus of BI-1 interacts with β3, the other predominant β subunit known to interact with α1A in the brain (16Liu H.Y.

Our data also shed new light on data obtained by other groups that report a lack of impact of α1 carboxyl-terminal alternative splicing on β subunit regulation (for instance in α1C (34Klockner U. Mikala G. Eisfeld J. Iles D.E. Strobeck M. Mershon J.L. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1372-H1381Google Scholar), but see Soldatov et al. (35Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) and suggest that negative data may well be due to the use of an inappropriate combination of α1 and β subunits. It is becoming increasingly obvious that a wide range of neurological and motor diseases result from mutations in the α1 or β subunits, and a number of these are particularly relevant to the data we have presented here. In mice, the leaner phenotype, similar to absence epilepsy, has been attributed to a mutation in a splice donor consensus sequence of α1A, resulting in aberrant splicing and therefore degeneration of the coding sequence corresponding to either residue 2026 or 2072 onward of the protein we have used (36Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Hawkes R. Frankel W.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar),i.e. corresponding well to the region identified as interacting with β4. In humans, a severe form of ataxia has been shown to be associated with a 5-base pair insertion close to the stop codon that extends the translated sequence to include a glutamine repeat of variable size (37Zhuchenko O. Bailey J. Bonnen P. Ashizawa T. Stockton D.W. Amos C. Dobyns W.B. Subramony S.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Lee C.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar), which would presumably entail conformational changes to this region. Concerning the β4subunit, its overall functional importance has been shown by the assignment of a lethargic phenotype in mice to a deletion of about 60% of the protein (38Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), although such a drastic alteration is likely to completely inactivate the β4 subunit and at least leads to the loss of the BID in addition to the carboxyl-terminal site. Finally, the data obtained here contribute to our understanding of the general organization of high voltage-activated calcium channels. The existence of several sites of interaction between the two channel components highlights the utility of an in vitro approach using fusion proteins, since it enables us to study such interactions individually and therefore to assess their functional impact and to gradually dissect the conformational basis of the relationship between the two subunits. It is not always possible, however, to extrapolate directly between the situation in vitro and that in vivo. For example, our inability to demonstrate an effect of AID-β association on the affinity of the interaction between the carboxyl termini of α1A and β4 probably reflects the absence of the remainder of the α1A molecule and therefore a loss of integrity of the conformational constraints existing in native channels which may determine the overall manner in which the two subunits interact.

https://openalex.org/W2320359800,"Rho proteins have been implicated in the regulation of multiple signal transduction processes. Some of the members of this family, including the rho gene from Aplysia californica and the human genes (rhoA, rhoB and rac-1), are proto-oncogenes since when properly mutated they can induce cell transformation, and the generated rho-transformed cells are tumorigenic when inoculated into mice. In addition to their tumorigenic activity, there is evidence suggesting that Rho proteins may contribute to the metastatic phenotype. However, all the experiments implicating Rho proteins or Rho-regulating proteins in the induction of metastatic potential are either indirect or have been performed in vitro. In this study we investigated whether cells transformed by rho oncogenes do have metastatic potential in vivo. We present evidence that cells transformed by the Aplysia californica rho gene, when injected directly into the blood stream are able to efficiently colonize lungs and secondary organs, consistent with the acquisition of the metastatic potential. Moreover, tumors derived from subcutaneous injections of these rho-transformed cells are also able to metastasize in distant organs, a strong support to the hypothesis that Rho proteins play a role in the metastatic phenotype. Finally, cells transformed by the human oncogenes dbl, vav and ost, three well-known guanine exchange factors for members of the Rho family, or cells transformed by the activated human rac-1 or rhoA genes do also have metastatic potential when injected into the blood stream. These results demonstrate that signaling pathways regulated by Rho proteins play an important role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in vivo."

It catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (see Fig. 1). TIM has been the subject of extensive biophysical, enzymological, and computational studies. Its catalytic properties and mechanism have been studied in detail (1Knowles J.R.

It has been established that TIM is a very efficient catalyst, since the reaction rates are diffusion-controlled. Neither cofactors nor metal ions are required in this reaction, and there is no evidence of allostery or cooperativity among the subunits. Structurally TIMs do form a well characterized family.

Jaenicke, and R. K. Wierenga, manuscript in preparation. This manuscript will compare all 10 TIM structures and focus on potentially thermostabilizing features. Also, 45 amino acid TIM sequences from a wide variety of organisms have been determined and are available in the data bases. Each TIM monomer has a globular shape with two protruding loops. The globular part is formed by an 8-fold repeat of a β-strand, loop, α-helix, loop motif. The βα units fold up in a regular way, such that the β-strands (numbered β1 to β8) form an eight-stranded β-barrel surrounded by the eight α-helices (numbered α1 to α8) on the outside. This folding motif is also referred to as the TIM barrel motif. In TIM, the two protruding loops are after β-strand three and after β-strand six. The TIM barrel structural motif is found for a large number of other enzymes with widely different functions (10Reardon D. Farber G.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) that have little or no sequence homology. As such this stable framework with tolerant sequence variations has already been used as an interesting scaffold to design loops (11Borchert T.V. Abagyan R.A. Radha Kishan K.V. Zeelen J.Ph. Wierenga R. Structure. 1993; 1: 205-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Thanki N. Zeelen J.Ph. Mathieu M. Jaenicke R. Abagyan R.A. Wierenga R.K. Schliebs W. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and even artificial proteins (13Goraj K. Renard A. Martial J.A. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Tanaka T. Kimura H. Hayashi M. Fujiyoshi Y. Fukuhara K. Nakamura H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The active sites of all these TIM barrel enzymes are located at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel, with catalytic residues contributed by the β-strands and the loops connecting the β-strands to subsequent α-helices numbered loop 1 to loop 8 in correspondence with the numbering of the preceding β-strands. The loops preceding the β-strands are located on the other side of the barrel and are believed to be important for the stability of the TIM barrel (15Urfer R. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the TIM dimer, the dimer interface is formed mainly by loops 1, 2, 3, and 4. The protruding loop 3 of one subunit docks into a deep pocket between loop 1 and loop 4 of the other subunit (16Schliebs W. Thanki N. Eritja R. Wierenga R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The catalytic residues, a lysine, a histidine, and a glutamate are located in loop 1, loop 4, and loop 6, respectively. Binding of substrate or substrate analogues is accompanied by changes in conformation of loops 5, 6, and 7. The most remarkable change occurs in loop 6, “the flexible loop,” the tip of which undergoes a Cα movement of some 7 Å in response to ligand binding (17Wierenga R.K. Noble M.E.M. Postma J.P.M. Groendijk H. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Opperdoes F.R. Proteins. 1991; 10: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Joseph D. Petsko G.A. Karplus M. Science. 1990; 249: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As such, the active site is closed off from solvent to prevent an unwanted phosphate elimination reaction that may otherwise occur (1Knowles J.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This state is called “the closed state” in contrast to the unliganded “open state.” In the liganded form the oxygen atoms of the phosphate interact with main chain atoms of loops 6, 7, and 8. Loop 8 is called the phosphate binding loop, because it comprises a 3/10 helix (the phosphate binding helix) whose N terminus points directly to the phosphate moiety, allowing for hydrogen bonds between main chain NH groups and phosphate oxygen atoms. These interactions keep the phosphate moiety rigidly in place, whereas in the triose part of the ligand molecule, the catalytic conversion takes place. The glutamate at the beginning of loop 6 is implicated in the transfer of a proton between the two substrate C atoms. The side chain of this glutamate can occupy two different positions, depending on the contents of the active site. In ligand-free TIM, it is found in a “swung out” conformation, whereas in liganded TIM, it occupies a “swung in” conformation, ideal for carrying out catalysis (19Noble M.E.M. Zeelen J.Ph. Wierenga R.K. Proteins. 1993; 16: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper, we focus on the TIM enzyme from the psychrophilic bacterium Vibrio marinus. We will refer to the sequence numbering of V. marinus TIM (vTIM); according to this numbering, the catalytic residues are Lys-11, His-92, and Glu-169 (see Fig. 2). V. marinus is a member of the Vibrionaceae family, able to grow at 4 °C and having an optimal growth temperature of about 15 °C (20Morita R.Y. Bacteriol. Rev. 1975; 39: 144-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned the gene encoding TIM. Recombinant vTIM was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. The kinetic properties as well as the stability of the enzyme were determined. Two structures of this enzyme, one complexed with sulfate and one with the substrate analogue 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) (Fig.1), were solved by x-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.7 Å. Because the sequence of vTIM is most closely related to that of E. coli TIM (eTIM) (66% identity) (see Fig. 2), the latter enzyme will be used as a reference for comparison throughout this paper. Furthermore, sequence comparison of the vTIM sequence with all other known TIM sequences reveals that vTIM has a unique residue in the phosphate binding helix, where the otherwise completely conserved Ser-238 is replaced by an alanine. The implications of this unique sequence feature are discussed by comparing the stability and the kinetic parameters from the native vTIM with its A238S mutant. It turns out that this point mutation decreases the physiological efficiency at 10 °C and it increases the thermal stability, as evidenced by calorimetric studies. V. marinus strain ATCC15382 was obtained from the Laboratorium voor Microbiologie, Universiteit Gent and grown at 15 °C in a medium containing 5 g/liter peptone, 2 g/liter yeast extract, and 25 g/liter marine salt (pH 7.3). E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (hsd S gal cIts 857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV-T7, gene 1) were used for overproduction of the recombinant vTIM. E. coli Sure (Stratagene) (hsd R, mcr A, mcr B, mrr F', pro AB, lacIq, Z M15, Tn10(tetr ); Stratagene) and E. coli HB101 (SupE44 hsd S20 rB- mB recA13ara-14 pro A2 lacY1 gal K2rpsL20xyl-5mtl-l) were used for DNA cloning. The vector used to overexpress the vTIM gene was a derivative of plasmid pT7CTBR (21L'Hoir C. Renard A. Martial J.A. Gene. 1990; 89: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A fragment of the vTIM gene was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using primers corresponding to conserved regions of the molecule (22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned,32P-labeled, and used to screen a V. marinusgenomic library constructed by partially digesting the chromosomal DNA with XbaI and ligating the fragments to XbaI-cut and dephosphorylated pUC13. A 2,100-bp XbaI fragment ofV. marinus DNA cloned in pUC13 gave a strong hybridization signal with the specific 500-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment used as a probe. DNA sequencing revealed that this 2,100-bp fragment contains the entire TIM gene. The vTIM gene cloned in pUC13 was digested with Sau3AI and PstI. This fragment (about 780 bp) contained the entire TIM gene except for its first 20 codons. These first 20 codons were synthesized chemically with an NdeI restriction site adjacent to the initiation ATG codon and a Sau3AI protruding end at the opposite site. The resulting oligonucleotide and its complementary strand were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated to the Sau3AI-PstI 780-bp TIM gene fragment as well as to the pT7CTBR plasmid cut withNdeI and PstI. The ligation products were used to transform E. coli HB101 cells. The correct recombinant plasmid, called pT7-Vib, was used to direct expression of vTIM. To construct the gene encoding the A238S mutant of vTIM, site-directed mutagenesis was performed directly on the pT7-Vib vector using the Chameleon kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the mutated oligonucleotide was as follows (5′-3′ noncoding strand; mutated codon underlined): 5′-CTTTTCGCGTCAAGAGATGCGCCGCC-3′ (Eurogentec, Belgium). Expression of the TIM gene was performed using the T7 system (23Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the pT7-Vib recombinant vector were grown for 16 h at 37 °C in L-broth medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was unnecessary for the production of vTIM and its mutant. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min, 4,500 × g) and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. After lysis in a high pressure cell disruption system (Inceltech), the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (45 min, 10,000 × g), and the supernatant containing the soluble TIM was recovered. TIM was partially purified by stepwise ammonium sulfate precipitation. Monitoring was performed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide). TIM precipitated between 60 and 90% saturation. The TIM-containing precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) and dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA. The sample was dialyzed against 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.6) overnight at 4 °C. The sample was then concentrated by ultrafiltration with Centricon-10 (Amicon Corp.) and applied onto a Mono Q ion-exchange column (HR 10/10, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.6). TIM was eluted with a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl, and the fractions containing TIM were pooled and concentrated with Amicon YM-10 membranes (Amicon). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin as the standard. An average of 80 mg of TIM was obtained/liter of bacterial culture. eTIM was produced and purified as described previously (6Noble M.E.M. Zeelen J.Ph. Wierenga R.K Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 403-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TIM activity was determined by a coupled enzyme assay based on the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm due to oxidation of NADH, according to Misset and Opperdoes (25Misset O. Opperdoes F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The assay was monitored with a thermostated Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer (Kontron). The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 0.24 mmNADH (Boehringer Mannheim, Gmbh) and 20 μg/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Boehringer Mannheim, Gmbh) in 100 mmtriethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.6). To initiate the reaction, 2.5 ng of vTIM or 4 ng of its A238S mutant were added to each sample. The enzymatic assay was performed by adding varied concentrations of the substrated-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Sigma) (0.13–9.75 mm) to the enzyme system (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/NADH) and consecutively measuring the residual activity. Kinetic parameters were determined with the Enzfitter program (26Leatherbarrow R.J. ENZFITTER: A nonlinear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC/P52. Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, UK1987Google Scholar).K i was measured with 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) as the inhibitor (27Wolfenden R. Nature. 1969; 233: 704-705Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For the stability assays, samples containing 100 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.6) and TIM were incubated at various temperatures (5–25 °C) in a thermocycler (Programmable TRIO-thermoblock TB-1, Biometra BAU) for 10–60 min. The remaining activity was measured as a function of incubation time. From these measurements an inactivation rate constant,k inact(sec−1), was calculated according to Rentier-Delrue et al. (22Rentier-Delrue F. Mande S.C. Moyens S. Terpstra P. Mainfroid V. Goraj K. Hol W.G.J. Martial J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thermal unfolding of TIM was studied using a microcal scanning calorimeter differential scanning calorimetric unit (MicroCal, Inc.). Protein samples of 1.3 mg/ml in triethanolamine-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) were used. Samples were heated from 15 to 60 °C, and the scan rate was 1 °C/min. Crystals were grown at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The protein solutions used in the crystallization setups contained 10 mg/ml protein in 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaN3. For the vTIM(sulfate) crystallization, 100 mm ammonium sulfate was added, and for the vTIM(2PG) crystallization, 20 mm 2PG was added. The crystallization conditions were found using the “Fast Screen” crystallization protocol (28Zeelen J.Ph. Hiltunen J.K. Ceska T.A. Wierenga R.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 443-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are summarized in TableI. Crystals of a size up to 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.5 mm3 grew within a week, and one of each was used for data collection. Data were collected at 25 °C on a BigMar image plate detector mounted on an Enraf Nonius rotating anode FR571. Data collection was set up to provide a 2.7-Å data set of the vTIM(2PG) crystal and a 2.65-Å data set of the vTIM(sulfate) crystal. The data were processed with DENZO (29Otwinowski Z. DENZO: An Oscillation Data Processing Program for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The crystal lattice for both growth conditions is primitive monoclinic. The β-angle for both data sets is about 91° and the a and c cell dimensions are very similar (89.7 and 89.5 Å), agreeing closely with tetragonal symmetry. Indeed at low resolution the data could be merged in space group P4, but for the higher resolution shells this results in an R-merge above 40%. The systematic absences of the 0k0 reflections indicated space group P21.

Open table in a new tab The molecular replacement calculations were done with the vTIM(sulfate) data set. To find the orientation of the TIM dimers in the unit cell, molecular replacement was performed with the program AMORE (30Navazza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of the eTIM dimer (1TRE; Ref. 6Noble M.E.M. Zeelen J.Ph. Wierenga R.K Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 403-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the search model. The flexible loop (residues 169–180) known to be variable in conformation was deleted in both monomers. The rotation function showed eight unique solutions, as expected for four dimers per asymmetric unit. A translation function was calculated for each of the eight rotation peaks. The best translation function solution was used to find the position of the second dimer. This procedure was repeated until the positions of all four dimers were found. The R-factor for data between 15 and 3.5 Å for this complete solution was 49.1%, which dropped to 45.7% after rigid body refinement. The correctness of the solution was confirmed by the good packing of the four dimers and the quality of the fit of the omitted loop in the electron density map. First the structure of the vTIM(sulfate) complex was refined. The sequence of the molecular replacement model was mutated from that of eTIM to that of vTIM in both monomers. The model was optimized to improve its fit in a 2Fo-Fc SIGMA A weighted map (CCP4; Ref. 31Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 (CCP4) Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) using O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) running on an Evans and Sutherland workstation. For refinement, a subset of 5% of the data (the test set) was used for R-free calculations. Refinement was pursued with a mixture of simulated annealing x-ray refinement and conventional positional and thermal factor refinement using the X-PLOR package (33Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System For X-ray Crystallography and NMR,Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) for all refinement calculations. The positions and the thermal B-factors of the atoms of both monomers in the dimer were refined independently. The atom positions of the three other dimers were generated by strict noncrystallographic symmetry operators, recalculated at several stages of the refinement by rigid body refinement. Electron density maps indicated an open conformation for loop 6, which was manually rebuilt into the density. In addition, a sulfate ion was found in the active site of the first subunit. Its coordinates were included in the model. In the final stages of the refinement, water molecules were added at sites, displaying a peak larger than 3 S.D. above the mean in an Fo-Fc map and having a potential hydrogen bonding partner. In total, 44 water molecules were added per dimer. The final R-factor was 20.3% and R-free was 22.0% to a resolution of 2.65 Å (Table I). Subsequently this structure was used for the rigid body refinement against the vTIM(2PG) data set. Electron density maps showed clear density for the closed loop 6 and the 2PG bound in the active site of both subunits. A similar protocol as for the native structure refinement was used, loop 6 was rebuilt, the inhibitor 2PG was built into the active site of both subunits, and 77 waters per dimer were added. It resulted in a final R-factor of 19.2% (R-free is 21.5%) for this vTIM(2PG) structure. The refinement statistics are given in TableI. The quality of the structures was analyzed using the programs PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHAT IF (35Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). For the purpose of analysis, TIM structures were superimposed on the basis of the 129 Cα positions forming the eight α-helices and eight β-strands using the lsq option in O. Cavities were calculated with the program MSP (36Conolly M.L. J. Am. Chem.

The corresponding protein was expressed inE. coli. The thermostability of this recombinant TIM was assessed by measuring the inactivation rate constant (k inact) at various temperatures (Fig.3). At 25 °C the value recorded was 1 × 10−3 sec−1. The calculated half-life (t 1/2) was 10 min at this temperature, showing the intrinsic psychrophilic character of this TIM. Because of its psychrophilic properties, we choose to measure its kinetic parameters at 10 °C; at this temperature t 1/2is 58 min.

https://openalex.org/W2043503095,"Pyk2 is a recently described cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is related to focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and can be activated by a variety of stimuli that elevate intracellular calcium. In this report, we showed that Pyk2 and FAK tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated differentially by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and soluble factors both in rat aortic smooth muscle cells, which express endogenous Pyk2 and FAK, and in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. We also found that Pyk2 is diffusely present throughout the cytoplasm, while FAK is localized in focal contacts as expected, suggesting that the different localization may account for their differential regulation. By analyzing a chimeric protein contain N-terminal and kinase domains of Pyk2 and C-terminal domain of FAK, we provided evidence that the distinctive C-terminal domains of Pyk2 and FAK were responsible for their differential regulation by integrins and soluble stimuli as well as their subcellular localization. Finally, we correlated FAK, Pyk2, and the chimeric protein binding to talin, but not paxillin, with their regulation by integrins and focal contact localization. These results demonstrate that the distinctive C-terminal domain of Pyk2 and FAK confer their differential regulation by different subcellular localization and association with the cytoskeletal protein talin.

Recent studies have shown that Pyk2 is involved in calcium-induced regulation of ion channel and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar), stress-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (5Tokiwa G. Dikic I.

Lev S. Courtneidge S. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Although these studies indicate that Pyk2 is involved in several signal transduction pathways, many questions concerning the regulation and function of Pyk2, especially the role of Pyk2 in cell adhesion, remain unanswered. Pyk2 and FAK share a similar structural organization with a tyrosine kinase domain flanked by non-catalytic domains at both the N and C termini. These two kinases are approximately 60% identical in the central catalytic domain and share approximately 40% identity in both the N- and C-terminal domains (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P.

Because of the high sequence homology and similar overall organization between Pyk2 and FAK, it is especially interesting to compare the regulation of Pyk2 with that of FAK, in particular their responses to integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Several recent reports have presented somewhat conflicting data regarding regulation of Pyk2 by integrin-mediated cell adhesion in different cell types. It has been reported that Pyk2 displays an integrin-dependent phosphorylation and is localized in focal contacts in B lymphocytes, megakaryocytes, and transfected COS cells (7Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); however, in transfected 3Y1 cells, Pyk2 phosphorylation is not increased upon plating on fibronectin (FN) and Pyk2 has been shown to localize in intercellular junctions (2Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In addition, Siciliano et al. (9Siciliano J.C. Toutant M. Derkinderen P. Sasaki T. Girault J.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28942-28946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) reported that, in rat hippocampal slices and cortical synaptosomes, Pyk2 and FAK are regulated differentially by pathways involving calcium and protein kinase C. To determine whether induction of Pyk2 phosphorylation by integrins is as effective as that by soluble factors and how it compares with FAK phosphorylation in cell adhesion in the same cells, we investigated regulation of Pyk2 and FAK in rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells, which express both kinases. Using a CHO cell transfection system, we also analyzed regulation of Pyk2, FAK, or a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal and kinase domains of Pyk2 fused to the C-terminal domain of FAK. Our results demonstrated that Pyk2 and FAK were regulated differentially in both RASM cells and transfected CHO cells and that the distinctive C-terminal domains are responsible for the differential regulation by directing different subcellular localization and association with the cytoskeletal protein talin. Antiserum against human Pyk2 was prepared in rabbits using a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 250 residues (GST-Pyk2.C). Anti-Pyk2 antibodies were then affinity-purified from the antiserum using GST-Pyk2.C immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose as an affinity matrix, as described previously (10Devor B.B. Zhang X.

Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 and mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin and anti-talin antibodies, rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, normal goat serum, Protein A-Sepharose 4B, calcium ionophore A23187, angiotensin II, sorbitol, and poly-l-lysine (PLL) were purchased from Sigma. Human plasma FN was from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant PDGF-BB was obtained from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). RASM cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc), 10 μg/ml penicillin, and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin. Confluent cells were incubated overnight in DMEM with 0.2% FBS and then subjected to different treatments as described. In some experiments, prior to sorbitol addition, serum-starved cells were plated onto dishes that had been coated with 10 μg/ml FN or 50 μg/ml PLL and blocked with 2 mg/ml heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin, as described previously (13Guan J.-L. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 951-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of CHO cells were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. pKH3-FAK has been described previously (14Chen H.-C.

The full-length human Pyk2 cDNA was isolated from a placenta cDNA library by polymerase chain reaction based on an EST clone generously provided by Dr. Y. Li of HGS, Inc. 2Z. Xing, C. Zheng, Z. C. Bian, L. Warner, and J. L. Guan, unpublished results. Sequence analysis showed that our clone is identical with the published Pyk2 sequence, except for the presence of threonine rather than alanine at position 612. It was then cloned into the EcoRI site of the pKH3 vector with the N terminus fused in frame to the triple HA tag to generate plasmid pKH3-Pyk2. The Pyk2/FAK chimeric (designated PFhy1) was created by polymerase chain reaction with the “gene splicing by overlap extension” method as described previously (15Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar). Correct fusion was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and this fragment was then inserted into the EcoRI site of pKH3. Cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) as described previously (12Chen H.-C.

Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C by incubating cell lysates for 2 h with indicated antibodies followed by incubation for 1 h with Protein A-Sepharose or Protein G-Plus. After washing, the beads were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with appropriate antibodies as indicated using the ECL system (Amersham Life Science), as described previously (12Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D.

Cells grown overnight on FN-coated glass coverslips were washed in PBS supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and then washed in PBS and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in PBS and stained with primary antibody in 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes in PBS, they were incubated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody in 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS, coverslips were mounted on Slowfade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and examined and photographed using a Zeiss Axioplan (magnification, ×100) universal microscope. Because they express both endogenous Pyk2 and FAK, RASM cells provide an ideal system to compare regulation of tyrosine phophorylation of Pyk2 and FAK by cell adhesion and by soluble factors in the same cells, which may clarify the somewhat contradicting results on Pyk2 regulation by integrins in previous reports (2Sasaki H.

They were immunoprecipitated with either anti-Pyk2 or anti-FAK antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting using either a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (anti-pY), PY20, to detect tyrosine phosphorylation levels, or anti-Pyk2 or anti-FAK antibodies to verify similar expression levels. As shown in Fig.1 A, there is a low level of Pyk2 phosphorylation in serum-starved, attached RASM cells compared with almost non-detectable Pyk2 phosphorylation in suspended cells. Stimulation of the attached cells by angiotensin II, PDGF, sorbitol, calcium ionophore A23187, and KCl all caused further increases in Pyk2 phosphorylation (approximately 5–10-fold as determined by densitometric analysis). In contrast, FAK phosphorylation in unstimulated attached RASM cells was near the maximum level and showed no further increase after stimulation with A23187 or KCL and only a small increase (≤1-fold as determined by densitometric analysis) upon treatment with angiotensin II, PDGF, and sorbitol (Fig. 1 B). These results suggested a differential regulation of Pyk2 and FAK in the same cells; while FAK phosphorylation is primarily controlled by cell adhesion, Pyk2 phosphorylation is influenced more by soluble factors that elevate intracellular calcium. To determine the specificity of the cell adhesion effect, we examined Pyk2 and FAK phosphorylation in RASM cells plated on FN or PLL. Little tyrosine phosphorylation was detected for either Pyk2 or FAK in cells plated on PLL (Fig. 2). Cell adhesion to FN increased Pyk2 phosphorylation slightly, while sorbitol treatment caused a more dramatic (8–10-fold) increase, as shown in Fig.2 A. In contrast, cell adhesion to FN enhanced FAK phosphorylation more significantly, to a nearly maximum level, and sorbitol treatment caused only a minimal additional increase in FAK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). These results confirmed the differential responses of FAK and Pyk2 to integrin-mediated cell adhesion and to soluble factors in RASM cells. To explore potential mechanisms of the differential response of Pyk2 and FAK to cell adhesion, we examined cellular localization of these two kinases in RASM cells upon their adhesion to FN. Cells plated on FN-coated coverslips were stained by double-label immunofluorescence using either rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK or anti-Pyk2 antibodies and mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3shows the typical distribution of FAK in focal contacts of cells plated on FN (panel A), which colocalizes extensively with vinculin, a major component of focal contacts (panel C). In contrast, Pyk2 was detected as predominantly diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm (panel B), exhibiting no colocalization with the vinculin staining of the same cell (panel D). These results suggested that differential localization of Pyk2 and FAK might be responsible for their differential regulation by integrins. The C-terminal domain of FAK contains the focal adhesion targeting sequence that has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for FAK localization to focal contacts (16Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Even though the C-terminal domain of Pyk2 is ∼40% identical to that of FAK and, in fact, exhibits a higher degree of homology within the focal adhesion targeting sequences, the lack of focal contact localization of Pyk2 in RASM cells raised the possibility that the differences in the C-terminal domains of these two kinases are responsible for their differential regulation and subcellular localization. To test this hypothesis, we created a chimeric protein, PFhy1, which consists of the N-terminal and kinase domains of Pyk2 (amino acids 1–665) fused in frame to the C-terminal domain of FAK (amino acids 663–1052), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The site of fusion was selected at a region of high homology between Pyk2 and FAK to minimize possible gross structural alteration of the chimeric protein (Fig.4). To examine regulation of the chimeric protein PFhy1, expression vectors encoding PFhy1, FAK, and Pyk2 were transfected into CHO cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated with calcium ionophore A23187 or with sorbitol. Lysates were prepared from these cells and immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (anti-HA) that recognizes the HA epitopes present in these proteins. Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates using anti-HA indicated that similar levels of FAK, Pyk2, and PFhy1 were expressed in the transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Western blotting with anti-pY showed a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation of transfected FAK in the untreated control (C) cells as well as the treated cells (top panel, left three lanes). In contrast, only a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in the transfected Pyk2 in the control (C) cells and a significantly higher level was detected in cells treated with A23187 or sorbitol (top panel, middle three lanes). These results are similar to that observed for endogenous FAK and Pyk2 in RASM cells (see Fig.1), suggesting that transient transfection in CHO cells offers a good system for analyzing these two kinases. Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of the chimeric protein PFhy1 resembled that of FAK: high phosphorylation in the control (C) cells and only a slight increase after treatment with either A23187 or sorbitol (top panel, right three lanes). These results suggested that the C-terminal domain of FAK was responsible for its high level of phosphorylation in attached cells. To further study the regulation of PFhy1 by integrins, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of the transfected FAK, Pyk2, and PFhy1 in CHO cells that had been plated on PLL or FN (Fig.6). Cell adhesion to FN led to a slight increase of Pyk2 phosphorylation compared with no detectable Pyk2 phosphorylation in cells plated on PLL, and sorbitol treatment of cells on FN resulted in a further increase in Pyk2 phosphorylation (middle three lanes). In contrast, plating cells on FN increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and PFhy1 to the maximal levels and no further stimulation was observed by sorbitol treatment (left three lanes and right three lanes, respectively). In addition, a low level of FAK and PFhy1 phosphorylation was detected in cells on PLL, which was likely the result of autophosphorylation due to the relatively high expression achieved by transient transfection in CHO cells. Notably, little or no autophosphorylation was detected for Pyk2 despite a similarly high expression level (bottom panel). Therefore, the regulation of PFhy1 resembled that of FAK, but not Pyk2 in transfected CHO cells. To determine if the C-terminal domain of FAK conferred integrin-regulation of PFhy1 by targeting it to focal contacts, we compared subcellular localization of PFhy1 with that of Pyk2 and FAK in transfected CHO cells (Fig. 7). Both the transfected FAK and PFhy1 were colocalized with vinculin in focal contacts as detected by double-label immunofluorescence using rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK (panels A and B) and mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (panels D andE). In contrast, Pyk2 was present in the transfected cells in a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm as detected by anti-Pyk2 antibody (panel C), which is clearly distinct from the vinculin staining in focal contacts (panel F). To exclude the possibility that different staining patterns of FAK and PFhy1versus Pyk2 were due to the use of different antibodies (our Pyk2 antibody was generated against the C-terminal part of Pyk2 and therefore does not recognize the chimeric protein PFhy1), we stained the transfected cells with the anti-HA antibody (12CA5) which recognizes the epitope tag on all three transfected proteins. This analysis confirms the focal contact localization of FAK (panel G) and PFhy1 (panel H) as well as the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of Pyk2 (panel I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that replacing the C-terminal domain of Pyk2 with that of FAK results in a chimeric protein PFhy1, which resembles FAK in both regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization. They suggest that the C-terminal domains of Pyk2 and FAK are functionally distinct even though they share 40% homology. The C-terminal domain of FAK has been shown to interact with several proteins localized in focal contacts including p130 cas, paxillin, and talin (12Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T.

To explore the mechanism underlying the different localization of Pyk2 and FAK, we examined the in vivointeraction of Pyk2 and FAK with talin and paxillin in RASM cells (Fig.8 A). Lysates were prepared from RASM cells, immunoprecipitated by various antibodies as indicated, and then Western-blotted with anti-talin or anti-paxillin antibodies. Talin was detected in immunoprecipitates with anti-FAK antibody, as reported previously in NIH 3T3 cells (12Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.-L. J. Biol.

However, it was not present in immunoprecipitates with anti-Pyk2 antibody or preimmune serum (top panel). Consistent with previous results (19Turner C.E. Miller J. J.

Similar experiments were performed with CHO cells transfected with an empty vector (mock), Pyk2, FAK, or PFhy1 (Fig. 8 B) using anti-HA antibody to precipitate the transfected proteins. Talin was co-immunoprecipitated with epitope-tagged FAK and PFhy1, but not with Pyk2 or from the mock-transfected cells (top panel). In contrast, paxillin was coprecipitated with all three proteins (bottom panel). Western blotting with anti-HA antibody confirmed similar expression levels of Pyk2, FAK, and PFhy1 in the transfected cells (middle panel). These results correlated FAK, Pyk2 and PFhy1 binding to talin, but not paxillin, with their regulation by integrins and focal contact localization. Previous studies have suggested that regulation of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation by cell adhesion is cell type- and integrin-specific. Pyk2 has been shown to display an integrin-dependent phosphorylation in B lymphocytes, CMK cells, and transfected COS cells (7Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pyk2 phosphorylation has been found to be independent of either cell adhesion in transfected 3Y1 cells or integrin ligation during platelet aggregation (2Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 24Raja S. Avraham S. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10941-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether induction of Pyk2 phosphorylation by integrins is as effective as that by soluble factors or how it compares with FAK phosphorylation in cell adhesion in the same cells. In this report, we investigated these questions using both RASM cells expressing endogenous Pyk2 and FAK, and transfected CHO cells. We showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is controlled mainly by integrin-mediated cell adhesion in both cell types, as expected (25Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a small increase in Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is observed upon cell adhesion in these cells. A significantly higher increase in Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is obtained when the cells are stimulated with soluble factors such as angiotensin II, PDGF, sorbitol, and calcium ionophore A23187, whereas these treatments produced little change in FAK phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that Pyk2 and FAK are differentially regulated by cell adhesion and soluble factors in these cell types. The mechanism by which cell adhesion differentially regulates Pyk2 and FAK is poorly understood at present. However, it has been suggested that aggregation of FAK with integrins and cytoskeletal proteins in focal contacts may be responsible for FAK activation and autophosphorylation by integrins in cell adhesion (25Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 26Guan J.-L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have observed that, in contrast to the localization of FAK in focal contacts, Pyk2 is detected diffusely in the cytoplasms in both RASM cells and the transfected CHO cells. Therefore the lack of (or relatively little) stimulation of Pyk2 by cell adhesion could be explained by the lack of focal contact localization in these cells. Interestingly, studies in several other cell types have also demonstrated a correlation between integrin-dependent Pyk2 phosphorylation and its localization in focal contact-like structures (2Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 7Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, this hypothesis is strengthened by our analysis of a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal and kinase domains of Pyk2 and C terminus of FAK, which is localized in the focal contacts and stimulated by cell adhesion to the same extent as FAK. Direct interactions of FAK with the integrin cytoplasmic domain or cytoskeletal proteins such as paxillin and talin have been suggested to mediate focal contact localization and activation of FAK (25Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 26Guan J.-L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated an interaction of Pyk2 with paxillin (21Hiregowdara D. Avraham H. Fu Y. London R. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10804-10810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Salgia R. Avraham S. Pisick E. Li J.-L. Raja S. Greenfield E.A. Sattler M. Avraham H. Griffin J.D. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding to paxillin is unlikely to account for the differential regulation of FAK and Pyk2 observed here. Consistent with this, we have found that paxillin was associated with FAK, Pyk2, and the chimeric protein in both RASM cells and transfected CHO cells. In contrast, we have found an association of talin with FAK, but not Pyk2, in these cells. In addition, the chimeric protein PFhy1, which behaves like FAK in terms of regulation and localization, was also found to associate with talin as effectively as FAK in transfected CHO cells. Therefore, association with talin may be responsible for the differential regulation and localization of Pyk2 and FAK in these cells, although we cannot exclude the possibility that binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain or to other, as yet unidentified, proteins are also involved. In addition to its activation by integrins, Pyk2 has been shown to be activated by a variety of soluble factors that elevate intracellular calcium (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 4Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate clearly that in comparison with these soluble factors, cell adhesion mediated by integrins is a relatively weaker activator of Pyk2 in both RASM cells and transfected CHO cells. The small increase in Pyk2 phosphorylation upon cell adhesion could be due to low levels of focal contact localization of Pyk2 that are below the sensitivity of the immunofluorescence method used in these studies. We have occasionally observed localization of Pyk2 in focal contacts in a small fraction (≤5%) of cells (data not shown), which could contribute to the small increase in Pyk2 phosphorylation. However, we did not find any increase in Pyk2 localization in focal contacts, even after stimulation with sorbitol or angiotensin II (data not shown). Alternatively, Pyk2 may be solely regulated by intracellular calcium and protein kinase C, as suggested in previous studies (1Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 6Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S. Schlessinger J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14996-15002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Integrin clustering has been shown to induce calcium transients in some cell types (25Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 28Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). It is possible that integrin-mediated cell adhesion could increase intracellular calcium (although increases may be relatively small compared with those generated by the soluble factors used) to activate Pyk2 to some extent in these cells. It will be interesting to compare directly the level of calcium increases in response to cell adhesion and to the various soluble factors used in these cells. Results from these comparative studies of Pyk2 and FAK may also have implications for our understanding of FAK regulation by integrins. For example, the potential calcium increase upon cell adhesion, although small, could lead to a small increase in FAK phosphorylation (just like Pyk2), which may promote its aggregation in focal contacts resulting in an additional, more significant increase in phosphorylation. This two-step FAK activation model is consistent with previous reports indicating a role for calcium and protein kinase C in FAK activation (29Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Shattil S. Haimovich B. Cunningham M. Lipfert L. Parsons J.T. Ginsberg M.H. Brugge J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as with the importance of focal contact localization in the regulation as discussed above. Phosphorylation of FAK by protein kinase C and possibly by other serine/threonine kinases has been observed (32Richardson A. Parsons J.T. BioAssays. 1995; 17: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 33Richardson A. Shannon J.D. Adams R.B. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), although their potential role in FAK regulation awaits further investigation. Given the high degree of sequence homology between Pyk2 and FAK, it is somewhat surprising to find that these kinases are differentially regulated. Analysis of a chimeric protein suggests that the C-terminal domains of the kinases are responsible for these regulation differences despite their 40% identity. Although we cannot exclude a role for the N-terminal and kinase domains in the regulation of Pyk2 and FAK, it is likely that part of the amino acid differences in the C-terminal domains are critical for the differential talin binding, focal contact localization, and integrin regulation as described here. We have previously reported that deletion of amino acids 965–1012 within the focal adhesion targeting sequence of FAK ablated its binding to talin (12Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), suggesting that the different residues within this region may be important.

We investigated the capability of recombinant neuroserpin to form SDS-stable complexes with, and to reduce the amidolytic activity of, a variety of serine proteinases in vitro. Consistent with its primary structure at the reactive site, neuroserpin exhibited inhibitory activity against trypsin-like proteinases. Although neuroserpin bound and inactivated plasminogen activators and plasmin, no interaction was observed with thrombin. A reactive site mutant of neuroserpin neither formed complexes with nor inhibited the amidolytic activity of any of the tested proteinases. Kinetic analysis of the inhibitory activity revealed neuroserpin to be a slow binding inhibitor of plasminogen activators and plasmin.

Furthermore, tPA has been demonstrated to be involved in excitotoxin-induced neuronal cell death in the murine hippocampus by converting locally secreted plasminogen to active plasmin (15Tsirka S.E.

Thrombin, which has been extensively characterized due to its important function in the blood clotting system, has been reported to be expressed in the nervous system (17Dihanich M. Kaser M. Reinhard E. Cunningham D. Monard D. Neuron. 1991; 6: 575-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It has been found to negatively affect neurite outgrowth in vitro (18Gurwitz D.

A serine proteinase termed “erase” was proposed to be associated with membranes of neurons from the peripheral but not from the central nervous system (20Baird J.L. Raper J.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6605-6618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cDNAs of three serine proteinases called “neuropsin,” “neurosin,” and “neurotrypsin,” respectively, which are preferentially expressed in the nervous system, have been cloned and characterized (21Chen Z.-L.

In analogy to processes of tissue remodeling, blood coagulation, and fibrinolysis, one would expect specific inhibitors of serine proteinases belonging to the structural class of the serpins (serine proteinase inhibitors; for a review, see Ref. 24Gettins P. Patston P.A. Schapira M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. N. Am. 1992; 6: 1393-1408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to act as regulators of proteolytic activity in the nervous system. Guenther et al. (25Guenther J. Nick H. Monard D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Gloor et al. (26Gloor S. Odink K. Guenther J. Nick H. Monard D. Cell. 1986; 47: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) have found a glial cell line-derived activity, which promotes neurite outgrowth in vitro and which is identical to protease nexin-1 (PN-1), a member of the serpin family. PN-1 is directed against thrombin; it is widely distributed in the nervous system (27Mansuy I.M. van der Putten H. Schmid P. Meins M. Botteri F.M. Monard D. Development. 1993; 119: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and might serve as a physiological regulator of thrombin (28Liu Y. Fields R.D. Festoff B.W. Nelson P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel member of the serpin family has been purified from bovine brain (29Nishibori M. Chikai T. Kawabata M. Ohta J. Ubuka T. Saeki K. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 24: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be expressed in neurons and in glial cells and to interact in vitro with several serine proteinases (e.g. thrombin) (30Nishibori M. Ohtsuka A. Kawabata M. Nakaya N. Murakami T. Saeki K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 200: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Nakaya N. Nishibori M. Kawabata M. Saeki K. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 42: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast to thrombin, the PAs in the brain have not been associated with a regulatory serpin. The plasminogen activator inhibitors of nonneuronal tissues (PAI-1 and PAI-2) were found in the nervous system (e.g. Refs. 32Rao J.S. Chen M. Festoff B.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and 33Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Kondo H. Kato M. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 164: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but they are not coexpressed with PAs in a pattern suggestive for a role of their physiological regulators in the brain. We have recently purified a neuronal serpin, neuroserpin, from ocular vitreous fluid (VF) of chicken embryos and have cloned the cDNA (34Osterwalder T. Contartese J. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of neuroserpin is highly conserved between chick, rodents, and man (35Schrimpf S.P. Bleiker A.J. Brecevic L. Kozlov S.V. Berger P. Osterwalder T. Krueger S.R. Schinzel A. Sonderegger P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 2Krueger, S. R., Ghisu, G. P., Cinelli, P., Gschwend, T. P., Osterwalder, T., Wolfer, D. P., and Sonderegger, P. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17, 8984–8996. especially in the region of the reactive site loop (between P17 and P5′; following the standard nomenclature introduced by Schechter and Berger (36Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar)) (Fig.1). A considerable amount of work over the past decade revealed the unusually flexible reactive site loop to be essential for the activity and the specificity of serpins (e.g. Refs. 37Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Phillips J.E. Cooper S.T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7423-7428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on its amino acid sequence within the reactive site loop, neuroserpin belongs to the inhibitory Arg serpins and might therefore be an inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteinases, and the high similarity of neuroserpin sequences of chicken, mice, and men within this region (Fig. 1) suggests a high conservation of target specificity. However, the speculations about inhibitory activity and possible target proteinases were solely based on amino acid sequence comparisons, and no antiproteolytic activity of neuroserpin has been demonstrated so far. The purpose of the presented study was to determine experimentally whether neuroserpin is an inhibitory serpin and whether it is targeted against serine proteinases expressed in the nervous system. We used complex formation assays and inhibition assays to investigate the interaction between recombinant neuroserpin and the neural serine proteinases tPA, uPA, plasmin, and thrombin. We found that the inhibitory activity of neuroserpin is directed specifically against PAs and plasmin, whereas no activity versus thrombin was observed. The cDNA fragments termed cNS-wt and cNS-fus were amplified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the full-length cDNA clone Sc3a4 as a template and the oligonucleotide primer pairs cNS-for/cNS-wt-back and cNS-for/cNS-fus-back, respectively. For site-directed mutagenesis of the reactive site, the mutagenic backward primer cNS-mt-back was combined with cNS-int-for to amplify the XbaI-ScaI fragment of neuroserpin with a mutated reactive site (Fig. 2 A). (cNS-for, 5′-GTC TTA AGA GCT CAC AAC ATG TAT TTC C-3′; cNS-int-for, 5′-GTA TCT ACC AAG TTC TAG AAA TAC C-3′; cNS-wt-back, 5′-GGG AAG CTT ACT TAC CTA AAG CTC TTC AAA GTC ATG GCC-3′; cNS-fus-back, 5′-GGG AAG CTT ACT TAC CTA GCT CTT CAA AGT CAT GGC C-3′; cNS-mt-back, 5′-GGA TAC AGT ACT GCA GGT TCG CTA ATG GC-3′.) PCR amplification was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 0.025 units/ml AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), 50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.3 mmMg2+ (3 mm for cNS-mt), 200 nmamounts of each primer, and 0.25 μg of template. Sc3a4 was linearized by KpnI digestion, and cNS-wt or cNS-fus, respectively, were amplified in a 50 μl volume in a 16-cycle amplification (hot start with denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C; cycles 1–5, annealing 1 min at 60 °C; elongation 1.5 min at 72 °C; Denaturation 1 min at 95 °C; Cycles 6–16, annealing and elongation 2 min at 72 °C; denaturation 1 min at 95 °C; 7 min completing at 72 °C). For the amplification of cNS-mt, KpnI-linearized pBluescript containing cNS-fus was used as template, and the PCR conditions were as above, except the annealing temperature (59 °C for cycles 1–5 and 60 °C for cycles 6–16) and an elongation time of 1 min in all cycles. cNS-wt and cNS-fus were digested withSacI and HindIII (all restriction endonucleases from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; recognition sites underlined in the primers) and ligated into the identically digested vector pCD4-FvCD3-Cκ (kindly provided by Dr. K. Karjalainen), resulting in the expression vectors pcNS for wild-type and pcNS-Cκ for the fusion protein, respectively (Fig. 2 B). For mutant neuroserpin, theSacI-HindIII fragment of pcNS-Cκ was excised and subcloned in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the wild-type XbaI-ScaI fragment covering the reactive site loop was replaced by the mutated fragment cNS-mt amplified by PCR. Replacing the SacI-HindIII fragment of pcNS-Cκ with the mutated neuroserpin yielded the expression vector pcNSEP-Cκ for mutant neuroserpin as a fusion protein with Cκ. The integrity of the resulting constructs was confirmed by double-strand sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or with the SequiTherm Long Read Cycle Sequencing Kit-LC (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). Stable transfectants were obtained by transfecting pcNS, pcNS-Cκ, or pcNSEP-Cκ, respectively, into the mouse myeloma cell line J558L by protoplast fusion (42Schaffner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as described by Oi and colleagues (43Oi V.T. Morrison S.L. Herzenberg L.A. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To achieve independent transfectants, the cells were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; both from Life Technologies, Basel, Switzerland) and cultivated in 96-well microtiter plates at 37 °C in 10% CO2. After 2 days, selection of transfectants was started by adding 5 mm l-histidinol (Sigma). Two weeks later, histidinol-resistant colonies were expanded and cultivated for 3–4 days in 24-well plates containing 600 μl of selection medium (5 mm l-histidinol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FCS) per well. To screen for recombinant wild-type neuroserpin (cNS) and for neuroserpin fusion protein with Cκ (cNS-Cκ), 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was then added, and the expanding colonies were metabolically labeled for 20 h. Afterward, the relative expression levels of cNS and cNS-Cκ of different clones were compared by immunoprecipitation of the recombinant protein from the supernatants using the polyclonal antiserum R35 as described below, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. For mutant neuroserpin fusion protein (cNSEP-Cκ), supernatants of the surviving colonies were incubated with a sheep antibody against mouse Cκ (The Binding Site, Birmingham, UK) dotted on nitrocellulose, and the expression levels of the tested cell lines were compared by incubating the dot blot with a peroxidase-conjugated sheep antibody against mouse IgG (H + L; from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and by developing with 0.5 mg/ml 4-chlor-1-naphthol (Merck, Dietikon, Switzerland) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl). The clones with the highest expression were subcloned and adapted to low serum conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% FCS). Recombinant cNS was partially purified from supernatants of transfected myeloma cells by a two-step chromatographic procedure. The supernatants were first passed through a column containing Blue Sepharose (CL6B, Pharmacia, Dübendorf, Switzerland). The flow-through was dialyzed against ion exchange chromatography loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl), and proteins were fractionated using an anion exchange column (MonoQ HR5/5, Pharmacia, Dübendorf, Switzerland) and a linear gradient from 200 to 500 mm NaCl. The fractions from 350 to 400 mm NaCl were highly enriched with cNS; they were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl) and stored frozen until further use. For the isolation of cNS-Cκ and cNSEP-Cκ, respectively, supernatants of the transfected myeloma cells were passed through an immunoaffinity column with the immobilized monoclonal antibody 187.1 (Rat anti-mouse-Cκ IgG, ATCC). Bound antigen was eluted with 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11.5. The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 230 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and then dialyzed against PBS. All procedures, except ion exchange chromatography, were carried out at 4 °C. Human neuroserpin (PI12) was cytoplasmically expressed in Escherichia coli with a stretch of six histidines fused to the C terminus of the protein. Briefly, a fragment of the human neuroserpin cDNA encoding amino acids 1–394 of human neuroserpin (according to the numbering of Schrimpf et al. (35Schrimpf S.P. Bleiker A.J. Brecevic L. Kozlov S.V. Berger P. Osterwalder T. Krueger S.R. Schinzel A. Sonderegger P. Genomics. 1997; 40: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)) was amplified in a PCR using the oligodeoxynucleotide primers 5′-AAT TTC TAG AGA AAG GAG ATA CAT ATG ACA GGG GCC ACT TTC CCT-3′ and 5′-GGG AAG CTT CTA GTG GTG ATG GTG GTG GTG AAG TTC TTC GAA ATC ATG GTC C-3′. The cDNA fragment was cloned into the vector pAK400 (44Krebber A. Bornhauser S. Burmester J. Honegger A. Willuda J. Bosshard H.R. Pluckthun A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) via the XbaI and HindIII sites of the vector, allowing expression of the cDNA from the lacoperator/promoter located immediately upstream. For expression, a colony of E. coli strain BL21DE3 harboring the expression plasmid was precultured overnight at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. After inoculation of the same medium with the preculture, bacteria were grown at 25 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase at an A 600 of 0.5. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 6 h after induction, resuspended in Ni-NTA-binding buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0), and disrupted in a French press. The soluble protein extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.4 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Following extensive washing with Ni-NTA binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with Ni-NTA binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against PBS and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Generation and specificity of the rabbit antiserum R35 against neuroserpin purified from VF has been described earlier (34Osterwalder T. Contartese J. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2944-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The rabbit antiserum R61 against recombinant neuroserpin was generated by intramuscular injection of 10–20 μg of cNS-Cκ in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by two booster injections of cNS-Cκ in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 2 and 4 months later. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the antiserum R61 against cNS-Cκ obtained 1 week after the second booster injection was specific for neuroserpin of both conditioned medium of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and VF. VF of 14-day-old chicken embryos was prepared as described earlier (45Ruegg M.A. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Heller M. Zuellig R. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). DRG neurons were dissected from 10-day-old chicken embryos and cultured essentially as described by Sonderegger and co-workers (46Sonderegger P. Lemkin P.F. Lipkin L.E. Nelson P.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Selective labeling of newly synthesized proteins was carried out essentially as described by Stoeckli and co-workers (47Stoeckli E.T. Lemkin P.F. Kuhn T.B. Ruegg M.A. Heller M. Sonderegger P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The labeling medium consisted of growth medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), and the incubation time was 24–48 h. Immunoprecipitation of neuroserpin using the polyclonal antiserum R61 was carried out as described previously (45Ruegg M.A. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Heller M. Zuellig R. Sonderegger P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Human tPA (Activase®, recombinant Alteplase, 580,000 IU/mg; kindly provided by Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at −80 °C; human uPA (100,000–300,000 Plough units/mg, Sigma U-8627) was delivered in a concentration of 1 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C; porcine plasmin (3–5 units/mg, Sigma, P-8644) and human thrombin (50–100 NIH units/mg, Sigma, T-4648) were dissolved in water to final concentrations of 2 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. The enzyme substrate S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-para-nitroanilide) was purchased from Chromogenix (Mölndal, Sweden), dissolved in water to a concentration of 25 mg/ml, and stored frozen until use. Active enzyme concentrations were determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of the proteinases in the presence of 1 mm S-2288, using values for substrate turnover of ΔA 405 = 0.275 min−1cm−1, 0.031 min−1 cm−1, 0.030 min−1 cm−1, and 0.042 min−1cm−1, for 4 nm thrombin, uPA, single chain tPA, and plasmin, respectively, as indicated by the substrates' supplier. Recombinant neuroserpin was prepared as detailed above, stored frozen, and thawed immediately before use if not indicated otherwise. The concentrations of cNS-Cκ and cNSEP-Cκ were determined by amino acid analysis on an Aminoquant II equipped with the fluorescence detector 1046A (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) using standard procedures. The concentration of cNS was estimated by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The concentration of hNS-H6was estimated using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) in combination with densitometric analysis of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Recombinant PN-1 (active concentration 1.2 mg/ml) was kindly provided by Dr. D. Monard and was stored frozen until use. Chemicals for reaction buffers were purchased from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. For complex formation assays, a complexation buffer containing 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 133 mm NaCl, and 0.13% PEG 8000 was used. Inhibition buffer contained 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; from Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Coating solution contained 1% BSA, 0.5% w/v PEG 8000, and 0.01% v/v Triton X-100. In an Eppendorf reaction tube, proteinases and inhibitors were mixed in 30 μl of complexation buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C if not indicated otherwise. For experiments with hNS-H6, incubation was 15 min at 4 °C. The final amounts of enzymes and inhibitors are indicated in Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2-fold concentrated sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (containing 6% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, 31.3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and by immediately boiling the sample for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE was according to O'Farrell (49O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Sonderegger et al. (46Sonderegger P. Lemkin P.F. Lipkin L.E. Nelson P.G. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For autoradiography, the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was used. Silver staining was performed according to the procedure of Switzer et al. (50Switzer R.C.D. Merril C.R. Shifrin S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) as modified by Oakley et al.(51Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). Carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), phosphorylase (97 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), and myosin (205 kDa, all from Sigma) were used as molecular mass markers throughout the study. Electrotransfer of resolved proteins onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) was carried out according to Towbin et al. (52Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) at 30 V for 16 h or at 100 V for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Molecular mass markers were visualized by 3 min incubation of the membranes in 0.1% Ponceau S (Sigma P-3504) in 1% acetic acid followed by destaining with distilled water. Immunodetection of neuroserpin was performed using the polyclonal antisera R35 or R61 and the BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) according to the supplier's recommendations, or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Bio-Science products, Emmenbrücke, Switzerland) at a dilution of 1/1,000. Enzyme inhibition was determined by mixing enzyme and inhibitor in a 96-well plate in 98 μl of inhibition buffer. The final concentrations of enzymes were as follows: uPA, 19.1 nm (9.1 nm for experiments with hNS-H6 shown in Fig. 5); tPA, 7.9 nm; thrombin, 18.8 nm; plasmin, 12.7 nm. Concentrations of inhibitor were 5 and 25 nm (cNS-Cκ) or 30 and 150 nm (hNS-H6). cNS-Cκ was preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C, while hNS-H6 was 10 min at room temperature. After preincubation, the amidolytic reactions were started simultaneously by adding 2 μl of substrate solution (25 mg/ml S-2288) to each well. Residual amidolytic activity was determined by measuring the hydrolysis over time (velocity) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech, Denkendorf, Germany). The kinetics of the interaction between cNS-Cκ and tPA, uPA, or plasmin, was determ"
https://openalex.org/W2073387947,"The E6 and E7 proteins of the high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are consistently expressed in HPV-positive cervical carcinomas. We investigated the ability of HPV-16 E6 and E7 to disrupt mitotic checkpoints in normal diploid human cells. Acute expression of HPV-16 E6, but not HPV-16 E7, decreased the fidelity of multiple checkpoints controlling entry into and exit from mitosis. After irradiation, nearly 50% of cells containing HPV-16 E6 readily entered mitosis as opposed to less than 10% of control cells. Consistent with this, asynchronous populations of cells expressing HPV-16 E6 had increased cdc2-associated histone H1 kinase activity relative to control populations. In addition, HPV-16 E6 increased sensitivity to chemically-induced S-phase premature mitosis and decreased mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint function relative to control populations. HPV-16 E6 mutants with a reduced ability to target p53 for degradation were unable to abrogate mitotic checkpoints, suggesting a possible mechanism by which HPV-16 E6 disrupts mitotic checkpoints. Expression of a mutant p53 gene yielded an intermediate phenotype relative to HPV-16 E6, generating moderate increases in sensitivity to chemically-induced S-phase PCC and mitotic spindle disruption and a heightened propensity to enter mitosis after irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1987954806,"The crystal structure of the major peroxidase of barley grain (BP 1) has been solved by molecular replacement and phase combination and refined to an R-factor of 19.2% for all data between 38 and 1.9 Å. The refined model includes amino acid residues 1–309, one calcium ion, one sodium ion, iron-protoporphyrin IX, and 146 solvent molecules. BP 1 has the apparently unique property of being unable to catalyze the reaction with the primary substrate hydrogen peroxide to form compound I at pH values > 5, a feature investigated by obtaining crystal structure data at pH 5.5, 7.5, and 8.5. Structural comparison shows that the overall fold of inactive barley grain peroxidase at these pH values resembles that of both horseradish peroxidase C and peanut peroxidase. The key differences between the structures of active horseradish peroxidase C and inactive BP 1 include the orientation of the catalytic distal histidine, disruption of a hydrogen bond between this histidine and a conserved asparagine, and apparent substitution of calcium at the distal cation binding site with sodium at pH 7.5. These profound changes are a result of a dramatic structural rearrangement to the loop region between helices B and C. This is the first time that structural rearrangements linked to active site chemistry have been observed by crystallography in the peroxidase domain distal to heme."
https://openalex.org/W2056377405,"DNA methyltransferases are excellent prototypes for investigating DNA distortion and enzyme specificity because catalysis requires the extrahelical stabilization of the target base within the enzyme active site. The energetics and kinetics of base flipping by the EcoRI DNA methyltransferase were investigated by two methods. First, equilibrium dissociation constants (K DDNA) were determined for the binding of the methyltransferase to DNA containing abasic sites or base analogs incorporated at the target base. Consistent with a base flipping mechanism, tighter binding to oligonucleotides containing destabilized target base pairs was observed. Second, total intensity stopped flow fluorescence measurements of DNA containing 2-aminopurine allowed presteady-state real time observation of the base flipping transition. Following the rapid formation of an enzyme-DNA collision complex, a biphasic increase in total intensity was observed. The fast phase dominated the total intensity increase with a rate nearly identical to k methylation determined by rapid chemical quench-flow techniques (Reich, N. O., and Mashoon, N. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 9191–9193). The restacking of the extrahelical base also revealed biphasic kinetics with the recovered amplitudes from these off-rate experiments matching very closely to those observed during the base unstacking process. These results provide the first direct and continuous observation of base flipping and show that at least two distinct conformational transitions occurred at the flipped base subsequent to complex formation. Furthermore, our results suggest that the commitment to catalysis during the methylation of the target site is not determined at the level of the chemistry step but rather is mediated by prior intramolecular isomerization within the enzyme-DNA complex.

https://openalex.org/W2022329167,"The 5′-untranslated region of theDrosophila gypsy retrotransposon contains an “insulator,” which disrupts the interactions between enhancer and promoter elements located apart. The insulator effect is dependent on the suppressor of Hairy-wing (su(Hw)) protein, which binds to reiterated sites within the 350 base pairs of the gypsy insulator, whereby it additionally acts as a transcriptional activator of gypsy. Here, we show that the 350-base pair su(Hw) binding site-containing gypsy insulator behaves in addition as a matrix/scaffold attachment region (MAR/SAR), involved in interactions with the nuclear matrix.In vitro experiments using nuclear matrices fromDrosophila, murine, and human cells demonstrate specific binding of the gypsy insulator, not observed with any other sequence within the retrotransposon. Moreover, we show that the gypsy insulator, like previously characterized MAR/SARs, specifically interacts with topoisomerase II and histone H1, i.e. with two essential components of the nuclear matrix. Finally, experiments within cells in culture demonstrate differential effects of the gypsy MAR sequence on reporter genes, namely no effect under conditions of transient transfection and a repressing effect in stable transformants, as expected for a sequence involved in chromatin structure and organization. A model for the gypsy insulator, which combines within a short “compacted” retroviral sequence three functional domains (insulator, enhancer, and the presently unraveled MAR/SAR) dispersed within more extended regions in other “boundary” domains, is discussed in relation to previously proposed models for insulation.

One of the most extensively analyzed insulator element inDrosophila is part of a retrotransposon, the gypsy retrotransposon, where it occupies the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; bp, base pair(s); MAR/SAR, matrix/scaffold attachment region; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LIS, lithium diiodosalicylate; LTR, long terminal repeat; topo, topoisomerase. of this mobile element. Actually, transposition of gypsy has been revealed by the isolating activity of its insulator, which resulted for instance in the disruption of the effect of enhancers sequences of the yellowgene on the promoter of the gene (7Modolell J. Bender W. Meselson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1678-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 8Parkhurst S.M. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell.

The gypsy insulator was identified as entirely contained within a 350-bp sequence of the 5′-UTR; experiments performed in transgenic Drosophila with this minimal sequence placed between a reporter gene and various enhancer and/or silencers have shown that the gypsy insulator blocks the effect of enhancers in a directional manner, since only those located distally from the promoter with respect to the insulator sequence are affected (10Geyer P.K.

Similar effects can be produced with other well characterized insulator elements, including theDrosophila scs (specialized chromatin structures) from the 87A7 heat shock locus (15Kellum R. Schedl P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10735-10742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), all of which segregate DNA into distinct functional domains. However, the structural basis of this functional dissection is not so clear. Actually, boundary formation is thought to be connected with the establishment of specific chromatin structures, possibly associated with the formation of chromatin loops that would fold and assemble in such a way so as to increase the likelihood of interactions between regulatory elements within a domain, while decreasing these interactions between domains (reviewed in Refs. 2Lewin B. Cell. 1994; 79: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Schedl P. Grosveld F. Elgin S.C.R. Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression.

Nature. 1995; 376: 462-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence for this type of model is still weak and stems from the observation of such loops by electron microscopy, and from the occurrence of specific DNA sequences, which would mediate the attachment of chromosomes to the nuclear matrix (see Refs. 24Paulson J.R. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1977; 12: 815-828Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 25Hancock R. Hughes M.E. Biol. Cell. 1982; 44: 201-212Google Scholar, 26Saitoh Y.

Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1995; 83: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, and references therein). These sequences, also called MAR/SARs for matrix-associated or scaffold-attachment regions, have been operationally defined as DNA sequences that remain attached to the unsoluble nuclear matrix, and thereby are supposed to both define genomic structural domains and localize DNA segments close to the enzymatic machinery involved in DNA replication and transcription (22Laemmli U.K. Käs E. Poljak L. Adachi Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,27Strick R.

MAR/SARs are therefore likely structural elements to be involved in the segregation of the chromatin into functional domains and to participate in insulation. Accordingly, we have devised experiments to determine whether the gypsy retrotransposon contains a MAR/SAR domain. The in vitroexperiments presented in this report disclose such a sequence, which furthermore strictly co-localizes with the gypsy insulator. Experiments performed within cells in culture either transiently or stably transfected with reporter genes containing this sequence further demonstrate integration-dependent effects, consistent with a role in the organization and shaping of chromatin. The gypsy insulator, which contains previously identified binding sites for a protein, the suppressor of Hairy-wing protein (30Spana C. Harrison D.A. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Spana C. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1505-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Harrison D.A. Gdula D.A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and acts as a transcriptional activator (8Parkhurst S.M. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Smith P.A. Corces V.G. Genetics. 1995; 139: 215-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore also interacts with components of the nuclear matrix. The complex in vivo regulatory effects of the gypsy element are discussed in relation with the characteristic features of this insulator. The gypsy DNA was from plasmid cDm111 (35Bayev A.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3707-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), re-cloned as BglII-EcoRI plusEcoRI-BamHI fragments into the pSK (Stratagene) polylinker; a plasmid containing the gypsy LTR plus 5′-UTR was obtained by cloning the Klenow-treated HpaI-NcoI fragment (positions 2–1201 in Ref. 36Marlor R.L. Parkhurst S.M. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) from the above plasmid into theEcoRV site of the pSK polylinker; plasmids with fragments I to IV (see Fig. 1 A) were obtained by inserting the corresponding DNA fragments, obtained either by restriction from the plasmids above or after polymerase chain reaction amplification, into the pSK polylinker. For the assays with histone H1, a plasmid containing one copy of the gypsy insulator as a XmnI-Sau3AI fragment (positions 670–1029 in Ref. 36Marlor R.L. Parkhurst S.M. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) cloned into the BamHI site of pSK after Klenow treatment of both vector and insert was used, as well as a plasmid containing three copies of the same fragment cloned into the Klenow-treated SpeI, XbaI, andBamHI sites of the pSK polylinker. For the transfection experiments, we used the previously described p6 plasmid (37Poljak L. Seum C. Mattioni T. Laemmli U.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4386-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence under control of SV 40 promoter and enhancer, followed by the SV 40 polyadenylation sequence. TheXmnI-Sau3A gypsy insulator fragment (positions 670–1029) with all 12 copies of the binding site for the su(Hw) protein was inserted both upstream and downstream to the reporter gene into the BamHI and XhoI sites, respectively. As a reference, we used plasmid p8 (37Poljak L. Seum C. Mattioni T. Laemmli U.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4386-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), derived from plasmid p6 upon addition on both sides of the reporter gene of the 960-bp intergenic scaffold-associated regions from the Drosophila melanogasterhsp 70 gene. High salt extraction of nuclei from Drosophila Schneider II, murine L, or human HeLa cells (2 m NaCl extraction after DNase I digestion) and in vitro MAR binding assays were performed as in Refs.29Cockerill P.N.

In vitro SAR binding assays with LIS-extracted nuclei (25 mm lithium diiodosalicylate) digested with a series of restriction nucleases (XbaI, BstXI, andXmnI) were performed as in Refs. 39Mirkovitch J.

The gypsy fragments, radiolabeled either by Klenow treatment after restriction with appropriate enzymes or upon polymerase chain reaction amplification using 32P-labeled primers, were incubated 2 h with nuclear matrices prepared from 5A 260 units of purified nuclei, in the presence of competitor DNA (0.2 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). Pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions were separated by centrifugation (1 min at 4 °C, 10,000 × g), treated with proteinase K and, after purification, were resolved on polyacrylamide or agarose gels (and transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes in the latter case); dried polyacrylamide gels or membranes were then autoradiographed. For competition experiments, the labeled fragment corresponding to the gypsy insulator (XmnI-Sau3A) was first preincubated with the antibiotics distamycin (Sigma) or chromomycin (Boehringer Mannheim) as in Refs. 41Käs E.

Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, and then assayed as above. For the precipitation assay, radiolabeled fragments of the gypsy retrotransposon were incubated 30 min at 30 °C with increasing amounts of highly purified yeast or human topoisomerase II (topo II; gift from Dr. A. Larsen) in TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% digitonin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of competitor DNA (sonicated salmon sperm DNA) as in Refs. 41Käs E.

Pellet and supernatant fractions, separated by centrifugation (10 min at 4 °C, 12,000 ×g) and treated with 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (final concentrations), were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels, which were dried and autoradiographed. For the topo II cleavage assay, a fragment containing the 5′ part of gypsy (positions 1–1201 in Ref. 36Marlor R.L. Parkhurst S.M. Corces V.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) plus 1.5 kilobase pairs of the pSK vector was incubated with increasing amounts of topo II in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 70 mm NaCl, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mmspermidine, 0.1% digitonin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP), supplemented with the anti-tumor drug VM 26 (final concentration 50 μm; gift from Dr. A. Larsen) as in Ref. 42Adachi Y. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar. After electrophoresis and blotting, the cleavage pattern was analyzed by hybridization with the indicated probe (indirect end-labeling). Precipitation assay and protection from digestion by DNase I (Sigma) were performed as in Refs. 43Izaurralde E. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 44Zhao K. Käs E. Gonzales E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, with the gypsy insulator (fragment XmnI-Sau3AI) either as a single copy or as three directly repeated copies subcloned into the pSK plasmid. Plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes in the pSK polylinker, and fragments were labeled by Klenow treatment. DNA (2–5 ng of labeled fragments with 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA) was then incubated with histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) for 3 h at 37 °C. For the precipitation assay, pellet was recovered by centrifugation (15 min at 4 °C, 12,000 × g) and analyzed as above. For the DNase I protection assay, DNA with histone H1 was digested with DNase I (50 ng; Sigma) for 3 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2, purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (44Zhao K. Käs E. Gonzales E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DrosophilaSII cells were grown in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and murine L and human HeLa cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same serum. Transfection of cells (about 5 × 106 cells) were by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure, with 10 μg of DNA. Stable transformants were obtained upon co-transfection with the plasmid pSV2neo conferring Geneticin resistance (45Nicolas J.-F. Berg P. Silver L.M. Martin G.R. Strickland S. Teratocarcinoma Stem Cells. 10. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 469-485Google Scholar), followed by selection with G-418 (0.7 mg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient assays, cells were co-transfected with a plasmid containing the luciferase gene under control of Rous sarcoma virus LTR to normalize transfection efficiency. Protein extracts prepared as in Ref.37Poljak L. Seum C. Mattioni T. Laemmli U.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4386-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar were assayed for CAT activity as in Ref. 46Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar using appropriate dilutions to obtain less than 50% conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to acetylated forms. Reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and conversion of chloramphenicol was quantitated with a Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS model 1000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). CAT activity was expressed as the percentage of [14C]chloramphenicol acetylated in 30 min/mg of protein at 37 °C. Reporter plasmid copy number in the stable transformants was measured by Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNAs restricted with HindIII and EcoRI, using a CAT gene fragment from the p6 plasmid as a probe. DNA isolation and Southern blot hybridization were as in Ref. 47Maniatis T. Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. The gypsy insulator is a short sequence (350 bp) with a complex organization (Fig.1, A and B). It contains reiterated binding sites for the suppressor of Hairy-wing (su(Hw)) protein, which both regulates insulation efficiency and acts as a transcriptional enhancer (see Introduction). These sites are part of a sequence characterized by 12 copies of a core 12-bp sequence, 5′-PyPuTTGCATACCPy-3′, with homology to the mammalian octamer motif (see Ref. 30Spana C. Harrison D.A. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These reiterated binding sites are interspersed among an AT-rich domain (>70%), which is composed of short homopolymeric runs of dA-dT base pairs and AT dimer repeats (Fig. 1 B), and is involved in the refined modulation of su(Hw) binding (30Spana C. Harrison D.A. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1414-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although there is no definite consensus sequence for MAR/SARs, analysis of previously characterized sequences revealed ATC regions with G residues only on one strand of the DNA duplex, which were demonstrated to contain binding sites for nuclear matrix specific proteins and which in a multimerized form actually bind to the nuclear matrix (48Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 49Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Close examination of the gypsy insulator actually discloses ATC regions, with, for instance, four almost perfect (T/C)TTTTAATAAA(T/A)A(T/C)ATT repeats (Fig. 1 B), organized as the ATC sequences in the MAR of the mouse IgH gene, which harbors binding sites for the nuclear matrix-specific SATB1 and Bright proteins (ATC stretches with A-rich core, flanked by AT-dimer repeats, see reference above). Finally, MAR/SARs usually contain sequences related to the in vitrotopoisomerase II cleavage core consensus (A/T)A(C/T)ATT (51Sander M. Hsieh T.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1057-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 52Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar); such sequences can be found in the present sequence (see Fig.1 B). The possibility that the gypsy insulator co-localizes with a MAR/SAR was therefore tested, using classical assays for the identification of such domains. In vitro binding assay of gypsy sequences with high salt-extracted nuclei was performed as described in Refs. 29Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar and 38Phi-Van L. Strätling W.H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, using eitherDrosophila (SII), murine (L), or human (HeLa) cells. Insoluble material (i.e. associated with the nuclear matrix) was recovered as a pellet after centrifugation and treated, in parallel with the supernatant, with proteinase K, purified and analyzed on agarose or polyacrylamide gels. As illustrated in Fig. 1 Cusing end-labeled fragments from the gypsy retrotransposon, a fragment is specifically recovered in the insoluble fraction, which coincides with the 5′-UTR of gypsy; the other gypsy fragments are not associated with the nuclear matrix. A more refined analysis of the 5′-UTR region using for the binding assay four labeled fragments (I–IV, see Fig.1 A) including the gypsy LTR, the most 5′ part of the untranslated region (also AT-rich), the gypsy insulator (10Geyer P.K. Corces V.G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1865-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Cai H.N. Levine M. Nature. 1995; 376: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and the region corresponding to the N-terminal part of ORF1, further showed that the MAR coincides with the insulator domain (Fig. 1 C). Identical results were obtained with nuclear scaffold (SAR assay, see Fig. 1 D) isolated after lithium diiodosalicylate (LIS) extraction of nuclei from the SII cells as described in Refs. 39Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.-E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar and40Izaurralde E. Mirkovitch J. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. In typical MAR/SAR assays, about 50% of total gypsy insulator DNA was recovered in the pellet, as also observed (data not shown) with the previously characterized histone MAR/SAR from Drosophila(37Poljak L. Seum C. Mattioni T. Laemmli U.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4386-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Finally, binding assays performed with nuclear matrices from cells of other species revealed a conservation of the MAR/SAR activity of the gypsy insulator (see Fig. 1 C for murine and human cells), as observed for other such domains (48Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 53Mirkovitch J. Gasser S.M. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol.

Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1986; 46: 521-530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar for MAR/SARs, further demonstrated that the oligo(dA)-oligo(dT) tracks within the gypsy insulator should be the main structural determinants of the nuclear matrix binding activity. As illustrated in Fig.1 E, binding of the gypsy insulator to the nuclear matrix was specifically inhibited by the peptidic distamycin antibiotic, and was not affected by chromomycin, which selectively interact with the minor groove of AT- and GC-rich DNA regions, respectively. All MAR/SARs so far described have been shown to be functional targets of topo II, one of the main protein components of the nuclear matrix (54Earnshaw W.C. Heck M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1716-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,55Berrios M. Osheroff N. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4142-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Topo II is a key protein mediating interconversions between different topological states of the DNA, through transient double-strand breaks and rejoining. This enzyme is also required for chromatin assembly and packaging, and it plays a significant role in the establishment of chromatin loops (29Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 56Gasser S.M. Laroche T. Falquet J. Boy de la Tour E. Laemmli U.K. J. Mol.

A. 1989; 86: 5497-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Assays for both the aggregation of the gypsy MAR/SAR and for cleavage were therefore performed, using highly purified yeast or human topoisomerase II. Topo II-mediated aggregation was monitored as in Ref. 42Adachi Y. Käs E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3997-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar by centrifugation using end-labeled gypsy fragments and analysis of the pellet as in the MAR assay (Fig. 2 A). As illustrated in the figure using either a full-length gypsy element restricted with appropriate enzymes or 5′-UTR fragments including the insulator and the AT-rich domain 5′ to it (fragments III and II, see Fig. 1 A), topo II specifically precipitates the gypsy insulator. In a second series of experiments (see Fig. 2 B), topo II cleavage sites were assayed in vitro, using a linearized fragment containing the gypsy 5′ end and plasmidic DNA incubated with increasing concentrations of topo II, in the appropriate cleavage buffer. After electrophoresis on an agarose gel and blotting, DNA was analyzed by an indirect end-labeling procedure using the probe indicated in the figure. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, these experiments revealed the presence of a few strong cleavage sites within the gypsy insulator, and no sites in the adjacent AT-rich untranslated regions; sites in the LTR as well as in the flanking plasmidic DNA were also detected, but possibly with lower cleavage efficiency, taking into account the intensity of the bands and the position of the probe. Altogether, these series of experiments reveal a specific interaction of the gypsy insulator with topo II, as indeed observed for previous"
https://openalex.org/W2087308250,"The accepted dogma concerning the regulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity by Gβγ dimers states that the various isoforms of AC respond differently to the presence of free Gβγ. It has been demonstrated that AC I activity is inhibited and AC II activity is stimulated by Gβγ subunits. This result does not address the possible differences in modulation that may exist among the different Gβγ heterodimers. Six isoforms of Gβ and 12 isoforms of Gγ have been cloned to date. We have established a cell transfection system in which Gβ and Gγ cDNAs were cotransfected with either AC isoform I or II and the activity of these isoforms was determined. We found that while AC I activity was inhibited by both Gβ1/γ2 and Gβ5/γ2 combinations, AC II responded differentially and was stimulated by Gβ1/γ2 and inhibited by Gβ5/γ2. This finding demonstrates differential modulatory activity by different combinations of Gβγ on the same AC isoform and demonstrates another level of complexity within the AC signaling system.

The heterotrimeric G-protein has been shown to be a central molecule that connects seven-transmembrane domain receptors to the many downstream effector molecules whose activities they regulate. The G-protein superfamily has been divided into many classes, originally based on the activity that the Gα subunit exerted on the effectors. For example, the Gα subunit that was found to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; FS, forskolin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GαsQ227L, constitutively active Gαssubunit; IBMX, isobutylmethylxanthine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; JNK/SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase. was classified Gαs while the Gα subunit found to inhibit AC activity was called Gαi (reviewed in Refs. 1Birnbaumer L.

In the last few years, the role of free Gβγ subunits (disassociated from Gα upon receptor activation) in signal transduction has begun to be revealed (reviewed in Refs. 5Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu.

For example, the activity of AC type I is significantly inhibited while the activity of AC types II, IV, and presumably VII are activated by Gβγ (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J.

This finding has led to the understanding of how it is possible that the classically known inhibitory receptors that are coupled to Gαi/o can actually stimulate AC activity in situations where AC isoforms that are activated by free Gβγsubunits are present (11Avidor-Reiss T.

Most of the prior experiments investigating the role of free Gβγ on AC activity were performed in cell-free systems with either baculovirus/Sf9 recombinant Gβ and Gγ preparations (15Iñiguez-Lluhi J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is little information about the possible variations between the effects of various Gβ and Gγ subunits in the intact cell. This seems to be important since the various Gβ and Gγ subunits do not necessarily have the same regulatory activities. Due to the recent cloning of various Gβ and Gγ isoforms, it is now possible to study the activity of the various Gβγ combinations. Indeed, it has recently been shown by us that activation of PLC-β2 by Gβγ is Gβ isoform-independent (Gβ1/γ2 being equally effective as Gβ5/γ2) while MAPK/ERK and JNK/SAPK activation appeared to be Gβ isoform-dependent and was much more efficiently activated with Gβ1/γ2 than with Gβ5/γ2 (17Zhang S. Coso O. Lee C. Gutkind J. Simonds W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the modulations of two AC isoforms by specific Gβγ combinations. Utilizing cotransfection of Gβ and Gγ together with AC isoforms I and II, we observed differential modulation of AC activities by specific combinations of Gβγ. We found that AC type I was inhibited by both Gβ1/γ2 and Gβ5/γ2. On the other hand, AC II activity was stimulated by one isoform of Gβ (β1) while inhibited by another (β5). COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Bethesda, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. cDNAs of AC I and II were used in the pXMD1 vector under control of the adenovirus-2 major late promoter (18Kluxen F.-W. Lübbert H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AC I cDNA was released from pSK-AC-I (19Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G.

AC II cDNA was released from pSK-AC-II (20Feinstein P.G. Schrader K.A. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. Reed R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24418-24423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA for Gα-transducin (αT) was provided by Dr. J. S. Gutkind. Constitutively active Gαs(GαsQ227L) was obtained from Dr. H. Bourne (23Zachary I. Masters S.B. Bourne H.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1184-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the indicated cDNAs by the DEAE-dextran chloroquine method (24Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Vectors were added to complement the amount of cDNA in the transfection mixture to 6–7 μg. 24 h later, the cells were trypsinized and cultured for an additional 24 h in 24-well plates for AC activity assay or in 10-cm dishes to check protein expression by Western blots. Transfection efficiency, as determined by staining for β-galactosidase (25Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) activity following transfection with the plasmid expressing the enzyme, was 60–80%. The assays were performed in triplicate as described (26Bayewitch M. Rhee M. Avidor-Reiss T. Breuer A. Mechoulam R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9902-9905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 24-well plates were incubated for 3 h with 0.25 ml/well of fresh growth medium containing 5 μCi/ml [3H]adenine. This medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (0.5 mm) and RO-20–1724 (0.5 mm). Unless otherwise indicated, the AC stimulants forskolin (FS) or ionomycin (which increases intracellular Ca2+ and thus increases the activity of AC I) were immediately added at 1 μmconcentrations, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reaction was terminated with 1 ml of 2.5% perchloric acid containing 0.1 mm unlabeled cAMP. Aliquots of 0.9 ml were neutralized and applied to a two-step column separation procedure (27Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The [3H]cAMP was eluted into scintillation vials and counted. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped in PBS, and spun down at 5000 rpm (4 °C for 5 min), and cell pellets were mixed with 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), sonicated, and frozen. Prior to application on the gel, dithiothreitol (0.1 m final) was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels (8% for AC and 12% for Gβ) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose was blocked in PBS containing 5% fat-free milk and 0.5% Tween-20 for 1 h followed by 1.5 h of incubation with either BBC-1 monoclonal antibody (against AC I), BBC-4 monoclonal antibody (against AC II) (29Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 30Droste M. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), RA polyclonal antibody (against Gβ1), or SGS polyclonal antibody (against Gβ5) (17Zhang S. Coso O. Lee C. Gutkind J. Simonds W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Blots were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.3% Tween-20 and secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled rat anti-mouse or HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:20,000 in 5% fat-free milk plus 0.5% Tween-20 and incubated with the blot for 1 h, and the blot was extensively washed (>2 h) with PBS containing 0.3% Tween-20. Peroxidase activity was observed by the ECL chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Corp.). We have performed cotransfection experiments of AC I together with Gβ1 or Gβ5 and Gγ2. Activation of AC I is known to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ ions (8Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, we have assayed the activity of this isozyme in the presence of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (1 μm) together with FS (1 μm). This combination was shown to synergistically stimulate AC I activity (11Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The endogenous AC activity present in COS cells was not significantly affected by ionomycin and thus contains very little Ca2+-stimulated AC isozymes. As shown in Fig.1 A, AC I activity was significantly inhibited upon cotransfection with either Gβ1 or Gβ5together with Gγ2. The individual Gβ1, Gβ5, and Gγ2 subunits had no inhibitory activity on their own. Western blots of AC I protein (see Fig.1 B) reveals that the levels of AC I were not affected by the cotransfection of the other cDNAs. Our results thus indicate that the inhibitory effect mediated by Gβγ subunits, originally found in membrane assays, can also be observed in a whole cell system and that both Gβ1 and Gβ5 are effective in the inhibition of AC I, provided that Gγ2 is present. The AC II subtype is known to be stimulated by free Gβγ (8Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have performed cotransfection of AC II with constitutively active Gαs(GαsQ227L) and, where indicated, with Gβ1or Gβ5 and with Gγ2. The amounts of cAMP in these cells were determined 2 days after transfection. In addition, we have treated the cells for 10 min with a mixture of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, IBMX and RO-20–1724, and assayed the amounts of cAMP following this incubation. From the results shown in Fig. 2, it is clear that transfection with AC II increased the amounts of cAMP present in the cells under both conditions. As expected, transfection with Gβ1caused a further increase in cAMP accumulation. This is due to AC II activation since it was not observed when Gβ1 was transfected to COS cells without the addition of AC II plasmid (data not shown) or when it was transfected with AC I (Fig. 1). The increase of AC II activity mediated by Gβ1 was not significantly affected by the addition of Gγ2, which by itself had no effect. Interestingly, in contrast to Gβ1, Gβ5 caused a siginificant inihibition of AC II activity, and the addition of Gγ2 increased this inhibition. These results show that in contrast to AC I, AC II is differentially affected by Gβ1 and Gβ5, thus demonstrating a level of specificity within the Gβ family members in regards to their ability to affect AC II activity. Western blot analysis of the AC II protein levels under the various transfection conditions revealed that AC II expression was not affected by the cotransfection with Gβ and Gγ subunits. The experiments shown in Figs.1 and 2 were performed with relatively large amounts of Gβ and Gγ cDNAs. They were, therefore, repeated with Gβ1 and Gβ5 cDNAs at various concentrations. Fig.3 A demonstrates that the inhibition of AC I reaches maximal values when concentrations of cDNAs of Gβ1 or Gβ5 are above 2.5 μg. The efficiencies of inhibition by transfected Gβ1 and Gβ5 (in the presence of Gγ2) were similar. Half-maximal effect was observed with ∼1 μg of Gβ1and 2 μg of Gβ5 cDNAs. The inhibition observed for AC I activity was dependent on the presence of Gγ2 (2 μg/plate) for both Gβ1 and Gβ5. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the level of stimulation of AC II by Gβ1 is dependent on the amount of Gβ1cDNA used, reaching a maximum above ∼1 μg of transfected cDNA. The addition of 2 μg Gγ2 cDNA to the transfection mixture increased the effect observed with Gβ1 cDNA alone by only a marginal value of approximately 10%. Conversely, transfection of Gβ5cDNA caused a marked inhibition of AC II activity, and this inhibition was greatly enhanced by the presence of transfected Gγ2. Maximal inhibition (∼30%) was observed with 5 μg of Gβ5 cDNA/10-cm culture dish, while in the presence of Gγ2, maximal inhibition (of the same level of 30%) was already observed with ∼1 μg of Gβ5cDNA. Since we have demonstrated that the Gβ5/γ2 combination can be inhibitory to AC II activity, it became of interest to characterize the role of endogenous Gβγ in COS-7 cells with respect to AC II modulation. To investigate this question, we utilized a number of molecular tools that were shown to interfere with Gβγ activity. A mutant form of Gγ2 that lacks the prenylation site (Gγ2C68S) and which therefore cannot anchor to the membrane has been shown to redirect Gβ subunits into the cellular cytosol (21Garritsen A. Gallan P.V. Simonds W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7706-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Garritsen A. Simonds W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24418-24423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, wild-type Gαsubunits such as αT combines with Gβγ and interferes with Gβγ-mediated signaling (11Avidor-Reiss T. Nevo I. Saya D. Bayewitch M. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5040-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A demonstrates the effect of cotransfection of the above mentioned proteins on AC II activity in COS-7 cells. A marked inhibition of AC II activity was observed in cells cotransfected with αT. Gγ2C68S also produced a significant inhibition of AC II activity although the efficacy of inhibition compared with αT was noticeably less. The cotransfection of αT and Gγ2C68S with AC II did not have any effect on the expression of AC II (data not shown). These results suggest that Gβγ in COS cells has a role in the stimulation of AC II activity. Fig. 4 B demonstrates that COS cells do indeed express endogenous Gβ1, but appear to be devoid of Gβ5. Transfection of COS cells with Gβ1 or Gβ5 cDNAs led to a significant increase in the levels of Gβ1 and Gβ5 protein in the cell membranes. There are many reports that show involvement of the Gβγ dimer complex in the regulation of various effectors including PLC-β2, MAPK/ERK, JNK/SAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and several AC isozymes (5Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 8Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Most of these experiments were performed either in whole cells using Gβγ scavengers (i.e. molecules that strongly interact with Gβγ and block its ability to modulate effectors) or with cell membranes. In the latter case, the Gβγ used for most of the experiments has been with either baculovirus/Sf9 recombinant Gβ and Gγ preparations or with a mixture of a large repertoire of Gβγ heterodimers, such as in Gβγpreparations purified from bovine brain. Therefore, there has been little information regarding the possible differences in activities between the various Gβ and Gγ subunits composing the Gβγ dimers in intact cells. Following the cloning of specific Gβ and Gγ isoforms, it has become possible to dissect the individual Gβ and Gγ combinations that affect AC activity. In a previous study, using transfection of intact cells with Gβ1 or Gβ5 cDNAs, we showed that Gβ1 and Gβ5 differ in their ability to activate MAPK/ERK and JNK/SAPK but not in their capacity to activate PLC-β2 (17Zhang S. Coso O. Lee C. Gutkind J. Simonds W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we have used the same approach to investigate the role of Gβ1 and Gβ5 in the modulation of two types of AC isozymes: AC I, previously shown to be inhibited by Gβγ heterodimers, and AC II, previously reported to be stimulated by Gβγ (8Taussig R.

We found that Gβ1 and Gβ5 do not markedly differ in their capacity to inhibit AC I and that in both cases, the inhibition was dependent on the cotransfection of a Gγ subunit. Our observations with AC II showed that while Gβ1/γ2 yielded stimulation of this isoform, in agreement with previously reported activities of Gβγ(7Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

Gβ5/γ2 caused a marked inhibition of AC II activity, demonstrating selective effects of Gβsubunits on the activity of this AC isoform. Interestingly, transfected Gβ1 was by itself sufficient in stimulating AC II activity. This is probably due to its capacity for recruiting endogenous Gγ present in the cell. Gβ5 also had some effect on its own, although its effect on the inhibition of AC II was significantly enhanced by cotransfection of Gγ2. As previously proposed (17Zhang S. Coso O. Lee C. Gutkind J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24418-24423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest a difference in the capacity of Gβ1 and Gβ5 to interact with Gγ subunits. It is known that of the six cloned Gβ isoforms, Gβ5 shares only a 53% homology compared with the other Gβ isoforms (5Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The unique sequence of Gβ5may be the source of the different effects on AC II activity that we have observed. It should be noted that this specific activity could have been missed in prior studies in which Gβγ was tested in in vitro membrane reconstitution assays due to the possibility that the concentration of Gβ5 in the pool of Gβγ (usually purified from bovine brain) may have been too small. The activity of Gβ5 may have been masked by other Gβ subunits present in the preparation, and therefore, the levels of Gβ5 were not high enough to observe any inhibitory effects on AC II activity. In summary, Gβ1 and Gβ5 represent two distinct forms of the Gβ subunit, as based on their sequence, expression pattern, and ability to affect downstream signaling proteins (17Zhang S. Coso O. Lee C. Gutkind J. Simonds W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33575-33579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Watson A. Katz A. Simon M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that they also differ in their capacity to affect the activity of AC type II. Future studies should allow complete characterization of the various Gβγ combinations influencing the activity of each of the AC isozymes and elucidate the finer regulation of Gβγ signaling within the AC system."

The Rh (Rhesus) protein family is currently known to consist of three erythroid-specific integral membrane proteins, the Rh50 glycoprotein and two Rh30 (RhD and RhCE) polypeptides (1Huang C.-H. Curr.

By contrast, the 409-amino acid Rh50 glycoprotein in itself does not carry Rh antigens but rather interacts with Rh30 polypeptides to form a protein complex, thereby functioning as a coexpressor to facilitate Rh antigen disposition in the erythrocyte membrane (8Ridgwell K.

Apart from being a structural unit of Rh antigen expression, the Rh50 and Rh30 proteins appear to possess some hitherto undefined roles essential for the function and integrity of plasma membranes. This proposal is highlighted primarily by the occurrence of Rh deficiency syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a chronic hemolytic anemia of varying severity, a hereditary spherostomatocytosis, and multiple membrane abnormalities (1Huang C.-H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Cartron J.-P. Agre P. Blood Cell Biochem. 1995; 6: 189-225Crossref Google Scholar, 3Cartron J.-P. Blood Rev. 1994; 8: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Rh deficiency syndrome exists in two conditions in which a complete absence of all Rh antigens defines the Rhnull status and a barely detectable presence defines the Rhmod phenotype (11Race R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man. 6th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, London1975: 78-260Google Scholar,12Nash R. Shojania A.M. Am. J. Hematol. 1987; 24: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both conditions exhibit an absence or weakened expression of several other membrane glycoproteins or associated antigens, including Rh50, CD47, LW, Duffy (Fy5), and glycophorin B (GPB for SsU) (1Huang C.-H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Cartron J.-P. Agre P. Blood Cell Biochem. 1995; 6: 189-225Crossref Google Scholar, 3Cartron J.-P. Blood Rev. 1994; 8: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Rh deficiency syndrome can be regarded as a disorder of impaired protein-protein interactions. As shown by family studies, Rh deficiency is almost invariably associated with consanguinity and can occur on different genetic backgrounds (11Race R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man. 6th Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, London1975: 78-260Google Scholar, 12Nash R. Shojania A.M. Am. J. Hematol. 1987; 24: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amorph type of Rhnull is thought to arise by silencing mutations at the RH30 locus encoding RhD and RhCE polypeptides, but its underlying molecular defect has remained to be determined (13Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Le Van Kim C. D'Amrosio A.-M. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 656-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Carritt B. Blunt T. Avent N. Daniels G. Steers F. Ann. Hum.

In contrast, the regulator Rhnull and Rhmod phenotypes are considered to result from suppressor or “modifier” mutations independent of theRH30 locus (16Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Gane P. Mattei M.-G. Bailly P. Gibbs B. Colin Y. Cartron J.-P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The genuine interaction of Rh50 with Rh30 proteins in Rh complex formation points to RH50 locus as a primary candidate responsible for the suppressor forms of Rh deficiency. To facilitate the identification of such suppressor mutations, the organization of Rh50 gene has now been delineated. Here, I describe the exon/intron structure of the Rh50 gene and identification of its associated splicing defect as a loss-of-function mutation in one Rhnull patient. The findings reported herein correlate the disease phenotype with an impaired Rh complex formation and provide evidence for the importance of the C-terminal region of Rh50 participating in protein-protein interactions. Blood samples from normal human blood donors with RhD-positive (RhD+) and RhD-negative (RhD−) phenotypes (defined by DCe/DCe anddce/dce genotypes) were used as controls. The Rhnull blood sample was obtained from a Japanese patient (T. T.). Preliminary studies showed that the propositus was a homozygote for the regulator type of Rhnull disease and no Rh antigen was detectable by serologic testing. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the RH30 locus was grossly intact without apparent gene deletion or rearrangement (15Huang C.-H. Reid M.E. Chen Y. Coghlan G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from reticulocyte polysomes using the differential cell lysis method (17Goossens M. Kan Y.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), followed by extraction with the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Genomic DNA was prepared from leukocyte pellets, as described previously (18Huang C.-H. Guizzo M.L. McCreary J. Leigh E.M. Blumenfeld O.O. Blood. 1991; 77: 381-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was performed using Rh50, Rh30, and CD47 cDNA probes generated with gene-specific primers (see below) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products). To determine the structural organization of the Rh50 gene, genomic DNA from a normal person was digested separately with restriction endonucleases EcoRV, HincII,PvuII, SmaI, SspI, andStuI. The total digests of each restriction enzyme were ligated to the same adaptor to generate a genomic library using the Marathon amplification kit (CLONTECH). The exon and its adjacent intron sequences were then amplified in two steps using the Taq DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (19Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). The first step employed the adaptor primer (AP1) and a Rh50 gene-specific primer (GSP1), whereas in the second step, nested AP2 and GSP2 were used. The resultant products were analyzed by agarose gel and sequenced after purification by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

To assay the donor splice site mutation, the genomic region spanning exon 7 of RH50 in normal and Rhnull was amplified. For PmlI digestion, the fragment was amplified with intron primers 6s and 7a: intron 6s, 5′-GCCCAGCTATAGCTGTGTTTCAGT-3′ (nt −80 to −56 upstream of exon 7); and intron 7a, 5′-CTAATGATCTTCTCTCAGGCGCGT-3′ (nt 128–152 downstream of exon 7).

All amplified cDNA and genomic DNA products were purified by native 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sequenced with either amplimers or nested primers. Nucleotide sequence determination was carried out using fluorescent dye-tagged chain terminators on an automated DNA sequencer (model 373A, Applied Biosystems). The resultant nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the DNASIS program (Hitachi), and the deduced amino acid sequences were assessed for hydropathy character using the Kyte-Doolittle plotting method (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). To delineate the structural organization of the Rh50 gene, a bidirectional walking approach was taken to retrieve unknown sequences (Fig.1 A). 40 synthetic primers that cover various coding sequences (Table I) were used in combination to amplify the adaptor-ligated, restriction enzyme-specific genomic libraries. Fig. 1 A shows a representative panel of the resultant Rh50gene products, each spanning a unique exon/intron junction. They range in size from several hundred base pairs (bp) to several kilobase pairs, depending on the distribution of restriction sites. Sequencing of these amplified products revealed the features of the Rh50 gene and confirmed no coamplification from the related Rh30 genes. The translated sequence of Rh50 was found to be distributed in 10 exons whose size ranges from 15 (exon 10) to 184 bp (exon 2) (Fig.1 B). This global organization is strikingly similar to that of the Rh30 genes (23Huang C.-H. Blood. 1996; 88: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cherif-Zahar B. Le Van Kim C. Rouillac C. Raynal V. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Genomics. 1994; 19: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and is essentially conserved in the Rh50 homologues from the mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans. 2Z. Liu and C.-H. Huang, unpublished observations.Comparison of Rh50 with Rh30 showed that their sequence homology is confined mainly to exons 2–9, whereas their 5′ or 3′ regions share little or no sequence similarity. The size of all internal exons except exons 7 and 8 was conserved, and exon 2 of Rh50 was missing codon AGT for Ser99, which is present in Rh30 genes (5Cherif-Zahar B. Bloy C. Le Van Kim C.

Thus, Rh50 and Rh30 show the same assignment of exon/intron junctions except for a difference in their exon 7/exon 8 boundaries (Fig.1 B). The 5′ region of Rh50 has several putative cis-acting elements (Fig. 2), including the TATA boxes that are absent from the proximal promoter of both RhD and RhCE (23Huang C.-H.

This mapping result was consistent with the assignment of ATG initiation codon noted in bone marrow Rh50 mRNAs (8Ridgwell K. Spurr N.K. Laguda B. MacGeoch C. Avent N.D. Tanner J.M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), although the genomic sequence indicated a potential occurrence of another in-frame ATG codon upstream (nt −96 to −94) (Fig. 2). A detailed study of the Rh50 gene, including the mapping of its introns and dissection of its promoter activity and transcription initiation sites, will be described elsewhere. 3Z. Liu and C.-H. Huang, manuscript in preparation. Fig. 3 schematically shows the nucleotide sequence of splice sites as well as the structure of exon/intron junctions in the Rh50 gene. All the 5′ donor and 3′ acceptor splice sites conform to the “GT-AG” rule and possess the consensus splicing signals (25Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7156-7174Crossref Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Of the 10 exons identified, only exon 6 is symmetrical, having intraexon codons GTT (Val270) and ACT (Thr315) at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, whereas the other exons have either one or two split interexon codons (Fig. 3). One potential consequence of this type of exon/intron arrangement is that skipping of any single internal exon, except exon 6, during the splicing of Rh50 pre-mRNA would result in a shift in open reading frame and, therefore, alter the encoded amino acid sequence downstream of the skipped exon. To identify the molecular defect underlying the Rhnull disease, the expression of candidate genes encoding the Rh50, Rh30, and CD47 proteins was characterized by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The full-length cDNA of Rh30 or CD47 was readily detectable in normal and Rhnull erythroid cells (gels not shown), indicating a comparable expression of the corresponding mRNA. Sequencing showed that the Rh30 or CD47 cDNA from Rhnull was normal and that the Rh30 cDNA contained both RhD and RhCe, indicating that the patient was aDCe/DCe homozygote. Definition of this Rh genotype by transcript analysis was in full agreement with the result of DNA typing by SphI polymorphisms (15Huang C.-H. Reid M.E. Chen Y. Coghlan G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). These data showed that theRH30 or CD47 locus itself is not responsible for the disease phenotype. However, RT-PCR analysis of Rh50 gene expression in erythroid cells revealed an important difference between the normal and Rhnull patient. Although there was no apparent change in size of the 5′ portion of Rh50 cDNA encompassing exons 1–5, the 3′ portion of Rh50 cDNA encompassing exons 4–10 always showed a truncation in the Rhnull patient (Fig.4 A). This finding indicated that the Rh50 mRNA from Rhnull could be an aberrantly spliced form lacking a portion of the 3′ sequence. Indeed, sequencing showed that the 122-bp sequence of exon 7 was excluded from the truncated cDNA, resulting in the connection of exon 6 to exon 8 (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the skipping was complete or partial, a 3′ RACE reaction was carried out using 7 s and 3′-UTR primers. A cDNA product of expected size (376 bp) was found in normal controls but not in the Rhnull patient (Fig.4 C), indicating that no splicing of exon 7 occurred for the Rh50 primary transcript. Further studies showed that this exon skipping was not seen in 15 normal subjects nor in other Rhnullpatients examined; thus, it could not be a constitutive splicing or regulated alternative splicing event. The complete absence of exon 7 associated with Rh50 cDNA suggested strongly that either a splicing defect or a genomic deletion was present in the cognate gene. To define the nature of the underlying mutation, amplification from Rhnull genomic DNA of a segment encompassing exon 7 of the Rh50 gene was attempted. A fragment of 354 bp in size was detected, excluding the possibility of gene deletion. Sequencing of this fragment on both strands led to the identification of a single G → A mutation in the invariant GT element (+1 position) of the 5′ donor splice site attached to exon 7 (Fig. 5 A). Sequencing of other exon/intron junctions amplified with intron-specific primers (data not shown) confirmed this mutation to be the only structural alteration in the Rh50 gene. Because the mutation abolished a PmlI restriction site (CAC↓GTG) (Fig. 3) and introduced a novel NlaIII site (↓CATG), a direct diagnostic assay was performed on amplified exon 7-containing fragments. The two enzymes showed an opposite cleavage pattern in normal and Rhnull fragments (Fig.5 B), confirming the mutation at the splicing junction. To demonstrate that loss of the PmlI site was not caused by PCR spurious mutations, Southern blot of native genomic DNAs was hybridized with a probe spanning the exon7/intron 7 junction. As shown, thePmlI specific band was seen in normal but not in Rhnull (Fig. 5 C). Given the observation of no dosage reduction in RH50, these results confirmed that the patient is homozygous for the G → A splicing mutation. Such a genotype assignment is consistent with the inheritance of Rhnull syndrome in an autosomal recessive fashion. To gain information on the primary structure of Rh50 glycoprotein, the Rhnull-associated Rh50 cDNAs were sequenced to completion. Compared with normal Rh50, no point mutation other than an absence of the sequence encoded by exon 7 was observed in the Rhnull patient (Fig.6 A). Because exon 7 is asymmetric in codon distribution at the 5′ side (Fig. 3), its complete skipping and the subsequent joining of exon 6 with exon 8 inevitably resulted in an open reading frame shifting (Fig. 6 A). In turn, the deduced translation product would be truncated and prematurely terminated, containing only 351 amino acid residues. This includes the loss of 41 amino acid residues encoded in exon 7 and gain of an entirely new sequence of 36 residues following Thr315(Fig. 6 A). Compared with the wild-type Rh50 protein (8Ridgwell K. Spurr N.K. Laguda B. MacGeoch C. Avent N.D. Tanner J.M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), hydropathy plot analysis of the mutant form suggested two possible alterations in membrane organization of the C-terminal region (Fig. 6 B). (i) Deletion of the exon 7-coding sequence abolishes the 5th intracellular loop as well as the 11th TM segment. (ii) The inherent frameshift and premature termination further eliminates the last TM domain, and the resulting new sequence would face the cytoplasmic side due to lack of a continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues. Apparently, loss of a normal C-terminal portion of the Rh50 protein is the major cause for the perturbation of Rh complex formation in the Rhnullerythrocyte. Rh50 glycoprotein is a critical coexpressor of Rh30 polypeptides, the carriers of erythrocyte Rh antigens (1Huang C.-H. Curr. Opin.

Here, the exon/intron structure of Rh50 gene has been delineated, which should facilitate identification of mutations underlying the suppressor forms of Rh deficiency syndrome. A homology-based approach coupling with bidirectional walking revealed that Rh50 is a single copy gene with 10 exons and has a global organization strikingly similar to its related Rh30 members (23Huang C.-H. Blood. 1996; 88: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cherif-Zahar B. Le Van Kim C. Rouillac C. Raynal V. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Genomics. 1994; 19: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Both the structural conservation and sequence homology of the two genes are confined mainly to exons 2–9, while their 5′ and 3′ regions, including the promoter and untranslated sequences, share little or no similarity. Since Rh50 and Rh30 genes are located on different chromosomes (5Cherif-Zahar B. Bloy C. Le Van Kim C. Blanchard D. Bailly P. Hermand P. Salmon C. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our recent studies suggest that Rh50 and Rh30 genes originated from a common ancestor and were linked to each other following their initial duplication; later, one was translocated and diverged as the independent locus on a separate chromosome. 4C.-H. Huang, J. Cheng, Y. Chen, and Z. Liu, unpublished observations. Comparative analysis of the Rh50 and Rh30 gene orthologues in lower organisms should help decipher the evolutionary pathway ultimately leading to the establishment of two genetic loci encoding the Rh family proteins inHomo sapiens. The extreme rareness, recessive nature, and consanguineous background of Rh deficiency syndrome (11Race R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man. 6th Ed.

Hematol. 1987; 24: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) point to a heterogeneous spectrum of the underlying mechanisms. At present, the molecular defect atRH30 locus responsible for the amorph type of Rhnull remains unknown (13Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Le Van Kim C. D'Amrosio A.-M. Bailly P. Cartron J.-P. Colin Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 656-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Carritt B. Blunt T. Avent N. Daniels G. Steers F. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1993; 57: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Huang C.-H. Reid M.E. Chen Y. Coghlan G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that the RH50 locus is the prime target of suppressor mutations resulting in the regulator Rhnull disease. (i) Rh50 is thought to directly interact with Rh30, and the deficiency of the two proteins in the plasma membrane occurs in parallel (9Eyers S.A.S. Ridgwell K. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mallinson G. Anstee D.J. Avent N.D. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J.A. Daniels G.L. Tippett P. von dem Borne A.E.G. Transfusion. 1990; 30: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). (ii) Despite a close link of Rhnull with absence or deficiency in GPB, Duffy, or LW, the erythrocytes lacking these glycoproteins per se exhibit no change in the Rh antigen expression and no apparent perturbations in membrane physiology and cell morphology (27Huang C.-H. Johe K.K. Moulds J.J. Siebert P.D. Fukuda M. Blumenfeld O.O. Blood. 1987; 70: 1830-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tournamille C. Colin Y. Cartron J.-P. Le Van Kim C. Nat.

Presumably these proteins are casually associated components not essential for the interaction and membrane assembly of Rh family proteins. (iii) Although CD47 is also reduced in Rhnull state, its low level of expression is restricted to erythroid cells but not to other hematopoietic cells (31Avent N.D. Judson P.A. Parsons S.F. Mallison G. Anstee D.J. Tanner M.J.A. Evans P.R. Hodges E. Maciver A.G. Holmes C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Lindberg F.P. Lublin D.M. Telen M.J. Veile R.A. Miller Y.E. Donis-Keller H. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1567-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CD47 deficiency occurs as the consequence of, rather than the cause for, the defect in Rh complex formation. (iv) More recently, two small DNA deletions causing frameshift in the Rh50 gene have been found to be associated with the regulator Rhnull phenotype in unrelated patients (16Cherif-Zahar B. Raynal V. Gane P. Mattei M.-G. Bailly P. Gibbs B. Colin Y. Cartron J.-P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that this Rhnull patient had a grossly intact RH30 locus occurring in the form ofDCe/DCe haplotype combination (15Huang C.-H. Reid M.E. Chen Y. Coghlan G. Okubo Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar). The present study confirmed this assignment and showed further that the RH30locus gave rise to expression of both RhD and RhCe transcripts with sequences identical to that from normal subjects. These results, together with the identification of a normal CD47 gene, exclude the involvement of mutations of RH30 or CD47 locus in this Rhnull patient. However, transcript analysis showed that there was no expression in the Rhnull cells of any full-length form of Rh50 mRNAs except the shortened one specifically lacking the sequence of exon 7. Genomic sequencing revealed the occurrence of a homozygous G → A mutation in the invariant GT element of 5′ donor splice site as the only alteration in the Rh50 gene. These findings establish the pre-mRNA splicing defect, for the first time, as the suppressor mutation ofRH50 leading to a loss-of-function phenotype characteristic of the regulator form of Rhnull disease. Mutations in the GT and AG motifs of the donor and acceptor splice sites, the cis-acting elements essential for pre-mRNA splicing (33Padgett R.A. Grabowski P.J. Konarska M.M. Seiler S. Sharp P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 1119-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), portray an important mechanism for the origin of human genetic diseases (34Krawczak M. Reiss J. Cooper D.N. Hum. Genet. 1992; 90: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The donor splice site mutation described here has caused a complete skipping of exon 7 from the mature form of Rh50 mRNA in the Rhnull patient. Significantly, such a splicing event not only excluded a coding sequence for 41 amino acids but resulted in a frameshift after the codon for Thr315 and a premature chain termination after the codon for Ile351. Therefore, the deduced Rh50 mutant protein contains only 351 amino acids, including a stretch of 36 new residues at the C terminus. Correlation of these primary changes with regulator Rhnulldisease provides new insight regarding how different mutations might act as suppressors to disrupt or modify the protein-protein interactions that dictate the Rh complex formation. Prior studies suggested that there may be a direct contact between Rh50 and Rh30 via their N-terminal sequences (9Eyers S.A.S. Ridgwell K. Mawby W.J. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Avent N.D. Liu W. Warner K.M. Mawby W.J. Jones J.W. Ridgwell K. Tanner M.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14233-14239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, additional interacting sites are likely to be present in the Rh protein complex. For the Rh50 mutant reported here, its only difference from the wild-type lies C-terminal to the 10th putative TM domain (Fig. 6). This suggests that the C-terminal half may also participate in the interaction directly and/or confer required conformation to stabilize that interaction. In support of this notion, we have identified in unrelated Rhnull patients several missense mutations that are clustered in the C-terminal region of the Rh50 protein.4 It is of further interest to note that such mutations all target the TM domains in the C-terminal half that are conserved in the Rh50 homologues from the mouse to C. elegans. Currently, little is known about how the disruption of the Rh protein complex causes the multiple facets of structural and functional abnormalities in the Rh-deficient erythrocytes. There is also a lack of general information regarding the involvement and coordination of possible intracellular factor(s) in the functioning of the Rh membrane complex. A full description of Rhnulldisease mutations and assessment of their phenotypic effects in model systems, such as C. elegans, should lead to a better understanding of the membrane assembly and structure/function relations of the Rh family of proteins. I am particularly grateful to Y. Okubo and M. Reid for providing and typing the Rhnull blood sample used in this investigation. I thank Y. Chen for technical assistance, and T. Ye for help in the construction of human Marathon genomic libraries. I also thank O. O. Blumenfeld and C. Redman for comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2092513493,"Phenotypes of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-18 and unc-64 gene mutations are similar. Whileunc-18 is known to be essential for normal synaptic transmission (Hosono, R., Hekimi, S., Kamiya, Y., Sassa, T., Murakami, S., Nishiwaki, S., Miwa, J., Taketo, A., and Kodaira, K.-I. (1992)J. Neurochem. 58, 1517–1525), the function ofunc-64 remains unclear. Here we describe the cloning, and the molecular and genetic characterization of the unc-64gene, especially in relation to unc-18. unc-64 encodes a protein (C. elegans syntaxin) showing sequence and structural similarities to mammalian syntaxin 1A. Fromunc-64, at least three types of poly(A)+ RNA are transcribed, which encode two types of syntaxin that differ in the deduced transmembrane domain. In gene expression, unc-64closely resembles unc-18, that is, both are expressed in neural cells, especially in motor neurons and neurons constituting head ganglions. C. elegans syntaxin binds to UNC-18 with high affinity. The unc-64 (e246) mutation producing a mild phenotype causes an Ala → Val conversion in the conserved COOH-terminal region in mammalian syntaxin 1A or Drosophilasyntaxin-1A whose site is included in three types of transcripts. The binding of the mutant C. elegans syntaxin to UNC-18 is greatly reduced, indicating the mutation site contributes to the binding."

This phenomenon of bystander killing has been previously investigated for herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) and has been shown to require cell to cell contact. Using silicon rings to separate E. coli PNP expressing cells from non-expressing cells sharing the same medium, we demonstrate that bystander cell killing by E. coli PNP does not require cell-cell contact. Initially, cells expressing E. coli PNP convert the non-toxic prodrug, 6-methylpurine-2′-deoxyriboside (MeP-dR) to the highly toxic membrane permeable toxin, 6-methylpurine (MeP). As the expressing cells die, E. coli PNP is released into the culture medium, retains activity, and continues precursor conversion extracellularly (as determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography of both prodrug and toxin). Bystander killing can also be observed in the absence of extracellular E. coli PNP by removing the MeP-dR prior to death of the expressing cells. In this case, 100% of cultured cells die when as few as 3% of the cells of a population express E. coli PNP. Blocking nucleoside transport with nitrobenzylthioinosine reduces MeP-dR mediated cell killing but not MeP cell killing.

In transient transfection, expression of E. coli PNP in as few as 1 in 1000 cells kills all of the bystander cells (7Hughes B.W. Wells A.H. Bebok Z. Gadi V.K. Garver Jr., R. Parker W.B. Sorscher E.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3339-3345PubMed Google Scholar,8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar). 3B. W. Hughes, S. A. King, P. W. Allan, W. B. Parker, and E. J. Sorscher, unpublished observations.3B. W. Hughes, S. A. King, P. W. Allan, W. B. Parker, and E. J. Sorscher, unpublished observations. The mechanism of killing involves the cleavage of MeP-dR by E. coli PNP to release the cell toxin 6-methylpurine (MeP), which can freely diffuse in and out of cells (Fig. 1). Measured levels of MeP production correlate with the degree of cell killing (8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar, 9Parker W.B. King S.A. Allan P.W. Bennett L. Secrist J.A. Montgomery J.A. Gilbert K.S. Waud W.R. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Sorscher E.J. Human Gene Therapy. 1997; 8: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The importance of the development of methods that optimize bystander killing is evident, since it is not currently possible to deliver a reporter or therapeutic gene to greater than 10 to 20% of cells in most abnormal tissue with any of the available in vivo gene delivery protocols. We have hypothesized that potent bystander killing by E. coli PNP is mediated by intracellular generation of the MeP toxin that is released into the local environment, and that cell contact is not necessary for killing to occur. In this study, we show that theE. coli PNP/MeP-dR system can kill bystander cells physically separated from PNP expressing cells. We demonstrate a role for E. coli PNP released by dying cells in the extracellular conversion of prodrug to toxin and define the kinetics of E. coli PNP activity with respect to prodrug exposure time and concentration. Furthermore, we show that cell proliferation is abolished in a fashion that exhibits both time and dose dependence upon either the amount of prodrug added or the level of E. coliPNP expressed. D54 were human glioma cells obtained from the American Tissue Type Collection. MT539, mouse glioma cells, were a generous gift from Yancy Gillespie, University of Alabama, Birmingham. All cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earl's salts and 10% fetal bovine serum. D54-PNP and MT539-PNP cells were generated using an amphotropic retrovirus and the shuttle vector pLNSX to express E. coli PNP under SV40 promoter control (as described elsewhere (7Hughes B.W.

Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar)). To create a cloning ring barrier, the upper portion was cut off a 1-ml blue pipette tip (Fisher), autoclaved, dipped in sterile silicon vacuum grease (Dow Corning), and placed in the center of a well of 12-well tissue culture plate. Cells were seeded in the outside and inside the ring at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2. The following day the rings were removed, leaving behind a circular barrier of vacuum grease which the medium, but not cells could pass over. Following aspiration, 2 (Fig. 2) or 1 ml (Fig. 6 A) of medium containing either 100 μm MeP-dR or vehicle was placed into each well. To fix the cells, the medium was aspirated and replaced by 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline with Mg2+ and Ca2+, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The wells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and covered with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline until the entire plate was ready to stain. Following fixation of all of the wells in a plate, the cells were stained by incubating 1 ml of staining solution (1 mg/ml crystal violet in 70% ethanol) in each well for 10 min at room temperature and then immersing the plate in a beaker under running water until no more dye was released. D54-PNP cells were seeded at 30% confluency and grown for 5 days in a T-75 flask with or without MeP-dR. Cells and culture medium were removed from the flasks at the beginning of the experiment and after 5 days of culture. The samples were prepared and the activity ofE. coli PNP was determined using MeP-dR as a substrate as described (8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of MeP produced was determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar). MT539 mouse glioma cells were grown in 96-well plates and 100 μm MeP-dR was added. Proliferation was measured every other day using a cell proliferation assay (Celltiter 96 AQ, Promega) which detects the accumulation of tetrazonium salts by living cells (below). D54 human glioma cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates. For the time course assay, 100 μm drug in 100 μl of medium was added to each well. At 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, the drug was removed, the cells were washed with 250 μl of medium, and fresh medium was added. For studies of MeP-dR and MeP dose dependence, increasing concentrations of drug were incubated for 4 days. The cells were then washed with 250 μl of medium and fresh medium was added. Proliferation was measured every day by tetrazolium dye assay (18Givens K.T. Kitada S. Chen A.K. Rothschiller J. Lee D.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1856-1862PubMed Google Scholar). Medium was removed from the wells and 50 μl of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (5 mg/ml MTT in phosphate-buffered saline) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The MTT was then removed and 100 μl of dimethyl sulfate was added. After pipetting, the chromogen containing dimethyl sulfate solution was transferred to another 96-well tray and absorbance at 490 nm was read and compared with a standard curve for cell number calculation. Each point represents the average of three wells. S-(p-Nitrobenzyl)-6-thio-inosine (NBMPR) (Sigma) is an inhibitor of nucleoside transport and is prepared as a 10 mm stock solution in 50% dimethyl sulfate/sterile water. D54 cells in 96-well plates were treated for 1 h with either 1 μm NBMPR in medium or with vehicle (medium with an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfate). The cells were then washed and treated for 6 h with vehicle, 1 μmNBMPR, 1 μm NBMPR plus 100 μm MeP-dR or MeP, or 100 μm MeP-dR or MeP. Following treatment, cells were washed and medium added. Each point represents the average of three wells. Proliferation was measured daily using the MTT assay described above. To investigate whether or not bystander killing of non-E. coli PNP cells requires cell contact, cloning rings were attached with vacuum grease to the center of cell culture wells. For each pair of wells, the outside of the ring was seeded with D54 parental (non-E. coli PNP expressing) “bystander” cells, while the inside of each ring was seeded with either D54-PNP cells (which constitutively express E. coli PNP) or D54 parental cells. In this assay, the cells inside of the ring comprise approximately 10% of the total number of cells in the well. After a day, the rings were removed, leaving behind a 2–4-mm uncrossable barrier of vacuum grease separating the cells inside of the ring from the cells outside of the ring. This assay prevented physical contact between the cell populations while allowing them to share the same medium. Half of the well pairs were treated with 100 μm MeP-dR (Fig. 2, columns A andB). Within 2 days, cell growth was inhibited in the center well of D54-PNP cells treated with MeP-dR (Fig. 2, column A), while cells in all other wells, including the surrounding D54 parental cells, showed no qualitative decrease in growth. Over the next 4 days, D54-PNP center cells treated with MeP-dR declined to near zero. D54-parental bystander cells surrounding the D54-PNP cells treated with MeP-dR had stopped growing at day 3 (Fig. 2, column A). These bystander cells then declined rapidly to less than 1% of control cells (based on microscopic visual examination). No decrease in growth was seen in MeP-dR treated D54-parental center wells (Fig. 2,column B) or in untreated wells (Fig. 2, columns C and D). The lack of cell contact did not limit the ability of PNP transduced cells to kill bystander cells in the presence of MeP-dR. The decrease in the number of parental cells on day 6 lagged behind the death of D54-PNP cells by about 2 days (Fig. 2, column A), suggesting that the parental cells were exposed to a lethal event about 2 days after the D54-PNP cells were exposed. To test whether E. coli PNP was released by dyingE. coli PNP expressing cells, and whether the extracellular enzyme could contribute to MeP-dR conversion, we determined the amount of E. coli PNP activity present in either the medium or a cell pellet from a culture of D54-PNP cells (Fig. 3). Day 0 represents the baseline amount of E. coli PNP activity in cell pellet and culture medium of D54-PNP cells 24 h after plating. The amount of E. coliPNP activity in the cell pellets and medium from D54-PNP cells grown for 5 days in the presence or absence of 100 μm MeP-dR was determined. All D54-PNP cells treated with MeP-dR died by day 5 of drug treatment. The amount of E. coli PNP activity found in the medium of cultures killed with MeP-dR was 10-fold greater than the amount of PNP activity in medium of untreated cells. The E. coli PNP activity in the culture medium of D54-PNP cells treated with MeP-dR represents the total PNP activity released by the dying cells over several days. The total amount of E. coli PNP activity in the untreated D54-PNP cell pellet at day 5 was approximately 50% lower than the activity in the culture medium of cells after treatment with MeP-dR, which could suggest that the rate of PNP degradation inside of cells is higher than in the medium, or that the freeze/thaw protocol for cell lysis is a less efficient way to recover E. coli PNP than the release of the enzyme from dying cells. These results suggest that extracellular E. coli PNP released from dying cells remains active and stable over time. To confirm the release and stability of extracellularE. coli PNP, a second glioma cell line transduced withE. coli PNP (MT-539-PNP) was mixed in varying proportions with non-expressing cells (MT-539 parental) (9Parker W.B. King S.A. Allan P.W. Bennett L. Secrist J.A. Montgomery J.A. Gilbert K.S. Waud W.R. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Sorscher E.J. Human Gene Therapy. 1997; 8: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation and the concentrations of MeP-dR and MeP in the medium were measured over time. Even at 1% MT-539-PNP cells, all of the cells in the mixture died after MeP-dR treatment (Fig. 4). However, both the rate of cell death and the rate of MeP-dR conversion directly correlated with the increase in the proportion of cells expressing the PNP gene. MeP-dR conversion continued to rise at a steady rate even after all the cells in the culture were dead, confirming the stability of PNP enzyme in the medium. Because the rate of conversion was constant over time and dependent upon the percentage of cells initially expressing PNP, there appears to be little loss ofE. coli PNP activity due to degradation inside or outside of the cell. The smallest amount of MeP-dR converted to MeP that was sufficient to kill 100% of parental cells was approximately 4% (4 μm MeP). Equivalent amounts of MeP added directly to parental cells have been shown to mediate 100% cell killing in numerous cell lines (8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5D).3 In D54-PNP cells, an exposure to 100 μmMeP-dR for as little as 1 h led to a 50% decrease in growth of the cells by day 4 (Fig. 5 A). Exposure for 4 h or longer led to complete cell population death. A similar time course is seen when D54 parental cells are treated with MeP (Fig. 5 B). When D54-PNP cells were treated with various concentrations of MeP-dR for 4 days, as little as 0.78 μm MeP-dR caused a 25% reduction in growth (Fig. 5 C). When grown in concentrations of 3.1 μm MeP-dR or greater, all of the D54-PNP cells eventually died (by day 8, data not shown). The dose-response of D54 parental cells to MeP mirrors the D54-PNP response to MeP-dR (Fig.5 D). In contrast, D54 parental cells grown in 100 μm MeP-dR for 4 days showed growth reduction of less than 20% and no change in growth at concentrations of MeP-dR at 50 μm and below (data not shown). These results show that a brief exposure of PNP expressing cells to high concentrations of MeP-dR (100 μm for 4–8 h) or a prolonged exposure to 30-fold less MeP-dR (equal to or greater than 3.1 μm for 4 days) killed all cells. In addition to providing evidence of prodrug dose dependence, these experiments suggest the possibility that a variety of dosing schedules of MeP-dR might be therapeutically useful in the development of in vivo models of E. coli PNP cell killing. To determine the relative contributions to prodrug conversion of intracellular E. coli PNP and extracellular (free) enzyme, a cloning ring assay was performed with D54-PNP cells inside and D54 parental cells outside of the rings. The experiments were designed to briefly expose cells to MeP-dR, and remove the prodrug at a time before substantial cell lysis had occurred. In Fig. 6A, the treated wells were exposed to 100 μm MeP-dR for 24 or 48 h, washed, and given fresh medium, as shown. In wells treated with MeP-dR for 24 h, substantial bystander killing was evident on day 8 of the experiment, while in wells exposed to MeP-dR for 48 h, nearly all bystander cells were dead by day 5 (Fig. 6, A andC). The cell density of MeP-dR-treated D54-PNP cells (inside the ring) did not change between day 1 and day 2, suggesting that cell death was not pronounced during this period. However, profound bystander killing was observed by day 8, even when the prodrug, generated toxin, and any extracellular E. coli PNP enzyme were removed at the end of day 1. These results suggested that a strong bystander killing effect does not depend on the death of E. coli PNP expressing cells and consequent release of active enzyme into the extracellular environment. To further examine the effect of intracellular prodrug conversion on bystander killing, 1 and 3% mixtures of D54-PNP cells and D54 parental cells were treated with 100 μm MeP-dR for 48 h (a time period prior to a decrease in cell number). Afterward, the medium was exchanged (to remove any prodrug, toxin, or extracellular enzyme), and cell growth was measured using a MTT assay (Fig. 6 D). Four days after exchanging medium, the 3% mixture was completely killed. The 1% mixture grew briefly and then declined. Although PNP mediated cell killing can be augmented by extracellular conversion of prodrug by free enzyme (Fig. 4), the result in Fig. 6 Dsuggests that even without extracellular enzyme involvement, as few as 3% of cells need to express E. coli PNP for MeP-dR treatment to cause complete bystander killing. The human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1) has recently been cloned and characterized (19Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Because hENT1 facilitates the transport of nucleosides but not bases, hENT1 might be involved in MeP-dR transport, but not MeP transport. We used the drug NBMPR, an inhibitor of hENT1 transport, to block MeP-dR transport into D54-PNP cells (Fig. 7 A). D54-PNP cells treated with 1 μm NBMPR and 100 μm MeP-dR for 6 h grew moderately throughout the experiment. In the absence of NBMPR treatment, all of the MeP-dR-treated cells died. This result indicated that nucleoside transporter inhibition blocks cellular entry and cell killing by MeP-dR. The NBMPR had no effect on D54 parental cells treated with 100 μm MeP (Fig. 7 B) showing that uptake mechanisms for MeP differ from that of MeP-dR. Sensitization to MeP-dR has a high bystander effect in vitro. When 1% of a population of cells express the E. coli PNP gene, substantial toxicity to non-expressing cells occurs after addition of MeP-dR (Figs. 4 and 6). The mediator of the bystander killing is the toxin MeP (8Sorscher E.J. Peng S. Bebok Z. Allan P.W. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Gene Therapy. 1994; 1: 233-238PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 1, 4, and 5) which can diffuse between cells without the need for cell-cell contact (Fig. 2). A short time (1 h) is sufficient for a toxic effect of MeP-dR to occur, and a large therapeutic index between the lethal toxin dose in transduced cells (3–6 μm) and the dose of prodrug known to be tolerated in parental cells (100 μm, data not shown) was observed in vitro. The early death of expressing cells and subsequent death of non-expressing cells was observed in mixing experiments (Figs. 2, 4, and 6). Moreover, bystander cells continue to die even after the death of the PNP expressing cells (Figs. 2 and 6). The PNP enzyme is very stable and can participate in extracellular prodrug conversion even after producing cells have died. However, substantial bystander killing can occur in the absence of prodrug conversion by extracellular E. coli PNP released by dying cells (Fig. 6). MeP-dR appears to enter the cell via a nucleoside transporter (19Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) while the MeP toxin uses a different pathway to cross the membrane (Fig. 7). Therefore, E. coli PNP cells that develop resistance to MeP-dR uptake still might be killed by MeP generated by neighboring cells. Cell sensitization and regression with HSV-TK have been well established in preclinical animal models, and form the basis for multicenter clinical trials of central nervous system glioma and other human tumors, as well as for infectious diseases, rheumatologic conditions, and other disease states. However, bystander killing with the HSV-TK gene has been a limitation in vivo and in vitro. When fewer than 10% of cells express HSV-TK, efficient killing has been variable, and is not consistently obtained in many cell types (20Sacco M.G. Benedetti S. Duflotdancer A. Mesnil M. Bagnasco L.

Human Gene Therapy. 1995; 6: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the apparent reliance on gap junctions to transmit an activated toxin that is not membrane permeable precludes many cell types from HSV-TK bystander killing (22Wygoda M.R. Wilson M.R.

Human Gene Therapy. 1997; 8: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we have not observed any cell type which is resistant to drug sensitization and high bystander killing by E. coli PNP. The following are among those cells tested: HeLa (cervical cancer), HepG2 (hepatoma), LNCaP (prostate), Mel-1 (melanoma), B16 (mouse melanoma), D-54 (glioma), MT-539 (mouse glioma), SKV03 (ovarian cancer), T84 (colon cancer), 16/C (breast cancer), RT-2 (glioma), and 293 (renal). With each cell type, the entire population of cells could be killed when 1% or less of the cells expressed the E. coli PNP gene (over a 3–5-day exposure to prodrug). Similar conclusions have been reached by others (13Both G.W. Khatri A. Xu Z.Z. Boyle D.B. Blau H.M. Wilson J.M. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Gene Therapy. Keystone Symposia, Snowbird, UT1997: 26Google Scholar, 14Heinkelein M. Nestler U. Scheurlen W. Meixensberger J. Rethwilm A. Blau H.M. Wilson J.M. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Gene Therapy.

Keystone Symposia, Snowbird, UT1997: 68Google Scholar). From this list, we conclude that efficient bystander killing with E. coli PNP appears to be consistent across many cell types. In vivo, the generation of MeP within a tumor mass offers a means by which potent, novel toxins capable of killing bystander cells can be used to study tumor regression in many types of cancer. In investigations of the mechanism of MeP toxicity, 4W. B. Parker, P. W. Alan, S. C. Shaddix, G. Y. Gillespie, and L. L. Bennett, Jr., manuscript in preparation. we have demonstrated in human tumor cells that MeP: 1) is converted to an ATP analog, MeP-riboside triphosphate; 2) is incorporated into RNA and DNA; and 3) disrupts protein and RNA synthesis prior to affecting DNA synthesis. These results support the observation that MeP kills resting as well as proliferating cells (10Allan P.W. Shaddix S.C. Gillespie G.Y. Bennett Jr., L. Parker W.B. Proc. Am. Ass. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 379Google Scholar). Cells lacking adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of MeP (25Montgomery J.A. Hewson K. J. Med. Chem. 1968; 11: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which indicated that this enzyme is involved in the conversion of MeP into cytotoxic nucleotides. In contrast, prodrug activation by enzymes such as HSV-TK and cytosine deaminase cannot generate toxins that kill resting cells. Moreover, both of these alternatives lead to variable bystander killing when fewer than 10% of cells express the sensitization gene. Finally, at least for HSV-TK, extracellular enzyme does not participate in cell killing. One can argue that the generation of very potent agents within a tumor or other tissue could lead to uncontrolled systemic toxicity, or that the surprising stability of the E. coli PNP enzyme after cell death might be limiting in vivo, due to the generation of toxin in undesirable sites within an animal host. However, theE. coli PNP approach has recently been supported by in vivo studies which show complete tumor regressions and cures of tumors stably expressing the E. coli PNP gene, without apparent host toxicity (9Parker W.B. King S.A. Allan P.W. Bennett L. Secrist J.A. Montgomery J.A. Gilbert K.S. Waud W.R. Wells A.H. Gillespie G.Y. Sorscher E.J. Human Gene Therapy. 1997; 8: 1637-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The careful administration of the prodrug, therefore, appears to allow substantial anti-tumor effects despite both the highly toxic agents generated, and the stability of the E. coli PNP. In summary, we have shown that during the course of bystander killing, the prodrug, MeP-dR, kills cells expressing E. coli PNP first. Killing of bystander cells by expressing cells is efficiently mediated by a membrane permeable toxin produced by both intracellular PNP and by extracellular enzyme released by dying cells. Bystander cell killing is dose and time dependent. The toxin is approximately 30-fold more potent than the prodrug in the cells studied here, and the levels of toxin that are generated are sufficient to explain the bystander killing that is observed. These features provide a way to study cell sensitization in a number of cell types and human disease states, that take advantage of a simple and efficient mechanism for bystander killing.

Recent advances in NMR spectroscopy have had a major impact on macromolecular structure determination largely due to the advent of double and triple resonance three- and four-dimensional heteronuclear experiments (1Clore G.M.

Similarly, structural characterization of folded RNA molecules and their complexes by NMR has been greatly aided by the application of multidimensional heteronuclear techniques (for reviews, see Refs. 4Pardi A.

The marked success of these modern NMR techniques for proteins and RNA is in stark contrast to their rare application in DNA investigations. This is mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. Labeling proteins with NMR observable isotopes (13C and 15N) is commonly achieved by expressing the protein of interest in a suitable host, commonly inEscherichia coli, using a growth medium containing15N and 13C as sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Labeled RNA is generally obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (6Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar) and13C- and/or 15N-labeled ribonucleoside triphosphates prepared from RNA of organisms grown with15N- and 13C-enriched nutrients (7Batey R.T.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Isotope labeling of DNA has been difficult and most heteronuclear NMR studies on DNA oligonucleotides have been carried out using either13C at natural abundance (12Ashcroft J. Live D.H. Patel D.J. Cowburn D. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Schmieder P. Ippel J.H. van den Elst H. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Altona C. Kessler H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4747-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Radha P.K. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34: S18-S22Crossref Google Scholar) or site specific15N- and/or 13C-labeled chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. Isotopes have been incorporated either at particular atomic positions (15Michalczyk R. Silks L.A.I. Russu I.M. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34: S97-S104Crossref Google Scholar), uniformly in single nucleotides (16Ono A. Tate S. Ishido Y. Kainosho M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or uniformly in all nucleotides of a particular type (17Tate S. Ono A. Kainosho M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5977-5978Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The fact that structural studies using uniformly isotopically labeled DNA are lagging behind is almost exclusively due to the fact that the labeled phosphoamidites necessary for chemical synthesis are not commercially available and that their preparation is both extremely labor intensive and costly. More recently, a procedure for the enzymatic synthesis of uniformly 13C- and 15N-labeled DNA oligonucleotides has been reported (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this approach, labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates are prepared from DNA of organisms grown with 15N- and 13C-enriched nutrients in a similar manner to that described for the ribonucleoside triphosphates. DNA synthesis is carried out with DNA polymerase I and isotope-labeled triphosphates using a primer-template with a ribonucleotide at the 3′ terminus that allows for alkaline hydrolysis. Cleavage yields unlabeled primer-template and the labeled, newly synthesized single-stranded oligonucleotide. In this manner, uniformly labeled DNA can be prepared and structurally characterized by multidimensional heteronuclear NMR (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Zimmer D.P. Marino J.P. Griesinger C. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1996; 34: S177-S186Crossref Google Scholar, 20Smith D.E. Su J.-Y. Jucker F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this paper we present two additional methods for the large scale preparation of uniformly isotope-labeled DNA. The first method is akin in spirit to expressing the protein of interest in E. coli, using a growth medium based on 15N and 13C nutrients. The second method, which we have termed ESRA 1The abbreviations used are: ESRA, endonuclease sensitive repeat amplification; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; SRY, male sex-determining factor Y.1The abbreviations used are: ESRA, endonuclease sensitive repeat amplification; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; SRY, male sex-determining factor Y. forEndonuclease Sensitive RepeatAmplification, is PCR based and makes use of labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates similar in spirit to the above mentioned enzymatic approach. The novelty of our PCR strategy over existing ones consists of primer and template being the identical molecule, resulting in an exponential growth in the length of the double strand, which contains tandem repeats of the target DNA sequence. Both methods have several advantages compared with chemical synthesis and the Zimmer and Crothers (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) procedure. In particular, ESRA is superior in terms of ease of use, yields, and costs. We demonstrate the utility of both methods for the preparation of two double-stranded oligonucleotides: a 21-mer uniformly labeled with 15N and a 17-mer uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C. Two complementary SRY oligonucleotides, 5′-AATTCCCGGGTGTTTGTGCAG and 5′-AATTCTGCACAAACACCCGGG were annealed and ligated overnight. The products of this ligation reaction, exhibiting a distribution of lengths around ∼200 bp, were cloned into theEcoRI site of pUC8 (21Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar). Novablue cells (Novagen) were transformed with pUC8-SRY DNA and transformants were screened by restriction enzyme analysis. Several candidates containing multiple copies of the 21-bp oligonucleotide were further analyzed and propagated. Insert instability was observed and resulted in multiple shorter insert lengths after prolonged growth. One candidate plasmid pUC8-SRY#27 was transferred to E. coli Sure® (Stratagene) for storage and subsequently into E. coli GM1674 (kindly provided by M. G. Marinus, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester) for plasmid production. Cells bearing pUC8-SRY#27 were grown in 30 liters of minimal M9 medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1989Google Scholar) substituted with15NH4Cl and in the presence of 0.5% glucose, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 0.1 μg/ml biotin, and trace elements in a 50-liter fermentor until the glucose was depleted from the medium. An optical density of 7.0 at 600 nm roughly corresponds to a yield of 300 g wet weight of cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Giga plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen Inc, Chatsworth, CA). Typically 10–12 mg of plasmid DNA was purified from 40 g of cells and stored at 2 mg/ml in 6 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 6 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA at 4 °C. Restriction endonuclease digestion was performed in batches of 25 mg of plasmid at 0.4 mg of plasmid/ml of buffer and 0.25 units SmaI/μg of plasmid for 15–17 h at 25 °C according to the specifications of the provider (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The digested DNA was dialyzed against a 200-fold excess of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA using 2 kDa molecular mass cut-off membranes (Pierce) for 4 h at ambient temperature, diluted 2-fold in the same buffer, and subjected to anion-exchange column chromatography (Poros 50 HQ 1 × 10 cm, Perceptive Biosystems, Framington, MA). The double-stranded SRY-21 oligonucleotide (SRY-21) was fractionated with a gradient of 0.6–1m NaCl in 20 column volumes at a flow-rate of 7.5 ml/min. Peak fractions were concentrated to ∼1.5 ml in a Centriprep 3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and ethanol precipitated. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, washed with 95% cold ethanol, dried, and dissolved in DNA buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 25 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA). A yield of ∼1.1 mg of pure SRY-21 was obtained from 75 mg of plasmid and used for NMR studies. The oligonucleotide 5′-GGGTGTTTGTGCAGCCCGGGTGTTTGTGCAGCCC, which represents a repeat of the sequence 5′-GGGTGTTTGTGCAGCCC in tandem, and its complement were synthesized and purified on 15% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). 60 ng of each oligonucleotide were used in an amplification reaction using the Expand high fidelity PCR kit (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 0.2 mm uniformly labeled 13C,15N dNTPs (Martek Bioscience Corp., Gaithersburg, MD) and cycled 8 rounds at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min in a GeneAmp 9600 cycler (Perkin Elmer). This amplified mixture (700 μl) was used to further amplify 12.5 ml of reaction mixture cycled 40 times under the same conditions in 100-μl aliquots. Aliquots were pooled and digested withSmaI and subjected to column (0.5 × 5 cm) chromatography under conditions as described above for the 21-mer. The double-stranded SRY-17 oligonucleotide (SRY-17) was purified using a NaCl gradient of 0.5–0.9 m in 50 column volumes at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Peak fractions were concentrated, dialyzed extensively against DNA buffer, and concentrated further to yield a 0.3 mm solution. The concentrations of oligonucleotides were estimated both spectrophotometrically and by densitometry following gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DMX600 spectrometer equipped with x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum with a water flip back pulse and the 1H-13C constant time HSQC spectrum were recorded as described in Refs. 23Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1001) Google Scholar and 24Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 428-435Google Scholar, respectively. The application of multidimensional heteronuclear NMR techniques, which revolutionized solution structure determination of proteins, was intimately linked to advances in molecular biology that allowed for easy cloning of genes and the expression and purification of their isotopically labeled products. Access to labeled nucleic acids, on the other hand, has been difficult and up until now only isotopically enriched RNA oligonucleotides could be prepared with relative ease. Although chemical synthesis of DNA oligomers is a simple and automated procedure, its use for preparing labeled DNA is limited to those laboratories that have the manpower and chemical expertise to synthesize uniformly labeled phosphoamidites (16Ono A. Tate S. Ishido Y. Kainosho M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Quant S. Wechselberger R.W. Wolter M.A. Worner K.H. Schnell P. Engels J.W. Griesinger C. Schwalbe H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 6649-6652Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Földesi A. Nilson F.P.R. Glemarec C. Gioeli C. Chattopadhyaya J. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9033-9072Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Apart from chemical synthesis, only one alternative approach has been reported in the literature for the preparation of labeled single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to develop efficient and simple methods to prepare labeled double-stranded DNA that would bring structural studies of DNA by NMR to the same level of sophistication as that of proteins. The first procedure exploits our knowledge of biosynthetic labeling inE. coli. At first sight, production of the desired DNA sequence in bacteria grown with 15N and 13C nutrients should be a simple and easily accomplished task. Indeed,15N-labeled DNA has had an illustrious history in molecular biology (27Meselson M. Stahl F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 671-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most DNA within the cell, however, constitutes chromosomal DNA, and therefore one has to devise an efficient way to increase the amount of a desired short sequence such that it can be detected and purified from the vast excess of nondesired sequences. Clearly, introduction of a defined sequence via a plasmid or phage, rather than introduction into the E. coli, genome is the method of choice. We chose plasmid-mediated introduction since, in general, plasmids are smaller than phage genomes and higher numbers of extrachromosomal DNA copies of plasmid can be achieved. Based on size (2664 bp) and copy number (500–700) we chose pUC8 (21Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar) as our cloning vector. The oligonucleotide for insertion into the plasmid was designed in the following fashion. One end has an EcoRI overhang followed by a SmaI restriction site, whereas the other end has the EcoRI overhang (Fig.1). The specific sequence in the center of the oligonucleotide codes for the binding site of the transcription factor SRY in the Müllerian inhibitory substance promoter (28Haqq C.M. King C.Y. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This arrangement of restriction sites and specific target sequence allows for cutting the desired oligonucleotide from any recombinant vector originating from pUC8 containing single or multiple copies with the blunt-end creating enzyme SmaI. The reason for this is that the multiple cloning site in pUC8 contains a SmaI site adjacent to the EcoRI site. (Note, this is different for other members of the pUC series.) Multiple repeats of the original 21-mer were created by ligation and successfully inserted into theEcoRI site of pUC8. Stable cloning of repeat sequences is not easily achieved, and indeed we observed shortening of inserts for a large number of transformants. For production purposes we chose a particular pUC8 derivative designated pUC8-SRY#27. It contains seven tandem copies of the original 21-mer. The fact that no 34-merSmaI fragments were observed for this candidate indicates that inverted repeats are extremely unstable and are lost from the plasmid rapidly. E. coli strain GM1674 (kindly provided by M. G. Marinus) was transformed with pUC8-SRY#27 and used for plasmid DNA preparation. This particular strain was chosen to avoid the introduction of any heterogeneity caused by selective methylation. It lacks both the Dam and Dcm methylases that modify the N6 position of adenine residues and the C5 position of cytosine residues with methyl groups in GATC or CC(A/T)GG sequences, respectively. On average, Dam sites occur at a frequency of ∼1 site per 256 bp and Dcm sites at ∼1 site per 512 bp in DNA of random sequence. Sites for the thirdE. coli DNA methylase, EcoKI, are much less common (∼1 site per 8 kilobase pairs) such that it is not necessary to worry about this modification. Although heterogeneity within the 21-mer oligonucleotide due to Dam and Dcm methylases would be too small to be of concern, preparation of labeled nucleotides from chromosomal DNA or the vector portion of the plasmid DNA (see second method below) may not be advisable. We grew pUC8-SRY#27-transformed GM1674 in minimal medium using15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source, isolated the plasmid DNA, and carried out endonucleolytic cleavage with the enzyme SmaI. The 21-bp oligonucleotide, designated SRY-21, with the sequence5′GGGAATTCTGCACAAACACCC3′CCCTTAAGACGTGTTTGTGGG was purified by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 4 C,lane 3). 1.1 mg of purified oligonucleotide was obtained from 75 mg of plasmid DNA, which corresponds to an overall final yield of ∼30%. Although the final amount of 15N-labeled 21-mer seems to be rather small compared with the amount of labeled DNA produced in E. coli, the latter constitutes an excellent source for the preparation of labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates by previously established methods (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Smith D.E. Su J.-Y. Jucker F.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 presents the cytosine amino (A) and imino (B and C) regions of the1H-15N HSQC spectrum recorded at 30 °C on a 0.3 mm sample of 15N-labeled SRY-21 in phosphate buffer containing 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The thymidine N3 nitrogens resonate around 158–160 ppm, whereas the guanosine N1 atoms resonate around 146–148 ppm. Despite the limited chemical shift dispersion for these cross peaks, it is possible to identify the imino proton and nitrogen resonances for all but the two terminal base pairs. The latter are not visible due to fraying of the strands at the ends of the duplex. We were able to assign these resonances using a conventional two-dimensional 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectrum (data not shown), and cross peaks are labeled with the base pair number. The isotopic enrichment of SRY-21 was ascertained from a one-dimensional proton spectrum recorded without nitrogen decoupling (data not shown) and by mass spectrometry. By both methods, the oligonucleotide is >95% labeled with 15N. The second procedure, ESRA, exploits the power of PCR technology for DNA amplification in a novel way. Relying on an enzymatic synthesis step, this approach is similar in spirit to the methodology developed for the preparation of labeled RNA (29Batey R.T. Battiste J.L. Williamson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 300-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30Puglisi J.D. Wyatt J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and subsequently DNA (18Zimmer D.P. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3091-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) oligonucleotides. The major difference and clear advantage of our method is based on the fact that a large number of repeated cycling steps can be performed, thus resulting in the production of copious amounts of DNA. An outline of the PCR-ESRA approach is illustrated in Fig.3. The starting material consists of two oligonucleotides prepared by chemical synthesis using standard methodologies. Their sequences comprise the desired DNA sequence repeated twice and embedded between two restriction sites. For the present purposes we have chosen SmaI sites since we had already developed efficient cleavage conditions for large amounts of DNA for our first methodology (described above). Any other restriction site can also be employed, and indeed HaeIII works equally well. 2J. M. Louis, R. G. Martin, G. M. Clore, and A. M. Gronenborn, unpublished data. Annealing of the two oligonucleotides will, in addition to the complete double-stranded 34-mer, yield partial double-stranded species that are amenable to filling in by polymerases. In this manner each single strand functions simultaneously as a template and as a primer. Using natural abundant deoxynucleoside triphosphates will result in unlabeled DNA, whereas15N- and/or 13C-labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates allow for the preparation of uniformly 15N- and/or 15N-13C labeled DNA. In the first extension reaction (see Fig. 3) the product is a 3-fold repeat of the target sequence. Multiple cycles of annealing and extension will result in hundreds of tandem copies of the target double-stranded oligonucleotide. Although initially only a small percentage of the annealed sequences will have single-stranded ends, these are the only species competent in the extension reaction, and multiple rounds of melting and annealing will completely consume these initial and intermediate blunt-end species. Restriction endonuclease treatment of the several kilobase pairs-long product results in the desired double-stranded oligonucleotide in large amounts. We prepared a uniformly 15N-13C-labeled 17-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide, designated SRY-17, with the following sequence.5′GGGCTGCACAAACACCC3′CCCGACGTGTTTGTGGG The DNA fragment was purified by ion exchange chromatography in the same manner as SRY-21. Fig. 4illustrates the results of the annealing/extension protocol. A timecourse for the PCR reaction is shown in the left panel, the product before and after endoncleolytic cleavage is shown in themiddle panel, and the final purified product is shown in theright-hand side panel. As is easily appreciated, cleavage with SmaI yields predominantly the 17-mer with only a small amount of undigested material migrating to the position of a dimer. The latter most likely occurs as a result of a single base 3′ overhang in the extension products that is not efficiently removed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity (31Clark J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). This, in turn, may obliterate theSmaI recognition site resulting in some oligonucleotides that cannot be cleaved to monomers. The amount of dimer is less than 10% and is easily removed in the chromatography step. The overall yield of purified labeled double-stranded 17-mer is ∼50% calculated with respect to the amount of input labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates, illustrating the cost effectiveness of this methodology (i.e. ∼50% of the labeled deoxynucleoside triphosphates are incorporated into the final product). Most of the loss could be due to the instability of deoxynucleoside triphosphates over extended cycles of heating and cooling used in PCR. The final product (∼1 mg) is >95% labeled with 15N and 13C, as evidenced from an undecoupled one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum as well as mass spectrometry. Fig. 5 shows four regions of the constant time 1H-13C HSQC spectrum recorded at 30 °C on a 0.3 mm sample of15N-13C-labeled SRY-17 in phosphate buffer containing 99.99% D2O. The C1′-H1′ region is surprisingly well resolved, and 29 of the 34 cross peaks can be identified. The remaining ones are hidden in the severely overlapped portions of this region of the spectrum. Naturally the C3′-H3′ and, more markedly, the C4′-H4′ regions exhibit extensive overlap. In panel D all cross peaks for the thymine methyl groups can be identified. As can be appreciated, all expected resonances are observed, indicating complete13C-labeling of the oligonucleotide. A1H-15N HSQC spectrum, analogous to that presented in Fig. 2, demonstrates complete 15N-labeling as well (data not shown). In summary, we have developed two efficient and economical methods for the large scale production of isotopically labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. Although the plasmid-based approach is currently limited to 15N-labeled DNA for reasons of cost, the yields may easily be improved using fed-batch fermentation protocols developed for large scale plasmid production (32Chen W. Graham C. Ciccarelli R.B. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 18: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Improvements in the cloning of multiple repeats using a variation of the ESRA approach in conjunction with specialized strains may also be possible. The ESRA approach, on the other hand, is cost effective for any type of uniform isotopic labeling. As has been eluded to above, the PCR-based ESRA methodology presented here is not only applicable to the preparation of labeled oligodeoxynucleotides for NMR structural studies. Indeed, it may well be the method of choice for the large scale production of double-stranded oligonucleotides per se, particularly in cases that require a minimum length where chemical synthesis and purification of large amounts becomes difficult due to contamination with n-1 products (i.e. 60 bp and longer). Thus DNA fragments required for structural studies by x-ray crystallography may present another system that would benefit from the ESRA approach. No doubt, the availability of uniformly isotopically labeled DNA will make NMR studies of DNA oligonucleotides, either free or complexed, amenable to the same level of sophistication that can be applied to proteins.

It was also suggested that ε increased the processivity of α during DNA synthesis on primed single-stranded DNA (15Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

At the replication fork, this results in a physical coupling of the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases in space (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16558-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β dimer encircles the DNA and associates with α to topologically lock the polymerase onto the template, thereby enabling processive synthesis (26Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M.

This interaction also results in the protection of β on the leading-strand side from premature recycling by the γ-complex (29Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

We have been studying the action of the pol III HE at replication forks formed during rolling circle DNA replication on specialized tailed form II (TFII) DNA templates in the presence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and the φX-type primosomal proteins. In this report, we have analyzed the contributions of the three subunits of the polymerase core to replication fork function. We find that only the α subunit is required to form replication forks that are as processive and which move at the same rate as those formed with the intact HE. In addition, replication forks containing only α responded to control of Okazaki fragment synthesis as mediated by the primase (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

NTPs and dNTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [α-32P]dATP was from Amersham. Alkaline phosphatase was from Boehringer Mannheim. Single-stranded circular DNAs from bacteriophages f1AY-7/M and f1R229-A/33 were prepared as described previously (34Model P. Zinder N. J. Biol.

SSB was purified according to Minden and Marians (40Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TFII DNA was prepared as described by Mok and Marians (41Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (12 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 12 mm MgOAc, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.1 μm SSB, 0.42 nm TFII DNA, 3.2 nmDnaB, 56 nm DnaC, 240 nm DnaG (or as indicated), 28 nm DnaT, 2.5 nm PriA, 2.5 nm PriB, 2.5 nm PriC, and the pol III core, αε, or α as indicated and all other HE subunits at 28 nm, were preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min. NTPs were added to final concentrations of 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, and 200 μm UTP, and dNTPs to 40 μm and the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 30 °C. [α-32P]dATP (2000–4000 cpm/pmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the incubation was continued at 30 °C for an additional 10 min. DNA synthesis was quenched by addition of EDTA to 40 mm. Total DNA synthesis was determined by assaying an aliquot of the reaction mixture for acid insoluble radioactivity. The reaction mixtures were treated with alkaline phosphatase (3 units) at 37 °C for 45 min and the DNA products analyzed by alkaline gel electrophoresis as described (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The φX-type primosomal proteins were used rather than just DnaB, DnaC, and DnaG because the former group of proteins assembles replication forks about 15-fold more efficiently than the latter (41Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard rolling circle reaction mixtures containing core, αε, or α as indicated were incubated for 2 min at 30 °C in the absence of label to establish active replication forks. Aliquots (1 μl) were then transferred to a prewarmed dilution reaction mixture (90 μl) containing all buffer components, NTPs, dNTPs, [α-32P]dATP, SSB, and primase at their standard concentrations, but that lacked DNA template, all other HE subunits, and the preprimosomal proteins (PriA, PriB, PriC, DnaT, DnaB, and DnaC). The incubation was continued at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of EDTA. As a control for Okazaki fragment size, the original reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and in the absence of any diluent. Reactions were then processed and analyzed as described above. Standard rolling circle reaction mixtures were assembled either in the presence of core, αε, or α, as indicated. The effect of the anti-β antibody (42Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12310-12315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on initiation was assessed by including it in the reaction mixture from the start, before the ATP concentration was raised and before the dNTPs and other NTPs were added. The effect of the antibody on elongation was determined by adding the antibody along with the [α-32P]dATP 2 min after the reactions had been initiated. Reactions were then processed and analyzed as described above. Standard rolling circle replication reactions containing core, αε, or α were increased in size 4-fold. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 6 min at 30 °C after the addition of [α-32P]dATP. 5-Methyl-dCTP was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm and aliquots (7 μl) were withdrawn every 10 s for the next minute. Each aliquot was mixed with 1 μl of 20 mm ddTTP to terminate the elongation reaction. Aliquots were then heated at 68 °C for 10 min and then treated with 10 units each of the AluI, HaeIII, HhaI, andHpaII restriction endonucleases for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis through alkaline-agarose gels (20 × 25 × 0.5 cm) at 40 V for 48 h. The electrophoresis buffer was changed once after 24 h. oriCDNA replication was reconstituted as described by Hiasa and Marians (43Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using pBROTB DNA as the template in the presence of DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, SSB, HU, and the pol III HE reconstituted with either core, αε, or α as indicated. Replication reactions (75 μl) were initiated in the absence of any topoisomerase. After a 2-min incubation, [α-32P]dATP was added and the incubation continued for 1 min. Under these conditions only an early replication intermediate (ERI) is formed. Subsequent nascent chain elongation requires the release of the accumulated topological constraint. The label was chased by the addition of an 100-fold excess of cold dATP (time 0) and the incubation continued. Aliquots (15 μl) were removed at the indicated times, mixed with the SmaI restriction endonuclease (20 units), and incubated an additional 10 min. DNA products were then analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing alkaline-agarose gels as described (43Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of the TFII DNA template, SSB, the primosomal proteins, and the pol III HE generates replication forks that support rolling circle DNA replication. These forks produce multigenome length double-stranded tails that are composed of a long, continuous leading strand and short (about 2 kb) Okazaki fragments (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstated that the forks formed in vitropossess many of the characteristics of bona fide E. colireplication forks. They are highly processive, synthesizing leading strands in excess of 0.5 megabase in length (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), move at rates comparable to that of the fork in vivo (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exhibit coupled leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 44Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Hughes Jr., A.J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Zechner E.L. Reems J.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4074-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the roles of the three subunits of the polymerase core at the replication fork, we therefore assessed the ability to form replication forks with αε and α alone, as well as the characteristic properties of the forks formed. HE reconstituted with αεθ, αε, or α was titrated in rolling circle replication reactions in the presence of the TFII DNA template, SSB, and the primosomal proteins. Neither ε nor θ were required to form replication forks capable of producing long leading strands and short Okazaki fragments (Fig. 1). The lagging-strand products were of typical size, between 1 and 2 kb in length. We did note that a higher concentration of HE containing only α was required to produce active replication forks. This probably reflects either a decrease in affinity for the template for α compared with αε or a decrease in affinity of one of the protein-protein interactions required to establish a replication fork. This is consistent with the lower level of DNA synthesis observed with α alone, presumably reflecting a lower efficiency of initiation. Okazaki fragment size is governed by a transient protein-protein interaction between primase and DnaB at the replication fork (33Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 46Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DnaG acts distributively with respect to the cycle of lagging-strand synthesis, loading onto the template via interaction with the helicase, synthesizing a primer, and then dissociating from the fork to be replaced by another molecule from solution for the next round of primer synthesis (32Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Okazaki fragment size is inversely proportional to both the primase concentration (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the affinity of the protein-protein interaction between primase and DnaB (33Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Replication forks formed with αεθ, αε, or α responded in an identical fashion to primase concentration (Fig.2). This indicated that neither ε nor θ were required for the interaction between primase and the replication fork and that their absence from the fork in no way compromised cycling of the lagging-strand polymerase from the just completed Okazaki fragment to the new primer. This argues that neither dissociation of the lagging-strand polymerase from the Okazaki fragment nor the ability of the polymerase to find and bind to the new primer terminus requires either ε or θ. The replication forks that form at oriC are extraordinarily processive. Each fork presumably synthesizes a leading strand of about 2.3 × 106 nt in length in one polymerase binding event. We have developed a protocol that allows us to test replication fork processivity (41Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that makes use of the observation that once formed in an elongation complex with α, β is no longer accessible to antibody (42Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12310-12315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, replication forks that are processive are resistant to inhibition by anti-β antibody. Rolling circle replication reactions containing αεθ, αε, or α received the anti-β antibody either 3 min before initiation (I in Fig. 3) or 3 min after initiation (E in Fig. 3). When added before initiation, all DNA replication was inhibited with any combination of core subunits, as would be expected because the replication fork cannot form without free β (Fig. 3). On the other hand, when the anti-β antibody was added after replication forks had formed, only lagging-strand synthesis was inhibited, long leading strands that could not enter the alkaline-agarose gel were still formed for each combination of core subunit (Fig. 3). Inhibition of lagging-strand synthesis was expected because the synthesis of each new Okazaki fragment requires a new β dimer (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Note that the Okazaki fragments synthesized in this experiment are much larger than the typical ones (e.g. in Figs. 1 and 2). This was because the concentration of β was lowered in this experiment to observe the effect of the antibody. Because β is used stoichiometrically during lagging-strand synthesis, Okazaki fragment size is inversely related to its concentration (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate that replication fork processivity is unaffected by the absence of either the ε or θ subunits. The E. coli replication fork moves at about 1000 nt/s at 37 °C. Replication fork speed in the rolling circle system has been measured at 600–800 nt/s at 30 °C (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mok M. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16644-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the ε or θ subunits had any affect on replication fork speed. The technique used measures the speed of established replication forks in the following manner (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rolling circle replication reactions are initiated under normal conditions in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. After 6 min of incubation, when significant initiation of replication has occurred, 5-methyl-dCTP is added in 10-fold excess over dCTP and aliquots are taken every 10 s for 1 min. The reaction is then terminated by adding a 60-fold excess of ddTTP over dTTP. This generates long, labeled, leading strands that are unmethylated except in the regions synthesized during the last minute of synthesis. The unmethylated regions are removed by digestion with restriction endonucleases that have 4-base recognition sequences with dCMP residues in them. What remains is the methylated region of the DNA. When electrophoresed through alkaline-agarose gels, these DNA products appear as long smears with sharp trailing edges. The trailing edge represents the longest leading strand synthesized in the reaction and the change in its size as a function of time is a direct measure of the speed of the replication fork. The analysis of replication fork speed for forks containing αεθ, αε, or α is shown in Fig. 4. The size of the leading strands in all three cases is nearly identical for each replication fork at each time point during the 1-min sampling period. This indicates that the rate of replication fork progression in each case was identical. The actual values, calculated using PhosphorImager traces of each lane to locate the trailing edge of the smear, for the forks containing core, αε, and α were 660, 656, and 654 nt/s, respectively. τ couples the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases together in space at the replication fork (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, when the lagging-strand α dissociates from the just completed Okazaki fragment, it does not dissociate from the fork, but is held there via protein-protein interactions as predicted originally by the trombone model of Alberts and co-workers (49Alberts B.M. Morris C. Mace D. Sinha N. Bittner M. Morgan L. Goulian M. Hanawat P. DNA Synthesis and Its Regulation. W. A. Benhamin, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1975: 241-269Google Scholar, 50Sinha N.K. Morris C.F. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4290-4293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allows the lagging-strand polymerase to find the new primer terminus with minimal delay. It also makes lagging-strand synthesis resistant to extreme dilution. This can be assessed by observing the size of Okazaki fragments made before and after dilution. Coupling of the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases is manifested as the retention of the synthesis of Okazaki fragments after dilution of roughly the same size as those synthesized before dilution. If the polymerases were not coupled, one would expect that Okazaki fragment size would either get very large, because the distance on the template between two successful initiation events would increase as a result of the delay in the polymerase associating with the primer, or, as we have observed (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the entire fork would fall apart and synthesis would not be observed at all. Fig. 5 shows that lagging-strand synthesis is preserved when replication forks containing core, αε, or α are diluted 90-fold into reaction mixtures that contain only SSB, DnaG, and β at their original concentrations, all other protein components were omitted from the dilution reaction mixture. The concentrations of SSB, DnaG, and β must be maintained after dilution because each of these proteins acts distributively during multiple cycles of lagging-strand synthesis (31Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are identical to those we have observed previously with bona fide HE purified from bulkE. coli (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 44Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Hughes Jr., A.J. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4064-4073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we have remarked before (20Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21406-21412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we consistently observe a slight shift in Okazaki fragment size after dilution that we believe is attributable to the large excess of SSB over active template in the dilution reaction mixture. Thus, neither ε nor θ are required for coupling of the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases at the replication fork. The presence or absence of a 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease function might only affect the stability of the polymerases when the fork was paused. Thus, we considered that we might not observe any differences between replication forks in the presence and absence of ε when they were moving, as they were in all the experiments described above. Because it is difficult to pause replication forks in the rolling circle replication assay, we used theoriC replication system, where forks can be paused as a result of accumulated positive overwindings in the template DNA (51Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to investigate this issue. This protocol exploits the fact that oriC replication will initiate on a superhelical plasmid DNA template in the absence of a topoisomerase. Replication proceeds until excess positive supercoils accumulate, causing the replication forks to pause, resulting in the formation of an ERI where the nascent leading strands are about 600 nt in length. Replication fork progression is resumed if the accumulated topological constraint is relieved by either the addition of a topoisomerase or by breaking the phosphodiester backbone of the template. The use of a restriction endonuclease to relieve topological constraint results in a replication fork run-off on the now linear template (6.0 kb). To assess replication fork stability, we actually measured decay of the capacity of paused forks in the ERI to resume DNA replication. ERIs were formed containing αεθ, αε, or α in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. An 100-fold excess of nonradioactive ATP was added (time 0) and aliquots were removed at the indicated times. Aliquots were processed by the addition of the SmaI restriction enzyme to linearize the template and an additional 10-min incubation to permit elongation by active replication forks. When analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.6 A) two bands are therefore observed, ERI that has not been elongated and linear DNA, which represents the product of active replication forks. The stability of paused replication forks in the ERI is then measured as the fraction of ERI that can be converted to linear DNA as a function of time (Fig. 6 B). We do not, as yet, know the reason that the forks decay and there are, of course, many possibilities. However, for the purpose of this assay, we assume that the mechanism of decay is the same in all cases. Replication forks containing core, αε, or ε displayed identical stabilities, decaying with essentially the same rates (Fig.6 B). Thus, the presence of ε, even under conditions where the exonuclease would be expected to be active, does not have an affect on replication fork stability. The replication fork is a complex structure where upward of 30 protomers combine to execute ordered, semi-conservative DNA replication in a rapid and highly efficient fashion. Understanding the role of the polypeptides at the fork is the key to understanding how the replisome functions. We have been using a rolling circle DNA replication system reconstituted with purified proteins in an effort to contribute to this understanding. The availability of all the protein components in highly purified form has allowed an analysis of the replication fork functions that are disrupted when various polypeptides are omitted from replication fork assembly. Such analyses revealed, for example, the requirement for a protein-protein interaction between the τ subunit of the HE and DnaB that literally defined the replisome, cementing the polymerase and the helicase together, enabling rapid replication fork movement (28Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and determining which of the two polymerase cores will be the leading-strand polymerase (29Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4315-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1986; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this report we have considered the contributions of the three subunits of the polymerase core to replication fork function. α, ε, and θ purify as a tight 1:1:1 complex when polymerase activity is scored by, e.g. using nicked salmon sperm DNA as the template (11McHenry C.S. Crow W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1748-1753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When processive DNA synthesis is used as the assay, the core is isolated as a component of the HE (8Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). θ is the product ofholE (12Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Carter J.L. Franden M.A. Aebersold R. Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3281-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which can be disrupted in E. coliwithout any apparent affect (53Slater S.C. Lifsics M.R. O'Donnell M. Maurer R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analyses have also failed to attribute a catalytic activity to θ. ε is the proofreading 3′ → 5′ exonuclease (10Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) encoded by dnaQ (54Scheuermann R.H. Tam S. Burgers P, M.J. Lu C. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7085-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It can form a tight complex with both α and θ, apparently forming the bridge between them in the core (12Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains deficient in ε show the expected mutator effect (55Deguen G.E. Cox R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α is the polymerase subunit (9Welch M.M. McHenry C.S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 351-356PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by dnaE (56Gefter M. Hirota Y. Kornberg T. Wechsler J.A. Barnaux C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3150-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and is, of course, essential for viability. Because these three proteins form such a tight complex, it is expected that they are present at the replication fork. On one level, the contribution of ε is obvious. At a different level, we have investigated whether ε and θ played additional roles that affected replication fork function directly. We have assessed the distinguishing characteristics of replication forks that contained αεθ, αε, or only α. We found that replication forks that contained only α performed in a fashion indistinguishable from those containing the complete core. Thus, neither ε nor θ were required to either maintain high rates of processive replication fork movement, to couple the leading- and lagging-strand polymerases, or to ensure proper recycling of the lagging-strand polymerase from the just completed Okazaki fragment to the new primer terminus. This makes it unlikely that these subunits are required to maintain the structural integrity of the replisome. Replication fork assembly did require higher concentrations of α than αε. This reduced efficiency suggests that ε may facilitate the interaction of α with another protein at the replication fork. In a study examining processivity of αεθ, αε, and α on primed single-stranded phage DNAs in the presence of β and the γ-complex, Studwell-Vaughan and O'Donnell (12Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that α, while maintaining a reasonable processivity in the range of 1–3 kb, was still significantly less processive than the combination of αε and suggested that highly processive DNA synthesis by the HE was contingent on the exonuclease subunit. Kim and McHenry (14Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20681-20689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) did not observe this difference when they used τ complex to load β onto the DNA and an anti-β antibody challenge similar to the one described in this report to test processivity. This latter report did note that HE reconstituted with only α synthesized DNA at about one-fifth the rate of HE reconstituted with αε or αεθ. Thus, the results observed at bona fide replication forks are somewhat different from each of these reports, underscoring the importance of assessing function in the proper context. Presumably, the major difference is that the τ-DnaB interaction that occurs at replication forks is the overriding factor in the determination of fork rate and processivity. However, a structural role for ε at the replication fork under certain conditions cannot be completely ruled out. dnaQdisruptions in Salmonella typhimurium display two phenotypes, a mutator defect and a slow growth defect (57Lancy E.D. Lifsics M.R. Kehre D.G. Maurer R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5572-5580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous suppressor mutations of the slow growth phenotype that have been mapped to α arise very rapidly in these strains. The purified supressor polymerase was shown to have 3–5-fold higher activity than the wild-type polymerase (58Lifsics M.R. Lancy E.D. Maurer R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that ε activates αin vivo. It is interesting to consider that this apparent difference may reflect the basic difference between the rolling circle replication system and replication forks on the chromosome of E. coli. That is, the in vitro system proceeds in an unimpeded fashion around the template, whereas in the cell, replication forks encounter all sorts of protein roadblocks on the DNA as well as damaged bases in the template. It may be that under these circumstances ε is required for stability of the fork. This possibility awaits further investigation."

Full length sequence of RB18A cDNA and computer analysis demonstrated that despite common antigenic determinants between RB18A and p53 proteins, nucleotide and deduced protein sequences did not reveal any significant homologies. RB18A mRNA was detected in all tissues tested except in kidney. In addition, RB18A protein shared identical functions with p53 protein: binding to DNA or to p53 and self-oligomerization. Furthermore, RB18A regulated p53 specific binding on his DNA consensus binding site. These functions were associated to the C-terminal domain of RB18A protein and more specifically to the PAb421 binding site present in this domain. The activation by RB18A of p53 binding on DNA was induced through an unstable interaction between both proteins. Altogether, our data demonstrated that RB18A protein shares antigenic and functional properties with p53 and regulated p53 functions."

The precise sorting of proteins along the secretory pathway is crucial for the maintenance of organelle integrity. The localization of chaperones and other soluble proteins to the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; BCM, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; BCM, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin; NEM,N-ethylmaleimide. is achieved by their continuous retrieval from post-ER compartments by the KDEL receptor, a membrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus. Binding of soluble ER proteins to the receptor is dependent on a conserved tetrapeptide sequence at their carboxyl terminus, which is usually KDEL in animal cells and HDEL in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (see Ref. 1Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar for review). The HDEL receptor was originally isolated from yeast; it is the product of the ERD2 gene and has subsequently been cloned from other organisms (2Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and a direct interaction between KDEL ligands and the human receptor has recently been demonstrated (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analyses and the “positive inside rule” (10Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) suggest seven primarily hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains with the amino terminus in the lumen and the carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm (11Semenza J.C. Pelham H.R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The topology of the KDEL receptor would thus be similar to the organization of G-protein-coupled receptors, although no amino acid sequence homology is observed. Based on studies using fusions to N-linked glycosylation sites, a different topology has been proposed with six transmembrane domains and the amino terminus located in the cytoplasm (13Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the KDEL recycling system is well established, several significant questions have remained unanswered. For example, the sorting of KDEL proteins is believed to be controlled by the pH difference between the Golgi apparatus and the ER (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the pH difference between these two compartments, which is estimated to be approximately 0.5 pH units (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is sufficient to ensure efficient binding of KDEL proteins in the Golgi apparatus and their release in the ER. In addition, ligand binding was suggested to induce retrograde transport of the receptor-ligand complexes, involving a signal transduction mechanism across the membrane (14Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Neither the mechanism of signal transduction nor any components of the machinery apart from the KDEL receptor have been identified. It has been shown that the KDEL receptor, presumably together with bound ligand, is selectively recruited into COPI-coated vesicles from Golgi membranes, but this process is not well characterized (15Sönnichsen B. Watson R. Clausen H. Misteli T. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1411-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). As a better understanding of these events requires detailed analyses of the receptor structure, we set out to identify amino acid residues involved in ligand binding and to investigate the topology of the human Erd2.1 protein, one of two related KDEL receptors identified in humans (17Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We undertook a sulfhydryl-specific labeling approach, creating site-directed mutants with unique cysteine residues engineered at different positions in the receptor, followed by chemical labeling with thiol-specific reagents. We have investigated the effect of derivatization of single cysteine residues on ligand binding and the sidedness of these residues by labeling of receptor mutants with membrane-permeant and -impermeant sulfhydryl-specific compounds. The baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 and linearized baculovirus DNA were from PharMingen, Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen, NEM and 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide) were from Sigma, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was from Molecular Probes, and a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Pierce. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kunkel (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) in a pBluescript vector containing the human Erd2.1 cDNA modified at the 3′-end to add a Myc and a hexahistidine tag (hErd2-Myc-His, see Ref. 9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All sequences were confirmed by dye terminator cycle sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 377 sequencer. The cDNAs encoding receptor mutants were cloned into aSmaI/BglII-digested baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. Mutants are named as (wild-type residue and number) → (mutant residue). Recombinant baculoviruses containing mutant Erd2.1 cDNAs under the control of a polyhedrin promoter were created using the Baculogold kit from PharMingen according to the information provided by the manufacturer. Isolation of virus clones and infection of Sf9 cells were carried out as described (19Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). Preparation of a crude membrane fraction from infected cells and ligand binding assays were carried out as described previously (9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard binding assays contained membranes derived from infected insect cells expressing wild-type or mutant KDEL receptors, approximately 180,000 cpm of 125I-YTSEKDEL, 100 ng of YTSEKDELGL (nonfunctional ligand) in binding assay buffer (20 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm sodium cacodylate pH 5.0). Unless otherwise mentioned, all binding data are shown without background subtraction. Competition assays contained 180,000 cpm125I-YTFEHDEL and variable amounts of competitor peptide. All binding assays were done under nonsaturating conditions. To assess the effect of alkylation of individual cysteine residues on the binding activity of receptor mutants, 1–10 μg of crude membranes were incubated with NEM or biotin maleimide in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, for 10 min on ice and were then directly used in the peptide binding assay. For analysis by Western blotting, 100 μg of crude membranes were incubated with 100 μm biotin maleimide for 10 min on ice in phosphate buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0), quenched with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and solubilized with 0.5% SDS at room temperature. The soluate was spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the receptor was bound to Ni-NTA resin by incubation of the soluble detergent extract with 40 μl of resin under rotation for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound proteins were washed off and bound receptor protein eluted with 1m imidazole, pH 7.0. All buffers during the purification contained 0.5% SDS. Biotin-labeled KDEL receptor was visualized by immunoblotting using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce, 1 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin) and the ECL chemoluminescence detection system (Amersham International, United Kingdom). To determine the sidedness of amino acid residues relative to the membrane, 100 μg of crude membranes were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μm AMS for 10 min on ice and the membranes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g. After a washing step, the membranes were resuspended in phosphate buffer and incubated with 100 μm biotin maleimide for 10 min on ice before quenching the reaction with 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Biotinylated receptor was purified and visualized as described above. The human KDEL receptor Erd2.1 contains four cysteine residues, none of which is strictly conserved in all receptor homologues. There are no cysteines in theS. cerevisiae receptor, indicating that cysteine residues are not strictly required for receptor function (2Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, Cys-29 in the human sequence (Fig. 1) is conserved in six out of nine receptor homologues, and a change to alanine at this position reduces the binding activity of the human KDEL receptor approximately 2–3-fold, implying that a mutation at this position has indirect affects on the receptor structure (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first objective was to test whether any individual cysteine residue was strictly required for structure or function of the human KDEL receptor. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change all four cysteines to serines, and Cys-less and wild-type receptors were expressed in insect cells. We used the baculovirus expression system, as we have recently demonstrated that it can be used to produce large amounts of functional human KDEL receptor (9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We expressed a both Myc- and hexahistidine-tagged version of the human Erd2.1 protein (hErd2-Myc-His, see “Experimental Procedures”), since the addition of these tags to the carboxyl terminus of the receptor does not alter the affinity of the receptor for KDEL ligand and Myc-His-tagged receptor can be easily purified in a single step by nickel affinity chromatography (9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Crude membranes containing equal amounts of wild-type receptor and a cysteine-less receptor mutant were analyzed for KDEL peptide binding. The binding activity of Cys-less human KDEL receptor is significantly higher than the wild-type receptor (Fig.2 A). This is not due to a change in ligand affinity and thus suggests an increase in the amount of functional receptor, which was estimated to be approximately 2.3-fold as judged by Scatchard analysis (data not shown). Together with earlier data, which showed around 40% of the human KDEL receptor to be functional when expressed in insect cells (9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this suggests that more than 90% of the Cys-less KDEL receptor in these preparations is functional. To determine which cysteine residue is responsible for this effect, we mutated three cysteines at a time to serine, leaving one of the endogenous cysteine residues. Fig. 2 A shows that a receptor containing only Cys-29, which is predicted to be in the first cytoplasmic loop, shows a binding activity similar to wild-type receptor. Thus, it is evidently the presence of Cys-29 that causes some of the overexpressed wild-type receptor in insect cells to accumulate in an inactive state. Immunoblotting showed an increase in the amount of receptor dimers for the Cys-29-containing mutant compared with Cys-less receptor (data not shown), suggesting that oxidation of Cys-29 may play a role in receptor inactivation.Figure 2Effect of cysteine replacements on the KDEL binding activity of the human KDEL receptor. A, binding of125I-YTSEKDEL to membranes derived from insect cells containing equal amounts of wild-type and mutant KDEL receptors was determined. Wild-type, human Erd2-Myc-His; ΔC, human Erd2-Myc-His with all four endogenous cysteines (Cys-29, Cys-62, Cys-70, Cys-192) changed to Ser; the numbering of the other mutants refers to the only cysteine residue still present in the receptor sequence, e.g. Cys-29, residues Cys-62, Cys-70, and Cys-192 changed to Ser. B, Western blot analysis of the samples used in A probed with the 9E10 anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reintroduced individual cysteine residues into the Cys-less KDEL receptor sequence at 25 different positions by site-directed mutagenesis to probe their function and location (Fig. 1). In the choice of the residues, we were guided by an earlier study, which used mutational analysis to identify amino acid residues crucial for ligand binding (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although this approach could not be used to distinguish between residues directly contacting the ligand or ones that merely altered the receptor structure, thus affecting ligand binding indirectly, it allowed us to predict which residues might be involved in forming the binding pocket. We concentrated on charged residues or residues predicted to be on the same side of a potential α-helix as charged or polar residues (Fig.1). Recombinant baculoviruses encoding receptor mutants were used to infect insect cells, and crude membrane preparations were subsequently analyzed for their ability to bind ligands in vitro (TableI). The replacement of charged residues by cysteines had a significant effect on KDEL binding activity, consistent with earlier findings (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The first half of transmembrane domain 1 was particularly sensitive to mutations, even a replacement of Gly by Cys (Gly-8 → Cys) strongly affected ligand binding, whereas less conserved residues in the same region (Leu-10, Ser-11, and Leu-13) could be changed without significant effect (Table I). In general, mutation of less conserved residues or nonpolar residues had only minor effects on KDEL binding. Surprisingly, a minor change in the fifth transmembrane domain (Ser-123 → Cys) greatly reduced KDEL binding, whereas an identical amino acid mutation in the same transmembrane domain (Ser-128 → Cys) has no effect on the binding activity (see below).Table IEffects of mutations on KDEL binding activityPositionReceptor mutantKDEL binding activity1-a+, less than 30%; ++, 30–60%, +++, greater than 60% of KDEL binding activity compared to the Cys-less receptor.ΔC+++TMD 1Arg-5 → Cys+Gly-8 → Cys+Asp-9 → Cys+Leu-10 → Cys++Ser-11 → Cys+++His-12 → Cys+Leu-13 → Cys+++Loop 1Cys-291-bThese cysteine residues are present in the wild-type receptor and were introduced into a Cys-less receptor mutant.

TMD, transmembrane domain. Open table in a new tab Crude membranes containing wild-type or mutant receptors were treated with NEM or biotin maleimide (BCM), and then KDEL binding activity was determined (see Fig.3 for examples). Biotin maleimide is a bulky maleimide-derivative, which was shown to be membrane-permeant at higher concentrations (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This reagent was used to determine whether the size of the modifying reagent is of importance, and it also facilitated detection of labeled receptor. We have identified four receptor mutants (Arg-5 → Cys, Asp-50 → Cys, Tyr-162 → Cys, and Asn-165 → Cys), which upon derivatization with NEM or BCM show significantly reduced binding activity (Fig. 3 and TableII). Binding of KDEL peptides to wild-type or Cys-less KDEL receptor was not affected by derivatization (Fig. 3). Arg-5 → Cys, Asp-50 → Cys, Tyr-162 → Cys, and Asn-165 → Cys already show a significant defect in binding (Table I), which was enhanced when the cysteine residue was alkylated; note that the binding experiments in Fig. 3 used a larger amount of Arg-5 → Cys mutant than wild-type receptor to compensate for its lower binding activity. We consider it to be unlikely that these mutations have a severe effect on folding of the receptor protein, the insertion into the bilayer or protein stability, as their expression levels are comparable with that of wild-type or Cys-less Erd2 (data not shown). Labeling with biotin maleimide was visualized by purification of the KDEL receptor using nickel affinity chromatography followed by immunoblotting and probing with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. Biotin maleimide is specific for cysteine residues under our conditions, since we were unable to detect reaction of BCM with the Cys-less receptor (Fig. 4 A). Arg-5 → Cys, Asp-50 → Cys, Tyr-162 → Cys, and Asn-165 → Cys could be labeled with both BCM and NEM, where labeling with NEM was visualized by its ability to prevent biotinylation (Fig.4 A).Table IIEffects on KDEL binding of receptor mutants by BCM and NEMMutantRelative YTSEKDEL binding after treatment of membranes with500 μm BCM2-aFigures represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicates using constant amounts of125I-YTSEKDEL under nonsaturating conditions (the standard deviation was less than 10%). 100% binding corresponds to KDEL binding in the absence of modifying reagent.500 μm NEM2-aFigures represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicates using constant amounts of125I-YTSEKDEL under nonsaturating conditions (the standard deviation was less than 10%). 100% binding corresponds to KDEL binding in the absence of modifying reagent.%%Cys-less100100Arg-5 → Cys4033Asp-50 → Cys50100Thr-85 → Cys100100Thr-114 → Cys100100Ser-123 → Cys100100Tyr-162 → Cys8044Asn-165 → Cys75352-a Figures represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in duplicates using constant amounts of125I-YTSEKDEL under nonsaturating conditions (the standard deviation was less than 10%). 100% binding corresponds to KDEL binding in the absence of modifying reagent.

The membranes were washed with phosphate buffer, and incubated with 100 μm BCM for 10 min on ice before quenching with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The KDEL receptor was solubilized and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”A, biotinylated KDEL receptor was visualized by immunoblotting and probing with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate.

B, total amounts of KDEL receptor were detected using anti-Myc antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of KDEL ligands to Arg-5 → Cys was similarly affected by NEM and biotin maleimide. Interestingly, while Asp-50 → Cys was labeled with both compounds (Fig. 4 A), only treatment with biotin maleimide inhibited KDEL binding (Table II), suggesting that a large group added to the cysteine side chain is required to inhibit binding. Inactivation of Tyr-162 → Cys and Asn-165 → Cys was more efficient with NEM, presumably because the labeling efficiency with biotin maleimide was low compared with Arg-5 → Cys or Asp-50 → Cys (Fig.4 A). KDEL binding to receptor mutant Ser-123 → Cys was not further affected by treatment with either reagent (Table II). Thus, the drastic effect of Ser-123 → Cys on KDEL binding is presumably indirect, and even minor changes of the amino acid side chain at this position seem to have severe effects on the receptor conformation. All other receptor mutants could be treated with NEM or biotin maleimide without any effect on KDEL binding (see Table II for examples). We were interested to see whether ligand binding could protect Arg-5 → Cys, Asp-50 → Cys, Tyr-162 → Cys, and Asn-165 → Cys from chemical modification, supporting the localization of these residues to the ligand binding site. However, ligand binding is strongly pH-dependent and is maximal at pH 5 (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where we were unable to obtain sufficient biotinylation. We investigated the location of the amino acid residues identified above relative to the membrane by testing the ability of a membrane-impermeant maleimide, stilbenemaleimide disulfonic acid (AMS), to prevent derivatization with biotin maleimide. These experiments crucially depended on intact membrane vesicles with the receptor being oriented in its natural way with the ligand binding side facing the lumen of the vesicles. To test the orientation of the receptor, binding assays were performed in the presence or absence of low amounts of detergent. The addition of 0.3% CHAPS stimulated the binding of 125I-YTSEKDEL to wild-type receptor and all mutants examined at least 4-fold (data not shown). This suggests that 80% of the KDEL binding sites are inaccessible to the hydrophilic peptide without permeabilization of the membrane. We assume that a small fraction of the membrane vesicles are either inverted or slightly leaky, allowing access of the peptide to the ligand binding side in the absence of detergent. AMS has been reported to be a membrane-impermeant thiol-specific compound (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and to confirm its physical properties we chose two mutants, Thr-85 → Cys and Thr-114 → Cys, with changes in positions that are predicted to be on the cytoplasmic and lumenal side of the membrane, respectively. The treatment of single cysteine mutants with AMS prior to incubation with biotin maleimide should prevent the biotinylation of cysteine residues located in the cytoplasmic loops, in contrast to cysteines located on the lumenal side of the membrane. The reaction of biotin maleimide with Thr-85 → Cys was completely prevented by AMS, indicating that residue 85 is indeed located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the binding of biotin maleimide to Thr-114 → Cys was unaffected by pretreatment with AMS, which locates Thr-114 to the lumenal compartment. This experiment confirms the proposed orientation of Thr-85 and Thr-114 (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,13Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it shows that AMS is indeed sufficiently membrane-impermeant under our conditions to be used to determine the sidedness of individual cysteine residues relative to the membrane. We focused on a mutant containing the endogenous cysteine residue Cys-29 and the mutants Arg-5 → Cys and Asp-50 → Cys, since the topology of the amino-terminal part of the KDEL receptor has remained controversial (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, biotinylation of Cys-29 is almost completely blocked by preincubation of the membranes with AMS, strongly suggesting that this residue is located in the cytoplasm. Both Arg-5 → Cys and Asp-50 → Cys behave like Thr-114 → Cys and are not accessible to AMS under these conditions. The biotinylation of all residues studied could be blocked at higher concentrations of AMS and after longer incubation periods, which indicates that these residues are in principle accessible to AMS. Thus, the amino acids Arg-5 and Asp-50, which we suggest to be directly involved in ligand binding are located on the lumenal side of the membrane and are not accessible from the cytoplasm. The tetrapeptide signal used for the retention of soluble ER proteins is conserved among different species, although some variations can be found. On most major ER proteins in higher organisms, KDEL acts as the signal (1Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), whereas S. cerevisiae uses HDEL and Kluyveromyces lactis uses both HDEL and DDEL (7Lewis M.J. Sweet D.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1359-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, one of the residues described above, Asp-50, which we propose to be involved in ligand binding is located in a region which was shown earlier to be important in determining ligand specificity in the K. lactis and S. cerevisiaereceptors (11Semenza J.C. Pelham H.R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The same region in the human receptor (amino acids 50–56) was shown to be crucial for binding of KDEL ligands (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To determine whether a change of Asp-50 affects ligand specificity, we tested the binding activity of KDEL and DDEL peptides to the Asp-50 → Cys mutant. Octapeptides were shown to bind with higher affinity than tetrapeptides, 2A. Scheel, unpublished observation. presumably because sequences upstream of the tetrapeptide signal contribute to the interaction with the receptor. To eliminate these additional effects, we used tetrapeptides as competitors for binding of radioactively labeled YTFEHDEL. Binding of 125I-YTFEHDEL to the Cys-less receptor was competed efficiently with the peptide KDEL, whereas the peptide DDEL competed poorly (Fig.6 A), consistent with earlier findings (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of DDEL peptides to Asp-50 → Cys was comparable with binding to the Cys-less receptor; a concentration of approximately 250 μm DDEL was required to compete 50% of125I-YTFEHDEL bound to the Cys-less mutant or Asp-50 → Cys (Fig. 6). Strikingly, KDEL was a substantially worse competitor with the Asp-50 → Cys mutant than with the Cys-less receptor (Fig.6 B). The same effect, which was specific for Asp-50 → Cys, was observed for HDEL and RDEL peptides. These results suggest that the efficient binding of peptides with a positive charge at position −4 from the carboxyl terminus of the ligand (HDEL, KDEL, RDEL) requires the aspartic acid at position 50, presumably involving a direct ionic interaction. This paper describes an investigation of the three-dimensional organization of the human KDEL receptor Erd2.1, using a site-directed sulfhydryl labeling approach. We show that all four endogenous Cys residues of the human KDEL receptor can be removed without affecting the ligand binding activity. Furthermore, the removal of cysteine 29 leads to the expression of almost homogeneously active receptor protein in Sf9 cells. Together with an earlier study, in which we describe the high level expression and the purification of functional receptor protein (9Scheel A.A. Pelham H.R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10203-10209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this will prove to be a significant step toward the determination of the receptor structure by two-dimensional crystallization and cryo-electron microscopy. We have investigated the topology of the KDEL receptor by testing the sidedness of amino acids relative to the lipid bilayer using membrane-permeant and -impermeant thiol-specific reagents. This was of particular interest since the topology of the amino-terminal half of the KDEL receptor has been controversial (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Using this method, we have demonstrated that both Arg-5 → Cys and Asp-50 → Cys are not accessible to membrane-impermeant reagents, indicating that these residues are located in the lumen of the membrane compartments and contribute to the formation of a hydrophilic binding site for KDEL ligands, which is not accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Furthermore, Cys-29 was shown to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This suggests that the amino terminus is located in the lumen as proposed previously (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Together with the location of Thr-85 → Cys and Thr-114 → Cys, which were shown to be located on the cytoplasmic and lumenal side of the membrane, respectively, these findings strongly point toward a two-dimensional organization of the KDEL receptor analogous to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors with seven membrane-spanning segments. By determining the binding activity of single cysteine mutants of the human KDEL receptor after reaction with thiol-specific reagents, we have identified four residues that we believe contribute to the formation of a hydrophilic binding pocket for KDEL ligands (Arg-5, Asp-50, Tyr-162, and Asn-165). The KDEL binding activity of these mutants is considerably decreased compared with the Cys-less receptor and alkylation of these cysteines further inhibits KDEL binding. This suggests that these four residues play a critical role in KDEL binding and that the alkylation of the cysteine replacing the wild-type residue leads to steric hindrance of ligand binding. We do not believe that these mutations cause a significant change in receptor conformation, as these mutants retain substantial KDEL binding activity and no differences in expression levels could be observed compared with the wild-type receptor. Furthermore, mutations of these residues described earlier (Arg-5 → Gln, Asp-50 → Asn, and Asn-165 → Ala) do not interfere with the proper localization of these mutants to the Golgi apparatus and no accumulation of the mutants in the ER, indicative of misfolded proteins, was observed (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reaction of Tyr-162 → Cys and Asn-165 → Cys with biotin maleimide was less efficient compared with Arg-5 → Cys and Asp-50 → Cys, presumably because they are located closer to the inside of the hydrophilic binding pocket, making their side chains less accessible to a bulkier reagent such as BCM, whereas a smaller reagent, NEM, was still efficient in inhibiting binding of YTSEKDEL. Arg-5 → Cys was equally well labeled by both NEM and biotin maleimide, and residual KDEL binding to Arg-5 → Cys was efficiently inhibited by both reagents. Strikingly, all four residues are predicted to be located at the lumenal end of the transmembrane domains based on a model with seven transmembrane domains (see Fig. 1). Asp-50 → Cys is a particularly interesting mutant. KDEL binding, which is substantially reduced compared with the Cys-less receptor, could only be inhibited by reaction with biotin maleimide, although labeling of this mutant with both NEM and biotin maleimide was efficient. This suggests that this residue is located closer to the opening of the binding pocket than Arg-5 → Cys, and a large group added to the cysteine side chain is required to perturb peptide binding. Furthermore, we have studied the effects of this mutation on the specificity of ligand binding. As mentioned above, the yeastK. lactis uses both HDEL and DDEL as retention signals, whereas the S. cerevisiae receptor only recognizes HDEL. Studies in yeast suggest that amino acids 51–57 in the K. lactis receptor determine ligand specificity in vivo(11Semenza J.C. Pelham H.R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the corresponding residues (amino acids 50–56) in the human receptor were replaced with theK. lactis sequence, which significantly decreased the ability of the human receptor to bind KDEL ligands but not DDEL ligands, both in vitro and in vivo (8Wilson D.W. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1992; 68: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Asp-50 in the human receptor sequence is required for the efficient binding of KDEL ligands; the binding of KDEL (and other peptides with a positive charge at the position −4 such as HDEL and RDEL) to Asp-50 → Cys was strongly reduced, whereas the binding of DDEL peptides was unaffected. This suggests that DDEL, at least partly, interacts with different amino acids than H/KDEL as proposed previously (11Semenza J.C. Pelham H.R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The fact that binding of peptides with a positive charge (His, Lys, or Arg) is specifically weakened by a mutation in the receptor that changes a negatively charged residue to a polar residue implicates a direct interaction. Close proximity between this residue and the ligand is also supported by the finding that ligand binding to Asp-50 → Cys was inhibited by alkylation of the cysteine side chain (see above). Strikingly, Asp-50 is conserved in all Erd2 sequences known except for the K. lactis receptor. The importance of this residue is further demonstrated by the fact that one of the receptor mutants originally isolated in S. cerevisiaewas localized to the equivalent residue in the yeast receptor, changing the aspartate to an asparagine (2Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, there must be other interactions significantly contributing to ligand binding, in particular to the binding of HDEL peptides; the K. lactisreceptor, which has an asparagine residue at the corresponding location, binds HDEL ligands in vivo, but not KDEL ligands. In addition, the binding of HDEL was substantially worsened by the Asp-50 → Cys mutation, but it still binds considerably tighter to Asp-50 → Cys than all other peptides tested, suggesting additional interactions of the histidine residue both in the human and theK. lactis receptor. Furthermore, our competition experiments were performed with tetrapeptides. They bind with lower affinity to the receptor than the corresponding octapeptides, indicating that interactions with residues upstream of the conserved tetrapeptide contribute to ligand binding, although no sequence conservation among different ER proteins can be observed (1Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Additionally, soluble ER proteins have been identified without a positively charged residue at position −4 (1Pelham H.R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our study provides insight into the three-dimensional organization of the KDEL receptor; we present evidence for the existence of a hydrophilic ligand binding pocket formed by conserved amino acid residues of the transmembrane domains. Together with earlier findings (12Townsley F.M. Wilson D.W. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2821-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Singh P. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6435-6441Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), our data suggest a secondary structure of the KDEL receptor with seven membrane-spanning domains, similar to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. Furthermore, we have shown that Asp-50 is involved in determining the ligand specificity, presumably by directly pairing with a positively charged amino acid at position −4 from the COOH terminus of the ligand."

Digestion of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in gastrointestinal tract involves several hydrolysis reactions. A variety of lipases, including acid lipase in lingual gland or stomach, and pancreatic lipase (which is of primary importance in luminal digestion of fats), hydrolyze triacylglycerol to produce monoacylglycerols and free fatty acids (see Refs. 1Carey M.C.

Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 876-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Lysophospholipid can be directly absorbed, or hydrolyzed by pancreatic lysophospholipase and converted to glycerol 3-phosphate esters and fatty acids. Until recently, all those processes were believed to proceed in the lumen of alimentary tracts by the action of secretory enzymes mentioned above. However, recent studies suggest the presence of a lipid-hydrolyzing enzyme associated with intestinal brush border membranes (5Diagne A. Mitjavila S. Fauvel J. Chap H. Douste B.L. Lipids. 1987; 22: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 6Pind S. Kuksis A. Lipids. 1989; 24: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), named phospholipase B/lipase (PLB/LIP) because this enzyme displayed broad lipolytic activities (PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities) (7Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaebe A. Chap H. J Biol Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLB/LIP might participate in terminal digestion, or membrane digestion, of dietary lipids and biliary phospholipids, like well established glycosidases and peptidases in brush border membranes (8Semenza G.

In the preceding paper, we detailed the purification and characterization of the catalytic domain of PLB/LIP after its solubilization from the membrane by autolysis. The purified enzyme consisted of a 14-kDa peptide and a 21-kDa glycosylated peptide and catalyzed PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase reactions in a single active site (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M.

To understand the molecular basis of such a broad enzyme specificity, the structure of the nascent enzyme, the membrane anchoring mode, and its physiological significance, we cloned and sequenced the full-length PLB/LIP cDNA based on information of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of the two peptides derived from the purified enzyme. PLB/LIP is translated as a large single peptide of 1450 amino acids containing a signal peptide, four tandem repeats, and the COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretch. The second repeat has the stretch coding the amino acid sequences found in the previously purified enzyme and has full enzymatic activities, as confirmed by the expression of individual repeats in COS-7 cells. Furthermore, to determine whether or not the hydrophobic stretch is responsible for a membrane anchor, a deleted mutant was constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Trioleoylglycerol (TOG), 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-palmitoyl-GPC), and diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) were purchased from Sigma. Surgically removed rat intestines were washed with distilled water. The ileal mucosa was scraped off and stored at −80 °C until use. The frozen tissues (about 1.0 g) were homogenized in 10 ml of 4 mguanidine thiocyanate containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 2% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The homogenate was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and RNA in the aqueous phase separated by centrifugation was precipitated with ethanol. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with 200 units of SuperScript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 150 ng random hexanucleotides in a 20-μl reaction mixture according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The products were heated at 70 °C for 5 min, and then a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was added to a 90-μl PCR mixture containing 100 pmol of primers. The primers used were as follows: primer KF, ccggatccAA(A/G)TT(C/T)ACITG(C/T)CCIGA(C/T)AA(A/G)GA(C/T)CC, corresponding to the previously determined peptide, KFTCPDKDP, followed by BamHI adaptor; primer QT, GCIGT(C/T)TTIAT(A/G)TT(A/G)TCIGT(A/G)AANGT(C/T)TG, corresponding to the peptide QTFTDNIKTA (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), where the letter I in the oligonucleotide sequences means inosine. The PCR was conducted in 30 cycles of reactions at 94 °C for 40 s, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The amplified DNA fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining as a single band of 540 bp on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The products were directly cloned into pCRII plasmid vector (Invitrogen) without further purification. Six clones containing the PCR products were isolated. Double-stranded DNA sequencing of each clone was performed by the dideoxy method (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automatic DNA sequencer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Predicted amino acid sequences at both termini of these clones coincided with those of the primers. One clone named pCR-RIPLB was used as the probe DNA for RNA blot analysis and screening of a λ phage library. A rat ileum mucosa cDNA library was prepared based on the method of Gubler and Hoffman (11Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar) using a λMosElox cloning vector (Amersham). Six μg of poly(A)+ RNA, an oligo(dT) primer, and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase were used for the first strand synthesis. The second strand was then synthesized by treatment with RNase H and DNA polymerase I, and then the generated cDNA was blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase, ligated to EcoRI adaptor (Amersham) by T4 ligase, and further treated with polynucleotide kinase. The cDNA greater than 500 bp in length were selected on a spin column. The resultant cDNAs were ligated into anEcoRI site of λMosElox vector, and the vectors were packaged into 3 × 106 phages. The library was screened without amplification. For screening, 105 phages were plated and replicas were made from the resultant plaques (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positively hybridizable plaques were screened with a 32P-labeled BamHI cDNA fragment of pCR-RIPLB and 50 strongly hybridized clones were selected and stored at 4 °C. Randomly chosen 20 clones of the 50 were subjected to the second screening, and 19 positive clones were isolated. To recover the cloned cDNAs as plasmids, anEscherichia coli strain BM25.8 (Amersham) was infected with the λ phage, and plasmid was subcloned by a cre(site-direct endonuclease)-mediated plasmid self-subclone system (13Palazzolo M.J. Hamilton B.A. Ding D.L. Martin C.H. Mead D.A. Mierendorf R.C. Raghavan K.V. Meyerowitz E.M. Lipshitz H.D. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmids prepared from ampicillin-resistant colonies were digested withEcoRI, and the fragments were separated on an agarose gel. Four clones revealed an identical pattern composed of three fragments of 1.4 kb, 3.1 kb, and 4.0 kb. Since the 4.0-kb fragment was derived from the vector, we concluded that each of these four clones contained a 4.5-kb insert with a single EcoRI site, which was the same size as the PLB/LIP transcript as judged by Northern blot analysis. One of the four clones, named pMOS-RIPLB3, was used for further analysis. To determine its complete nucleotide sequence, theEcoRI-digested cDNA fragments were independently subcloned into pBluescript KS(−) (Stratagene). A plasmid containing a 1.4-kb cDNA fragment (NH2-terminal portion) and that containing a 3.1-kb fragment (COOH-terminal portion) were named pBS-3S and pBS-3L, respectively. Clones having various sizes of the insert were obtained from each plasmid by ExoIII nuclease and mung bean digestion system (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a PLB/LIP fragment (amino acids 450–1450). The antigen was produced in E. coli as a fusion protein using T7 RNA polymerase expression system (14Tabor S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Vark A. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc./John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). AnEcoRI insert of pBS-3L encoding the peptide was subcloned into EcoRI-cleaved pET28a(+) vector (Novagen), and it was transfected into E. coli strain, BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The expressed proteins were solubilized from a particulate fraction of cell homogenates with an SDS sample buffer containing 1% SDS and 10% mercaptoethanol, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (15Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Harikrishna J.A. Lin D. Wolf C.R. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Nonaka Y. Takemori H. Halder S.K. Sun T. Ohta M. Hatano O. Takakusu A. Okamoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fusion protein (about 1.5 mg) was electrophoretically extracted from the gel slices (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Its aliquot (about 0.4 mg) was emulsified with 2 volumes of complete Freund's adjuvant and used to immunize Japanese white rabbits (females, body weight of 2.0 kg). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from 15 ml of antiserum by an IgG purification kit (Amersham). The freshly prepared intestinal mucosa was homogenized in 5 volumes of HBS buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2). Testis tissues and sperm collected from epididymis were sonicated in 10 volumes of HBS buffer, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, and pellets (membrane fraction) were taken and suspended in 0.1 volume of HBS buffer. All the samples were stored at −40 °C until use. The proteins (20 μg each) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (on 6 or 10% gels), and immunoblotting was performed as described (12Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes on the membranes were further reacted with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Cappel). The peroxidase conjugate was developed with a Konica immunostaining kit (Konica, Japan). To construct the expression vector, pMOS-RIPLB3 was partially digested byBamHI and the full-length 4.5-kb cDNA fragment having adaptor links on both sides was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the BamHI site of a pSVL vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). This vector, named pSVL-RIPLB3, had an extra ATG atNcoI site in the adaptor sequence preceding the initiating ATG of RIPLB cDNA. This was removed by replacing an XhoI fragment of pSVL-RIPLB3 with a fragment from the initiator ATG toXhoI site (nucleotide position 333) that was amplified by PCR using the pMOS-RIPLB3 as a template and primers, Nfor (Fig.3 b) and L331 (CATTCTGTAGTTCGCTCTCGAGGC). The resultant vector was named pSVL-RIPLB. Expression plasmids for repeats 1, 2, 3, or 4, named pSVL#1, pSVL#2, pSVL#3, or pSVL#4, respectively, were constructed by linking a cDNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal peptide of PLB/LIP including the signal peptide with a cDNA encoding each repeat to meet requirements for secretable proteins. We first constructed pSVL-Nhead that contains a cDNA encoding amino acids 1–40 of PLB/LIP and a synthetic polylinker consisting of NheI andDraI sites, a stop codon, and a MluI site in this order. The insert was amplified by PCR using primers Nfor and Nrev (Fig. 3), and pSVL-RIPLB as template, and subcloned directly into a pMOS-Blue vector (Amersham). The ApaI-BamHI fragment excised from this vector was substituted for anApaI-BamHI fragment of pSVL-RIPLB, generating pSVL-Nhead. pSVL#1 containing amino acids 1–357 of PLB/LIP was generated by replacing an ApaI-DraI fragment of pSVL-Nhead with an ApaI-PvuII fragment of pSVL-RIPLB (Fig.3). Expression vectors for the other repeats were constructed as follows. Fragments encoding repeats 2, 3, and 4 were first amplified by PCR using the pSVL-RIPLB template, sense primers (F2, F3, and F4, respectively) with a 5′-terminal NheI site, and antisense primers (R2, R3, and R4, respectively) with a 5′-terminalMluI and stop codon. Then they were digested byNheI and MluI, and the resultant fragments were finally cloned into pSVL-Nhead that had been previously digested by the same restriction endonucleases. An expression vector lacking the COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretch (pSVL-ΔC) was constructed by replacing the 3′-side BamHI fragment of pSVL-RIPLB (nucleotides 3701–3′ end) with that of pSVL#4 (nucleotides 3701–4259). COS-7 cells (4 × 106 cells) suspended in 0.4 ml of saline G were transfected with the plasmids (50 μg) in the presence of 250 μg of carrier DNA by electroporation using a single pulse (125 microfarads at 400 V) as reported (16Nonaka Y. Takemori H. Halder S.K. Sun T. Ohta M. Hatano O. Takakusu A. Okamoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection estimated by enzyme activity recovered medium and cell fractions depended on cell density (16Nonaka Y. Takemori H. Halder S.K. Sun T. Ohta M. Hatano O. Takakusu A. Okamoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); the cell density of 60–70% confluence was optimal. The transfected cells were plated on two 9-cm dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The medium was changed once every 24 h. The medium was recovered for enzyme assay, and the cells were harvested for immunoblot and Northern blot analyses after 72 h. Cells were sonicated in 600 μl of HBS buffer, and the sonicate was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min to obtain the cytosol and membrane fractions. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of HBS buffer. All the fractions were stored at −40 °C until use. PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities were measured using POPC, 1-palmitoyl-GPC, and triolein as substrates, respectively, as described in the preceding paper (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The lipolytic activities of PLB/LIP toward exogenous substrates were expressed as the difference between the activities in the presence and absence of the substrates and as nanomoles of free fatty acid released/1 min. Protein concentration was measured by a Bio-Rad protein assay system. Total RNA (1 μg) prepared from the ileum and poly(A)-rich RNA (1 μg) prepared from esophagus or testis were reverse-transcribed as described above. Transcripts (4 μl) were mixed with a pair of primers (50 pmol each), Nfor and R2 or F3 and R4, in 5 μl of 10 × Taq polymerase buffer supplied by company (Takara), 4 μl of 10 mm dNTP solution, 5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and H2O to give the final volume of reaction mixture, 50 μl. The mixture was overlaid with 30 μl of mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Taq polymerase (2.5 units) was added to the reaction mixture, and the chain reaction was conducted as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72 °C for 4 min with 30 cycles. Rat ileum and testis were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 h. Frozen sections (6 μm) prepared on glass slides were stained immunohistochemically (17Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to incubation with the primary antiserum, the sections were treated with Gomori's oxidation mixture (0.5% potassium permanganate, 0.25% sulfuric acid) (18Kurabuchi S. Tanaka S. Cell. Tissue Res. 1997; 288: 485-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The primary antiserum was diluted 1:300, and the second antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG) was diluted 1:300. For the controls, the preimmune rabbit serum and the primary antiserum absorbed by the E. coli extract containing overexpressed antigen (PLB/LIP) were used. The E. coli containing PLB/LIP was solubilized in 1% SDS-PBS, diluted 20 times with PBS, and incubated with the antiserum for 12 h at 4 °C. The specimens were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For testes, photographs were taken in combination with phase-contrast transmission light. A set of oligonucleotide primers designed on the basis of previously determined partial amino acid sequences of rat intestinal PLB/LIP (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for amplification of cDNA fragments from total RNA of intestinal mucosa by RT-PCR. The PCR products were visualized as a clear 540-bp single band on agarose or polyacrylamide gel. The cDNA was sequenced, and parts of the predicted amino acid sequence coincided with those of peptides derived from the purified enzyme. The cDNA was used as a probe for screening the cDNA library of ileal mucosa. Four independent clones were isolated, all having the identical fragment pattern when digested by restriction enzymes. A cDNA insert of one of the clones was cleaved in two fragments by EcoRI digestion, each of which was subcloned into plasmid and partially sequenced. A longer fragment had a poly(A) tail and the sequence corresponding to the large peptide of purified PLB/LIP, and the other had a TGA-opal codon just six bases upstream of the first ATG starting codon and the sequence corresponding to its small peptide. From these results, we concluded that this clone contained a full open reading frame of PLB/LIP. As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length 4590-bp cDNA of PLB/LIP contained an open reading frame encoding a 1450-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 161 kDa and a potential polyadenylation sequence (AATAAn) (19Berget S.M. Nature. 1984; 309: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) just upstream of its poly(A) tail. Two hydrophobic regions were identified in the protein: the first was a putative 30-amino acid signal peptide at the NH2 terminus (20Rapoport T.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2792-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the second a stretch from residue 1421 to 1443, functioning as a transmembrane anchor as described below. Notably, the PLB/LIP contains four tandem repeats in a putative extracellular domain of the protein, each repeat being composed of about 350 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). These repeats began shortly after the signal sequence and occupied 93% of the entire protein. Amino acid sequences corresponding to the PCR-amplified cDNA probe were found in the second repeat. A Swissprot data base search revealed that the amino acid sequence of PLB/LIP was 67.9% identical to that of AdRab-B, the cDNA of which had been isolated as an adult-specific clone of rabbit intestine (21Boll W. Schmid-Chanda T. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins shared functionally important domains, i.e. a putative NH2-terminal signal sequence, four tandem repeats each of which was composed of about 350 amino acids and occupied more than 90% of the entire protein, and a short hydrophobic stretch followed by a short hydrophilic one at the COOH-terminal end. There are 14 potential N-glycosylation sites, of which one is in the NH2-terminal sequence preceding repeat 1, two in repeat 1, one in repeat 2, six in repeat 3, and four in repeat 4, when weak sites in an Asn-Pro-Ser(Thr) sequence were not counted. To confirm that the rat intestinal PLB/LIP cDNA determined here encodes an active enzyme, we expressed the full-length cDNA in COS-7 cells. The cells and culture media were separately recovered and the former was further fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression was assessed in these fractions by enzyme assay and immunoblot analyses. The cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid revealed greatly enhanced PLA2, lysophospholipase and lipase activities, compared with cells transfected with the pSVL vector alone. This confirmed that the full-length PLB/LIP exhibits the same substrate specificity as the enzyme purified from rat intestine (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as a single polypeptide protein. These activities were mainly localized in membrane fractions as verified by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4, a andb), confirming PLB/LIP is a membrane-bound protein (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The enzyme produced by COS-7 cells apparently migrated as two bands on a 6% gel, and their estimated molecular masses (∼200 and 220 kDa) were larger than that calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence data (161 kDa). This may be due in part to the difference in the degree of glycosylation. The COOH-terminal segment, residues 1421–1443, is the only stretch that is hydrophobic and long enough to meet requirement for membrane anchoring. To determine whether the stretch plays a role in binding of the enzyme to membrane, an expression vector (pSVL-ΔC) that lacked the COOH-terminal 42 amino acid residues (Fig. 3c) was constructed and introduced into COS-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that about 90% of the expressed truncated enzyme was recovered in culture media (Fig. 4a), in contrast with membrane localization of the full-length PLB/LIP. In that culture medium, PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities were unexpectedly not observed, but a substantial activity of lipase was detectable. The truncated protein, however, restored phospholipid hydrolyzing activities to the level as comparable as lipase activity, when dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the reaction mixtures to the final concentration of 4–20 mm. This apparent activation of PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities occurred only in the truncated enzyme released in culture media. DTT (4 mm) treatment had little effect on the activities of the membrane-bound PLB/LIP. There are two possibilities that the COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretch can serve as a direct membrane anchor or as a signal for attaching a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety to the COOH-terminal end after the cleavage of that stretch (22Thomas J.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5413-5422Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As in the case of PLB/LIP in brush border membranes (9Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), phospholipase C treatment (25 and 100 munits/ml) did not solubilized PLA2 activity in membrane fractions of full-length PLB/LIP-expressing COS-7 cells, but treatment with 1% Triton X-100, a poor solubilizer for GPI-anchored proteins (23Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 865-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), did solubilize 72% of the activity. This suggests that the hydrophobic stretch functions as a direct membrane anchor. The enzyme purified from rat intestine had an apparent molecular weight of 35,000 with PLA2, lysophospholipase and lipase activities. It consisted of the 14-kDa and 21-kDa peptides, and their amino acid sequences were derived from the second repeat of PLB/LIP, suggesting the second repeat is a catalytic domain. To determine which domains are responsible for the activities observed in the expressed full-length and purified natural PLB/LIP, we constructed four expression vectors, each of which contained a nucleotide sequence encoding a NH2-terminal signal peptide and the respective repeats (Fig. 3 c), and transfected them into COS-7 cells. The antibody used in this study (r"

Synaptojanin is a PIP 5-phosphatase that is expressed in a brain-specific and a ubiquitous splice variants and is thought to constitute the major PIP 5-phosphatase in mammalian brain (Woscholski, R., Finan, P. M., Radley, E., Totty, N. F., Sterling, A. E., Hsuan, J. J., Waterfield, M. D., and Parker, P. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 9625–9628). We now describe synaptojanin 2, a novel isoform of synaptojanin that, similar to synaptojanin 1, contains an N-terminal SAC1-like sequence and a central 5-phosphatase domain but a distinct, unique C-terminal sequence. Transfection studies demonstrated that synaptojanin 2, like synaptojanin 1, is an active PIP phosphatase. An interesting feature of synaptojanin 1 is the presence of a long open reading frame in the 3′ region of the brain mRNA that in non-brain tissues is joined to the coding region by alternative splicing, resulting in a shorter synaptojanin 1 form in brain and a longer form in peripheral tissues (Ramjaun, A. R., and McPherson, P. S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24856–24861). Although it exhibits no homology to synaptojanin 1 in this region, synaptojanin 2 also contains an open reading frame in the 3′ region that is subject to alternative splicing. Similar to synaptojanin 1, alternative splicing of synaptojanin 2 is tissue-specific and creates a shorter isoform expressed in brain and a longer form in peripheral tissues. The similar alternative splicing of two homologous proteins in a region of non-homology raises the possibility of evolutionary convergence and supports the significance of the variants. Analysis of mRNAs from three brain regions at different developmental stages revealed that alternative splicing of synaptojanin 2 is a developmentally late event, occurring only after the first postnatal week after the generation of neurons and initial synaptogenesis.

Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EST, expressed sequence tag; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol diphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EST, expressed sequence tag; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol diphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate; bp, base pair(s). are minor components of the cellular phospholipids with major roles in signal transduction and membrane traffic (1Majerus P.W.

PIPs can carry phosphates at the 3, 4, and 5 positions of the inositol ring in various combinations. The synthesis and hydrolysis of PIPs are mediated by a tightly regulated network of PIP kinases and phosphatases with distinct substrate specificities (1Majerus P.W.

Studies in permeabilized PC12 cells demonstrated that a PIP 5-kinase is essential for Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (3Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), suggesting that generation of PIPs with 5-phosphates is involved in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. PIPs have also been proposed to function in endocytosis because they bind to a number of proteins involved in endocytosis (4Norris F.A. Ungewickell E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 214-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 5Hao W. Tan Z. Prasad K. Reddy K.K. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Falck J.R. Shears S.B. Lafer E.M. J. Biol.

Because PIPs have such a central role in membrane traffic and signal transduction, termination of the PIP signal by phosphate hydrolysis must be a key regulatory step. A PIP 5-phosphatase called synaptojanin was recently discovered that is enriched in synaptic nerve terminals (7McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and may serve to inactivate the PIP 5-phosphate signal. Synaptojanin is ubiquitously expressed and hydrolyzes soluble inositol 5-phosphates as well as lipidic PIP2 and PIP3phosphorylated in the 5-position (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C.

Synaptojanin is composed of three principal domains: an N-terminal domain homologous to the yeast membrane trafficking protein SAC1, a central domain that carries the phosphatase activity, and a C-terminal domain that is not similar to any currently known protein but highly enriched in proline. Three homologues of synaptojanin have been identified in the yeast genome that also contain an N-terminal SAC1 domain and a middle 5-phosphatase domain but differ from synaptojanin and from each other in their C-terminal sequences (1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin was first identified as a phosphoprotein purified on immobilized Grb2 (7McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Later the C-terminal proline-rich domain of synaptojanin was shown to interact with the SH3 domain of amphiphysin, suggesting a function in endocytosis (10de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, the relative significance of the enzymatic activity and protein interactions of synaptojanin have not been elucidated. In addition to the three principal domains, the synaptojanin mRNA contains an open reading frame in the 3′ region separated from the proline-rich C-terminal sequence by a stop codon (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Although synaptojanin was initially thought to be brain-specific, PCR experiments revealed that it is ubiquitously expressed and that it is alternatively spliced (11Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In brain, synaptojanin is present in a splice variant containing a stop codon after the proline-rich domain, whereas in peripheral tissues the stop codon is spliced out, and a longer protein is produced in which the open reading frame is fused to the proline-rich sequence. Thus two different forms of synaptojanin are produced, a shorter form that is expressed primarily in neurons in brain where it seems to be concentrated in nerve terminals and a longer ubiquitous form (11Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have now identified a second isoform of synaptojanin that is similar in its N-terminal SAC1 and phosphatase domains but differs in the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, this isoform is also subject to alternative splicing at the C terminus despite the lack of homology between synaptojanins in the alternatively spliced sequences. Our data suggest that in brain and other mammalian tissues, PIP signaling may be more complex than previously envisioned and involve multiple differentially regulated PIP 5-phosphatases that are subject to coordinate alternative splicing. GenBank™ was searched using the BLAST programs of the NCBI. A single candidate synaptojanin homologue was identified, the corresponding clone was obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (clone 360567; Ref. 12Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), mapped with restriction endonucleases, and sequenced after subcloning into pBlueScript II using standard procedures. The 5′AvaI fragment of the clone was used as a probe to screen a mouse brain cDNA library (Stratagene). Pooled λZAP clones were plaque-purified and sequenced after in vivo excision using standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 14Ichtchenko K. Nguyen T. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2676-2682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc.). The sequences have been submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AF026123). A synaptojanin 1 expression vector (pMESJ1) was constructed by amplifying its complete coding region by PCR using oligonucleotides 1581 and 1578 (sequences GCGAATTCGGCTGCCTCTGAAGAAAGGAGAATGGCG and GCGACTAGTTACCCTGTTGGTTGCTCCTGTTGTAGC) and cloning the PCR product into the EcoRI and SpeI sites of pME18Sf. A synaptojanin 2 expression vector (pCMVmycSJ2) containing the putative phosphatase domain and the C-terminal domain (residues 505–1206; see Fig. 1) N-terminally fused to the myc epitope was created by subcloning the BamHI-AvrII fragment of the cDNA into the BglII and XbaI sites of pCMV5. Total RNA was purified from 100 mg each of adult mouse brain, postnatal mouse brains (days 1–20), embryonic mouse brain (day 18), adult mouse heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, testis, and skeletal muscle tissues using RNASTAT-60 (TEL-TEST Inc). RNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. 10 μg of each RNA sample were reverse transcribed using SuperScript System (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT)12–18 primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forward and reverse primers GCGGATCCTTACAACGTCAAACAGATCAAAACCAC and GCGAATTCCACTCGGCCTCCTCTCAACACCTCTC (BamHI andEcoRI sites are underlined) were used for PCR amplifications with AmpliTAQ DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCRs were performed in 38 cycles, with the first three cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 1 min. Products were separated on 2% agarose gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA), purified using a Qiaex kit (Qiagen), and cloned into pBlueScript vector after digestion with BamHI andEcoRI for sequencing. The sequences of the PCR products consistently contained multiple substitutions compared with the sequences of the cDNA clones, possibly because they were derived from different mouse strains (see GenBank™ entry). COS cells transfected with the synaptojanin 1, the synaptojanin 2, or control expression vectors were lysed by sonication in 4 mm CHAPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/l benzamidine, 10 mg/l leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin A. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by high speed centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 1 h). Proteins from the transfected COS cells were immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal rabbit serum raised against bacterially expressed synaptojanin 1 (T694) for synaptojanin 1-transfected COS cells and monoclonal antibody 9E10 against themyc epitope for synaptojanin 2-transfected COS cells because synaptojanin 2 was expressed as a myc epitope fusion protein. All immunoprecipitations were also carried out with control transfected COS cells. Immunoprecipitates immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads were washed five times at 4 °C in assay buffer (4 mm CHAPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmMgCl2). The PIP2 activity of the washed immunoprecipitates was then determined essentially as described (15Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a lipid mix containing 0.67 g/liter phosphatidylcholine, 0.33 g/liter phosphatidylserine (from Avanti lipids), and 1.4 μm3H-phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (2.4 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was dispersed in assay buffer by sonication. Equal volumes (30 μl) of the lipid mix and the bead suspension were combined and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter 50 μg of total phosphoinositides (Sigma) were added as carrier lipids, and samples were extracted with 225 μl of chloroform:methanol:concentrated HCl (100:200:1) followed by extraction with 75 μl of chloroform and 0.1 n HCl. The chloroform was evaporated under nitrogen, and lipids were redissolved in chloroform and separated by thin layer chromatography on Whatman silica gel 6 nm plates using a n-propanol, NH4OH, and water (65:20:15) as solvent system. The corresponding spots for phosphatidylinositol, PIP, and PIP2 were identified using lipid markers as internal standards visualized with iodine vapors, scraped out, and counted by liquid scintillation counting. The yeast genome contains three genes for synaptojanin-like proteins, but only a single such gene was described in mammals (1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Synaptojanin may be considered as corresponding to two isoforms because it is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner (11Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Yet it seemed unlikely that the mammalian genome would not contain additional 5-phosphatases of this family in view of the apparent complexity of synaptojanin-like PIP 5-phosphatases in yeast. Therefore we searched the EST data bank for synaptojanin homologues. We identified a single mouse EST closely related to synaptojanin (clone 370576) and named the corresponding protein synaptojanin 2. Northern blots of synaptojanin 2 showed that it is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels in heart and brain (data not shown). Sequencing of the mouse EST clone suggested that it is nearly full-length. Screening a mouse cDNA library allowed us to isolate more 5′ sequences and to assemble a composite sequence that contains almost the complete coding sequence of synaptojanin 2 (Fig.1). Based on the comparison with synaptojanin 1, approximately 30 amino acids are missing. Mouse synaptojanin 2 is closely related to synaptojanin 1. Both synaptojanins contain an N-terminal SAC1 domain and a central PIP 5-phosphatase region (Fig. 2). The N-terminal SAC1 domains of synaptojanins 1 and 2 are 53.7% identical, and their central PIP 5-phosphatase domains are 57.6% identical (Fig. 1). In contrast, the C-terminal domains are not conserved between the synaptojanins (19.3% identity). The C-terminal domain of synaptojanin 2 exhibits no similarity to proteins currently in the data banks. This domain is not highly enriched in prolines (8.7% prolines), whereas the sequence of the corresponding C-terminal domain of synaptojanin 1 is highly enriched in prolines (19.8% prolines). The domain structure and homology between synaptojanins 1 and 2 suggest that they represent isoforms with shared N-terminal and divergent C-terminal domains. Recent studies demonstrated that synaptojanin 1 is a PIP phosphatase that hydrolyzes PIP2 and PIP3 (9Woscholski R. Finan P.M. Radley E. Totty N.F. Sterling A.E. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9625-9628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 10de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The homology of synaptojanin 2 to synaptojanin 1 suggests that synaptojanin 2 may also function as a phosphatase. To directly test this hypothesis, we expressed synaptojanin 1 and 2 by transfection in COS cells. Synaptojanin 1 was expressed as a full-length protein, and synaptojanin 2 was expressed as a truncated protein that was N-terminally fused to the myc epitope to allow efficient immunoprecipitation. COS cells transfected with the synaptojanin vectors, and control plasmids were subjected to immunoprecipitations using antibodies to synaptojanin 1 in case of the synaptojanin 1 transfections (Fig.3 A) or antibodies to themyc epitope in case of the synaptojanin 2 transfections (Fig. 3 B). The PIP phosphatase activity of the immunoprecipitates was measured using 3H-labeled PIP2 and thin layer chromatography for detection of the hydrolysis products (15Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The assays unequivocally demonstrated that both synaptojanins hydrolyze PIP2 to PIP (Fig. 3). No hydrolysis to phosphatidylinositol was detected as would be expected from the predicted specificity of synaptojanins as 5′-phosphatases (1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,15Woscholski R. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31001-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The background activity of the control immunoprecipitates was at the level of the assay buffer for synaptojanin 2, suggesting that the entire PIP2 phosphatase activity measured was due to the transfected protein. In the case of synaptojanin 1, however, the background activity obtained with the immunoprecipitates with the synaptojanin 1 antibodies from the control transfected COS cells was higher than the buffer background, presumably because the synaptojanin 1 antibody reacts with low levels of endogenous synaptojanin 1 present in the COS cells. Together these data show that synaptojanins 1 and 2 have comparable PIP phosphatase activities and that mammals contain multiple related PIP 5-phosphatases. The 3′-untranslated region of the synaptojanin 2 clone we analyzed contains a long open reading frame (243 residues) that starts 23 bp after the stop codon in a reading frame different from that of the preceding synaptojanin 2 sequence. The sequence of this open reading frame in the 3′-untranslated region is enriched in proline (15.0% of residues) but exhibits no other remarkable features. Data base searches failed to detect any similarity of this sequence with current entries. Synaptojanin 1 also contains a large open reading frame in the 3′-untranslated region of the brain mRNA that is proline-rich (14.3% of residues). Alternative splicing joins this open reading frame to the 5′ coding region in peripheral tissues (11Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The presence of a large open reading frame in the 3′ region of synaptojanin 2 suggests the possibility that this reading frame may also be joined to the synaptojanin 2 coding sequence by alternative splicing in some tissues, similar to the situation with synaptojanin 1. To test this possibility, we performed PCR experiments on first strand cDNA from a variety of tissues (Fig. 4). In most tissues, two PCR products were observed: a larger 544-bp product and a shorter 394-bp product (A and B in Fig. 4). In addition, a third band was occasionally observed that probably is due to an artifact as judged by sequencing (asterisk in Fig. 4). The two specific PCR products were differentially distributed in different adult tissues; most tissues contain primarily the smaller product and express only low levels of the larger product except for brain, in which the larger product predominates. Sequencing revealed that the larger product corresponds to the sequence of the EST clone (Fig. 1) and contains a stop codon before the open reading frame in the 3′ region (Fig. 5). The sequence of the shorter product was identical to that of the larger product except that it contains an internal deletion of 146 bp that includes the stop codon. This creates a single open reading in which the main coding region of synaptojanin 2 is linked to the 3′ open reading frame. Thus the longer splice variant encodes a shorter protein whose sequence is shown in Fig. 1 (referred to as synaptojanin 2A). The shorter splice variant encodes a longer protein (synaptojanin 2B) that lacks the C-terminal 40 residues of synaptojanin 2A but instead contains a unique sequence of 243 residues (Fig. 5). Whereas the sequences of the PCR products were identical to each other, they exhibited several base pair substitutions with the sequence of the EST clone, possibly because the EST clone was from a different mouse strain than the RNA used for cDNA synthesis for the PCRs. To characterize the developmental time course of alternative splicing of synaptojanin 2, we also used PCR (Fig.6). Alternative splicing of synaptojanin 2 was not detectable during early development or even in the first postnatal week in mice. In the three brain regions examined, alternative splicing appeared with similar developmental profiles that differed only slightly. It was first observed between postnatal days 9 and 13 in cortex and cerebellum, and a few days later in the olfactory bulb. The appearance of alternative splicing is significantly later than synaptogenesis, which starts in the first week of life, suggesting that alternative splicing may be triggered by synaptogenesis instead of being involved in synaptogenesis. Synaptojanin 1 is a PIP 5-phosphatase that is enriched in nerve terminals and forms a complex with proteins involved in endocytosis (8McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X.M. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar,10de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Based on its catalytic activity and protein interactions, synaptojanin 1 may function in terminating a PIP signal for exocytosis or in triggering endocytosis, but its precise function is unclear. In view of the importance of PIP 5-phosphates in signal transduction and membrane traffic (1Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), PIP 5-phosphatases are likely to be key regulatory enzymes. Although synaptojanin 1 constitutes the major PIP 5-phosphatase in mammalian brain (9Woscholski R. Finan P.M. Radley E. Totty N.F. Sterling A.E. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9625-9628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the presence of multiple related genes in yeast suggests that PIP 5-phosphatase signaling probably is more complex than could be performed by a single enzyme. In the current study, we have identified a second isoform of synaptojanin 1 named synaptojanin 2 that also exhibits PIP phosphatase activity and is also alternatively spliced. These data suggest that in mammals, multiple synaptojanin PIP 5-phosphatases are active. A unitary domain map emerges for synaptojanins from the analysis of the two mammalian and three yeast proteins (Fig. 1). All of these proteins consist of an N-terminal SAC1-homology domain, a central catalytic PIP 5-phosphatase domain, and a nondescript C-terminal domain. The SAC1-homology and PIP 5-phosphatase domains are well conserved, whereas the C-terminal regions exhibit no sequence homologies. Thus these proteins represent a family of enzymes with divergent C termini that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man. In the three domains of these proteins, only the central domain has a well defined function as a phosphatase, although the biological significance of the phosphatase activity is unclear. The role of the N-terminal SAC1-homology domain is unknown; however, its homology to SAC1, a protein involved in membrane traffic and the cytoskeleton possibly via interaction with inositol derivatives (16Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggests a similar function. The C-terminal domain in synaptojanin 1 functions as a binding domain for SH3 domains in adaptor proteins such as amphiphysin (10de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because it is not conserved in synaptojanin 2, this is unlikely to be a central activity of synaptojanin 2. The most unexpected feature of the synaptojanins may consist in their coordinate C-terminal alternative splicing. Alternative splicing of synaptojanins 1 and 2 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, it is developmentally regulated in synaptojanin 2. Alternative splicing appears developmentally very late in brain, after synaptogenesis has started. Because protein production lags behind the mRNA synthesis monitored in the PCR experiments, it seems likely that the production of the short form of synaptojanin 2 either accompanies or follows synaptogenesis. Synaptojanins 1 and 2 are very similar in that both genes produce splicing variants in which the longer variant encoding a shorter protein is primarily expressed in brain and the shorter variant produces a longer protein in peripheral tissues (Fig. 4 and Ref. 11Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, this similar alternative splicing is unexpected because the C-terminal domains of synaptojanins and their alternatively spliced sequences exhibit no homology. Furthermore, the alternatively spliced sequences are of different sizes. The lack of homology in this region and the differences in size suggest that the coordinate alternative splicing of synaptojanins is not the result of evolutionary conservation but of evolutionary convergence, i.e. that it arose independently in evolution in the two different isoforms. If this is correct, there must have been considerable evolutionary pressure in producing the splice variants, even if they are not homologous to each other. Identification of the functions of synaptojanins and of the roles of their C-terminal domains will be instrumental in clarifying this issue. We thank T. Nguyen for the gift of cDNAs and Drs. M. S.

L., Tang, D., and Wang, J. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 1538–1543). The yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify p35 nck5a -interacting proteins from a human brain cDNA library. One of the isolated clones encodes a fragment of glial fibrillary acidic protein, which is a glial-specific protein. Sequence alignment revealed significant homology between the p35 nck5a -binding fragment of glial fibrillary acidic protein and corresponding regions in neurofilaments. The association between p35 nck5a and neurofilament medium molecular weight subunit (NF-M) was confirmed by both the yeast two-hybrid assay and direct binding of the bacteria-expressed proteins. The p35 nck5a binding site on NF-M was mapped to a carboxyl-terminal region of the rod domain, in close proximity to the putative Cdk5 phosphorylation sites in NF-M. A region immediately amino-terminal to the kinase-activating domain in p35 nck5a is required for its binding with NF-M. In in vitro binding assays, NF-M binds both monomeric p35 nck5a and the Cdk5/p35 nck5a complex. The binding of NF-M has no effect on the kinase activity of Cdk5/p35 nck5a .

Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an independent study, Nclk was also isolated as a tau protein kinase since it catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation of tau, which is a brain microtubule-associated protein (2Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M.

Okano T. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15056-15060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Nclk is a heterodimer of Cdk5 and a 25-kDa regulatory subunit (p25), which is derived proteolytically from a brain and neuron-specific 35-kDa protein (p35) (4Ishiguro K. Kobayashi S.

Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In view of its specific Cdk5 activating activity, p25/p35 is called neuronal Cdk5 activator (Nck5a). In addition, mammalian brains also contain a neuron-specific 39-kDa isoform of Nck5a, called neuronal Cdk5 activator isoform (Nck5ai) (7Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.-Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Tomizawa K.

Nck5a and Nck5ai display a high degree of protein sequence identity, but share little sequence homology with members of the cyclin family, thus suggesting that they represent a novel family of Cdk-activating proteins.Along with its unique structure, Nck5a is endowed with unique regulatory properties distinct from those of cyclins. While the activation of Cdc2 by cyclin depends on phosphorylation of Cdc2 by a Cdk-activating kinase at a specific threonine residue (Thr-161), the activation of Cdk5 by Nck5a is independent of Cdk5 phosphorylation (8Morgan D.O.

Also, several Cdc2-like kinases have been shown to be inactivated readily upon tyrosine phosphorylation by a Wee1 kinase (8Morgan D.O.

However, Cdk5/Nck5a is only sluggishly phosphorylated and inactivated by Wee1 (12Poon R.Y.C. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdk-cyclin complexes are susceptible to inhibitory activities of specific inhibitory proteins, such as p21 cip1/WAF1 and p27 kip1 (8Morgan D.O.

The apparent involvement of Nclk in neuronal differentiation and brain functions may be attributed to the roles of this enzyme in neurocytoskeletal dynamics. Among in vitro Nclk substrates are neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins such as tau and neurofilaments (3Hisanaga S. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okumura E. Okano T. Kishimoto T. J. Biol.

In Alzheimer patients, tau from neurofibrillary tangles is hyperphosphorylated on many proline-directed Ser/Thr sites (28Vulliet R. Halloran S.M. Braun R.K. Smith A.J. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22570-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have suggested that Nclk is a major kinase involved in catalyzing the proline-directed tau phosphorylation (2Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian neurofilaments consist of three protein components, neurofilament high (NF-H), medium (NF-M), and low (NF-L) molecular weight subunits, which are assembled into neurofilaments and transported down axons as discrete cytological structures (30Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 31Liem R.K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 131: 109-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During this transport, NF-H and NF-M are heavily phosphorylated on their tail domains at many proline-directed Ser/Thr sites (33Elhanany E. Jaffe H. Link W.T. Sheeley D.M. Gainer H. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Betts J.C. Blackstock W.P. Ward M.A. Anderton B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12922-12927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cdk5 has been suggested to participate in this axonal transport-dependent phosphorylation of the neurofilament proteins (24Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25922-25926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sun D. Leung C.L. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol.

This suggestion is supported by the observation that, in cultured neuronal cells, both Cdk5 and Nck5a are present throughout the axons where neurofilaments represent the bulk of the cytoskeletal proteins (18Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that Nck5a and Nclk associate specifically with the neurofilament proteins, an observation that may be the molecular basis of the colocalization and possible co-transportation of Nclk and neurofilaments in the axons. Our characterization of the interaction between Nck5a and neurofilaments is compatible with the notion that, in addition to kinase activation, Nck5a functions in anchoring Cdk5 to its kinase substrates.RESULTSIn a previous study, we showed that Nck5a existed in bovine brain extracts either as a 25-kDa fragment in a heterodimeric complex of Cdk5/p25 nck5a, or as the full-length protein (p35 nck5a ) in a macromolecular complex of over 600 kDa, which also contained Cdk5 as a constituent protein (38Lee K.-Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the suggestion that p35 nck5a has the ability to undergo high affinity association with certain cellular proteins. The yeast two-hybrid system was therefore employed to screen a human brain cDNA library to identify the putative p35 nck5a -binding proteins. About 3.5 × 105 cotransformants were analyzed. A total of 108 positive clones were isolated and introduced into another yeast strain to test binding specificities. 14 clones from the primary isolates displayed specific interaction with the original bait p35 nck5a /pAS2. Upon sequence analysis, these 14 clones were revealed to originate from seven different cDNA sequences. One of the isolated sequences, which represents three individual clones, encodes a carboxyl-terminal fragment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).Since Nck5a is a neuron-specific protein, whereas the expression of GFAP is restricted to glial cells, it is unlikely that these two proteins associate in brains under normal physiological conditions. However, the association of Nck5a with GFAP may reflect the ability of Nck5a to undergo association with certain neuronal proteins containing protein sequences similar to that of the Nck5a-binding region of GFAP. GFAP is a member of the intermediate filament family (30Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). All intermediate filaments share the basic architecture of a conserved central rod domain flanked by variable head and tail domains (30Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The isolated Nck5a-binding fragment consists of a carboxyl-terminal portion of the rod domain and the entire tail region of GFAP. Among the intermediate filament family members are the neuron-specific intermediate filaments, NF-L, NF-M and NF-H (30Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar, 31Liem R.K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 131: 109-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). NF-M and NF-H have been suggested as in vivo substrates of Cdk5 (3Hisanaga S. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okumura E. Okano T. Kishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15056-15060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Lew J. Winkfein R.J. Paudel H.K. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Sequence alignment displays high degrees of protein sequence identity between the Nck5a-binding region of GFAP and the corresponding rod regions in neurofilaments (Fig. 1), suggesting that Nck5a may bind neurofilaments in cells.To test whether neurofilaments are indeed capable of association with Nck5a, a fragment of NF-M, NF-M346–467, corresponding to the Nck5a-binding fragment of GFAP, was engineered into the plasmidpACT2 for the two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig.2, the reporter activity was detected when NF-M 346–467 /pACT2 was cotransformed with p35 nck5a /pAS2 into yeast cells, whereas cotransformation of a control plasmid lamin C/pAS2 with theNF-M 346–467 /pACT2 displayed no reporter activity. The result suggests that NF-M could indeed associate with Nck5a in the yeast. The fragment NF-M346–467 is composed of a carboxyl-terminal region of the conserved core domain and an amino-terminal region of the tail domain of NF-M. To localize more precisely the p35 nck5a -binding region in NF-M, thepACT2 constructs of NF-M346–413 and NF-M411–467 were generated, corresponding to the rod domain and the tail domain fragments, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, cotransformation of the rod domain fragment (NF-M346–413) with Nck5a strongly activated the reporter activity, whereas no detectable reporter activity appeared in the cotransformants of the tail fragment constructNF-M 411–467 /pACT2 andp35 nck5a /pAS2. This observation indicates that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the NF-M rod domain, which is no more than 16% of the rod domain, is sufficient for the binding with Nck5a, and the tail region is not required for this interaction. Since Cdk5 phosphorylation sites in NF-M and NF-H are located at the carboxyl-terminal tails, the localization of the Nck5a-binding site immediately amino-terminal to the tail region may be significant for the kinase reaction. Mammalian brains contain an isoform of Nck5a, p39 nck5i (7Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.-Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Hatase O. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26897-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that p39 nck5i did not give rise to positive response when tested for its ability to bind NF-M using the yeast two-hybrid system. The result demonstrates specificity of the interaction between Nck5a and NF-M.Figure 2Interaction of Nck5a with NF-M fragments in the two-hybrid system. The recombinant pACT2 plasmids were introduced into yeast Y190 withp35 nck5a /pAS2 or lamin C/pAS. Cotransformants were selected on a synthetic dextrose medium without leucine and tryptophan.

Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction between NF-M and Nck5a requires the amino-terminal region of Nck5a, we dissected p35 nck5a into two fragments: the amino-terminal fragment (p351–98) and the fragment of p25 nck5a (p3599–307). These two fragments as well as the full-length Nck5a were tested for their abilities to bind NF-M in the yeast two-hybrid system. Figs. 2 and 3 show that NF-M interacts with both full-length Nck5a and p25 nck5a, but not with the amino-terminal fragment (p351–98). This observation suggests that the NF-M binding site is located within residues 99–307 of Nck5a. To define more precisely the region required for the NF-M binding, various amino-terminal-truncated forms of Nck5a were constructed and tested for their interactions with NF-M by the yeast two-hybrid assay. The results were summarized in Fig.4. It indicates that a short stretch of protein sequence spanning residues 144 to 150 is required for the NF-M binding. Recently, the Cdk5-activating domain in Nck5a has been mapped to a region of amino acid residues 150–291 (12Poon R.Y.C. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the region immediately amino-terminal to the minimal Cdk5-activating domain in Nck5a is essential for its interaction with NF-M.Figure 4Association of NF-M with Nck5a fragments in the two-hybrid system. NF-M 346–467 /pACT2 andNF-M 346–413 /pACT2 were transformed into yeast Y190 with the pAS2 constructs containing various truncated fragments of Nck5a. Cotransformants were selected on synthetic dextrose plates lacking leucine and tryptophan. After colonies appeared, β-galactosidase activity was tested by a filter lift assay using X-gal. Plus (+) means that the colonies turned blue, and minus (−) means that the colonies remained white in the assay of β-galactosidase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide direct proof for the specific association between NF-M and Nck5a, this protein-protein interaction was carried out and characterized in vitro using bacterially expressed proteins. GST-fusion proteins of two NF-M carboxyl-terminal fragments: NF-M346–915 and NF-M411–915, were expressed in and isolated from bacteria (Figs. 5,A and B). The results from the yeast two-hybrid assay suggested that NF-M346–915 contains the Nck5a-binding site, whereas NF-M411–915 does not. To demonstrate protein associations, the GST-NF-M proteins were incubated with (His)6-tagged p35 nck5a and then affinity-precipitated using GSH beads. The precipitates were then analyzed on an immunoblot using an anti-Nck5a antibody to determine whether Nck5a had co-precipitated with the NF-M fragments. Fig.5 C shows that the bacteria-expressed and affinity-purified p35 nck5a -His contains intact p35 nck5a and two partially proteolyzed fragments showing immunoreactive protein bands of approximately 30 and 28 kDa. The p35 nck5a -His proteins were present in the precipitate of GST-NF-M346–915 but not in the precipitates of GST and GST-NF-M411–915 (Fig.5 C). It supports the results from the yeast two-hybrid analysis suggesting that Nck5a undergoes specific association with NF-M and that the Nck5a-binding site is localized at the carboxyl-terminal region of the NF-M rod domain.Figure 5In vitro binding of p35 nck5a with NF-M fragments. A, a schematic diagram of NF-M and expressed NF-M fragments. The shaded region is NF-M346–413. B, SDS-PAGE patterns of the expressed NF-M fragments. 5 μg of GST-NF-M411–915 was applied in lane 1, and 3.2 μg of GST-NF-M346–915 in lane 2. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue.

The GST-fusion proteins were then precipitated with GSH-Sepharose 4B. Proteins bound to the beads were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. p35 nck5a -His was detected on the immunoblot with an anti-Nck5a antibody. 1 μg of p35 nck5a -His was applied in lane 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the interaction between NF-M and Nck5a, the interaction was examined with the heterodimer of Cdk5/p25 nck5a, which is the active form of Nclk existing in bovine brain extracts. Nclk was prepared by reconstitution from bacterially expressed Cdk5 and p25 nck5a as described previously (10Qi Z. Huang Q.-Q. Lee K.-Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Samples of Nclk were incubated with GST-NF-M346–915, GST-NF-M411–915, and GST separately. The GST fusion proteins were then affinity-precipitated using GSH beads. After being washed extensively, the precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Cdk5 and Nck5a. As shown in Fig.6, both Cdk5 and Nck5a could be detected in the precipitated sample containing GST-NF-M346–915 but not in those of GST-NF-M411–915 and GST. The binding of Nclk and NF-M346–915 is essentially quantitative under the experimental conditions. The results indicate that NF-M binds both Nck5a monomer and the Cdk5/Nck5a heterodimer, and the same site in NF-M may be involved in the binding of the two protein species.Figure 6In vitro binding of NF-M fragments with the Cdk5/p25 nck5a complex. 5 μl of Cdk5/p25 nck5a were incubated with 10 μg of GST (lane 1), GST-NF-M411–915 (lane 2), GST-NF-M346–915 (lane 3), at 30 °C for 30 min. The GST fusion proteins were recovered with GSH-Sepharose 4B. Proteins bound to the beads were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. p25 nck5a and Cdk5 were detected on the immunoblots with antibodies against Nck5a (A) and Cdk5 (B), respectively. 1 μl of Cdk5/p25 nck5a was applied in lane 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further address the question of potential physiological significance of the interaction between NF-M and Nck5a, we examined any effect on the Cdk5-activating activity of Nck5a by interaction with NF-M. In one experiment, the activation of Cdk5 by a suboptimal amount of p25 nck5a was determined in the presence of NF-M346–915. It was found that NF-M346–915, over a large concentration range, could neither enhance nor impede the Cdk5-activating activity of Nck5a (Fig.7 A). All three proteins used in the experiment of Fig. 7 A were bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins. However, similar results were obtained if the proteins were pretreated by thrombin to remove the GST moiety (data not shown). To ensure that the kinase activity measured was indeed that of NF-M-bound Nclk, samples of reconstituted Cdk5/p25 nck5a were incubated with varying amounts of GST-NF-M346–915. GST-NF-M346–915 along with its bound-Nclk was then affinity-precipitated using GSH beads and the Cdk5 kinase activity in the precipitates was then assayed. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the Cdk5 kinase activity could be recovered in the precipitates in a NF-M346–915 concentration-dependent manner. The kinase in the precipitate could also phosphorylate NF-M as shown in Fig. 7 C. In a separate experiment, the Cdk5-catalyzed phosphorylation of NF-M346–915 was compared with that of NF-M411–915, and they were about the same (data not shown). NF-M346–915 is capable of binding to Nck5a, but NF-M411–915 is not. Thus, under various conditions, NF-M-bound Nclk and free Nclk appeared to have the same kinase activity.Figure 7Effect of the NF-M binding on the kinase activity of Cdk5/Nck5a. A, effect of GST-NF-M346–915 on Cdk5 activation by p25 nck5a . 0.6 μg of GST-Cdk5 was mixed with 0.1 μg of GST-p25 nck5a and different amounts of GST-NF-M346–915 as indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the Cdk5 kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of the HS(9–18) peptide at 30 °C for 20 min. B, the kinase activity of NF-M-bound Cdk5/p25 nck5a . 7 μl of Cdk5/p25 nck5a were incubated with indicated amounts of GST-NF-M346–915 at 30 °C for 30 min. The GST fusion proteins were"

The purified enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity including esterase, phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities. SDS-gel electrophoretic and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographic analyses demonstrated that a single enzyme catalyzes these activities.

Diisopropyl fluorophosphate, an irreversible inhibitor of serine esterases and lipases, inhibited purified enzyme. When the position of enzyme on SDS-gel electrophoresis under the non-reducing conditions was determined by assaying the activity eluted from sliced gels, brush border membrane-associated enzyme corresponded to a ∼150-kDa protein; autolysis gave a 35-kDa product, in agreement with the results of immunoblot analysis. The purified 35-kDa enzyme consisted of a 14-kDa peptide and a glycosylated 21-kDa peptide. Their NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined and found in the second repeat of 161-kDa phospholipase B/lipase with 4-fold tandem repeats of ∼38 kDa each, which we cloned and sequenced in the accompanying paper (Takemori, H., Zolotaryov, F., Ting, L., Urbain, T., Komatsubara, T., Hatano, O., Okamoto, M., and Tojo, H.

PLA2s represent a diverse family of enzymes and can be classified into broad two classes according to requirement of Ca2+ ions for activity, Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PLA2s. Ca2+-dependent PLA2s have been extensively studied so far in connection with important roles of Ca2+ ions in regulation of intracellular signaling (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6187) Google Scholar). To date, at least three isoenzymes are known, i.e. group I and II secretory PLA2s and 85-kDa cytosol PLA2 (cPLA2). In the secretory PLA2s Ca2+ ions involve in both catalysis and substrate binding, whereas in cPLA2 calcium does not function in the catalytic machinery, but enhances the enzyme's affinity for membrane phospholipids (2Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 3Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ca2+-independent PLA2s, especially those of mammalian origins, have not been so extensively studied. They were recently purified from several mammalian sources, and their involvement in phospholipids metabolism is now becoming evident; for example, a 40-kDa myocardial PLA2 may participate in alkyl and alkenyl phospholipid metabolism (4Gross R.W. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1992; 2: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), a 80-kDa macrophage PLA2 in membrane phospholipid remodeling (5Balsinde J. Bianco I.D. Ackermann E.J. Conde-Frieboes K. Dennis E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8527-8531Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and a 15-kDa lung acidic PLA2 in surfactant metabolism (6Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Chander A. Jain M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Very recently, some information on primary structures has become available for these PLA2s (7Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 8Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Jones S.S. Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

During the course of a study on the tissue distribution of rat group I and II PLA2s, we found a high Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity in rat distal intestine (10Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we decided to purify and characterize this enzyme to better understand the detailed structural and enzymatic properties of one of Ca2+-independent PLA2s. This enzyme was similar to those reported in rat and guinea pig brush border membranes, which were partially purified after solubilized from those membranes by detergent or papain treatment and characterized (11Pind S. Kuksis A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9470-9475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They had the characteristics of a digestive ectoenzyme and exhibited lysophospholipase and lipase activities as well as PLA2activity (13Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaébé A. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), therefore being hereafter named phospholipase B/lipase (PLB/LIP). Unfortunately, there was no structural information available on PLB/LIP, because it has not yet been purified to homogeneity in a sufficient quantity. In this study, we purified to homogeneity a truncated form of PLB/LIP solubilized from rat intestine by autolysis during its storage at −35 °C for over 1 month, and characterized it both enzymatically and structurally. The purified enzyme exhibited PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities as a single 35-kDa molecule, which consisted of a 14-kDa and a glycosylated 21-kDa peptides. Molecular size analyses by SDS-gel electrophoresis suggested that the purified enzyme was a catalytic domain derived from a ∼150-kDa membrane-associated enzyme. The accompanying paper (14Takemori H.

The results demonstrate that the enzyme purified here is indeed the catalytic domain of membrane-bound PLB/LIP. The following glycerolipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), 1-O-hexadecyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (1-O-hexadecyl-OPC), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol. 2,3-Dioleoyl-sn-glycerol was purchased from Serdary Research Laboratories, Inc. Monoolein was obtained from Nu-Check Prep, Inc. 1-Stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycerol (SLDG) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 2,3-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC), 1-myristoyl-GPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-rac-glycerol, 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (POP), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-rac-glycerol (POS), 1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC), diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), and Rhizopus arrhizus lipase were obtained from Sigma. Triolein, hydroxyapatite, trifluoroacetic acid, and octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8) were purchased from Nacalei Tesque, Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Manoalide and p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Katayama Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Vectastain ABC kit was obtained from Vector Laboratories, Inc. ConA-Sepharose was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities were determined by a non-radiometric HPLC method based on precolumn derivatization with 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM) as described previously (10Tojo H. Ono T. Okamoto M. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual fatty acids released from mixed-acyl glycerophospholipids and tri- and diacylglycerols were simultaneously determined by this method. Substrate stock solutions used were as follows: mixed micelles of 5 mm diradyl-phospholipid and various concentrations of a bile salt, cholate, or deoxycholate (DOC); 1-acyl-GPC (5 mm) micelles; and emulsions of 5 mmtriacylglycerol and 5% gum arabic. In a typical experiment, the assay mixtures contained 10 mm EDTA, substrate micelles or emulsion (10-μl stock solution), 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the enzyme sample in a final volume of 50 μl. Cholesterol esterase activity was also determined by the ADAM method. Cholesterol oleate (5 mm) was emulsified with 3.6 mg/ml mineral oil (15Mattson F.H. Volpenhein R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 536-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 7.5 mm DHPC, or 5% arabic gum. DHPC was used in place of phosphatidylcholine (16Vahouny G.V. Weersing S. Treadwell C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) because PLB/LIP has a high PLA2 activity. The assay mixtures contained cholesterol ester emulsion (10 μl), either 10 mm DOC or 10 mm sodium taurocholate, 0.1 m NaCl, either 0.1m MES (pH 6.5) or 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and the enzyme sample. Rats anesthetized with pentobarbital were sacrificed by drawing blood from the abdominal aorta, then the proximal half of the ileum was removed and its mucosa was scraped off with a glass plate. Brush border membrane fractions were prepared according to Hauser et al.(17Hauser H. Howell K. Dawson R.M.C. Bowyer D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The brush border membrane fraction was incubated with an equal volume of either 2 m KCl, 2 m KBr, 1% DOC, or 2% Triton X-100 on ice for 1 h, and then 2 ml of the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4), and PLA2 activity of the supernatant and pellet fractions was determined with POPE/DOC mixed micelles as substrate. For autolysis experiments, the brush border membrane fraction was kept at −35 °C, and at the indicated times aliquots were taken, and handled in the same manner as described above. Rat small intestines (lower 2/3 portions) were kept at −35 °C for at least 1 months, and then used for the purification. The frozen tissues (80 g) were incubated in 800 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 2 mmEDTA with stirring for 1 h at room temperature to remove the mucosal cells and then the extract was sonicated for 5 min on ice. After removing the residual intestine tissues, the extract was centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 1 h. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 8.5, and then the solution was applied to a QAE-Toyopearl column (3 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The PLA2 activity was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. Since the affinity of PLB/LIP for the column was rather weak, the pass-through fraction was, if necessary, applied again to the same QAE-Toyopearl column pre-equilibrated in the same manner as described above. To the pooled PLA2 fraction was added 1 m lithium sulfate, and then the solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column preequilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 1 m lithium sulfate. The PLA2 activity bound to this column under the conditions, and was eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 10% ethylene glycol and 0.1% Triton X-100. The pooled PLA2 fraction was dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl containing 50 mm NaCl, and then applied to a QAE-Toyopearl column preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl. The PLA2 activity was recovered in the flow-through fractions, whereas a large amount of contaminants bound to the column. The resultant PLA2-active fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm MES (pH 6.8), and then subjected to hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The column was developed with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate from 10 to 500 mm (pH 7.4), and the PLA2 activity was eluted as a broad peak in the phosphate concentration range of 30–150 mm. The pooled PLA2 fraction was applied to a ConA-Sepharose affinity column (1.5 × 7 cm) pre-equilibrated with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4). A major part (51%) of the PLA2 activity bound to the column under these conditions, while a small part (34%) did not. The column was washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 0.1% C12E8 to remove strongly uv-absorbing Triton X-100. The major bound enzyme activity was eluted in a stepwise manner with the same buffer containing 0.5 mmethylmannoside, and the resultant solution was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and further purified by HPLC on a Cosmogel QA column (0.7 × 10 cm, Nacalei Tesque) preequilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), containing 0.1% C12E8. The column was developed with a linear concentration gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 m in 60 min. The PLA2 activity was eluted as a single peak at the retention time of 18 min. The pooled PLA2 fraction was rechromatographed on the same column; the pH of the eluent was decreased to 8.0, and a shallower gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.1m in 60 min was used. The enzyme activity was eluted at the retention time of 31 min, coinciding well with a protein peak detected at 280 nm. The HPLC system consisted of two Gilson model 302 liquid delivery modules, and a Gilson model 811 dynamic mixer. For a Cosmogel-QA column of 7 × 100 mm (Nacalai Tesque), the system equipped with a 1.8-ml mixing chamber was operated at 0.5 ml/min. When a Cosmosil 5C8-300 column of 2.1 × 100 mm or 2.1 × 30 mm was used, the system equipped with a 65-μl mixing chamber was operated in the microflow mode at 0.1 ml/min. Cosmosil 5C8-300 (Nacalai Tesque) was slurry-packed into a column (2.1 × 100 mm or 2.1 × 30 mm) in our laboratory. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmliet al. (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207523) Google Scholar) under the nonreducing conditions The gels were cut into slices of 3-mm length, which were immersed in 200 μl of buffer containing 0.25 m Tris-HCl and 0.25 mNaCl (pH 8.5), overnight at 4 °C to extract PLB/LIP. PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities in the extracts were determined as described in the standard assay. The recovery of enzyme activity was 52%. The positional specificity of PLB/LIP toward glycerophospholipids was determined using the mixed micelles of 6 mm DOC and 1 mm DOPC, a symmetric acyl phospholipid, as substrate. The reaction was followed under the standard conditions, and the released lysophospholipids, 1-oleoyl- and 2-oleoyl-GPC, were separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a LiChrosorb RP-18 column (4 × 150 mm, Merck) at the flow rate of 1 ml/min and room temperature as reported (19Creer M.H. Gross R.W. Lipids. 1985; 20: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eluent used was methanol/acetonitrile/water (57:20:23) containing 20 mmcholine chloride, and the effluent was monitored at 205 nm. The regiospecificity toward di- and triacylglycerols was determined with mixed acyl glycerides, SLDG, POP, and POS, as substrates. The stereospecificity was also assessed with enantiomeric pairs of DPPC and dioleoylglycerol. The released fatty acids were derivatized, separated, and quantitated by the same method as in the ADAM assay. The purified PLB/LIP was reduced,S-carboxymethylated, and purified as described in the legend of Fig. 4. The amino acid sequences were analyzed with an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer and a 120A PTH analyzer. To identify a phenylthiohydantoin S-carboxymethylated Cys precisely, bothS-carboxymethylated and unmodified proteins were analyzed and the resultant data were compared with each other. Phospholipid phosphorus was determined according to the method of Vaskovsky et al. (20Vaskovsky V.E. Kostetsky E.Y. Vasendin I.M. J. Chromatogr. 1975; 114: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). ConA-peroxidase staining was performed as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions (Honen, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblotting was performed as reported (21Inada M. Tojo H. Kawata S. Tarui S. Okamoto M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and immunoreacted bands were visualized with a Konica immunostain kit (Konica). Protein concentrations of crude samples during purification were measured with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce), and those of purified enzyme were estimated by microbore reverse phase HPLC based on protein concentrations determined by amino acid analysis with β-alanine as an internal standard (22Tojo H. Ono T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5724-5731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We determined the distribution of Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity, which was immunochemically distinct from Ca2+-dependent group I and group II PLA2s, along rat intestine's length, and along the villus-crypt units according to the method of Pinkus (23Pinkus L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and its subcellular distribution. The results confirmed that Ca2+-independent PLA2 is located in brush border membranes of the absorptive cells of the lower intestine, especially the proximal ileum (24Pind S. Kuksis A. Lipids. 1989; 24: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we will use the words “PLA2 activity” and “Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity” as the same meaning unless it is essential to distinguish between Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent PLA2 activities. A high concentration of KCl or KBr and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment (0.57–570 milliunits/ml) did not solubilize PLA2 activity at all, but treatment with 1% Triton X-100 solubilized 88% of PLA2 activity in the membrane fractions. Limited proteolysis by endogenous and exogenous proteases has been used to solubilize proteins associated with brush border membranes successfully (25Semenza G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 255-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that autolysis gave an active fragment that accounted for 50% of the total PLA2 activity of brush border membrane fractions during storage at −35 °C for 1 month. The molecular size of the solubilized enzymes was determined by SDS-PAGE under the non-reducing conditions, where PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities being recoverable from gel slices allowed us to estimate the R F values of enzyme (Fig.1). The size of Triton X-100-solubilized enzyme (corresponding to 150 kDa) was identical to that of the enzyme in brush border membrane fractions. Autolysis produced an active 35-kDa enzyme and active PLB/LIP species of another size were not detectable under the conditions used. PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities in all solubilized enzyme solutions co-migrated on SDS-PAGE as those in untreated membrane fractions, suggesting that a single enzyme catalyzes those activities and that the 35-kDa autolytic product is derived from the enzyme associated with brush border membrane. We purified to homogeneity PLB/LIP solubilized by autolysis during storage of the intestines at −35 °C. The results of purification are summarized in TableI. The enzyme activity was separated into the flow-through and bound fractions by ConA affinity chromatography. We purified PLB/LIP from the latter fraction because of its higher specific activity. Among several chromatographic steps involved in this purification strategy, Cosmogel QA HPLC is the most effective (Fig.2), leading to the overall purification and yield of 22,000-fold and 4.2%, respectively. Inclusion of a non-ionic detergent such as C12E8 in the eluent of the HPLC was essential for improving the recovery, otherwise the yield of enzyme activity was less than 10% on a single chromatographic run. The ratios of lysophospholipase to PLA2 activities at each purification step were rather constant (0.36–0.53), except for that of the supernatant of intestine extracts (0.13), suggesting a single enzyme catalyzes those reactions.Table IPurification of PLB/LIP from rat small intestineStepSpecific activityLyso/PLA21-aThe ratios of lysophospholipase to PLA2activities.Purification1-bBased on the specific activity of PLA2.RecoveryPLA2lysophospholipaseμmol min −1 mg −1%Supernatant34.64.40.131100QAE-Toyopearl41.517.40.421.282Phenyl-Sepharose2561240.487.454QAE-Toyopearl13106300.483853Hydroxyapatite16608560.524830ConA-Sepharose204010800.53598Cosmogel QA (pH 8.5)20,00082000.385785.3Cosmogel QA (pH 8.0)760,000274,0000.3622,0004.21-a The ratios of lysophospholipase to PLA2activities.1-b Based on the specific activity of PLA2. Open table in a new tab On SDS-PAGE analysis, purified PLB/LIP gave a single band corresponding to 35 kDa, which is the same as that in the autolytic extracts on a 10% gel under the non-reducing conditions, whereas reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol caused its separation into 14-kDa and 21-kDa proteins. To examine whether the 35-kDa protein indeed represented PLB/LIP, the same enzyme samples were loaded to adjacent two lanes on a 10% gel. A gel strip of one lane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other strip was sliced into 3-mm pieces from which PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities were eluted and assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The enzyme activities were observed only in fraction 12 corresponding to a 35-kDa protein band under the non-reducing conditions (Fig.3 A), whereas no activity was detectable in the reduced protein lane. Furthermore, reverse-phase HPLC analysis of purified enzyme on a Cosmosil 5C8–300 column (2.1 × 30 mm) showed a single protein peak coeluted with PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities (Fig.4 A). These results demonstrate that a single enzyme catalyzes the three lipolytic activities. The majority of PLA2 and lysophospholipase activities bound to a ConA-Sepharose column, suggesting the purified enzyme is a glycoprotein that contains ConA-recognizable sugar chain(s). Moreover, a ConA-peroxidase stain of the purified enzyme transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after SDS-PAGE showed that its large fragment was indeed glycosylated (Fig. 3 B). The presence of PLB/LIP that did not bind to the column indicated a minor fraction of PLB/LIP is either unglycosylated or modified with ConA-unrecognizable sugar chain(s). Fig. 3 C shows the results of immunoblot analysis using specific antibody raised against amino acids 450–1450 of PLB/LIP expressed in Escherichia coli (14Takemori H. Zolotaryov F. Ting L. Urbain T.

Under non-reducing conditions a 35-kDa band corresponding to purified enzyme was clearly observed together with other degraded products in the supernatant and membrane fractions of intestine homogenate prepared from stored tissues. On the other hand, brush border membrane fractions and intestine homogenate prepared freshly contained a single ∼200-kDa 2These values are only nominal, because the presence of intact disulfide bridges and hydrated carbohydrate moieties deviates the estimation. form of enzyme under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE in combination with detection by enzyme assay gave a molecular mass estimation of ∼150 kDa (Fig. 1). This difference was due to a lower resolution of the latter method. Denaturation treatment led to its splitting into 90- and 130-kDa proteins. Purified PLB/LIP did not require calcium ions for activity; the addition of calcium up to 10 mm did not affect PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities significantly. We examined the substrate specificity of PLB/LIP in the presence and absence of DOC using diradylphospholipids (POPC, POPE, POPG, or 1-O-hexadecyl-OPC), 1-palmitoyl-GPC, glycerides (triolein, diolein, or monoolein) and cholesterol oleate as substrates (TableII). The enzyme exhibited a broad substrate specificity, and the apparent order of activity under the standard conditions in the presence of 6 mm DOC was as follows: diolein > POPC ∼ POPE > 1-O-hexadecyl-OPC ∼ POPG >l-palmitoyl-GPC ∼ triolein > monoolein. The enzyme also had esterase activity toward p-nitrophenyl fatty acid esters. Cholesterol oleate, which was emulsified by three different methods as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was not a substrate for PLB/LIP. PLB/LIP required a bile salt for the activities toward diradylphospholipids and triacylglycerols, but not for those toward lysophospholipids and mono- and diacylglycerols (TableII). Fig. 5 shows typical dependence of the PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities on the DOC/glycerolipid molar ratio. PLB/LIP exhibited virtually no activity toward POPC and TOG in the absence of the bile salt, but its presence dramatically enhanced the activities with increasing the bile salt/glycerolipid molar ratio. The activity toward POPC reached a maximum at the molar ratio of 6 and then gradually decreased, whereas that toward TOG exhibited saturation and did not decrease at higher ratios (up to 100). In contrast, the enzyme was active to 1-palmitoyl-GPC micelles and the bile salt maximally increased the activity 1.8 times that in its absence at the molar ratio of 2, and then the activity gradually decreased (Fig. 5). The optimal activity toward POPC, 1-palmitoyl-GPC, or triolein was observed over the pH range of 8–9, and activity was hardly detected below pH 4.Table IISubstrate specificity of PLB/LIPSubstrateSpecific activityNo DOCWith DOCμmol min−1mg−1POPE—767POPC—790POPG—5471-O-Hexadecyl-OPC—6051-Palmitoyl-GPC292435Triolein—357Diolein1961260Monoolein68255p-Nitrophenyl pentanoate98130Cholesteryl oleate—— Open table in a new tab To determine the positional specificity of PLB/LIP toward diacylphospholipids, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols, the time courses for release of the individual fatty acids from mixed acyl phospholipid and glycerides, i.e. POPC, SLDG, POP, and POS, by the enzyme's action were followed by the ADAM method as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.6).

This study reports that with human PKCα, DECA exhibited competitive inhibition (K i = 11.5 ± 5 μm) with respect to RACK-1 (receptor for activatedCkinase-1), an adaptor protein that has been proposed to bind activated PKC following translocation (Ron, D., Luo, J., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 24180–24187). When exposed to UV light, DECA covalently modified and irreversibly inhibited PKC (α or β), with IC50 = 7–18 μm.

This modification occurred at a tryptophan residue (Trp223) that is conserved in all conventional PKC isoforms. In overlay assays with native RACK-1 that had been immobilized on nitrocellulose, UV-treated control PKCα bound well to RACK-1, whereas UV/DECA-inactivated PKCα had reduced binding activity. The significance of these findings is shown with adenocarcinoma cells, which, when pretreated with 10 μmDECA and UV light, exhibited diminished 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced PKCα translocation.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). A current focus of investigation is to identify a specific inhibitor of PKC that is targeted to a structural element of the protein that influences PKC behavior in cells. Because the regulatory domain of PKC distinguishes it from other protein kinases, it is this segment of PKC, contained in the N-terminal portion of the protein, that attracts the greatest interest. This domain houses the binding regions for PKC-activating ligands such as phosphatidylserine (PS), diacylglycerol (DAG), and phorbol esters (C1 region) as well as for Ca2+(C2 region). 1,1′-Decamethylenebis-4-aminoquinaldinium diiodide (DECA; dequalinium) (Fig. 1) is a dicationic lipophilic PKC inhibitor whose mechanism of action remains unknown. Identified as a potent anti-tumor agent in several animal models (8Weiss M.J. Wong J.R. Ha C.S. Bleday R. Salem R.R. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5444-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and as a drug that is selectively accumulated by cancer cells (9Chen L.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 155-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), DECA inhibits PKCβ1 activity in vitro and in murine embryo fibroblasts at low micromolar concentrations (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar). Observations that associate DECA action with both the catalytic and regulatory domains of PKC (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar) relegate this compound to a general category of PKC inhibitor defined as “mixed-type” (11Nakadate T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, previous findings have shown that, in its interaction with the regulatory domain, DECA is not competitive with PS (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar) and phorbol ester or Ca2+. 2S. A. Rotenberg, unpublished results. A candidate DECA recognition site in the regulatory domain with functional significance is the RACK-1-binding site. Identified as thereceptor for activated Ckinase, RACK-1 is a PKC-binding protein found in the Triton-X-insoluble material of the particulate fraction (3Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 4Mochly-Rosen D. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. Khaner H. Lopez J. Smith B.L.

It is believed to recognize specific sites in the C2 region of PKCβ that lie immediately C-terminal to the phorbol ester-binding domain (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). When bound to the C2 region of PKCα, this adaptor protein has been proposed to stabilize the activated form of the enzyme, but acts as neither substrate nor inhibitor. Synthetic peptides modeled after the RACK-1-binding domain in the C2 domain of PKCβ were observed to block the association of PKC with RACK-1 in vitro and to inhibit PKC translocation in cardiac myocytes and Xenopus oocytes (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The photochemically induced behavior of DECA makes possible a novel approach to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of this interesting compound. Irradiation by long-wave UV light (365 nm) in the presence of a target protein can cause covalent modification of that protein, as originally described with the mitochondrial F1-ATPase (12Zhuo S. Allison W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 152: 968-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The present study harnesses the photolyzable behavior of DECA to show that the RACK-1-binding domain of PKC is a recognition site for DECA. Recombinant human PKCα and PKCβ1 were purchased from PanVera Corp. (Madison, WI); dioleoylphosphatidylserine and DAG were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL); and TPA was purchased from LC Services (Woburn, MA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Antiserum for PKCα was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse IgM anti-RACK-1 monoclonal antiserum was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Conjugated and unconjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM antisera were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The modified pseudosubstrate peptide RFARKGSLRQKNV (Ser25 peptide), which represents amino acids 19–31 of PKC, was synthesized by N. Pileggi (Protein Core Facility, Columbia University). Peptide sequence analysis of the DECA-peptide adduct was carried out by Dr. J. Farmar (New York Blood Center, New York). Dequalinium diiodide was synthesized by an established method (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar, 13Taylor E.P. J. Chem. Soc. (Lond.). 1951; : 1150-1157Crossref Google Scholar). Elemental analysis was as follows. Calculated: 50.74% C, 5.63% H, 7.89% N; found: 50.63% C, 5.57% H, 7.62% N (Desert Analytics, Tucson, AZ). It should be noted that commercially available dequalinium salts contain a major impurity. PKC activity was taken as the difference in32Pi transferred from [γ-32P]ATP to the modified pseudosubstrate peptide RFARKGSLRQKNV in the presence and absence of lipid activators (20 μg of PS and 1 μg of DAG) as described previously (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were conducted in triplicate, and the results were averaged. Values were typically within 10% error. Curve fitting was carried out with Cricketgraph® software. The UV light-induced photolysis of DECA was carried out with a Blak-Ray 365-nm ultraviolet lamp (Model UVL-56) that was positioned 2.3 ± 0.1 cm above a porcelain welled plate seated in an ice bath. From this distance, the lamp delivered an intensity of 2700 microwatts/cm2. Into each well was placed the medium (50 μl) to be irradiated: PKC in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA) plus DECA at the specified concentration or 4% (v/v) Me2SO for controls. Control experiments demonstrated that this concentration of Me2SO did not affect PKC activity. Following 5 min of irradiation, an aliquot of the enzyme was diluted into the assay medium as described above but without [γ-32P]ATP, producing a 24-fold dilution of the irradiated enzyme. Assay tubes were equilibrated in a 30 °C water bath for 5 min prior to initiation of the phosphotransferase reaction by addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Synthetic peptides (1 mm) modeled after a C2 domain segment were UV-irradiated with 120 μm DECA for 45 min, and the product(s) were analyzed by HPLC on a Waters Delta-Pak C18 reverse-phase column (2 × 150 mm; 300 Å) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Peptides were eluted with a binary gradient of 0–30% solvent B in 60 min, where solvent A was 6 mm HCl in water and solvent B was 6 mm HCl in acetonitrile (14Young P.M. Wheat T.E. Pept. Res. 1990; 3: 287-292PubMed Google Scholar). Detection of the DECA-peptide adduct was carried out at 333 nm, the λmax of DECA. Peptide sequence analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Model 477A sequenator. Recombinant RACK-1 protein was expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein tagged with a FLAG sequence (DTKDDDDK). The fusion protein was isolated by affinity chromatography on a 0.5-ml amylose column and cleaved from its fusion partner as described previously (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). RACK-1 was purified from the cleavage products by buffer replacement (to remove the eluant), followed by affinity chromatography on amylose; purified RACK-1 protein was recovered in the flow-through material. The isolation of recombinant RACK-1 as a 35-kDa protein was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-RACK monoclonal antiserum and a rabbit anti-mouse IgM-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Protein content was determined by Bio-Rad protein reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Native RACK-1 protein was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates obtained from human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells by an established method (15Rosenberg I.M. Protein Analysis and Purification. Birkhaeuser Press, Inc., Boston1996: 38Google Scholar). Mouse anti-RACK-1 monoclonal antiserum was used as primary antibody, followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgM as secondary antibody. The immunocomplexes were collected with protein A-agarose beads (Vector Labs, Inc.), and the immunoprecipitated protein was prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitated native human RACK-1 (5 μg) or whole cell lysates (60 μg) were subjected to 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by electrophoretic transfer to a nitrocellulose filter by an established method (16Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filter was blocked overnight at 4 °C in a 5% powdered milk suspension containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.01% sodium azide. The overlay assay utilized individual lanes, either by excising them as nitrocellulose strips or by sequestering the lanes of an intact filter in a Deca-Probe (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified recombinant human PKCα (0.27 μg) was UV-irradiated for 5 min in the presence of 1 mm DECA or 10% (v/v) Me2SO as a vehicle control. Following irradiation, each PKCα sample was tested for enzymatic activity in triplicate and for high affinity binding to immobilized native RACK-1. For the binding assay, each lane was treated with the PKC sample (3.5 nm) in Ca2+, DAG, and PS and incubated with gentle rocking for 30 min at room temperature as described previously (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Lanes that were used in the overlay step were washed and detected with PKCα antisera. Additional lanes that excluded the overlay step were analyzed immunochemically with either anti-RACK-1 antisera to demonstrate the RACK-1 signal at 33 kDa or with PKCα antiserum to demonstrate the position of native PKCα (77 kDa) in cell lysates. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured to 60–70% confluence on 150-mm plates in complete medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). In serum-free medium, plated cells were treated with 10 μmDECA (or Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature and then, as indicated, subjected to 5 min of irradiation using a 365-nm UV lamp (American Ultraviolet Co., Murray Hill, NJ) at a distance that delivered 2000 microwatts/cm2. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with complete medium containing TPA (1 μm) or 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested, and cell pellets were lysed in 200 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/liter leupeptin, 10 μg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml calpain inhibitor II) by Dounce homogenization (40 strokes), followed by sonication (3 × 3 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min to remove unlysed cells, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was analyzed for protein content and prepared for electrophoresis. The pellet (particulate fraction) was resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol plus protease inhibitors) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, placed on ice for 30 min with periodic Vortex mixing, and prepared for electrophoresis. Soluble (10 μg/lane) and particulate (5 μg/lane) fractions were analyzed by Western blotting and immunochemically stained for PKCα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The binding interactions of recombinant RACK-1 and DECA with purified human PKCα were first explored by classical kinetics. For these studies, conditions of reversible binding of DECA were employed. Pilot experiments established that measurements of PKCα catalytic activity lay on the initial velocity component of the reaction curve. The Dixon plot (17Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 110Google Scholar) shown in Fig.2 depicts concentration-dependent inhibition by DECA conducted in the presence of fixed nanomolar concentrations of recombinant RACK-1. The results reveal that DECA-mediated inhibition is competitive with respect to RACK-1. The K i value for inhibition was 11.5 ± 5 μm (obtained by averaging three independent experiments). The following experiment demonstrates that irradiation with 365-nm light causes irreversible inhibition of PKCα activity by DECA, as revealed by dilution of the enzyme-DECA complex into the assay medium. Dilution would be expected to dissociate a reversibly bound complex such that full enzymatic activity is recovered. However, if PKC is irreversibly inhibited, the dilution step should be ineffective. Our findings indicate that a 5-min UV irradiation (365 nm) of mixtures of PKCα and DECA produced an inactive PKC·DECA covalent complex that persisted despite the dilution step. As shown in Fig.3, UV irradiation of PKCα and DECA alone produced a dose-dependent decrease in the recoverable kinase activity as the DECA concentration was increased; with 20 μm DECA, only 5% of the total PKCα activity remained. The IC50 for UV-induced inactivation by DECA is 12 ± 5 μm (average of four independent experiments) and was consistent with K i = 11.5 ± 5 μmfor human PKCα (Fig. 2) and with IC50 = 11 μm previously obtained for recombinant rat PKCβ1 (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar), the latter two values having been measured under conditions of reversible binding (i.e. no UV light). With recombinant human PKCβ1, UV-induced inactivation by DECA was again observed in the same concentration range, exhibiting IC50 = 14 μm ± 4, the average of four independent measurements (data not shown). In control experiments that omitted UV irradiation, reversible binding of DECA to PKCα was verified by assay of PKCα activity incubated with increasing concentrations of DECA. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that, in the absence of UV irradiation, incubation of PKC with up to 20 μm DECA produced 80–100% of the total activity following a 24-fold dilution into the assay medium. Losses of enzymatic activity attributable to UV light alone were usually within 5–20% of the control PKC activity. Western blot analysis of the irradiated enzyme showed no degradation of pure PKCα protein following UV irradiation for 5 min (data not shown). In view of results that indicate that DECA competes with RACK-1 for the RACK-1-binding domain, it was next considered that synthetic peptides previously shown to define the RACK-1-binding domain of PKC (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) may be covalently modified by DECA when irradiated with UV light. For these experiments, highly purified peptides were employed whose sequences had been modeled after the corresponding amino acid sequences of the C2 domain of PKCβ (Fig. 4 A). The PKCβ peptide sequences are closely aligned with the corresponding sequences of PKCα, although minor deviations are evident, as shown by the underlined residues. The segment of the C2 domain described by these sequences lies C-terminal to the phorbol ester-binding domain (amino acids 102–144) (18Quest A.F.G. Bardes E.S.G. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and within the general region that has been ascribed to Ca2+ binding (amino acids 187–249) (19Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B.

Separation of the unreacted material from the product(s) was performed by HPLC with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, with detection at 333 nm (λmax of free DECA). Of the three peptides tested, only βC2-4 (amino acids 218–226) yielded a detectable signal at 333 nm, indicative of a DECA-peptide adduct (Fig. 4 B, lower trace). While DECA itself typically eluted at 45% acetonitrile, this new peak eluted at 17% acetonitrile. This peak was not detected in the untreated peptide, peptide irradiated alone, or peptide mixed with DECA but not irradiated (data not shown). When a scrambled control peptide of βC2-4 (Fig. 4 A) was UV-irradiated with DECA under identical conditions, no major peaks at 17% acetonitrile were detected (Fig. 4 B, upper trace). This finding implied a sequence-specific interaction of DECA with βC2-4. Sequence analysis (Table I) of the DECA-βC2-4 adduct demonstrated that the modification had occurred at the tryptophan residue of βC2-4, which corresponds to Trp223 of PKC. These results suggest that Trp223 is a site in the intact enzyme that can be covalently modified by DECA during PKC inactivation. It is of interest to note that this amino acid is strictly conserved in the C2 domains of the conventional PKC isoforms (α, β1/β2, and γ) (21Parker P.J. Lester D.S. Epand R.M.

Open table in a new tab The ability of the DECA-inactivated enzyme to bind RACK-1 in an overlay assay was addressed. Under conditions that are optimal for RACK-1 binding (3Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H.

A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), samples of recombinant human PKCα (in the presence of PS/Ca2+/DAG) were incubated with strips of nitrocellulose representing individual lanes of a membrane onto which native human RACK-1 (immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB-231 cells) had been immobilized by electrophoretic transfer, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Purified recombinant human PKCα was subjected to UV treatment with or without DECA, prior to the overlay step. For these experiments, DECA-inactivated PKCα was irreversibly inhibited by 70–90% as compared with the UV-treated control enzyme. As shown in Fig.5 A, UV-treated control PKCα was observed to bind well to endogenous RACK-1 (lane 2), whereas UV/DECA-inactivated PKCα displayed significantly reduced binding to RACK-1 (lane 3). These results demonstrate that, coincident with its inactivation by DECA, PKCα is rendered unable to bind RACK-1. This finding is consistent with the idea that DECA and RACK-1 recognize the same binding site in PKCα. Additional high affinity interactions with human PKCα were observed with immobilized whole lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5 B,lane 2) that were also eliminated when the enzyme was inactivated by UV/DECA treatment (lane 3). This result suggests that, in addition to RACK-1, UV/DECA treatment blocks the ability of PKCα to bind other PKC-binding proteins as well, possibly localized in different subcellular compartments (reviewed in Ref.22Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because activated PKC is thought to bind RACK-1 as a consequence of translocation (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the ability of DECA to intervene in phorbol ester-induced translocation of PKC was tested in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231). In these cells, PKCα is the most abundant isoform as well as the only isoform with a C2 domain. (The other isoforms found by Western blotting in these cells were PKCη, PKCι, and PKCμ (data not shown).) Following pretreatment with DECA (10 μm) for 30 min and subsequent UV irradiation for 5 min, the cells were stimulated with the tumor-promoting phorbol ester TPA for 1 h to induce translocation of cytosolic PKC into cellular membranes. The Western blot shown in Fig.6 indicates that preincubation with UV/DECA followed by TPA treatment produced a marked retention of PKCα in the soluble fraction (lane 10) as compared with no retention when UV treatment alone preceded TPA addition (lane 8). Similarly, a decrease in TPA-induced PKCα recruitment to the particulate fraction was evident with UV/DECA treatment (Fig. 6,lane 5) as compared with UV treatment alone prior to TPA addition (lane 3). In both particulate and soluble fractions, analogous effects of DECA alone (without UV light) were observed, but were less pronounced than the effects achieved by a combination of UV light and DECA (Fig. 6, compare lanes 4and 5 or lanes 9 and 10). UV treatment alone had no independent effect on TPA-induced PKC translocation in either fraction (Fig. 6, compare lanes 2and 3 or lanes 7 and 8). These findings demonstrate that, at low micromolar doses, UV light potentiates the effect of DECA in suppressing PKC translocation. In this work, we demonstrate that, under reversible binding conditions, DECA and RACK-1 display competitive binding kinetics. When irradiated with UV light (365 nm), DECA causes irreversible inhibition of recombinant human PKCα activity (Fig. 3) with concomitant loss of high affinity binding by PKCα to immobilized RACK-1 (Fig.5 A) and other unidentified proteins (Fig. 5 B). The biological significance of PKC inactivation by DECA was observed in cells whose treatment with UV/DECA significantly diminished TPA-induced translocation of PKCα. Evidence of covalent modification by DECA of the RACK-1-binding domain in PKC was presented with the synthetic peptide βC2-4 (amino acids 218–226). This peptide is one of three peptides known to define the RACK-1-binding site (Fig. 4 A) and has been shown to interfere with PKC/RACK-1 binding interactions in cardiac myocytes andXenopus (6Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The modification of a tryptophan residue in βC2-4 by DECA is consistent with an earlier study with mitochondrial F1-ATPase in which a phenylalanine residue was derivatized by this compound (23Zhuo S. Paik S.R. Register J.A. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2219-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The preferential modification of βC2-4 as compared with the scrambled control peptide underscores the sequence specificity of the modification event and argues against random reactivity with tryptophan residues in the holoenzyme. Previous work with the catalytic fragment of PKC showed that DECA causes inhibition of phosphotransferase activity with the same potency as with the intact enzyme (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar), signifying that a critical target site is located in the catalytic domain. Neither Mg2+·ATP nor peptide substrate is competitive with DECA, however (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar).2 Other work from this laboratory has shown that DECA is ineffective as an inhibitor up to 1 mm with other protein kinases such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, the calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase, and pp60 src . 3A. Francis-Smith, S. A. Rotenberg, unpublished results. The lack of effect with cAMP-dependent protein kinase is particularly compelling since the catalytic domains of PKC and cAMP-dependent protein kinase exhibit almost 50% sequence homology and are believed to have very similar three-dimensional structures (24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8383-8387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of DECA for PKC may be explained in part by coincident binding interactions with both the catalytic domain (unidentified) and the regulatory domain (at the RACK-1-binding site). Inhibition of PKC by DECA involving the two domains could be due to either one or two molecules of DECA binding per molecule of PKC. A two-molecule binding model depicts the binding of one DECA molecule to the RACK-1-binding domain, which occurs in parallel with the binding of a second molecule of DECA to its target site in the catalytic domain. In a one-molecule binding model, the aminoquinaldinium moieties of DECA bind simultaneously to the RACK-1-binding domain and catalytic domain of the intact enzyme. Thus, the bipartite structure of DECA (Fig. 1) participates in a unique two-point contact such that the regulatory and catalytic domains are tethered. This idea is lent support by the structure-activity relationships of DECA analogues and their inhibition of PKCβ1 (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar), from which it is known that the 10-carbon distance that exists between the aminoquinaldinium moieties is a critical determinant of the inhibitory potency of DECA, thus implicating both ends of the molecule in DECA-mediated inhibition. A one-molecule binding model is also strengthened by the present study, which showed that nanomolar concentrations of RACK-1 (C2 domain interaction) were sufficient to diminish the DECA-mediated inhibition of PKC activity (catalytic domain interaction) (Fig. 2). An important finding of this work is that interaction of DECA with the RACK-1-binding domain of PKC produces significant inhibition of translocation. This result may explain the ability of DECA to delay the morphological response by fibroblasts treated with phorbol ester (10Rotenberg S.A. Smiley S. Ueffing M. Krauss R.S. Chen L.B. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 677-685PubMed Google Scholar), to act as an anti-tumor agent (8Weiss M.J. Wong J.R. Ha C.S. Bleday R. Salem R.R. Steele G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Cancer. 1993; 29A: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). That DECA did not entirely abolish TPA-induced translocation but merely suppressed it may be explained by the artificially strong stimulus provided by TPA (27Lester D.S. Lester D.S. Epand R.M. Protein Kinase C, Current Concepts and Future Perspectives. Ellis Horwood Ltd., West Sussex, United Kingdom1992: 80-101Google Scholar) that also produces direct interactions of PKC with membrane lipids (28Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9317-9323Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In view of the proposal that RACK-1 binds activated PKC (29Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), the present study suggests that DECA impedes this association (as well as other unidentified high affinity protein/protein interactions), thereby blocking downstream PKC-directed signaling events.

These data suggest a function for p130 cas as a PKC downstream target in SH-SY5Y cells and possibly also in their growth cones. p130 cas is a recently identified docking protein that contains an SH3 domain and a region with several tyrosine residues that can become tyrosine-phosphorylated and constitutes putative SH2 binding domains (1Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The protein structure suggests a function for p130 cas in assembling signaling complexes. The only identified kinases that directly phosphorylate p130 cas is pp60c- src (2Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S.

However, little is known about the signaling pathways that lead to induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas and thereby promote binding of SH2 domain containing proteins, and the downstream effects of this complex formation remain to be clarified.

Parrow V. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The differentiated cells extended neurites with neurotransmitter containing varicosities and growth cones. The growth cones are the leading tips of the growing neurites and are mainly composed of actin filaments (reviewed in Ref.15Smith S.J. Science. 1988; 242: 708-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and actin reorganization is the mechanism underlying growth cone motility. In SH-SY5Y cells, the activity of pp60c- src increases during differentiation (16Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellström K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and pp60c- src is enriched and activated in growth cones (17Meyerson G. Pfenninger K.H. Påhlman S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar). pp60c- src binds to the growth cone cytoskeleton in an activity dependent manner (18Helmke S. Pfenninger K.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 194-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine-threonine kinases that are subdivided into three classes based on activator and co-factor dependence. Classical PKCs (PKC-α, PKC-β, and PKC-γ) and novel PKCs (PKC-δ, PKC-ε, PKC-η, PKC-θ, and PKC-μ) are activated by TPA, but the endogenous activator is, for example, diacylglycerol that is generated after growth factor stimulation (reviewed in Refs. 19Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar and20Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells express at least PKC-α, PKC-ε, and PKC-ζ (21Parrow V. Fagerström S. Meyerson G. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A sustained PKC activity, measured as phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS), is detected during differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (22Parrow V. Nånberg E. Heikkilä J. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and treatment with a high concentration of TPA (1.6 μm) that down-regulates PKC-α completely only induces poor differentiation (21Parrow V. Fagerström S. Meyerson G. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Påhlman S. Ruusala A.-I. Abrahamsson L. Odelstad L. Nilsson K.

Furthermore, inhibition of PKC activity by specific inhibitors blocks differentiation induced by 16 nm TPA in FCS or the combination of bFGF and IGF-I with respect to both morphological and transcriptional events (24Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Gestblom C. Nånberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar). PKC-α and PKC-ε are enriched in growth cones of SH-SY5Y cells (21Parrow V. Fagerström S. Meyerson G. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Gestblom C. Nånberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar), and maintenance of growth cone structure appears to be PKC-dependent (24Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Gestblom C. Nånberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells and its dependence on activation and inhibition of PKC and Src family kinases. We also studied p130 cas phosphorylation in isolated growth cones. The data presented show that there are at least two signaling pathways in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells that promote tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas : an initial PKC-dependent but pp60c- src /Src-kinase family-independent pathway, and a second PKC and Src-kinase family-dependent pathway. A functional role for p130 cas in regulating the assembly of signals that control growth cone function is suggested.DISCUSSIONWe here report a PKC-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas in differentiating SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Src kinase and herbimycin A data suggested an initial p130 cas tyrosine phosphorylation pathway independent of pp60c- src and a later pathway in differentiating cells involving pp60c- src or related herbimycin A-sensitive kinase(s). We also propose a role for p130 cas in assembling signals that regulate the functional growth cone in axons and dendrites.Previously, we have demonstrated that TPA- and to a large extent bFGF/IGF-I-dependent neuronal differentiation (growth cone formation, outgrowth of neurites, and gene expression) of SH-SY5Y cells is blocked by PKC inhibitors. However, the cells retain their capacity to differentiate in response to bFGF/IGF-I when classical PKCs (such as PKC-α) are down-regulated by prolonged treatment with 1.6 μm TPA (24Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Gestblom C. Nånberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, PKC-ε is still present in substantial amounts. We have therefore proposed that PKC-ε or other novel isoforms are vital for neuronal differentiation in this cell system. We have now shown that under conditions where either of TPA and growth factors induce differentiation, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas is stimulated. This response is not entirely associated with the development of a differentiated phenotype, but rather with the activation of PKC, since a number of protocols inducing PKC activation but not differentiation also induced p130 cas tyrosine phosphorylation. We have previously demonstrated that both bFGF and IGF-I activates PKC in these cells, measured as in vivo phosphorylation of MARCKS, and that the combination of the factors was additive, whereas 16 nm TPA was twice as efficient (14Lavenius E. Parrow V. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This order of magnitude was also true for p130 cas phosphorylation, speaking in favor of a PKC-dependent signaling step in growth factor- and TPA-treated cells. The use of specific inhibitors for classical and novel PKCs (GF 109203X and Go 6976) demonstrated that this phosphorylation seemed to be dependent on active novel isoforms of PKC. Also the maintenance of an elevated p130 cas phosphorylation in differentiated cells required functional PKC, as demonstrated by the rapid net dephosphorylation of p130 cas after addition of GF 109203X. The strongest indication for a PKC-driven tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas came from the data in Fig.1 D where TPA added to serum-free cultures gave a rapid and potent effect.Introduction of a constitutively active PKC-ε also promoted phosphorylation of p130 cas, showing that increased PKC-ε activity as such was sufficient in promoting p130 cas phosphorylation. We have not been able to distinguish any signs of differentiation in the PKC-ε+-transfected cultures. In contrast to the TPA-differentiated cells, p130 cas phosphorylation in PKC-ε+-transfected cultures was not sensitive to acute exposure to PKC inhibitors (GF 109203X in Fig. 3 and Ro 31–8425, not shown). Preliminary results from transient transfections with PKC-ε+, where GF 109203X and Ro 31–8425 were added immediately after a shorter transfection protocol (6 h) and included for another 40 h, indicated that this treatment abolished the very small induction in tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas seen in these cultures (not shown). One possible explanation for these somewhat contradictive results could be that selective increase of PKC-ε activity in the transfectants induced secondary effects and, consequently, at a later time point an apparent dissociation of the p130 cas phosphorylation from PKC activity under these conditions.The steady-state level of p130 cas tyrosine phosphorylation is balanced by protein-tyrosine kinase activity(ies) counteracted by protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s). The effect of the TPA- or growth factor-stimulated serine-threonine kinase PKC in SH-SY5Y cells for tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas could thus be due to either activation of protein-tyrosine kinases, inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, or a combination of the two (Fig.7). One of several plausible kinase candidates would be pp60c- src since p130 cas is tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src transformed cells (40Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Wang H.C. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); pp60c- src has been shown to directly phosphorylate p130 cas (4Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pp60c- src is activated in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells as a comparatively late event (16Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellström K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A phosphatase candidate is the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-PEST, which is inactivated by PKC, can dephosphorylate p130 cas (41Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and is present in SH-SY5Y cells (42Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A direct effect of PKC on pp60c- src kinase activity has not been conclusively evaluated, but PKC can phosphorylate pp60c- src on serine 12 (36Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shalloway D. Hunter T. Cell. 1985; 42: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,37Purchio A.F. Shoyab M. Gentry L.E. Science. 1985; 229: 1393-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which also has been demonstrated in TPA-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells (16Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellström K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, we conclude that only the late but not the initial phosphorylation of p130 cas was dependent on pp60c- src or Src family members based on the following arguments. (i) The Src family inhibitor herbimycin A had no effect on the basal and initial (5–30 min) p130 cas phosphorylation in TPA- and bFGF/IGF-I-treated cells. (ii) Despite large efforts, we have never been able to detect an increased pp60c- src activity within the first 6 h of treatment of these cells with TPA (16Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellström K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or bFGF/IGF-I, and neither increased amounts of pp60c- src protein (16Bjelfman C. Meyerson G. Cartwright C.A. Mellström K. Hammerling U. Påhlman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). (iii) The small amount of p130 cas that co-immunoprecipitated with pp60c- src was unaltered after TPA treatment (not shown), indicating that stimulation of the cells did not lead to subcellular redistribution of active pp60c- src to a p130 cas containing compartment or vice versa. (iv) In differentiated cultures (4 days), i.e. when pp60c- src activity is up-regulated, p130 cas phosphorylation was abolished by herbimycin A, suggesting involvement of pp60c- src or another herbimycin A-sensitive kinase. Alternative genes, e.g. FYN and YES, are expressed in SH-SY5Y cells and are enriched and activated in growth cones of differentiating SH-SY5Y cells (43Meyerson G. Påhlman S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). p59 fyn binds p130 cas, and p130 cas phosphorylation is decreased in fibroblasts isolated from fyn knock-out mice compared with their normal counterpart (2Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both p59 fyn and pp62c- yes kinases should be sensitive to herbimycin A. These kinases might therefore contribute to tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas at later time points but are unlikely to promote the initial signal. (v) Overexpression of functional pp60c- src caused increased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas measured 40 h after transfection, and this phosphorylation was largely abolished by short term treatment with herbimycin A or GF 109203X, indicating the involvement of a PKC-dependent step also under these conditions. Another kinase, p125FAK, that also interacts directly with p130 cas (7Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 8Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and can be regulated by PKC (44Mogi A. Hatai M. Soga H. Takenoshita S. Nagamachi Y. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Yokota J. Yaoi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) is not likely to significantly contribute to the phosphorylation of p130 cas in SH-SY5Y, since no active, i.e. phosphorylated, p125FAK was detected in cells stimulated with TPA. The cytosolic tyrosine kinase Abl has been shown to phosphorylate p130 cas in vitro. The phosphorylation is enhanced by binding of Crk to Abl (3Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). An in vivo function for Abl in p130 cas phosphorylation remains to be investigated in SH-SY5Y and other cells.The tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST was recently shown to dephosphorylate specifically p130 cas in several cell lines (41Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and to bind directly to the SH3 domain of p130 cas (45Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST can be phosphorylated on serine residues in vitro by both PKC and cyclic AMP-dependent kinase, and the same residues are phosphorylated in TPA-stimulated HeLa cells. This phosphorylation negatively regulates the activity of the phosphatase by reducing the substrate affinity (46Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3763-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is feasible that PKC-evoked p130 cas phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells could be mediated by inactivation of PTP-PEST. The finding that activation of cyclic AMP-dependent kinase with dbcAMP also promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas is in agreement with a PTP-PEST-regulated p130 cas phosphorylation, but the possible involvement of PTP-PEST needs further studies.Little is known about the physiological function of p130 cas . Its localization to growth cones could imply that p130 cas takes part in the regulation of growth cone function. Both PKC-α and PKC-ε are enriched in intact growth cones (21Parrow V. Fagerström S. Meyerson G. Nånberg E. Påhlman S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 41: 782-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and PKC activity (presumably PKC-ε) is necessary for maintenance of the growth cone structure (24Fagerström S. Påhlman S. Gestblom C. Nånberg E. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 775-785PubMed Google Scholar). We now suggest that p130 cas could be a downstream target of PKC in the functional growth cone based on the following: (i) tyrosine-phosphorylated p130 cas was present in growth cones of differentiated SH-SY5Y; (ii) p130 cas in the growth cone fraction as well as in whole unfractionated cells was rapidly dephosphorylated after addition of a PKC inhibitor, a treatment that induces retraction of growth cone filopodia; and (iii) the time course of the initial dephosphorylation of p130 cas measured in whole cell extracts correlated closely to filopodia retraction. Unlike treatment with GF 109203X, exposure to herbimycin A did not lead to rapid changes of growth cone morphology, but prolonged exposure over several days caused cell detachment from the culture dish. p130 cas phosphorylation decreased in these cells but not as rapid as after GF 109203X treatment. Thus, p130 cas phosphorylation in growth cones did not seem to correlate closely to growth cone structure but rather to PKC activity.An explanation for the functionally different effects of GF 109203X and herbimycin A on growth cone structure would be if PKC has a more complex role regulating and integrating a number of vital activities in the growth cone. For example, GAP-43 is a well characterized PKC substrate located in growth cones of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells (17Meyerson G. Pfenninger K.H. Påhlman S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 233-243PubMed Google Scholar) and with an important role in neuronal sprouting and growth cone migration (47Aigner L. Caroni P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 48Aigner L. Arber S. Kapfhammer J.P. Laux T. Schneider C. Botteri F. Brenner H.R. Caroni P. Cell. 1995; 83: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although the results discussed above point to an important role of PKC in signaling through p130 cas in growth cones, neither p130 cas phosphorylation nor PKC activation are sufficient for neurite extension (see for instance PKC-ε transfections). Experiments with PC12 cells have previously demonstrated that introduction of v-src or mutated activeras leads to neurite outgrowth and differentiation (49Alema S. Casalbore P. Agostini E. Tato F. Nature. 1985; 316: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 50Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and that the two oncogenes have a synergistic effect (for a review see Ref. 51Keegan K. Halegoua S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Introduction of active Ras (Val-12 Ras) in SH-SY5Y cells also leads to neurite formation, 2A.-K. Olsson and E. Nånberg, manuscript in preparation.clearly demonstrating signaling events leading to neurite formation which cannot solely be explained by activation of PKC or p130 cas .SH-SY5Y cells undergoing an active process of differentiation have to coordinate signals mediating neurite outgrowth and other cytoskeletal events as well as altered gene expression. Also, survival and maintenance of the differentiated cell probably demands other signaling activities or combinations of signals than unstimulated or acutely stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. It is feasible that p130 cas has different or partially non-overlapping functions and is differently regulated during early and late phases of differentiation. The rapid phosphorylation of p130 cas in cells induced to differentiate might be an early event during the dynamic phase of cytoskeleton rearrangement that precedes the formation of growth cones and neurite sprouting. The acute effects of TPA, FCS, and growth factors added separately might also lead to the same actin reorganization. Since p130 cas is the target of both growth factor and integrin stimulation (see Introduction for references) and is a signal transduction docking protein, p130 cas may sense and integrate different signals in growth cones, thus being a member of the tightly regulated machinery needed for axon growth and path finding. p130 cas is a recently identified docking protein that contains an SH3 domain and a region with several tyrosine residues that can become tyrosine-phosphorylated and constitutes putative SH2 binding domains (1Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The protein structure suggests a function for p130 cas in assembling signaling complexes. The only identified kinases that directly phosphorylate p130 cas is pp60c- src (2Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Abl (3Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the signaling pathways that lead to induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas and thereby promote binding of SH2 domain containing proteins, and the downstream effects of this complex formation remain to be clarified. It is established that p130 cas becomes heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin stimulation (4Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1972237784,"The specificity of interaction of the isolated N- and C-terminal domains of calmodulin with peptide WFFp (Ac-KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFK-amide) and variants of the target sequence of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase was investigated using CD and fluorescence.

For WFFp, the C-domain binds with 4-fold higher affinity to the native compared with the non-native site; the N-domain shows similar affinity for either site.

Calmodulin-MLCK-peptide complexes show an approximate two-fold rotational relationship between the two highly homologous domains, and the 2:1 C (or N)-domain-peptide complexes evidently have a similar rotational symmetry.

Calmodulin is a regulatory protein involved in a variety of Ca2+-dependent cellular signaling pathways. Its importance as a mediator of the second messenger Ca2+ is reflected in its high conservation throughout evolution. This apparently contrasts with its unique ability to interact strongly with and to regulate selectively a variety of proteins (at least 30) without any obvious sequence homology in their calmodulin binding region (see Refs. 1Vogel H.J.

McMillan K. Leakey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16148-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation pattern is reproduced when calmodulin chimeras consisting of two linked N-domains or two C-domains are used (36Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the C-domain activates target enzymes better than the N-domain in several cases (29Wolff J. Newton D.L. Klee C.B.

Commun. 1987; 142: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, differences in domain sequence and structure may contribute to the versatility of calmodulin's regulatory functions. Binding of the domains to the target enzyme is not necessarily sufficient for activation since isolated domains can inhibit calmodulin-induced activation of enzymes which are not activated by the domain itself (28Newton D.

Chem. 1984; 259: 4419-4426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the overall structure of the two domains show marked similarities (37Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), differences between them in sequence and Ca2+ affinity have apparently been well conserved during evolution (38Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). This points toward possible functional differences of the two domains, which can be further amplified by variations in target sequences. Studies of enhancement of Ca2+ affinities of calmodulin by target sequences suggest that calmodulin which is half-saturated with Ca2+ could bind to the target protein by only one domain without activation, allowing a rapid response in enzyme activity to an increase in Ca2+ concentration (39Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In the present work, we address on a molecular level the specificity of the interaction of the individual calmodulin domains with target peptides derived from the target sequence of sk-MLCK. Previously, spectroscopic studies have been reported on the interaction of the domains with the short peptides melittin and mastoparan (40Steiner R.F. Marshall L. Needleman D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 41Sanyal G. Richard L.M. Carraway K.L. Puett D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6229-6236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 42Itakura M. Iio T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, the binding affinities, the molecular interactions in the complex, and the effects of domain binding on the conformation of the target peptides are investigated using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. The striking finding is that two molecules of either domain bind with good affinity to the 18-residue target peptides. The symmetry of the resulting complexes is considered by comparison with the calmodulin-MLCK peptide structure (2Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), and is discussed in relation to the known versatility of calmodulin in its specific interactions with a range of target proteins. The feasibility of calmodulin domains to bind with reversed polarity and alternative positions on a target sequence greatly extends the potential range of conformations of calmodulin in its bound form, and provides added diversity to the calcium sensitivity of calmodulin-dependent activation processes. Drosophila melanogastercalmodulin expressed in Escherichia coli was purified as described previously (43Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein ran as a single band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% gel; Laemmli system). The tryptic fragments of calmodulin were prepared as described in Ref.31Persechini A. McMillan K. Leakey P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16148-16154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar with an additional gel filtration step (G75 column) included after the cleavage and before the anion exchange chromatography. For each fragment, no impurities could be detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, HPLC chromatography showed an impurity of unknown origin in the C-domain preparation corresponding to 2.4% of the protein mass. Mass spectroscopy showed that the predominant fragment for the N-domain preparation was residues 1–75 of calmodulin and, for the C-domain preparation, residues 78–148. WFFp (Ac-KKRWKKNFIAVSAANRFK-NH2), WF10p (Ac-KKRWKKNFIA-NH2), FFFp (Ac-KKRFKKNFIAVSAANRFK-NH2), FFWp (Ac-KKRFKKNFIAVSAANRWK-NH2), and FW10p (Ac-IAVSAANRWK-NH2) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer and purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column. All peptides were protected at both termini. Peptide purity was assessed by mass spectrometry, reverse-phase HPLC, and ion exchange chromatography. Concentrations of proteins and peptides were determined spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: 5690 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for Trp-containing peptides (44Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar); 585 m−1cm−1 at 259 nm for FFFp (44Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar) and 1578m−1 cm−1 at 279 nm forDrosophila calmodulin in the presence of excess Ca2+ (43Maune J.F. Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same extinction coefficient was used for the C-domain of calmodulin assuming that the absorption of the single Tyr-138 in this domain is unaffected by the tryptic cleavage. For the N-domain, 975 m−1 cm−1 at 259 nm was used based on its five Phe residues (44Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). It was confirmed that the extinction coefficient of the N-domain changed by less than 10% upon denaturation with 6 m guanidine HCl. Uncorrected fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in UV-transmitting plastic cuvettes or in quartz cuvettes using a SPEX FluoroMax fluorimeter. Excitation was at 300 nm for measurements at ≥50 μm peptide concentration, otherwise at 290 or 295 nm for the C-domain and at 280 or 300 nm for the N-domain (bandwidth 0.9 nm). The emission was scanned from 300 or 310 nm to 400 nm (bandwidth 4.3 nm). The temperature was 20 °C and the buffer 25 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2 at pH 8.0. Data for the fluorescence titrations were obtained either by integrating the spectra in the region of the largest fluorescence change (300–330 nm) or by measurements of 30 s in duration at a wavelength in the range 322–334 nm with bandwidth 17 nm. Unless otherwise stated, the dissociation constants are derived from at least three independent titrations. CD spectra were recorded in fused silica cuvettes using a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter. The measurements were made at 20 °C in 25 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2 at pH 8.0. Far UV-CD measurements (200–280 nm) with calmodulin and all peptides as well as with WFFp and isolated domains were made using 1-mm cuvettes with peptide and protein concentrations in the range 7–25 μm. With isolated domains and FFFp or FFWp the measurements were made in a 0.1-mm demountable cuvette at 10-fold higher concentrations. Spectra are presented as the molar CD absorption coefficient (ΔεM) using the molar concentration of the protein rather than the mean residue weight for the normalization. In the case of the domain mixture complexes, the concentration of the complex was used for the normalization to facilitate the comparison with the spectra of calmodulin (46Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2087-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The difference between the CD absorption coefficient at 222 nm in the presence and the absence of the peptide was used to estimate the number of residues adopting a helical structure upon complex formation. The results of three experiments were averaged. The difference was expressed as molar in peptide (not protein) concentration and compared with the ΔεM value of fully helical peptides of different lengths, which were calculated according to Ref. 45Scholtz J.M. Qian H. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1463-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar. Near UV-CD spectra (255–340 nm) were measured using 15–30 repetitive scans for peptide and protein concentrations in the range 80–380 μm with 10 mm cuvettes. The spectral range of 310–340 nm was used to zero the curves. A base-line spectrum was recorded, smoothed over 10 nm, and subtracted, and the resulting spectra were slightly smoothed. The spectra are the average of at least two independent measurements. For near UV CD titrations, spectra of 10–20 scans were recorded between 280 and 320 nm, and were zeroed using the data between 308 and 320 nm. A base-line spectrum was smoothed over 10 nm, subtracted, and the CD signal of the resulting spectrum integrated between 280 and 293 nm for titrations with the N-domain and between 292 and 299 nm for titrations with the C-domain. At least four independent titrations were evaluated. Under the conditions of the CD experiments with the N-domain and the short peptides WF10p and FW10p, incomplete complex formation is expected owing to the low affinity of the interaction. Using the dissociation constants of 60 and 75 μm (see below), it is calculated that 53% (N-WF10p) and 48% (FW10p-N) of the peptides are bound under the conditions of the experiment, and these values were used to subtract the free peptide contribution to the spectra and to normalize them to 1 mcomplex concentration. Titrations were performed by addition of the domain solution to the peptide solution, and recording changes in fluorescence or CD signals deriving from the Trp chromophore of the peptide. Titration curves of WF10p and FW10p peptide with either domain were fitted with a stoichiometry of 1:1, using standard fitting procedures (46Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Beckingham K. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2087-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of the long peptides WFFp and FFWp, the titration curves clearly indicated that saturation of the optical signal was achieved close to a stoichiometry of two molecules of domain per molecule of peptide. The simplest model for binding assumes that the optical signal monitors binding of a domain to the Trp-containing portion of the peptide; binding of a second molecule of the domain is revealed only indirectly via the competition of the domain between the two sites. The analysis is based on the known structure of the complex of calmodulin with the sk-MLCK target M13 peptide, in which the C-domain of calmodulin, interacting exclusively with the Trp residue of the peptide, binds predominantly with the (Trp containing) N-terminal portion of the peptide, and the N-domain binds predominantly with the C-terminal portion of the peptide. The two sites on the peptide are therefore designated according to their position in the peptide sequence as site N and site C; in the case of binding to peptide WFFp, binding at site N withK d N, produces an optical signal, and binding at site C with K d C is optically “silent,” whereas for peptide FFWp, the optical properties of sites N and C are reversed. The mechanism for the binding of two molecules of a given domain (D) per molecule of peptide with sites N and C(understood to be oriented N-peptide-C) is shown in Scheme ins;1857s1}1. According to the scheme, in the course of a titration of a fixed amount of peptide (P) with a single domain, D, the optical signal at any point is determined by ΣX i ·S i, where X i is the mole fraction of various peptide-containing species (and ΣX i = 1), together with S i, their intrinsic spectroscopic properties. On the above model, for WFFp peptide, and indices 1–4 referring to free peptide, D-peptide-, -peptide-D, and D-peptide-D, respectively, then S 1 = S 3 (known from free peptide) and S 2 =S 4, (known from, or fitted to, the plateau titration value). To evaluate the values of X i for a given concentration of peptide (fixed) and variable concentration of added domain [D], the analysis requires the values ofK d C, K d N(and parameter f when f ≠ 1) with the solution of a cubic equation. The unknowns (K d C,K d N, and f) are then refined by least squares methods in fitting to the experimental titration data. Conversely, simulations were made, using chosen values of these parameters to examine their individual effects on model titration curves. To simplify the analysis, the determination of the two binding constants K d N andK d C was done in two steps. First, in titrations of the fluorescence and the CD signals at high peptide concentration, the ratioK d C/K d Nwas determined. This value was then used as a fixed parameter in the fits to the fluorescence titrations at low concentration, which finally resulted in the individual K d values. The rationale behind this approach, demonstrated by simulation, is that titration curves at high concentration (i.e. >K d C andK d N) depend strongly on the ratioK d C/K d Nand less on their absolute values, whereas the opposite is true at lower concentrations. The simplest analysis is where the two sites are non-interacting,i.e. there is no thermodynamic co-operativity in the binding of the second copy of the domain. For this case, the co-operativity factor in the scheme is given by f = 1. Interaction can be included with f > 1 (negative co-operativity) orf < 1 (positive co-operativity). In titrations of a full-length peptide with a single domain, it was found that the inclusion of the additional co-operativity parameter f gave no significant improvement to the numerical fitting, and thus fits were generally done with the simplest model with f = 1. In calculations based on studies of the 1:1:1 complex of C-domain plus N-domain plus WFFp peptide, the inclusion of an f ∼ 0.5 was deduced, suggesting a small degree of positive co-operativity; in one out of four cases, evidence was found for a spectroscopic interaction. These analyses are discussed under “Results.” Solutions of the free Trp-containing peptides have a fluorescence emission maximum at ∼358 nm. The maximum of the enhanced fluorescence emission of all the peptide-domain complexes (Table I) lies between 335 and 338 nm, except for the N-WF10p complex (348 nm), suggesting that the N-domain is less effective than the C-domain in burying the Trp residue of this short peptide in a hydrophobic environment. As discussed in more detail below, two molecules of either domain were found to bind to one molecule of full-length peptide (WFFp or FFWp). Complexes are represented as e.g. X-WFFp-Y, indicating that domain X binds to the N-terminal portion of the peptide and domain Y to the C-terminal portion.Table IProperties of the complexes formed between target peptides and calmodulin domainsComplexStoichiometryλemK N dK C dK C d/K N dΔG/kJ · mol−1nmC-WFFp-C2:133518 ( ± 8) nm1-aCalculated using the K d ratio determined from CD experiments.45 ( ± 25) nm 1-aCalculated using the K d ratio determined from CD experiments.2.5 ( ± 0.5)−43.4, −41.210 ( ± 4) nm1-bCalculated using the K d ratio determined from fluorescence experiments.80 ( ± 35) nm 1-bCalculated using the K d ratio determined from fluorescence experiments.8.0 ( ± 0.5)−44.9, −39.8C-WF10p1:1335560 ( ± 30) nm−35.1N-WFFp-N2:1335143 ( ± 30) nm180 ( ± 45) nm1.26 ( ± 0.05)−38.4, −37.8N-WF10p1:134860 ( ± 14) μm−23.7C-FFWp-C2:13372.0 ( ± 1.1) μm370 ( ± 150) nM0.19 ( ± 0.05)−32.0, −36.1FW10p-C1:13386.4 ( ± 3.5) μM−29.1N-FFWp-N2:13355.5 ( ± 2.6) μm2.1 ( ± 0.5) μM0.38 ( ± 0.09)−29.5, −31.8FW10p-N1:133775 ( ± 18) μM−23.11-a Calculated using the K d ratio determined from CD experiments.1-b Calculated using the K d ratio determined from fluorescence experiments.

The free peptides WFFp (Fig. 1 A), FFWp (Fig. 1 B), and WF10p (data not shown) have similar near UV CD spectra; below 290 nm, the signal increases steadily and without fine structure to a ΔεM = 0.4 m−1cm−1 at 255 nm. Only the FW10p peptide (Fig.1 C) shows a signal above 290 nm. The spectrum of the N-domain is composed of the Phe signals below 270 nm (Fig. 1 B, bold line).

https://openalex.org/W2006982266,"Abstract Transient-state kinetic analysis of compound I formation for barley grain peroxidase (BP 1) has revealed properties that are highly unusual for a heme peroxidase but which may be relevant to its biological function. The enzyme shows very little reaction with H2O2 at pH > 5 and exhibited saturation kinetics at higher H2O2concentrations (kcat app increases from 1.1 s−1 at pH 4.5 to 4.5 s−1 at pH 3.1 with an enzyme-linked pK a < 3.7 (Rasmussen, C. B., Bakovic, M., Welinder, K. G., and Dunford, H. B. (1993)FEBS Lett. 321, 102–105)). In the present paper, it is shown that the presence of Ca2+ gives rise to biphasic kinetics for compound I formation, with a slow phase as described above and a fast phase that exhibits a second order rate constant more typical of a classical peroxidase (k1 app = 1.5 × 107 m −1s−1, which is pH-independent between 3.3 and 5.0). The amount of enzyme reacting in the fast phase increases with Ca2+ concentration (K d = 4 ± 1 mm at pH 4.0), although it is also moderately inhibited by Cl−. The absorption spectrum of BP 1, which appears to be a five-coordinate high spin ferric in the resting state changes insignificantly in the presence of Ca2+. In the presence of Cl−, it becomes six-coordinate high spin (K d approximately 60 mm at pH 4.0) but only if Ca2+ is also present. Fluoride binds to BP 1 with monophasic kinetics in the presence of 0–5 mmCa2+. The activating effect of Ca2+ can be mimicked only by replacing it with Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions. Comparing these data with the crystal structure of the inactive neutral form of BP 1 (Henriksen, A., Welinder, K. G., and Gajhede, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 2241–2248) and similar data for wild-type and mutant peroxidases of plant and fungal origin suggests (i) a proton-induced conformational change from an inactive BP 1 at neutral pH to a low activity BP 1 form with a functional distal histidine and (ii) a Ca2+-induced slow conformational change (at least compared with compound I formation) of this low activity form to a high activity BP 1 with a typical peroxidase reactivity. BP 1 is the first example of a plant peroxidase whose activity can be reversibly controlled at the enzyme level by pH- and Ca2+-induced conformational changes."

However, little is known of how these signal transduction proteins, activated by the receptor complex assembled at the plasma membrane, affect erythroid gene expression in the cell nucleus. Among the genes that are activated in response to Epo and other cytokines are those encoding transcription factors, such as AP-1, that can subsequently activate other genes in a transcriptional cascade. The AP-1 complex is a transcriptional activator composed of members of the Jun and Fos families, including c-Fos, Fra1, Fra2, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. These proteins form homo- or heterodimers that bind to a conserved DNA sequence, identified initially as TRE (TPA responsive element) (14Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P.A. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar), and activate transcription of target genes. While Jun-Jun homodimers are able to bind to TRE sites and activate transcription, Fos proteins are active only as heterodimers with Jun proteins; any Fos protein can form a complex with any Jun, allowing for generation of a large number of transcription factors. AP-1 activity is controlled by increased expression of both fos and jungenes (15Curran T. Abate C. Baker S. Kerppola T. Xanthoudakis S. Adv.

Commun. 1996; 222: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the mechanism of AP-1 activation via the EpoR remains largely unknown. Here we studied Epo activation of AP-1 in Epo-dependent HCD57 erythroleukemia cells and in 32D myeloid cells that express wild-type and mutant Epo receptors. We found that ongoing protein synthesis is required for Epo activation of AP-1. We showed that tyrosine kinase activity is required for AP-1 activation by Epo, and that a mutant EpoR lacking all 8 tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail is incapable of AP-1 activation. However, either of two tyrosine residues in the EpoR, Tyr-343 or Tyr-464, can support maximal activation of AP-1 DNA binding and also Epo-induced transcriptional transactivation of promoters containing the AP-1-binding site TRE. One of these tyrosine residues, Tyr-343, supports activation of STAT5 but another one, Tyr-464, does not. These and other results we present indicate that multiple EpoR-induced intracellular signal transduction cascades can lead to activation of AP-1, and that Epo activation of AP-1 can occur independently of STAT5 activation. The wild-type EpoR cDNA was introduced into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the retrovirus expression vector pBabe (puro) (21Morgenstern J.P. Land H.

Mutant EpoRs lacking all 8 tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain (F8) or containing only one tyrosine (F7 Yxxx) were generated by overlap extension and cloned into the ApaI and EcoRI restriction sites in pBabe-Epo-R (puro) as described in Ref. 12Klingmüller U.

The truncated EpoRs 1–374 and 1–414 were generated by introducing an in-frame stop codon after amino acid positions 374 or 414, respectively, and an EcoRI restriction site. The fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the ApaI and EcoRI restriction sites of the expression vector pBabe-Epo-R (puro). pBabe (puro) DNA encoding the wild-type Epo-R, truncated EpoRs 1–374 and 1–414 or mutant EpoRs F8 and F7 Yxxx was transfected by the calcium-phosphate method into the packaging cell line Bosc 23 as described (12Klingmüller U.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, viral supernatants were harvested and used to infect 106 32D cells. Cell pools expressing the EpoR in conjunction with the puromycin resistance gene were selected and maintained in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 10% WEHI conditioned medium as a source of interleukin 3.

HCD57 cells or 32D cells expressing the wild-type EpoR or mutant EpoRs were starved for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and stimulated with 100 units of Epo/ml at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, mixed vigorously, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 min. The nuclear pellets were extracted with a solution containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. The tubes were rocked vigorously for 20 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 ×g. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C. DNA-binding reactions were conducted by incubation of 10–15 μg of nuclear extract with 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 15 min at room temperature in mixtures containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 4 mm KCl, 0. 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm spermidine, and 8% glycerol. Complexes were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The probe used to analyze AP-1 DNA binding contains the TRE consensus AP-1-binding site (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus TRE or a mutant TRE sequence (5′-CGCTTGATGACTTGGCCGGAA-3′) (24Lee W. Mitchell P. Tijan R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The probe used to analyze STAT5 DNA binding contains a core sequence corresponding to the GAS element of the FcγRI promoter (5′-GTATTTCCCAGAAAAGGAAC-3′) (25Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). 32D cells expressing wild-type EpoR, F8, and F7 Yxxx EpoR mutants were transfected by electroporation at 960 microfarads and 270 V with 20 μg of reporter plasmid consisting of a luciferase gene under the control of 3 TRE-binding sites (the kind gift from Dr. X. Liu, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research). After a 12-h recovery period, cells were stimulated with 100 units/ml Epo for 16 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in 0.25m Tris, pH 7.5, and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). A Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase construct was cotransfected and the level of luciferase activity was normalized to that of the β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Activation of AP-1 DNA binding was analyzed both in the Epo-dependent erythroid progenitor cell line HCD57, which expresses endogenous EpoRs, and in interleukin 3-dependent myeloid 32D-EpoR cells which express a transfected wild-type EpoR and can proliferate in the presence of Epo. HCD57 and 32D-EpoR cells were starved of growth factors and serum for 24 h, and stimulated with Epo for 3 and 6 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and tested for proteins that bind to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus AP-1-binding site, TRE, using an EMSA. In both cell lines Epo induced the formation of an AP-1·DNA complex (Fig.1, left panel). Maximum activation occurs at 6 h; by 12 h the level of AP1 complexes has been reduced over 3-fold (data not shown.) As judged by the different mobilities of the AP-1 complexes in the two cell lines, their protein composition is expected to be different. Epo-induced AP-1 activity is specific for the TRE-binding site since preincubation of nuclear extracts with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the TRE site prevented AP-1 binding to the radiolabeled probe, while preincubation with a 100-fold excess of a mutant TRE with reduced specificity for AP-1 did not affect AP-1 binding (Fig. 1, right panel). Most of the increase in AP-1 activity occurred between 3 and 6 h after Epo addition (Fig. 1) and could involve activation of the genes encoding the components of the AP-1 complex as well as modification (e.g. phosphorylation) of pre-existing AP-1 proteins. To determine whether Epo activation of AP-1 requires de novo protein synthesis, we used cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. HCD57 cells were treated with CHX for various periods of time before and after stimulation with Epo and nuclear extracts were analyzed for AP-1 DNA binding (Fig.2 A). Treatment of cells with CHX for 0.5 h before stimulation with Epo completely inhibited induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) while addition of CHX simultaneous with Epo or 0.5 and 1 h after Epo addition dramatically decreased induction of AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6). The low level of AP-1 binding activity induced in the presence of CHX may reflect activation of pre-existing AP-1 complexes, presumably by phosphorylation, in response to Epo. Thus, the results in Fig. 2 A indicate that most of the increase in AP-1 binding activity following Epo addition depends on de novo protein synthesis. However, because the half-life of newly made Epo receptors is very short, less than 2 h, and because cell surface Epo receptors are degraded with a half-life of only 30–45 min (26Neumann D. Wikstrom L. Watowich S.S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13639-13649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yoshimura A. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4139-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we needed to show that the effects of CHX on AP1 induction were not due to a reduction in the level of functional EpoRs. The experiment inpanel B of Fig. 2 shows that sufficient EpoRs remain after 6 h of CHX treatment to support normal Epo induction of STAT5 DNA binding activity. Here HCD57 cells were treated with CHX for up to 6 h before stimulation with Epo; after 10 min nuclear extracts were analyzed for STAT5 DNA binding activity. Clearly induction of STAT 5 DNA binding activity is unaffected even by a 6-h pretreatment with CHX, showing that ongoing protein synthesis is not required for Epo activation of STAT5 binding. Thus, the effects seen in panel A are not due to a depletion in the numbers of functional EpoRs on the cells even after 6 h of CHX treatment. The requirement of ongoing protein synthesis for AP-1 activation by Epo suggests that Epo induces transcriptional (or translational) activation of AP-1 components. To examine the role of tyrosine kinase activation in Epo induction of the AP-1 complex, HCD57 cells were incubated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) in the absence or presence of Epo. The results (Fig. 3) show that genistein completely inhibited AP-1 activation by Epo (lane 7), while zinc chloride and sodium orthovanadate augmented Epo activation of AP-1 (compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6). Addition of zinc chloride to cells not treated with Epo did not cause significant AP-1 activation (lane 2) while addition of sodium orthovanadate slightly increased AP-1 activity in the absence of EPO (lane 3). Similar results were obtained with 32D-EpoR cells (data not shown). Our results indicate that phosphorylation by a protein tyrosine kinase is essential for Epo activation of AP-1. To determine the segment(s) of the cytosolic domain of the EpoR which mediate AP-1 activation, we first used 32D cells expressing mutant EpoRs missing 42 (EpoR 1–441), 69 (EpoR 1–414), or 109 (EpoR 1–374) C-terminal amino acids; EpoR 1–374 contains the minimal cytosolic domain essential for cell proliferation and erythroid differentiation (11Damen J.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14009-14012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We also employed EpoR F8, containing a full- length cytosolic domain but with all 8 cytosolic tyrosines mutated to phenylalanine; F8 cannot stimulate cell proliferation or erythroid differentiation (10Klingmüller U. Wu H. Hsiao J.G. Toker A. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3016-3021Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Wu H. Klingmüller U. Acurio A. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1806-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts show that all truncated EpoRs are able to activate AP-1 binding with an efficiency comparable to that of the wild-type EpoR (Fig. 4). However, Epo activation of AP-1 binding is dramatically reduced in cells expressing mutant EpoR F8 (Fig. 4), demonstrating that tyrosine residue(s) of the EpoR are necessary for Epo activation of AP-1. Mutant EpoR 1–374 contains only tyrosine residue 343 and is able to support normal AP-1 activation. In contrast, EpoR 1–374 with a Y343F mutation is unable to support cell proliferation (30Socolovsky M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14009-14012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and cannot support normal AP-1 activation (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that (phospho)Tyr-343 can support Epo activation of AP-1, presumably by binding the SH2 or PTB domain of one or more intracellular signal transduction proteins. To identify other tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of EpoR that can support AP-1 activation, we used 32D cells stably expressing mutant EpoRs containing only one cytosolic tyrosine; these mutants are named F7 Yxxx according to the single tyrosine present. Pools of transfected 32D cells expressing comparable numbers of receptors were used for all experiments. The results (Fig.5 A) show that several tyrosine residues are individually able to mediate Epo activation of AP-1 binding. EpoR F7 Y343 and EpoR F7 Y464 supported the same level of AP-1 activation as did the wild-type receptor, indicating that either (phospho)Tyr-343 or (phospho)Tyr-464 are able to support maximal activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity. We then determined whether these tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR are sufficient not only for activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity but also for transcriptional transactivation of promoters containing the AP-1-binding site TRE. We again used 32D cells stably expressing the wild-type EpoR, EpoR F8, and all 8 mutant F7 Yxxx EpoRs; these were transiently transfected with the 3TRE-luc plasmid containing 3 TRE sites linked to a reporter luciferase gene. The results (Fig. 5 B) show that in cells expressing the wild-type EpoR, Epo induced a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity. In cells expressing mutant EpoR F8 Epo was unable to induce luciferase activity. However, cells expressing EpoR F7 Y343 and EpoR F7 Y464 supported normal Epo-induced activation of luciferase activity, and thus of the TRE promoter. Cells expressing EpoR F7 Y401 and EpoR F7 Y429 supported partial (∼30%) Epo-induced activation of luciferase activity. Taken together with the ability of Epo-R F7 Y401 and Epo-R F7 Y429 to support partial activation of AP-1 DNA binding (Fig.5 A), this indicates that (phospho)Tyr-401 and (phospho)Tyr-429 can mediate partial AP-1 activation, presumably by binding one or more intracellular signal transduction proteins. Cells expressing other EpoRs containing single tyrosine residues were able to support little, if any, Epo-induced activation of luciferase activity. Thus, the ability of F7 Yxxx EpoRs to support activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 5 A) correlates perfectly with their ability to transactivate a promoter containing the TRE AP-1-binding site. Our previous work showed that EpoR F8 supported activation of only ∼10% the amount of STAT5 DNA binding activity as did wild-type EpoR. EpoR F7 Y343 supported maximal activity of STAT5, while EpoR F7 Y464 supported activation of STAT5 to the same low extent (∼10%) as did EpoR F8 (12Klingmüller U. Bergelson S. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity by mutant F7 Yxxx Epo receptors (Fig. 5) did not correlate with activation of STAT5; if STAT5 were required, activation of only 10% of the maximal level would be sufficient. To test directly whether STAT5 is essential for AP-1 activation by Epo, we expressed a dominant-negative STAT5 mutant in HCD57 cells (Fig.6); in these HCD57-ΔSTAT5 cells the dominant-negative STAT5, ΔSTAT5 (22Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), was under the control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter. Removing doxycycline from the cells induces the expression of ΔSTAT5. Induced expression of ΔSTAT5 resulted in a significant decrease in the level of Epo-activated STAT5 DNA binding activity (Fig. 6, lane 3), but had no effect on the level of Epo-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 6, lane 6). Within minutes of binding of Epo to the EpoR, a number of intracellular signal transduction proteins become activated: the protein tyrosine kinase JAK2, the transcription factor STAT5, the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and adapter proteins such as Shc and Grb2 that stimulate activation of the ras pathway (see Introduction for references). Here we showed that, in both HCD57 cells and 32D-EpoR cells, the DNA binding activity of AP-1 transcription factors becomes activated about 3 h after Epo addition and reaches the maximum level at 6 h. We showed that AP-1 activation by Epo is prevented by CHX and therefore depends on de novo protein synthesis. This presumably reflects Epo receptor activation of gene transcription and/or protein synthesis of Jun and Fos AP-1 complex components. Using a mutant EpoR (F8) containing no cytosolic tyrosine residues, and a set of eight mutants (EpoR F7 Yxxx) containing a single cytosolic tyrosine residue, we showed that any of several tyrosines can mediate AP-1 activation to a significant extent. These studies also demonstrated that AP-1 activation does not require maximal STAT5 activation and may occur via a STAT5- independent signaling pathway. First, we showed that Epo activation of AP-1 requires tyrosine kinase activity, since it was suppressed by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and was activated by zinc chloride and sodium orthovanadate, inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Tyrosine kinase JAK2 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to Epo and is believed to phosphorylate a number of substrates including the EpoR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EpoR creates binding sites for the SH2 domains of many signal transduction proteins and is crucial for EpoR signaling. AP-1 activation by Epo was strongly reduced in cells expressing the EpoR mutant F8; neither induction of AP-1 proteins able to bind to TRE sequences nor transactivation of promoters containing AP-1 binding sites occurred after Epo addition. Thus, at least one cytosolic tyrosine in the cytosolic domain of the EpoR is essential for normal AP-1 activation. Second, several lines of evidence indicated that individual tyrosine residues in the EpoR, thought to support activation of different intracellular signal transduction proteins, could mediate normal AP-1 activation. First, a truncated EpoR (1–374), containing only the single tyrosine 343, could activate AP-1 to the same extent as the wild-type EpoR. EpoR 1–374 is able to support Epo-dependent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells and also differentiation of fetal liver erythroid progenitors from the fetal livers of EpoR−/− mice (31Wu H. Klingmüller U. Acurio A. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1806-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, EpoR 1–374 with a Y343F mutation is unable to support cell proliferation (30Socolovsky M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14009-14012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and cannot support normal AP-1 activation (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that (phospho)Tyr-343 can support Epo activation of AP-1. Additionally, an EpoR containing only tyrosine 343 (EpoR F7 Y343) or only tyrosine 464 (EpoR F7 Y464) supported maximal activation both of AP-1 DNA binding activity and of transcriptional transactivation of a promoter containing the AP-1-binding site TRE. An EpoR containing only tyrosine 401 (EpoR F7 Y401) or only tyrosine 429 (EpoR F7 Y429) was able to support partial activation of AP-1. Thus, there is marked redundancy in the abilities of individual tyrosine residues within the EpoR to mediate AP-1 activation. Presumably each of these phosphotyrosine residues binds the SH2 or PTB domain of one or more intracellular signal transduction proteins. The significance of this redundancy is made evident by Table I, which shows that individual tyrosine residues in the EpoR are known to support activation of different and sometimes overlapping sets of intracellular signal transduction proteins.Table ISignal transduction proteins induced by specific tyrosine residues in the cytosolic domain of the erythropoietin receptorTyrosineSHP-1Phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinaseSHP-21-aSee Ref. 8.STAT 5AP-1Tyr-343++++Tyr-401+++++Tyr-429++++Tyr-431+Tyr-443Tyr-461Tyr-464++Tyr-479++1-a See Ref. 8Tauchi T.

Bergelson S. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of STAT5 does not correlate with AP-1 activation since our present results showed that EpoR F8 is unable to activate AP-1 while EpoR F7 Y464 supports maximal activation of AP-1. Additionally, expression of a mutant dominant-negative STAT5, which decreased both phosphorylation of STAT5 and Epo-induced activation of STAT5 DNA binding activity, did not affect the ability of Epo to induce AP-1. These results support our conclusion that maximal induction of STAT5 activity is unnecessary for maximal induction of AP-1 activity. However, since Tyr-343 is able to support maximal activation of both STAT5 and AP-1, we cannot exclude the possibility that different signaling pathways can result in the activation of AP-1: one supported by Tyr-464 and independent of STAT5, and another supported by Tyr-343 which may involve STAT5 activation. Conflicting results have been reported regarding the involvement of STAT5 in the activation of the c-fos component of AP-1. In one study, the role of STAT5 was addressed using naturally occurring dominant-negative variants of STAT5 (32Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Although expression of a dominant-negative STAT5 suppressed the interleukin 3 induction of genes normally induced via STAT5, such as oncostatin M (OSM) and CIS (22Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar,33Yoshimura A. Ichihara M. Kinjio I. Miriyama M. Copeland N.G. Gisbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), there was no effect on induction of the c-fos gene (32Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In contrast, a different study showed that a truncated dominant-negative STAT5 suppressed interleukin 3-induced c-fos gene expression (22Mui A.L.-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The upstream region of the c-fos promoter contains several regulatory sequences, including a sis-inducible element which binds STAT1 and STAT3 proteins (34Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Sis-inducible element was shown to be essential for c-fos activation by granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (35Rajotte D. Sadowski H.B. Haman A. Gopalbhai K. Meloche S. Liu L. Krystal G. Hoang T. Blood. 1996; 88: 2906-2916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of the SIE element in Epo activation of c-fos has not been determined. We thank Dr. X. Liu for the 3TRE-luc plasmid, Dr. S. Watowich for the 32D cell line expressing the truncated EpoR 1–441, and Drs. S. Constantinescu and C. Rodriguez for helpful discussions and for critically reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2330273832,"The Fli-1 protein is a member of the ets proto-oncogene family, whose overexpression is a consequence of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) integration in Friend erythroleukemic cells. We present evidence that Fli-1 and the retinoic acid receptor (RARα) can reciprocally repress one another's transcriptional activation. Overexpression of Fli-1 inhibits the retinoic acid-induced activation of genes carrying a functional retinoic acid response element (RARE). Conversely, RARα is able to repress Fli-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Transfection analysis of RARα and Fli-1 mutants in cultured cells demonstrate that the DNA binding domain of RARα and the N-terminal region of Fli-1 are required for repression. Gel retardation analysis demonstrates that RARα cannot bind to the Fli-1 binding site in the E74 promoter and the expression of Fli-1 does not affect RARα binding to DNA. Furthermore, the data suggest an indirect interaction between Fli-1 and RARα mediated by a `bridging' factor(s) present in nuclear extracts from RM10 erythroleukemia cells. Fli-1 also interferes with the action of receptors for thyroid or glucocorticoid hormone in several hematopoietic cell lines. The RA-induced differentiation and decrease of cell proliferation was blocked in myeloblastic leukemia HL-60 cells overexpressing the N-terminal region of Fli-1 at physiological concentrations of RA. These data suggest that accumulation of Fli-1 can oppose the transcriptional activity of hormone receptors in hematopoietic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2018636538,"The phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) is ubiquitous in eucaryotes and is unique in structure, subcellular localization, and potential function. Previous studies have shown that CL is associated with major respiratory complexes in the mitochondrial membrane. To determine whether CL biosynthesis requires the presence of intact respiratory complexes, we measured activity of CL synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of CL from cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, in Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrains with genetic defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system. Assembly mutants of cytochrome oxidase had significantly reduced CL synthase activity, while assembly mutants of respiratory complex III and the F0F1-ATPase were less inhibited. To obtain further information on the activity of CL synthase, we purified the enzyme and compared the size of the catalytic protein with the functional molecular mass. The enzyme was solubilized by Triton X-100 from KSCN-extracted mitochondrial membranes of S. cerevisiae. The functional molecular mass of Triton-solubilized CL synthase, determined by radiation inactivation, was 150–240 kDa, indicating that the functional enzyme was a large complex. After partial purification, the enzyme eluted from a Superose 12 gel filtration column with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. CL synthase was further purified by hydroxylapatite and cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol affinity chromatographies, Mono Q anion exchange FPLC, and preparative gel electrophoresis. These steps led to identification of a 28-kDa protein, which had catalytic activity when eluted from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. This 28-kDa protein also reacted with an antiserum that inactivated the enzyme. We conclude that yeast CL synthase is a 28-kDa protein, which forms an oligomeric complex whose biogenesis and/or activity is influenced by the assembly of cytochrome oxidase.

Cardiolipin (1,3-diphosphatidyl-sn-glycerol; CL) 1The abbreviations used are: CL, cardiolipin; CDP-DG, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hydroxylapatite. is an anionic phospholipid found in procaryotic cells (1Pluschke G. Hirota Y. Overath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5048-5055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the inner mitochondrial membrane of all eucaryotic cells (2Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 3Sperka-Gottlieb C.D.M. Hermetter A. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is a unique phospholipid with a dimeric structure in which two phosphatidyl moieties are linked by a glycerol bridge. The physiological role of CL has remained obscure, but it has been shown to interact strongly with a large variety of apparently unrelated proteins. In mitochondria, CL displays characteristic combinations of acyl groups (4Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), distinguishing it from other phospholipids and implying some specific functional involvement. Mitochondrial CL is associated with the major proteins of oxidative phosphorylation, including the respiratory complexes I (NADH-ubiquinone reductase) (5Fry M. Green D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1874-1880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), III (ubiquinol-cytochrome creductase (6Hayer-Hartl M. Schagger H. von Jagow G. Beyer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and IV (cytochrome oxidase) (7Robinson N.C. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the F0F1-ATPase (complex V) (8Eble K.S. Coleman W.B. Hantgan R.R. Cunningham C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19434-19440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the carrier proteins for phosphate (9Kadenbach B. Mende P. Kolbe H.V.J. Stipani I. Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and adenine nucleotides (10Beyer K. Klingenberg M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3821-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). There is a common eucaryotic reaction for CL formation involving phosphatidyl transfer from CDP-diacylglycerol to phosphatidylglycerol (4Schlame M. Brody S. Hostetler K.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), in contrast to the bacterial reaction in which CL is formed by the condensation of two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol (11Hirschberg C.B. Kennedy E.P. Proc. natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 506-514Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Most of what is known about CL biosynthesis has originated from studies in rat liver mitochondria. In this tissue, the eucaryotic pathway was discovered (12Hostetler K.Y. Hawthorne J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 215-261Google Scholar) and its absolute dependence on divalent cations was established (13Hostetler K.Y. Galesloot J.M. Boer P. van den Bosch H. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 380: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Rat liver CL synthase was purified as an acidic 50-kDa enzyme whose activity was optimal in the presence of Co2+, phosphatidylethanolamine, and alkaline pH (14Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22398-22403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (15Hostetler K.Y. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the catalytic site facing the matrix (16Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CL is formed in the inner leaflet of the inner membrane. There is also evidence that the de novo formation of CL is succeeded by a deacylation-reacylation reaction via the intermediate monolysocardiolipin to generate the specific acyl pattern of CL (17Schlame M. Rustow B. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be an excellent model to study the biogenesis of mitochondria by combined biochemical and genetic approaches. Therefore, we chose this organism for experiments addressing the role of CL in eucaryotic cell function. Since CL interacts with several protein complexes of the mitochondrial inner membrane, it would be particularly interesting to determine how CL biosynthesis is coordinated with import and assembly of mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, it is desirable to identify the molecular components involved in CL formation as well as their supramolecular organization. In earlier studies, we solubilized yeast CL synthase by Triton X-100, characterized some of its properties, and investigated the mechanism of CL synthesis in a mixed micellar system containing Triton and the partially purified enzyme (18Schlame M. Zhao M. Rua D. Haldar D. Greenberg M.L. Lipids. 1995; 30: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). There are striking similarities between CL synthases from yeast and mammals, such as the high pH optimum, the absolute requirement for divalent cations, strong inhibition by lysophosphatidylglycerol, and insensitivity to the SH-reagent N-ethylmaleimide. However, in contrast to the mammalian enzyme, the yeast enzyme prefers Mg2+ over Co2+ for activation. The kinetic data were compatible with a model, in which CL synthase forms a ternary complex with both phospholipid substrates and exercises catalysis at the surface of mixed phospholipid/detergent micelles. Since Mg2+ increased the maximal velocity but not the substrate affinity, we suggested that it binds to the enzyme rather than the substrates. In the work described here, we report the purification of CL synthase from S. cerevisiae to apparent homogeneity, and show that activity is dependent on the assembly of specific respiratory complexes in the mitochondrial membrane. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin were obtained from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany).N-Ethylmaleimide, pepstatin A, 1-(3-sn-phosphatidyl)-rac-glycerol (derived from egg yolk phosphatidylcholine), CDP-diacylglycerol-1,2-diacylglycerol (derived from egg lecithin), and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 were from Sigma. Triton X-100 and Silica Gel 60 H were purchased from EM Science. Florisil was from J.T. Baker. SDS (electrophoresis grade) was from Fisher. Peptone and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HT), and ampholytes (pH 3–10) were from Bio-Rad. The ultrafiltration equipment, including YM 10 ultrafiltration membranes, the pressure dialysis device, and Centricon 10 microconcentrator tubes were made by Amicon (Beverly, MA). Agarose adipic acid hydrazide ((4% beaded agarose)-NHNH-CO-(CH2)4-CO-NHNH2) and the Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein electrophoresis was performed with the Mini-Protean II electrophoresis system from Bio-Rad. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-[U-14C]glycero-3-diphospho-5′-cytidine ([14C]CDP-diacylglycerol), specific activity 88 dpm/pmol, and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-[2-3H]glycero-3-phospho-5′-cytidine ([3H]CDP-diacylglycerol), specific activity 1923 dpm/pmol, were synthesized as described (18Schlame M.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The wild-type S. cerevisiaestrain D273–10B (met6 MATα) was grown to mid-logarithmic phase at 30 °C in a medium containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose in a 100-liter fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co.). Air at a rate of 15 liters/min was passed through the culture, which was stirred at 200 rpm. The culture was grown to anA 550 of 1.5. Cells were harvested in a Sharples AS-16 Super-centrifuge at 13,000 × g at a flow rate of 4 liters/min. The cell paste was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Frozen cells (100 g) were thawed, washed with water, and suspended in 400 ml of medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mmNaF. Mitochondria were prepared as described (20Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Extraction of membranes with 1 m KSCN and solubilization in 2% Triton X-100 have been described in detail previously (18Schlame M. Zhao M. Rua D. Haldar D. Greenberg M.L. Lipids. 1995; 30: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). During solubilization and all chromatographic procedures, the following mixture of protease inhibitors was present: 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mg/liter pepstatin A, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, and 2 mg/liter aprotinin. The Triton extract (14 ml) was loaded on a freshly prepared HA column (1.6 × 15 cm2) which was equilibrated in a buffer containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.08% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.05 m KCl, and 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). A 140-ml gradient was run from 10 to 500 mm phosphate in the equilibration buffer, and 5-ml fractions were collected (flow rate, 1 ml/min). Thirty-μl aliquots of each fraction were assayed for CL synthase activity. The peak fractions were pooled, and their total volume was reduced to 5 ml by ultrafiltration through an Amicon YM 10 membrane. The sample was diluted 2-fold with Medium A and then reconcentrated. Three dilution-reconcentration cycles were performed to reduce the salt concentration about 8-fold. The concentrated and desalted enzyme fraction from HA chromatography was incubated with CDP-diacylglycerol affinity resin, which was prepared as described (22Larson T.J. Hirabayashi T. Dowhan W. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and equilibrated with medium A containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After a 2-h incubation, the mixture was packed into a column (1 × 5 cm2) and incubated for an additional 1 h. CL synthase was eluted with 15 ml of 1 m KCl in medium A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and 30-μl aliquots were assayed for CL synthase activity. (For this and subsequent steps, an overnight incubation time was necessary due to low enzyme activity). Three peak fractions containing CL synthase were pooled, concentrated, and desalted 8-fold using Centricon 10 concentrators. The concentrated and desalted peak fractions from either the HA or CDP-DG affinity column were loaded on a Mono Q column (HR 5/5), which was equilibrated with medium A containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and run at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using a 15-ml gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and 30-μl aliquots were assayed. CL synthase eluted at about 0.4 m. Three peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted 8-fold using Centricon 10 concentrators. The concentrated and desalted enzyme fraction from the Mono Q column was further purified by preparative gel electrophoresis in a Bio-Rad Prep Cell apparatus, following the directions of the manufacturer, and using the discontinuous Laemmli buffer system for SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). One mg of protein in 1 ml was applied to a 12.5% polyacrylamide separating gel poured to 6.0 cm (height) with a 1-cm 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel. The lower chamber buffer circulated through the cooling core of the Prep Cell at 100 ml/min. The enzyme sample was electrophoresed at a constant current of 40 mA in the cold for 10 h. Starting at the dye front, 80 fractions of 3 ml were collected at an elution rate of 0.75 ml/min, and 30-μl aliquots were assayed. The enzyme assay mixture was incubated for 3 days. The peak fractions from the Mono Q column were applied to a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with medium A containing 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and 1m KCl (flow rate 0.25 ml/min). Fractions of 0.8 ml were collected and assayed for activity. CL synthase was eluted after a volume of 12 ml. The chromatographic fractions were depleted of salt and detergent using the Centricon 10 ultrafiltration system, and rediluted in medium A containing 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. The KCl concentration was reduced to about 0.05 m by several concentration/redilution cycles. The fractions from preparative gel electrophoresis were concentrated by the Centricon 10 concentrators without redilution. All the samples were heated at 90 °C for 5 min (except for experiments determining enzyme activity in gel slices), and electrophoresed on 10 × 7-cm slab minigels with a thickness of 0.75 mm. The Laemmli system (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was used at a polyacrylamide concentration of 12.5% (w/v). The gels were stained by Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). The formation of [14C]CL or [3H]CL from radiolabeled CDP-diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol was measured as described (19Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The incubation time was 1 h for early steps, and overnight or longer for CDP-DG affinity, Mono Q, and preparative gel electrophoresis fractions. A 50-μl aliquot of the enzyme preparation was mixed with 15 μl of Tris (0.5 m, pH 6.8), 20 μl of SDS (10%) and 1 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The sample was electrophoresed according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and run at 160 V/20 mA in the cold. The gel was cut into 5-mm slices, which were briefly washed with distilled water, and then further cut to 1-mm cubes with a razor blade. The gel pieces were assayed for CL synthase activity as described previously, except that the incubation time was 3 days. Samples were placed in Eppendorf tubes and irradiated for various times by a cobalt-60 irradiator with a dose rate of 1,906,681 rads/h. During irradiation, the samples were kept frozen on dry ice. Controls were kept at the same temperature for the same time without irradiation. After the treatment, CL synthase was assayed, and the data were used to fit the equationV/V 0 = exp(−D/D 37) in whichV 0 is the control activity, V is the activity after irradiation with the dose D, andD 37 is the dose at which the activity drops to 37% of the control activity. Least squares nonlinear fitting was performed with the program Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Theory and evaluation of radiation inactivation analysis were discussed by Kempner and Schlegel (24Kempner E.S. Schlegel W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Four mice were injected with the partially purified (HA, Mono Q, and Prep Cell) CL synthase (100 μg). Each mouse was immunized four times at 2-week intervals. Serum samples were tested for the production of polyclonal antibodies against CL synthase by standard procedures, using HA peak fractions as antigens. Several days after the fourth injection, serum from the mouse with the strongest immune response against CL synthase was obtained. The specificity of the anti-CL synthase antibodies was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using HA-purified enzyme as antigen. Western blotting was carried out using standard procedures. Protein concentrations of organelle and membrane fractions were determined by the procedure of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In partially purified fractions, protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad assay kit. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a standard, and blanks contained the same buffers used for the protein samples. We studied CL synthase activity in yeast mutants that had defined genetic defects in the oxidative phosphorylation system (TableI). Specific assembly defects of complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c reductase) and complex V (F0F1-ATPase) resulted in only small reductions in CL synthase activity. More striking changes were caused by an impaired assembly of complex IV (cytochrome oxidase), which led to the loss of about half of the CL synthase activity. The extent of reduction of CL synthase in complex IV mutants is the same as that observed in mutants lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho 0), in which none of the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation can assemble due to the lack of mitochondrially encoded subunits. Only those defects of cytochrome oxidase that affected the assembly of the complex (deletion of subunit 4, 6, or 7) decreased CL synthase activity significantly, while the deletion of subunit 6a, a modulator of complex IV activity (27Taanman J.-W. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18754-18761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had little effect on CL synthase.Table ICardiolipin synthase activity in mitochondria of yeast mutants with defects in the oxidative phosphorylation systemAffected complexStrainParent strainReferenceDeletionDefective functionCardiolipin synthaseN%III (QCR)aW303ΔCOR1W303–1A(35Weiss H.

Open table in a new tab The fact that CL synthase was still detectable in arho 0 mutant clearly demonstrated the nuclear location of its gene. CL synthase was solubilized from mitochondrial membranes by Triton X-100 or Triton X-114. When mitochondrial membranes were solubilized by Triton X-114, the total CL synthase activity dropped to 26 ± 5% (n = 3). Most of this activity (93 ± 19%, n = 3) partitioned into the detergent phase after Triton X-114 phase separation, suggesting that CL synthase is a very hydrophobic membrane protein. For the purpose of enzyme purification, Triton X-100 was chosen because of its compatibility with enzyme activity and its suitability for various chromatographic procedures. Mitochondria were isolated and separated into a membrane fraction and a soluble fraction. The membranes were treated with the chaotropic salt KSCN to remove loosely attached proteins. This procedure yielded a highly hydrophobic membrane residue, which could be partially solubilized by Triton X-100. CL synthase was solubilized with Triton X-100 and radiation inactivation was used to determine its functional size. The radiation inactivation curve of the Triton-solubilized enzyme revealed a target size of 240 ± 20 kDa (Fig.1). Given that Triton X-100 may artificially increase the target size by up to 55% (28Beauregard G. Potier M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the functional molecular weight of CL synthase is at least 150 kDa. Following purification, the enzyme lost activity dramatically. Radiation inactivation could not, therefore, be used to assess the functional size. Therefore, we analyzed the functional molecular weight of partially purified CL synthase by gel filtration. After solubilization from the membranes, the enzyme eluted in the void volume of a Bio-Gel A-1.5m column (exclusion limit about 1,500 kDa) (data not shown). However, after chromatographic purification, the enzyme eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa from a Superose 12 column (Fig. 2). Depending on the number of Triton molecules bound to the enzyme at this point, the data are consistent with an active enzyme consisting of a dimer or trimer. CL synthase was solubilized in Triton X-100 as described above and purified from the Triton extract by successive chromatography steps, as follows. HA chromatography was performed as described. A 280 during the elution and protein assay of each fraction indicated that a major protein peak was eluted in the wash. CL synthase eluted at about 0.2 m phosphate. Nearly 100% of applied CL synthase was recovered in peak fractions containing only 8% of the applied protein. The increase in purification is thus 12-fold for this step. CL synthase was very stable to freeze-thaw cycles at this point and could be stored at −80 °C for up to 6 months. The concentrated and desalted peak enzyme fraction from hydroxylapatite chromatography was incubated with CDP-DG affinity resin, which had been equilibrated with medium A containing 0.5% Triton X-100, the optimal Triton concentration for enzyme binding. The batch method allowed maximal binding of CL synthase to the resin. After a 2-h incubation, the mixture was packed into a column and precipitated for another hour. The column was eluted with 15 ml of 1 m KCl in medium A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the optimal concentration for elution. The majority of protein came off the CDP-DG affinity column in the flow-through (Fig. 3 A), resulting in substantial purification. However, over 90% of CL synthase activity was lost in this purification step. An attempt was made to recover enzyme activity in the peak fractions by adding a phospholipid mixture containing lipid in the ratio CL/phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylserine (19:29:36:8:2) found in the inner membrane of yeast mitochondria (2Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 822: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). However, this was not successful. CL synthase after CDP-DG affinity chromatography was very unstable to freeze-thaw cycles and could only be stored at −80 °C for a few days. The concentrated and desalted enzyme fraction from the CDP-DG affinity column was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q FPLC column (HR 5/5). A 15-ml gradient was run from 0 to 1m KCl in equilibration buffer, and CL synthase was eluted with 0.4 m KCl. The A 280 profile showed that a major protein peak eluted at 0.8 m KCl. CL synthase was very unstable to freeze-thaw cycles at this point. The sample could be stored at −80 °C for only a few days. The pooled, concentrated, and desalted peak fractions from the Mono Q column were further purified by preparative gel electrophoresis using the Bio-Rad Prep Cell. Preparative SDS-PAGE was run according to the discontinuous Laemmli buffer system (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). A total volume of 1 ml (1 mg of protein) was applied to the Prep Cell. The enzyme sample was electrophoresed at a constant current of 40 mA in the cold for 10 h. Starting at the dye front, 80 3-ml fractions were collected at an elution rate of 0.75 ml/min. To assay enzyme activity in each fraction, a 3-day incubation was necessary, since CL synthase activity was extremely low at this point. The peak fractions of CL synthase were eluted after 270 ml. The elution profile from preparative gel electrophoresis is shown in Fig.3 B. CL synthase was very unstable to freeze-thaw cycles at this point. The sample could be stored at −80 °C for only a few days. In a typical purification protocol, 100 g wet weight of yeast cell paste gave about 100 μg of CL synthase. Fig.4 shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified CL synthase. A single protein is present in the purified sample, indicating that the catalytic CL synthase is a 28-kDa protein. Because active enzyme was compatible with a low concentration of SDS, we identified the enzyme following elution from an SDS-PAGE gel. CL synthase was purified by hydroxylapatite and Mono Q chromatographies and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described, except that the sample was not boiled. Individual gel slices were assayed for CL synthase activity, and activity was recovered in the 25–29-kDa region (Fig. 5). Mice were immunized with partially purified enzyme following hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and Prep Cell steps (without affinity purification). SDS-PAGE analysis of the enzyme preparation showed three or four major protein bands, in the range of 26–29 kDa (data not shown). Antiserum from a mouse immunized with partially purified CL synthase strongly inhibited enzyme activity (Fig.6 A). Western blotting indicated that the antibodies in this serum react with a 28-kDa protein (Fig. 6 B). In this paper, we report that CL synthase activity is dependent on the assembly of respiratory complex IV in the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, we purified the enzyme to homogeneity and show that, while catalytic activity is associated with a 28-kDa protein, the functional protein is much larger. The data in this paper demonstrate that the catalytic activity for CL synthase resides in a 28-kDa integral membrane protein that is encoded by nuclear DNA. Identification of the enzyme was based on the reconstitution of activity in an electrophoretically isolated band (Fig. 5), as well as on chromatographic copurification of this protein with CL synthase activity (Fig. 4). In addition, mouse polyclonal antibodies that inhibited CL synthase activity reacted with a 28-kDa protein (Fig. 6). The hydrophobic nature of CL synthase was demonstrated by Triton X-114 phase partition and by the inability of a chaotropic salt to solubilize it. The presence of CL synthase activity in a ρ 0 mutant (Table I) was evidence for the nuclear location of its gene. We have recently identified the likely structural gene coding for CL synthase, CLS1 (29Jiang F. Rizavi H. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). ACLS1 null mutant has no CL synthase activity and no CL in its membranes. The CLS1 ORF predicts a protein of 32 kDa, which is consistent with the size of the catalytic protein reported in this paper and allows for the possibility of proteolytic cleavage of the protein upon import into the mitochondria. There are two problems with using CL synthase activity as an indicator of enzyme purity. 1) Changes of salt and Triton concentration may affect the enzyme conformation, and 2) more importantly, Triton induces a surface dilution effect that decreases CL synthase activity even if the enzyme conformation remains unharmed (18Schlame M. Zhao M. Rua D. Haldar D. Greenberg M.L. Lipids. 1995; 30: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Since we cannot control the Triton concentration at each step of the purification protocol, it is virtually impossible to estimate the amount of enzyme from CL synthase activity assays. Radiation inactivation is a well established method to determine the molecular size of proteins, and many examples demonstrate the validity of this procedure (24Kempner E.S. Schlegel W. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 92: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), including membrane proteins (28Beauregard G. Potier M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the Triton-solubilized CDP-DG synthase from yeast (30Kelley M.J. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14563-14570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The target size of CL synthase, as determined by radiation inactivation, translated into a molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa (Fig. 1). How can this be reconciled with the data showing that the catalytic activity was associated with a 28-kDa polypeptide, which was purified by gel filtration as a 70-kDa micelle? It is not clear whether the 70-kDa species represented a homopolymer of the 28-kDa protein, or whether it was an assembly of the 28-kDa protein with other proteins. The binding of detergent may also have contributed significantly to the molecular mass of the 70-kDa form. In any case, the high target size suggested that the functional CL synthase was a complex much larger than 70 kDa. The fact that CL synthase activity was detectable in the isolated 28-kDa protein does not preclude a requirement for other protein components, because only rudimentary activity was recovered after SDS-PAGE. Thus, while the 28-kDa protein is clearly the catalytic peptide, other proteins and/or lipids may be involved in stimulating its activity. Ohtsuka et al. (31Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22908-22913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) described a temperature-dependent mutation of a CHO cell line in which the content of CL was reduced due to a defect in phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase. They further studied the effect of this mutation on individual respiratory enzymes (32Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22914-22919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced levels of CL in the CHO cells led to altered mitochondrial morphology and to reduced oxygen consumption, but they were accompanied by little changes in the activities of individual respiratory enzymes, except for a reduction in complex I activity in the absence of exogenous electron acceptors. In the present work, we took a complementary approach by studying the impact on CL synthase of certain defects in the complexes of oxidative phosphorylation (Table I). Most mutants had a small reduction of their CL synthase activity, but this could most likely be ascribed to an unspecific pleiotrophic effect. However, assembly defects of complex IV had a more severe impact, reducing CL synthase activity by about 50% (which is the extent to which activity is reduced in the ρ 0 mutant). It was specifically the assembly of complex IV rather than its redoxactivity that affected CL synthase. Interestingly, Ohtsukaet al. (32Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22914-22919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found an almost 2-fold increase in complex IV activity in the CHO mutant at the permissive temperature, whereas other respiratory enzymes remained unaffected. While no explanation is readily available, both the data of Ohtsuka et al. (32Ohtsuka T. Nishijima M. Suzuki K. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22914-22919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and our data suggest that there might be a regulatory relation between cytochrome oxidase assembly and the CL pathway. There is evidence that respiratory complexes participate in functions other than energy transduction, such as the transfer of acyl groups (33Runswick M.J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Sackmann U. Zensen R. Rophlen D. Jahnke U. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or the proteolytic processing of mitochondrial precursor proteins (35Weiss H. Leonard K. Neupert W. Trends Biochem.

Docking and subsequent priming steps are thought to require cytoplasmic factors. These steps are believed to induce fusion competence. We have tested this hypothesis by isolating reserve granules from sea urchin eggs and determining under which conditions these granules will fuse. We find that isolated reserve granules, lacking soluble cofactors, support calcium-dependent membrane fusion in vitro. Preincubation with adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate did not prevent fusion. Thus, isolated reserve granules have all the necessary components required for calcium-gated fusion prior to docking.

Thus, isolated reserve granules have all the necessary components required for calcium-gated fusion prior to docking. The ontogeny of granules destined for calcium-triggered exocytosis involves many steps, including the biosynthesis of granule components, transport of granules to the plasma membrane, and docking with the plasma membrane. As in most cells, mature secretory granules from sea urchin eggs are derived from vesicles which bud from the Golgi apparatus (1Anderson E. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 514-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is known that secretory granules isolated from a cell surface complex consisting of sea urchin egg plasma membrane sheets and tightly associated cortical granules can be reconstituted to fuse with the plasma membrane (2Crabb J.H. Jackson R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Whalley T. Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1988; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), with other cortical granules (4Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and even with liposomes in response to elevated calcium in vitro (5Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that cortical granules have multiple copies of the machinery required for calcium-triggered fusion (6Vogel S.S. Blank P.S. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is clear that docked granules arrested at a stage just prior to being triggered can support membrane fusion in vitro. In contrast, the point during the development of secretory granules where fusion complexes are assembled and capable of supporting both homotypic and heterotypic membrane fusion is not known. It has been proposed that the assembly of a complex of proteins that are thought to mediate membrane fusion occurs during and subsequent to granule docking (7Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar, 8Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 9Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This assembly is thought to require cytoplasmic factors. Furthermore, other “activation” steps subsequent to granule docking are thought to be required for a fusion complex to support triggered membrane fusion (10O'Connor V. Augustine G.J. Betz H. Cell. 1994; 76: 785-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,11Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 335-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sea urchin eggs undergo a massive calcium-triggered exocytotic event called the cortical reaction immediately following fertilization. Approximately 18,000 docked cortical granules fuse with the plasma membrane during the first few minutes (12Epel D. Sci. Am. 1977; 237: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Secreted granule contents are integral to the construction of the fertilization envelope, a barrier to polyspermy (13Jaffe L.A. Cross N.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1986; 48: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sea urchin eggs also contain “reserve” secretory granules, distinct from cortical granules, which are localized in the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg. These granules translocate from the cytoplasm to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, dock, and fuse with the plasma membrane at various times, ranging from minutes to days, after the cortical reaction (14Alliegro M.C.

McClay D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 12-26Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One example of reserve secretory granules in sea urchin are the yolk granules. Despite their name, it appears that sea urchin yolk granules do not serve as a food source during early embryonic development, and their abundance is stable between fertilization and day 3 of development (24Scott L.B. Leahy P.S. Decker G.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Between day 3 and 7 of development, yolk granules disappear from the cytoplasm (24Scott L.B. Leahy P.S. Decker G.L. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 137: 368-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). During this same late period, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa, the major protein marker observed in the SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PIPES, piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid); Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor. profile of yolk granules, is deposited between the cells of the developing embryo, presumably via a secretory process (20Gratwohl E.K. Kellenberger E. Lorand L. Noll H. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A 160-kDa protein is the main constituent of a secreted protein complex, called toposome (17Noll H. Matranga V. Cervello M. Humphreys T. Kuwasaki B. Adelson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8062-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Matranga V. Kuwasaki B. Noll H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3125-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), responsible in part for cell-cell adhesion during sea urchin embryonic development (20Gratwohl E.K. Kellenberger E. Lorand L. Noll H. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The toposome complex has been isolated from sea urchin egg yolk granules (17Noll H. Matranga V. Cervello M. Humphreys T. Kuwasaki B. Adelson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8062-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and immunohistochemical study has localized it in these same granules (20Gratwohl E.K. Kellenberger E. Lorand L. Noll H. Mech. Dev. 1991; 33: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Indeed, electron microscopic analysis of yolk granules in the cells of sea urchin gastrula indicates that yolk granules can fuse with the plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner (25Armant D.R. Carson D.D. Decker G.L. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this study homogenates of both unfertilized and fertilized eggs were fractionated by free flow electrophoresis, a rapid separation technique that has been extensively used to purify intracellular vesicles (26Paulik M.

A fraction that contains reserve secretory granules was identified, and the requirements for fusion were determined using reconstitution. Eggs and sperm of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus were obtained by intracelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl. Eggs were collected in sea water and sperm were collected dry. Before homogenization, eggs were dejellied by several passes through 110-μm Nitex mesh and were washed three times in sea water. Fertilization was achieved by mixing eggs and diluted sperm (20:1, v/v in sea water) at a volume ratio of 50:1. Eggs were washed three times after isolation with GEHB buffer (1 m glycine, 5 mmEGTA, 5 mm HEPES titrated with Bis-Tris to pH 6.7) supplemented with 1 mm benzamidine and 1 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. Eggs were homogenized by six strokes of a Dounce homogenizer using the B pestle and kept at 4 °C prior to electrophoretic separation. A free flow electrophoresis apparatus (Octopus, Dr. Weber GmbH, Kirchheim-Heimstetten, Germany) providing marginal flows with high conductivity (31Bauer J. Weber G. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), modified to a chamber size of 500 × 100 × 0.3 mm, was used for homogenate separation. GEHB buffer was used as chamber buffer and GEHB supplemented with 50 mm HEPES and 50 mmBis-Tris were used as electrode and margin buffer. The optimal current for the electrophoretic separation of sea urchin egg granules was 80 mA, which was reached at a voltage across the chamber of 1000 V at 17 °C. The homogenate was injected into the separation chamber close to the cathode and separated at a flow rate of 700 ml/h. 96 fractions were collected after electrophoretic separation and the turbidity of each fraction was measured by absorbance at 405 nm in a Spectramax 250 microtiter dish reader to detect fractions containing granules. Free flow electrophoresis fractions containing granules were centrifuged onto glass coverslips as described previously (4Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips were placed in a perfusion chamber (32Shafi N.I. Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Methods. 1994; 6: 82-92Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), washed with PKME buffer (50 mmPIPES, pH 6.7, 425 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm benzamidine) and were observed by differential interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy. In some experiments PKME was supplemented with either ATP (2 mm), GTP (1 mm), ATPγS (2 mm), or GTPγS (1 mm). Fusion was triggered by perfusion with PKME buffer or nucleotide supplemented PKME buffer containing 316 μm free calcium (5Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments fusion was triggered by photo-releasing calcium from DM-nitrophen (“caged calcium”) (32Shafi N.I. Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Methods. 1994; 6: 82-92Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To reconstitute granule-plasma membrane fusion, sea urchin egg cortices were prepared as described previously (33Zimmerberg J. Sardet C. Epel D. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 2398-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but were treated with PKME containing 316 μmcalcium to trigger the fusion of any attached cortical granules. Next, granules from unfertilized eggs were labeled with the hydrophobic fluorescent marker octadecyl rhodamine B (1:1000 dilution of a 1 mm stock of octadecyl rhodamine B in ethanol), as described elsewhere (5Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and were centrifuged onto coverslips containing plasma membrane sheets in PKME buffer. Granules were imaged with a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 63 × 1.25 numerical aperture objective using both differential interference contrast optics and standard rhodamine epifluorescence optics on an upright Zeiss microscope. Reconstituted fusion of granules with sea urchin egg plasma membrane sheets was imaged using a Nikon Fluar 10 × 0.5 numerical aperture objective with a rhodamine filter set. Sea urchin egg cortices were prepared as described previously (33Zimmerberg J. Sardet C. Epel D. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 101: 2398-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic fractions of egg homogenates containing fluorescent endosomes were made from eggs fertilized in sea water containing fluorescent dextrans (34Whalley T. Terasaki M. Cho M.S. Vogel S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Caged calcium was released from DM-nitrophen in PK buffer (50 mm PIPES, 450 mm KCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmDM-nitrophen and 0.5 mm CaCl2, pH 6.7) as described previously (32Shafi N.I. Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Methods. 1994; 6: 82-92Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fraction C granules were fixed in 0.3% glutaraldehyde in PKME buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation in 3.0% glutaraldehyde. Granules were washed in Hendry's phosphate buffer and post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in the same buffer. The granules were then washed in distilled water and stained with saturated uranyl acetate for 15 min. Samples were dehydrated in a graded ethanol and acetone series. Dehydrated samples were embedded in Epon-Araldite and cured at 60 °C for 48 h. Cured blocks were ultrathin sectioned using a Leica Ultracut-UCT. Sections were stained with saturated uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and were observed in a Jeol 100CX transmission electron microscope. L. pictus eggs were fixed and stained as described previously (34Whalley T. Terasaki M. Cho M.S. Vogel S.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Homogenates of unfertilized and fertilized eggs were fractionated by free flow electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Two major fractions were isolated from homogenates of unfertilized eggs. The first fraction, A, contained small 0.77 ± 0.19-μm diameter (mean ± SD, n = 45) granules. The second fraction, C, contained larger granules (1.48 ± 0.25 μm diameter, n = 50). Upon fertilization, peaks A and C decreased in magnitude, and a new fraction, B, appeared between peak A and C. The exact migration distance of fraction B relative to fractions A and C was variable between preparations. Microscopic analysis of the fraction from unfertilized eggs corresponding in position to fraction B of fertilized eggs revealed a mixture of granules similar in size to those comprising fractions A and C. Occasionally, plasma membrane fragments with associated cortical granules were observed in fraction B. In contrast, aggregates of larger granules and occasionally plasma membrane sheets devoid of cortical granules were observed in fraction B isolated from homogenates prepared from fertilized eggs. Microscopic analysis of isolated sea urchin cortices from unfertilized eggs (data not shown) allowed us to measure the diameter of the plasma membrane docked cortical granules inL. pictus, 0.77 ± 0.21 μm (mean ± S.D.,n = 50). These were similar in size to the granules in fraction A, but were distinct from those in fraction C. To determine the origin of the components migrating in fraction B obtained from fertilized eggs we examined fractions of both fertilized and unfertilized eggs by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). The electrophoretic migration patterns of polypeptides from fractions A and C isolated from unfertilized eggs reveal that these fractions are composed of unique assemblies of proteins. Furthermore, fractions A and C are well resolved by free flow electrophoresis. While the SDS-PAGE pattern observed from egg homogenate is identical between unfertilized and fertilized eggs, following fertilization many of the proteins detected in fractions A and C are now found in fraction B. Reserve granules are by definition undocked granules resident in the cytoplasm but capable of being mobilized to migrate to the plasma membrane where they will ultimately fuse. The observation that some components resident in fraction C of unfertilized eggs migrate with fraction B of fertilized eggs suggests that some of these granules have been recruited into the large complexes observed in fraction B. We tested for calcium triggered fusion activity in fraction C by reconstitution in vitro. Granules were brought into close proximity by centrifugation onto glass coverslips. Next they were placed into PKME buffer which has a high concentration of Mg2+ (10 mm) but less than 1 μmfree calcium. We exposed fraction C granules isolated from either unfertilized or fertilized eggs to PKME buffer containing 316 μm free calcium. Upon perfusion with calcium, we observed the disappearance of high contrast edges between individual granules and the concomitant formation of larger refractile structures with high contrast edges (Fig. 3). These changes are consistent with the fusion of the membranes of these granules and the coalescence of their contents. When exocytotic granules fuse with each other they form larger structures called “fusosomes” (4Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The fusosomes formed by the fusion of fraction C granules were stable structures which were observed for several minutes after the addition of calcium. To verify that the reaction observed by differential interference contrast microscopy was actual membrane fusion, we labeled fraction C granules with octadecyl rhodamine B, a hydrophobic fluorescent membrane marker. Next, labeled granules were mixed with unlabeled granules and brought into close proximity by centrifugation onto glass coverslips. In calcium free buffer (prior to uncaging), dye transfer was not observed between labeled and unlabeled granules. Membrane fusion was triggered by the release of caged calcium and observed by differential interference contrast and fluorescent microscopy. Fig.4 shows a group of granules before and after the release of caged calcium. Differential interference contrast microscopy shows a group of granules coalescing to form a large fusosome upon exposure to calcium. Fluorescent microscopy reveals that the hydrophobic membrane marker resident in one of the granules has spread throughout the membrane of the newly formed fusosome and suggests that their membranes have merged. Reconstituted membrane fusion with fraction C granules did not require added ATP or GTP. There was no apparent change in the amount of fusion activity observed when ATP (2 mm) or GTP (1 mm) was added (data not shown). If nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for reconstitution, then incubation in nonhydrolyzable analogs of these nucleotides should not interfere with calcium triggered fusion. In Fig.5 we see that incubation in either ATPγS (2 mm), GTPγS (1 mm), or PKME buffer alone did not result in any significant inhibition of calcium triggered granule-granule fusion. Using video-enhanced microscopy, we counted the number of membrane delineated bodies observed to fuse after perfusion with calcium. We observed 50 ± 10% (mean ± S.E.,n = 12) fusion with calcium in PKME buffer, 44 ± 18% (n = 3) fusion with calcium in the presence of ATPγS, and 43 ± 22% (n = 4) fusion with calcium in the presence of GTPγS. Fusion was never observed in the absence of calcium; exposure to mm concentrations of Mg2+ in PKME buffer did not trigger fusion. Experiments using granules from any single preparation gave comparable amounts of fusion regardless of nucleotide treatment. We did however observe a significant amount of variability between preparations of granules in the amount of fusion observed between preparations of granules. To test if this variability was a function of the fraction of granules contacting other granules we plotted our PKME buffer fusion data as a function of the number of granules per μm2 (Fig.6). We observed a strong correlation between the density of granules and the fraction which fused in response to calcium. Above a density of 0.3 granules/μm2we observed that 78.9 ± 4.5% (n = 7) of fraction C granules fused upon exposure to calcium. Light microscopic and gel electrophoretic analysis of fraction C components support the view that fraction C is comprised of a homogeneous population of granules. If, however, fraction C was contaminated with a subpopulation of nonfusogenic components we might expect less than maximal membrane fusion. To test its homogeneity, we examined fraction C by thin section electron microscopy. Fig. 7 (bottom panel) reveals a population of granules which are homogeneous with regard to size. Granules fell into three general categories based on the density of staining. 9.2% were densely stained, 3.5% were lightly stained, and 87.3% were moderately stained. In comparison, thin section electron microscopy of L. pictus eggs revealed four classes of organelles that fell into the size range of 0.5–2.0 μm in diameter, mitochondria, yolk granules, acidic granules, and the cortical granules, which are found adjacent to the plasma membrane (Fig. 7, top panel). Yolk granules appeared identical to the fraction C granules and were also found to fall into roughly three categories based on the density of staining. Together these observations support the hypothesis that nucleotides are not required to reconstitute calcium triggered fusion and indicate that >85% of isolated fraction C granules are morphologically similar and at least 80% are fusion-competent.Figure 6Fusion efficiency is dependent of the density of granules. Granules isolated from fraction C of unfertilized eggs were pelleted onto glass coverslips and imaged by video microscopy. Slides were perfused with calcium-free PKME buffer. Slides were then perfused with PKME buffer containing 316 μmfree calcium to trigger fusion. The density of granules was determined by counting the total number of vesicles in the video field before perfusion with calcium, and the amount of fusion was determined by counting the number of vesicles that had fused at 2 min after calcium perfusion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Thin section electron microscopy of fraction C granules.

Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The formation of these highly curved lipidic stalks can be inhibited by the inclusion of lipids with an intrinsic curvature opposite to that which facilitates stalk formation. One such class of lipid, lysolipids, when introduced into the contacting monolayers of membrane fusion partners inhibit membrane fusion (35Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 36Zimmerberg J. Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 433-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Subsequent removal of lysolipids from these membranes lifts the block. Lysolipids are known to inhibit the exocytotic fusion of mast cells, chromaffin cells, and sea urchin egg cortical granulesin vitro (35Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 36Zimmerberg J. Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 433-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 37Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Exposing docked cortical granules to a pulse of buffer containing high calcium in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of lysolipid, was found to “activate” granules (38Vogel S.S. Leikina E.A. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25764-25768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When lysolipid was subsequently removed, granules were observed to fuse, even in the absence of calcium in the bulk solution. In contrast, isolated cortical granules when exposed to calcium were not “activated” (3Whalley T. Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1988; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data suggest that for calcium “activation,” granules must be tightly apposed to their target membrane during exposure to calcium. If the fusion of fraction C granules also proceeds by a “stalk mechanism,” lysolipids should reversibly inhibit membrane fusion in this system. Likewise, if the fraction C granules are tightly docked to each other after reconstitution, we might expect to observe calcium activation. Fig.8 shows four successive video fields of fraction C granules. Lysolipid (100 μm) by itself had no observable effect. The subsequent addition of calcium in the presence of lysolipid failed to trigger fusion. Removal of the calcium and subsequently of the lysolipid was also without effect. Subsequent addition of calcium in the absence of lysolipid did, however, trigger fusion, demonstrating that the block of membrane fusion was reversible. If fraction C granules are exocytotic granules, they should be capable of fusion with the plasma membrane of the egg. We labeled granules with octadecyl rhodamine B and centrifuged them onto the surface of a coverslip that contained large sheets of egg plasma membrane. Within seconds of exposure to calcium we observed an increase of fluorescence and dye transfer to these plasma membrane sheets (Fig.9). Granules which had alighted onto the surface of the glass coverslip did not change in fluorescence intensity. These observations are consistent with the dequenching of octadecyl rhodamine B (39Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and dye redistribution into the egg plasma membrane sheets, subsequent to granule-plasma membrane fusion. Granule localization on glass or plasma membrane was confirmed by fluorescent imaging after perfusion with PKME buffer containing the fluorescent membrane probe RH414 (1 μm) to visualize membrane sheets (data not shown). The main finding of this study is that 80% of isolated reserve secretory granules are fusion-competent when triggered by elevated concentrations of calcium. If this in vitro observation reflects the situation in the intact cell, then an important implication of this finding is that granule proteins responsible for triggered membrane fusion are already assembled and primed at a step prior to vesicle docking. Numerous yolk granule fusion complexes must be assembled at least 3 days prior to their physiological role in mediating the secretion of the toposome complex. One explanation for why reserve secretory granules would have preassembled and primed fusion complexes is that the granules may have an ancillary cellular function distinct from secretion. When the integrity of the plasma membrane is breached, cells can often repair the lesion (40Miyake K. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1737-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 41Krause T.L. Fishman H.M. Ballinger M.L. Bittner G.D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6638-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gallant P.E. Hammar K. Reese T.S. J. Neurocytol. 1995; 24: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recently the mechanism of membrane repair has been studied in sea urchin eggs (43Steinhardt R.A. Bi G. Alderton J.M. Science. 1994; 263: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 44Bi G.Q. Alderton J.M. Steinhardt R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the intact egg, the mechanism of membrane repair is thought to use rapid calcium-triggered membrane fusion. Yolk granules which can rapidly fuse with other granules and with the plasma membrane in vitro are good candidates for the source of membrane used to patch lesions in the egg in vivo. Together, these observations suggest that our reconstituted system does mirror important attributes of the intact cell. We used free flow electrophoresis to isolate vesicular fractions of sea urchin egg homogenates. The granules observed in fraction A of unfertilized eggs are of the same size as cortical granules, disappear following fertilization, and have a similar SDS-PAGE pattern as isolated cortical granules (45Vater C.A. Jackson R.C. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is likely that fraction A contains cortical granules which were dislodged from the plasma membrane during homogenization. The observation that many of the proteins associated with fraction A of unfertilized eggs migrate in fraction B prepared from fertilized eggs, and the fact that fraction B prepared from fertilized eggs contained exocytosis-associated endosomes, is consistent with cortical granule membrane proteins being retrieved by endocytosis into the membranes of large endosomes migrating in fraction B isolated from homogenates prepared from fertilized eggs. In contrast to fraction A, the granules in fraction C are distinct from the docked cortical granules observed on sea urchin egg plasma membrane fragments isolated from unfertilized eggs. First, these granules have a diameter of 1.48 ± 0.25 μm as opposed to the diameter of cortical granules, 0.77 ± 0.21 μm, in this species. Second, the protein composition of these granules is distinct from the composition of the cortical granules which migrate in fraction A (see Fig. 2) and from the published composition of sea urchin cortical granules (45Vater C.A. Jackson R.C. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Finally, these granules can be isolated from homogenates prepared from fertilized eggs in which cortical granules have already fused. Four lines of evidence suggest that the large 1.5-μm diameter granules observed in fraction C are reserve secretory granules. First, the morphology of fraction C granules as observed by electron microscopic analysis is identical to the unique morphology of sea urchin egg yolk granules (compare Fig. 7, top andbottom). Yolk granules have a characteristic homogeneous appearance with uniform dark staining (25Armant D.R. Carson D.D. Decker G.L. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). They also have small dark 10–50-nm subparticles (25Armant D.R. Carson D.D. Decker G.L. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These inclusions were observed in fraction C granules as well. Second, the major protein component observed in the SDS-PAGE profile of these large granules has an apparent molecular weight of 160 kDa. A 160-kDa protein is the main constituent of a secreted protein complex called toposome, which is also the most abundant protein in sea urchin yolk granules (17Noll H. Matranga V. Cervello M. Humphreys T. Kuwasaki B. Adelson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8062-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Matranga V. Kuwasaki B. Noll H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3125-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Comparison of the SDS-PAGE profile of the large granules we have studied (see Fig. 2,lanes C 1 –C 3) with the published SDS-PAGE profile of isolated yolk granules (45Vater C.A. Jackson R.C. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggests an identical pattern. Thus, based on their morphology and SDS-PAGE profile, it is likely that the granules we have isolated in fraction C are the cytoplasmic yolk granules responsible for secreting the cell adhesion toposome complex binding the cells of the developing embryo between day 3 and 7 of development. Third, like predocked cortical granules (2Crabb J.H. Jackson R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Whalley T. Whitaker M. Biosci. Rep. 1988; 8: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Vogel S.S. Zimmerberg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Vogel S.S. Chernomordik L.V. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25640-25643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these large granules can be reconstituted to fuse with other granules, or with the plasma membrane in a calcium dependent manner. Finally, some reserve granules should associate with the cytoskeleton after fertilization to allow those granules to translocate to the plasma membrane, dock, and fuse with the plasma membrane. Many of the large fraction C granules form aggregates upon fertilization consistent with association with the egg cytoskeleton upon egg activation. Calcium triggered membrane fusion in this system was reversibly inhibited by lysolipids. Thus, it is possible that fusion proceeds via stalk structures, the proposed membrane intermediate for several forms of biological membrane fusion reactions, including sea urchin cortical granule exocytosis, mast cell degranulation (35Chernomordik L.V. Vogel S.S. Sokoloff A. Onaran H.O. Leikina E.A. Zimmerberg J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and calcium triggered secretion in chromaffin cells (37Chernomordik L. Kozlov M.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). While calcium dependent fusion with fraction C granules can be reconstituted, exposing these granules to calcium in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of lysolipid did not result in any activated granules; fusion was not observed when calcium and then lysolipid were removed (see Fig. 8). This is in contrast to docked cortical granules which can be activated (38Vogel S.S. Leikina E.A. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25764-25768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and suggests that we have not reconstituted tight docking, perhaps because fraction C granules, as reserve granules, have never been docked with the plasma membrane. It is possible that fraction C granules may be missing key components which may be required for biological docking but which are not required for fusion. This is supported by the observation that yolk granules attached to egg plasma membrane sheets with 1/7 the efficiency of isolated cortical granules in an in vitrobinding assay (46Jackson R.C. Modern P.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the components required for biological docking may be different from the components responding to the experimental manipulations used to bring granule membranes into close juxtaposition in this study. Alternatively, the lack of activation with calcium in the presence of lysolipid might indicate a difference between homotypic fusion and heterotypic membrane fusion. It is not clear why 20% of isolated fraction C granules did not fuse under our reconstitution conditions. While it is possible that some granules fail to fuse because of the absence of limiting soluble factors, this seems unlikely because 1) addition of ATP, GTP, ATPγS, or GTPγS did not significantly alter the amount of fusion observed, and 2) incubation with an egg homogenate gave no significant increase in the amount of fusion observed when tested with a subsequent pulse of calcium (as compared with mock-treated granules, data not shown). Nonetheless, the majority of the reserve granule pool isolated from eggs can undergo rapid calcium-dependent membrane fusionin vitro. Thus, cellular components that respond to calcium, discriminate between calcium and magnesium, and can rapidly mediate membrane fusion must be present on these fusion-competent granules. This functional observation may have utility in identifying the molecular components required for calcium-triggered membrane fusion in this system; a candidate fusion protein should reside on these granules prior to docking. The ability of reserve granules to fuse with membranes in a calcium-dependent, nucleotide-independent manner is consistent with the observation that the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) driven release of α-soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) can precede docking and fusion in yeast vacuoles (47Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and it supports the hypothesis that the role played by the ATPase NSF may represent an early step in the exocytotic cascade (48Parsons T.D. Coorssen J.R. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) such as in priming granules for docking or fusion (11Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 335-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 49Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Because yolk granules are fusion-competent, ATP-dependent steps in secretion required to “prime” fusion complexes (50Holz R.W. Bittner M.A. Peppers S.C. Senter R.A. Eberhard D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5412-5419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Hay J.C. Martin T.F. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) must also take place prior to granule docking. It is possible that under certain conditions primed secretory components might become deprimed in the course of experimental manipulation. In this case, ATP might act as a cofactor to reprime these components, even subsequent to docking. This might explain why under some conditions calcium triggered exocytosis in sea urchin eggs can be preserved by the addition of ATP (52Baker P.F. Whitaker M.J. Nature. 1978; 276: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 53Sasaki H. Epel D. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

After our manuscript was submitted, a paper was published arguing that a critical element for calcium-dependent resealing of membrane disruptions in sea urchin eggs is the homo- and heterotypic fusion of yolk granules (Terasaki, M., Miyake, K., and McNeal, P. L. (1997) J. Cell Biol. 139, 63–74)."
https://openalex.org/W2093284796,"We investigated the biological significance of estrogen receptors (ER) in NIH3T3 cell transformation by the [12Val] K-Ras mutant. This mutant enhanced the steady state level of ER. Cells expressing mutant K-Ras (K12V cell) were tumorigenic. To determine the role of ER accumulation in Ras-transformed cells, we developed cells (KwtER cells) that overexpressed both wild-type (wt) K-Ras and ER, and found these cells were also tumorigenic. E2 stimulated the transcriptional activity by ER dominantly in K12V cells. However, only partial activation of ER by E2 was seen in KwtER cells. In the presence of 10% serum in media, the activation of ER appeared only in transformed KtwER and K12V cells, suggesting that two independently transmitted signals, the E2-ER binding and the ER-AF1 activation, are necessary for ER activation and that the dominant activation of ER might be involved in Ras-mediated cell transformation. Co-expression of progesterone receptor (PR) with mutant K-Ras led to suppression of tumorigenicity and inhibition of the activation of ER. The antisense oligomers complementary to the ER suppressed proliferation and transformed phenotypes of K12V cells.

CBFs contain a DNA-binding CBFα subunit and a non-DNA binding CBFβ subunit that increases the affinity of CBFα for DNA. We have developed a procedure for overexpressing and purifying full-length CBFβ as well as a truncated form containing the N-terminal 141 amino acids using a novel glutaredoxin fusion expression system. Substantial quantities of the CBFβ proteins can be produced in this manner allowing for their biophysical characterization. We show that the full-length and truncated forms of CBFβ bind to a CBFα·DNA complex with very similar affinities. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements show these proteins to be monomeric. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrates that CBFβ is a mixed α/β protein and NMR spectroscopy shows that the truncated and full-length proteins are structurally similar and suitable for structure determination by NMR spectroscopy.

The amino acid sequence of CBFβ yields few clues to its tertiary structure or the mechanism by which it modulates the affinity of the CBFα subunit for DNA. The heterodimerization domain in CBFβ has been localized to its N-terminal 135 amino acids, which corresponds to a region of significant homology between CBFβ and its twoDrosophila homologs, Brother (Bro) and Big Brother (Bgb) (13Golling G.

In humans, chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt the CBFA2 and CBFB genes are associated with a variety of leukemias, including de novo acute myeloid leukemias t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13;q22), t(16;16), and del(16)(q22), acute lymphocytic leukemias t(12;21)(p13;q22), and therapy-related leukemias and myelodysplasias t(3;21)(q26;q22) (10Liu P.

All of these translocations result in the synthesis of chimeric proteins, two of which have been directly demonstrated to block CBF function in a transdominant manner (23Yergeau D.A.

The primary structures of CBFβ and its Drosophila homologs are not similar to those of any other proteins, and the mechanism by which CBFβ stabilizes the CBFα·DNA complex is unusual. The CBFβ subunit is an essential component of the CBF complex and is mutated in a significant percentage of human leukemias, making it both an interesting and important target for biophysical and structural analyses. In this study, we describe a novel system for expressing the CBFβ subunit in bacteria and a purification protocol with which we can obtain large amounts of homogeneous CBFβ protein. We confirm that a truncated form of CBFβ, CBFβ(141), demonstrated previously to contain an intact heterodimerization domain (1Ogawa E. Inuzuka M. Maruyama M. Satake M. Naito-Fujimoto M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. Virology. 1993; 194: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), binds to CBFα with an affinity very similar to that of the full-length CBFβ(187) protein. The isolated heterodimerization domain in CBFβ(141) also assumes a folded structure indistinguishable from that which it assumes in the context of the full-length CBFβ(187) protein. We also demonstrate that both the full-length CBFβ(187) and truncated CBFβ(141) proteins are monomeric and contain a mixture of α-helical and β-strand secondary structural elements. The pGRXCBFβ141 plasmid encoding the glutaredoxin-CBFβ(141) fusion protein was constructed in the following manner. DNA sequence corresponding to Escherichia coli glutaredoxin-1 was polymerase chain reaction amplified from the plasmid pMG524-GRX (25Bjornberg O. Holmgren A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-CGGAATTCGGTTAAACCTACTTTCAGCG-3′ (S-GRX) and 5′-CGGGATCCCTTGTCATCGTCATCGGCGTCCAGATTTTCTTTCACC-3′ (AS-GRX). The sense primer (S-GRX) contains the recognition site for EcoRI at its 5′ end. The AS-GRX primer contains a restriction site forBamHI, followed by sequences encoding a cleavage site for the protease enterokinase (DDDDK). DNA encoding CBFβ(141) was amplified from the plasmid CBFβ(p21.5) (2Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) using the primers 5′-AGACGGATCCATGCCGCCGTCGTCCCGGAC-3′ (S-CBFβ141) and 5′-GGCCCAAGCTTTCACTGTTGTGCTAATGCATCTTCC-3′ (AS-CBFβ141). A restriction site for BamHI was included at the 5′ end of the sense primer (S-CBFβ141), and a HindIII site followed by a translational stop codon was added to the antisense primer (AS-CBFβ141). The polymerase chain reaction amplified fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pMG524. The resultant plasmid was transformed into the bacterial strain N99cI for the purpose of DNA characterization and sequencing and into strain N4830 or AR58 for protein expression. The pGRXCBFβ187 plasmid encoding the glutaredoxin protein fused to CBFβ(1–187) was generated by replacing theBamHI-HindIII fragment in pGRXCBFβ141 that encodes CBFβ(141) with a BamHI-HindIII fragment containing the open reading frame of CBFβ(1–187), which was excised from a previously described plasmid containing CBFβ(1–187) subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (2Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). A cleavage site for Factor Xa was subsequently introduced into this plasmid. Complementary oligonucleotides encoding a Factor Xa cleavage site flanked byBamHI sites (5′-GATCCATCGAAGGTCGTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCACGACCTTCGATG-3′) were annealed, phosphorylated, and subcloned into the BamHI site, between the enterokinase cleavage site and the open reading frame of CBFβ(187). The inserts in all plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. These plasmids are available upon request to the corresponding authors. E. coli AR58 were transformed with the pGRXCBFβ141 plasmid, and a single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of terrific broth (Sigma) containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. After overnight shaking at 200 rpm at a temperature of 29 °C, the culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of terrific broth (100 μg/ml carbenicillin). This culture was grown to an A 600 of 1.5 and then induced by raising the temperature to 40 °C and maintaining at this temperature for 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in an equal weight of 10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and frozen by dripping into liquid nitrogen. The frozen cells were stored at −70 °C. For expression of full-length CBFβ, pGRXCBFβ187 was transformed into E. coli AR58, and cells were grown in the identical manner as for CBFβ(141). For expression of 15N-labeled CBFβ(141) or CBFβ(187), E. coli AR58 transformed with the appropriate plasmid was grown in minimal medium containing15(NH4)2SO4 (Isotec, Inc.) as the sole nitrogen source. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Pefabloc (1 mm, Boehringer Mannheim), EDTA (1 mm), and lysozyme (0.4 mg/ml) were added to the thawed bacterial cell pellet from a 1-liter culture. The solution was stirred gently for 30 min, and the cells were then further lysed by four passages through a French press at 18,000 p.s.i. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 2.5 × 25-cm column of DEAE-Sephacel (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT at 1 ml/min and eluted from the column with a 1-liter linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing the fusion protein were identified by hydroxyethyl disulfide assay, which detects the enzymatic activity of the glutaredoxin system as described by Holmgren (26Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3664-3671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM3 membrane (Amicon, Inc.) to 15 ml. The DEAE pool was loaded onto a 2.5 × 113-cm column of Sephacryl S-100 (Pharmacia) in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer at 0.6 ml/min. The active fractions were again identified by 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide assay, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 15 ml. The resulting homogeneous fusion protein was cleaved by treatment with 90 units of enterokinase (Biozyme, San Diego)/A 280unit of fusion protein with addition of DTT to 0.5 mm and incubation at 30 °C for 20 h. The cleavage reaction was halted by addition of 0.5 mm Pefabloc. The resulting cleaved protein was exchanged into a lower ionic strength buffer (25 mm NaCl), loaded onto a 2.5 × 10-cm column of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 25–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer at 0.8 ml/min. The CBFβ fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 10 ml by ultrafiltration. From 1 liter of culture, a yield of 20 mg is typically obtained. For the15N-labeled protein used for NMR studies, the Q-Sepharose pool was loaded onto a 2.5 × 36-cm column of Sephacryl S-100 in 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% NaN3 and eluted at 0.8 ml/min. The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. The Grx-CBFβ(187) fusion protein was purified in the same manner as described above for the Grx-CBFβ(141) fusion protein. Following fractionation on DEAE-Sephacel and Sephacryl S-100, the resulting homogeneous Grx-CBFβ187 fusion protein was cleaved by treatment with 3.5 units of Factor Xa (Pharmacia)/A 280 unit of fusion protein in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and no DTT. Secondary cleavage at an undesired Factor Xa-sensitive site was minimized by carrying out the reaction for 6 h at 22 °C. The cleavage reaction was halted by addition of 4 mm Pefabloc with a subsequent 40-min incubation at 37 °C. The cleaved protein was exchanged into a lower ionic strength buffer (25 mmNaCl) by ultrafiltration, loaded onto a 2.5 × 10-cm column of Q-Sepharose in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mmEDTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient from 25 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer at 0.8 ml/min. The CBFβ(187) fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 4 ml by ultrafiltration. The concentrated protein was loaded onto a 2.5 × 113-cm column of Sephacryl S-100 (Pharmacia) in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 75 mm NaCl and eluted with the same buffer to separate the full-length protein from the product of the secondary cleavage reaction. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 15% Ready Gels from Bio-Rad with Coomassie staining as described by the manufacturer. Isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis was carried out on a Pharmacia Phast System using IEF 3–9 gels, and Coomassie staining was performed as described by the manufacturer. The molar extinction coefficients for the CBFβ(141) and CBFβ(187) proteins were calculated on the basis of the tryptophan, tyrosine, and cystine content of the proteins as described by Pace et al. (27Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3450) Google Scholar). A value of 18,500 m−1 cm−1 was calculated for both proteins. MALDI mass spectrometry was carried out by Dr. Gary Siuzdak at the mass spectrometry laboratory at the Beckman Center for Chemical Sciences, Scripps Research Institute. Samples were dialyzed into 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7), 0.5 mm DTT prior to analysis. To confirm the site of cleavage by enterokinase, N-terminal sequencing of the first five residues was carried out at the Biotechnology Resource Laboratory located at Yale University. A sequence of Xaa-Xaa-Met-Pro-Arg was obtained showing that cleavage had occurred at the correct site; however, the sequence of the first two amino acids was not determined with certainty. The affinities of CBFβ(141) and CBFβ(187) for a CBFα·DNA complex were measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The source of CBFα2 was an 41–214-amino acid fragment from the murine CBFα2 protein encompassing the DNA-binding Runt domain, expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (28Crute B.E. Lewis A.F. Wu Z. Bushweller J.H. Speck N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26251-26260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Basically, binding conditions were chosen such that the concentration of DNA was >10-fold above theK d of the CBFα2 Runt domain for the DNA site (∼1 × 10−8m DNA), and the concentration of active CBFα2 Runt domain was >10-fold below theK d of CBFβ for the CBFα2·DNA complex [5 × 10−10m CBFα2]. A fixed amount of DNA and the Runt domain, along with various amounts of CBFβ proteins, were used in binding reactions, and the complexes were resolved by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Assay conditions and methods for quantitation were the same as described previously (15Wang Q. Stacy T. Miller J.D. Lewis A.F. Huang X. Bushweller J.H. Boris J.-C. Alt F.W. Ryan G. Liu P.P.

The data are plotted as the percentages of CBFα2·CBFβ·DNA complexversus the concentration of CBFβ, and theK d is defined as the concentration of CBFβ at 50% saturation (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software). 100% ternary complex was defined as the point of saturation, and 0% ternary complex is taken from the background at the position in the absence of added CBFβ. High speed (29Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20 °C in a Beckman XL-l ultracentrifuge at rotor speeds of 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, and 30,000 rpm (CBFβ(141)) or 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 25,000 rpm (CBFβ(187)) using absorbance detection. For each sample, three cell loading concentrations were examined, from 0.25 to ∼1 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. Data were fit using NONLIN (30Johnson M.L. Correia J.J.

Partial specific volumes and solvent density (1.00960 g/ml) were calculated as described (31Laue T.M. Short Column Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis for Rapid Characterization of Macromolecules in Solution, Technical Information DS-835. Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA1992Google Scholar). For CBFβ(141), the calculated partial specific volume (0.7225 ml/g) was adjusted for the peptide charge (−3 at pH 7.5) by decreasing the molar volume 25 ml/mol charge to 0.7185 ml/g. An additional uncertainty of 0.004 ml/g in the partial specific volume was included when calculating the molecular weights (32Starovasnik M.A. Blackwell T.K. Laue T.M. Weintraub H. Klevit R.E.

For CBFβ(187), the calculated partial specific volume (0.7161 ml/g) also was reduced for its expected charge (−4 at pH 7.5) by 0.004 ml/g, and the same additional uncertainty was included in the molecular weight calculations. Circular dichroism spectra were collected at 20 °C on a Jasco 715 spectrometer calibrated using 10-camphorsulfonic acid. Mean amide Δε values were calculated using the known protein sequence. The protein solutions were dialyzed extensively against 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT prior to CD measurements. Quartz cells of 0.05 mm were used for measurements in the far ultraviolet (176–260 nm). The data were corrected by subtraction of a spectrum of the buffer alone. A total of eight scans were recorded at 1 nm resolution from 265 to 175 nm for both protein and buffer at a rate of 10 nm/min with a 16-s response time. The resulting data for 178–260 nm were fit using the variable selection protocol of Johnson and co-worker (34Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 35Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) using software provided by Dr. Johnson. Three proteins at a time were removed from the 33-protein data base, and the resulting 5456 combinations were examined for total percentage of secondary structure and root mean square error. Eleven combinations were finally selected, all of which had root mean square error values less than 0.20 (CBFβ(141)) and 0.25 (CBFβ(187)). All measurements were performed on a Varian UnityPlus 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded triple-resonance probe from Nalorac Corporation and pulsed field gradients. Measurements were carried out at 20 °C with solutions of the proteins in 25 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide, 5 mmDTT. 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded using the gradient sensitivity-enhanced HSQC sequence (36Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinern T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). The number of complex points and acquisition times for these experiments were15N (F1), 128 points, 79.3 ms and 1H (F2), 1024 points, 157 ms. For measurement of 15N T 1 andT 2 values, the pulse sequences of Farrowet al. (37Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) optimized for minimal saturation of water were employed. A recycle delay of 1.0 s was used between acquisitions to ensure sufficient recovery of NH magnetization (38Sklenar V. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 73: 375-379Google Scholar). 15NT 1 values were measured from spectra recorded with eight different durations of the delay: 44.4, 111.1, 222.2, 333.2, 555.4, 777.6, 999.7, and 1444.0 ms for CBFβ(141) and 44.4, 111.1, 222.2, 333.2, 444.3, 555.4, 666.5, 888.6, and 1333.0 ms for CBFβ(187). 15N T 2 values were measured from spectra recorded with delays corresponding to the duration of the CPMG sequence: 16.3, 32.6, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 97.7, 130.3, and 162.9 ms for CBFβ(141) and 16.3, 32.6, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 97.7, and 114.0 ms for CBFβ(187). To generate pure absorptive 2D line shapes, the N- and P-type signals recorded for each t 1 point were stored separately to carry out the necessary addition and subtraction of free induction decay and 90 ° phase correction as described previously (36Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinern T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). The necessary data manipulations were carried out using software written in-house. All other data processing was carried out using the program PROSA (39Güntert P. Dötsch V. Wider G. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 619-629Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The intensities of the peaks in the two-dimensional spectra were analyzed by measuring the peak heights using the integration routine in the program XEASY (40Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). The uncertainties in the measured peak intensities were set equal to the root-mean-square base-line noise of the spectra. The T 1 andT 2 values were determined by fitting the measured peak heights to the following two-parameter function:I(t)=I0exp−tT1,2Equation 1 in which I(t) is the intensity at timet and I 0 is the intensity at time zero. T 1 and T 2 values and uncertainties were determined by nonlinear least squares fitting of the experimental data points to the monoexponential decay given in Equation 1 using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm (41Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1986: 683-688Google Scholar) to minimize the χ2 goodness of fit parameter. The goodness-of-fit of the data to Equation 1 was evaluated by comparison of the calculated χ2 value with tabulated values of χ2 at 95% confidence level as described previously (42Palmer III, A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Crossref Scopus (597) Google Scholar). An initial estimate of the correlation time for CBFβ(141) and CBFβ(187) were obtained from a 10% trimmed mean of theT 1/T 2 ratio (43Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar) for those backbone amides with T 1 andT 2 values deemed adequate by the goodness-of-fit analysis described above. The biophysical and structural studies we wish to carry out to characterize CBFβ require large quantities of homogeneous protein.

It was found that the 5′ region extending approximately 85 base pairs (bp) upstream of the transcriptional initiation site served as the minimal DNA region that provided full relative promoter activity for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. This region of the gene also contains consensus sequences for liver-enriched transcription factors, C/EBPβ and HNF4, as well as for the ubiquitous protein factors, AP1, H4TF1, NF1, and Sp1. In vitro DNase I footprinting of the 200-bp proximal region of the promoter with a murine Hepa 1–6 cell nuclear extract revealed a clear footprint of a region corresponding to −80 to −28 bp of the murine fVII gene, suggesting that liver factors interact with this region of the DNA. Competitive gel shift and supershift assays with different synthetic oligonucleotide probes demonstrate that proteins contained in the nuclear extract, identified as C/EBPβ, H4TF1, and HNF4, bind to a region of the murine fVII DNA from 85 to 32 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Purified Sp1 also interacts with this region of the DNA at a site that substantially overlaps, but is not identical to, the H4TF1 binding locus. Binding of Sp1 to the mouse DNA was not observed with the nuclear extract as the source of the transcription factors, suggesting that Sp1 is likely displaced from its binding site by H4TF1 in the crude extract. In vivo dimethyl sulfate footprint analysis confirmed the existence of these sites and additionally revealed two other binding regions slightly upstream of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) binding locus that are homologous to NF1 binding sequences. The data demonstrate that appropriate transcription factor binding sites exist in the proximal promoter region of the murine fVII gene that are consistent with its strong liver-based expression in a highly regulated manner.

This latter activity is derived in part from the ability of fVIIa to activate the coagulation zymogens, fIX and fX to their respective enzymes, fIXa and fXa (1Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 2Bom V.J.J. van Hinsberg V.W.M. Reinalda-Poot H.H. Mohanlal R.W. Bertina R.M. Thromb.

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor serves to down-regulate this coagulation pathway by inactivating both fXa and the fVIIa·TF complex (3Broze G.J.J. Miletich J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1886-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Human fVII is synthesized in liver as a single-chain protein containing 406 amino acids. Activation of this zymogen occurs consequent to cleavage of the Arg152-Ile153 peptide bond. This step is catalyzed by fXa (4Radcliffe R. Nemerson Y. J. Biol.

Specifically, the light chain of fVIIa consists of a Gla-containing domain, followed by a short helical spacer region and two epidermal growth factor-like motifs. The functions of these modules are to provide binding sites for regulators of fVII activity, such as TF (11Toomey J.R. Smith K.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol.

Rosen E.D. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 957-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been established. Both of these genes contain approximately 12 kb, and include transcriptional and translation start sites, 5′-flanking transcriptional regulatory regions, and 3′-capping polyadenylation sites and polyadenylation enhancer elements. The positions of the introns in these genes are in identical locations, and splice the exonic regions that encode the protein domains. The human fVII DNA is organized in eight exons, with an optional exon in the leader peptide region. The murine fVII gene possesses seven introns and eight exons. The major transcriptional start site of murine fVII has been located nine nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation initiation site (16Idusogie E. Rosen E.D. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 957-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This short transcriptional initiator site in murine fVII presents a similar situation to that of the human gene, where in this latter case the major transcriptional start site was located 51 nucleotides 5′ of the translational initiation site (17Pollak E.S.

Although genetic deficiencies of human fVII have been reported, few patients present total fVII deficiency states. However, very low levels of this zymogen (<2% of normal) are associated with severe coagulation disorders (18Zimmermann R. Ehlers G. Ehlers W. von Voss H. Gobel U. Wahn U.

Other data suggest that fVII levels may be reciprocally involved in coronary heart disease, perhaps through a linkage with hypertriglyceridemia (26Lane A. Cruickshank J.K. Mitchell J. Henderson A. Humphries S. Green F. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 94: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The prospective Northwick Park Heart (27Meade T.W. Mellows S. Brozovic M. Miller G.J.

In addition, severe arterial thrombosis in a fVII-deficient patient was observed after infusion of fVII (21Escoffre M. Zini J.M. Schliamser L. Mazoyer E. Soria C. Tobelem G. Dupuy E. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 91: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), showing that even artificial elevation of fVII levels can result in thrombotic complications. To investigate the role of fVII in embryonic development and survival, mice were generated with a complete fVII deficiency (30Rosen E. Chan J.C.Y. Idusogie E. Clotman F. Vlasuk G. Luther T. Jalbert J. Albrecht S. Zhong L. Lissens A. Schoojans L. Moons L. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Carmeliet P. Nature. 1997; 390: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Unlike genetic deficiency of TF, which results in embryonic lethality at approximately 10.5 days post coitum, fVII-deficient mice develop normally. However, the fVII-deficient mice suffer severe perinatal lethality mainly from intra-abdominal bleeding. Those surviving birth expire within the next several weeks, primarily from intracranial bleeding (30Rosen E. Chan J.C.Y. Idusogie E. Clotman F. Vlasuk G. Luther T. Jalbert J. Albrecht S. Zhong L. Lissens A. Schoojans L. Moons L. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Carmeliet P. Nature. 1997; 390: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since human clinical data, as well as the fVII-deficiency state produced in mice, indicates that fVII activity levels are important in hemostatic and cardiovascular pathology, we undertook an investigation aimed at defining the factors that regulate transcription of the fVII gene. The results of this study constitute the present contribution. Recombinant transcription factors C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were gifts from Dr. Peter F. Johnson (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). Sp1 was a product of Promega (Madison, WI). The rabbit C/EBPβ polyclonal antibody was produced against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 258–276 of rat C/EBPβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 520–538 of human Sp1, a region with an identical sequence to the mouse protein. The NF-κB control polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 350–363 of human p50. HNF4 rabbit antiserum, raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 445–455 of rat HNF4, was obtained from Dr. Frances Sladek (University of California, Riverside, CA). Aprotinin and leupeptin were products of Sigma. Proteinase K was a product of Boehringer Mannheim. DNase I was obtained from Worthington. The expression vectors, pSV-β-gal control (C) vector and pCAT-control (C) vector, pCAT-enhancer (E) vector, and pCAT-basic vector were purchased from Promega. pSV-β-gal-C vector is a 6.8-kb plasmid containing the lacZgene, transcription of which is driven by the SV40 promoter/enhancer. pCAT-C vector is a 4.8-kb plasmid containing the CAT gene driven by the SV40 promoter/enhancer. pCAT-E vector is a 4.6-kb plasmid containing the SV40 enhancer, whereas pCAT-B vector is a 4.4-kb plasmid without the enhancer sequences. Mouse Hepa 1–6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained in DMEM containing 1.45 g of glucose/liter (Sigma), supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cultures were incubated at 6.6% CO2, 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere in 150-cm2 flasks. The cells were grown to confluence in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose. Mouse S194 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9159) Google Scholar). All solutions contained 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm). Protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay. Cell extracts were frozen in 100-μl aliquots and stored at −70 °C. pND95 is a 16.0-kb HindIII-NotI fragment generated from murine fVII λ genomic clone λE.80.11C (16Idusogie E. Rosen E.D. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 957-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was reinserted in the HindIII-NotI sites of pBSKII+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). This plasmid contains 7.0 kb of 5′-flanking sequences of the murine fVII gene and proceeds downstream through exon 5 of this gene. pND73 is a 2.0-kb NotI-BamHI fragment of λ clone λE.50.4A1 (16Idusogie E. Rosen E.D. Carmeliet P. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 957-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) subcloned in theNotI-BamHI sites of pBSKII+. The DNA insert of this plasmid contains 45 bp of the FIXII polylinker λDNA, 1.1 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the murine fVII gene, and 0.7 kb of the coding region of the gene, terminating at a location between genomic exons 1 and 2. A variety of plasmid inserts containing 5′ DNA sequences of the fVII gene were placed in the pCAT-E and pCAT-B plasmids. Different standard strategies with pND95 and pND73 were used for these purposes, employing both convenient restriction sites in the fVII 5′ genomic region and restriction sites cloned into the fVII 5′ region, as well as PCR amplifications with appropriate primers. These protocols generated plasmid inserts containing 7000 bp (pCAT-7000), 1100 bp (pCAT-1100), 200 bp (pCAT-200), 140 bp (pCAT-140), 97 bp (PCAT-97), 85 bp (pCAT-85), 56 bp (pCAT-56), 37 bp (pCAT-37), 19 bp (pCAT-19), and 4 bp (pCAT-4) beginning at the 5′-end and terminating at the ATG translation initiation codon. In addition, another plasmid, pCAT-900′, was generated that was derived from pCAT-1100, with a 200-bp deletion at the 3′ end of this segment. Nucleotide sequences were obtained for the fVII DNA inserts of all of these constructs, except for pCAT-7000. Adherent cells were washed three times with a solution of 0.05 msodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and harvested by incubating the cells for 5 min at room temperature with a buffer containing 0.04 m Tris-HCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 1.5m NaCl, pH 7.5. The cells were scraped from the bottom of the Petri dish with tissue culture cell lifter (Fisher) and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. After centrifugation for 1.5 min (10,000 rpm at 4 °C), the cells were resuspended in 0.25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7, and lysed by three cycles of liquid N2freeze-thaw steps. The cell debris were pelleted at 4 °C for 2.5 min at 10,000 rpm. One-third of the cell lysate was transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at −70 °C for β-galactosidase enzyme assays. The remaining cell lysate was heated at 60 °C for 10 min. The denatured proteins were pelleted for 2.5 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was stored at −70 °C for CAT assays. β-Gal assays using the substrate,p-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, were performed with protein extracts of transfected hepatocytes to quantify transfection efficiency. Assays for CAT activity were conducted with approximately 50 μg of cell extract protein in a 150-μl reaction mixture consisting of 35 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 μl [14C]chloramphenicol, 20 μl of acetyl-CoA (3.5 μg/μl), and an amount of water required to bring the reaction mixture to 150 μl. These components were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The extent of acetylation of the substrate was analyzed on thin layer chromatography plates (J.T. Baker) using a phosphorimager screen (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Normalizations of the CAT assays for transfection efficiencies were accomplished using the cotransfected β-gal activity. Oligonucleotides for mobility shift assays were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mm; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Promega). The binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing 50,000 cpm of the labeled probe, 1 μg of poly (dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), 12 μg of nuclear extract, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio, 19:1, w/w) in running buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.38 m glycine, 2 mmEDTA, pH 8.0). The samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 8 V/cm. The resulting gels were dried and exposed to the x-ray film with an intensifying screen overnight at −80 °C. In competition experiments, oligonucleotide competitors were added in the amounts indicated in the figure legends. Reactions containing recombinant C/EBPα (30 μg/ml) or C/EBPβ (26 μg/ml) contained 2.0 μl of the protein and 1.0 μl of normal rabbit serum/25 μl of binding reaction. Reaction mixtures with Sp1 included 1.0 footprint unit (fpu) of purified Sp1 (1 fpu is defined as the amount of Sp1 needed to give full protection against DNase 1 digestion on the SV40 early promoter). Sp1-containing mobility shift assays were performed on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). In supershift experiments, the antibodies were added 15 min after the initiation of the 30-min incubation period of the probe with the nuclear extract mixture. The sequences of double-stranded oligonucleotides used in the assays are as follows (the consensus sequences are indicated in bold lettering, the lowercase letters represent overhangs, the mutant sequences are indicated with an “m,” and the mutated bases are underlined): M7H4 (−44 to −66, mouse fVII promoter): gatcACCCCTCTCCCCTCCCCCCTGA; mM7H4: gatcACCTCTCTCTCCTCTCCTCTGA; HSp1 (−83 to −108, human fVII promoter): GTGTCCTCCCCTCCCCCATCCCTCT; mHSp1: GTGTCCTCCCCTCCACCATCCCTCT; M7HNF4: (−33 to −50, mouse fVII promoter): tcgaGGAGGGCAAAGGTCAGGG; HNF4 consensus (32Sladek F.M.

The DNase I footprint analysis was carried essentially as described (34Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). A quantity of 20 pmol of pCAT-200, containing 200 bp of the murine fVII promoter (−200 bp to −1 bp), was linearized with either restriction endonucleasesHindIII or XbaI, end-labeled as described above with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; ICN), and digested with the second enzyme to release the oligonucleotide insert. The 32P-labeled DNA was fractionated electrophoretically on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The 32P-labeled DNA insert was electroeluted from an excised gel slice, extracted with phenol/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v) followed by CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v), and precipitated by addition of 1 ml of 100% ethanol. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 50 μl of a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. An amount of 20,000 cpm of probe was incubated for 15 min on ice with 50 μg of nuclear extract protein in 50 μl of a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 2.0% polyvinyl alcohol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), in 10 mm sodium Hepes, pH 7.6. A volume of 50 μl of 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2was included in the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of 2 μl of a 0.016 mg/ml (or 0.0025 mg/ml for the control without nuclear extract) stock solution of DNase I (Worthington). The mixture was incubated for 1 min and followed by addition of 90 μl of DNase I stop buffer (1%, w/v, sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2 m NaCl, 250 μg/ml glycogen, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The samples were then digested with 10 μl of 2.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 5 min at room temperature. The solution was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated by addition of 1 ml of 100% ethanol. The samples were the resuspended in formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 1,500 cpm/μl, and a total of 5,000 cpm was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The corresponding murine fVII sequence generated by the Maxam and Gilbert method (35Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) was placed in a lane alongside the reactions. Methylation interference was conducted as described previously (34Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). A 30-bp fragment extending from bp −45 to bp −66 of the mouse fVII promoter was subcloned into the SmaI site of the pBSKII+ vector (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was linearized with either EcoRI orBamHI. A quantity of 20 pmol of plasmid was end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol), as described above. The labeled plasmid was then digested with the second enzyme to release the oligonucleotide insert. Labeled DNA was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. An amount of 1 × 107 cpm of labeled probe was mixed with 0.5 μl of DMS in 200 μl of DMS reaction buffer (50 mm sodium cacodylate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 2.5 min at room temperature. This was followed immediately by the addition of 40 μl of DMS stop buffer (1.5 m NaOAc, 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), 1 μl of 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA solution, and 600 μl of 100% ethanol. This solution was mixed and placed for 10 min in a dry ice/ethanol bath and microcentrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded. This step was repeated three times, and the final pellet obtained was dried and resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at 100,000 cpm/μl. Five standard gel shift reactions using either Hepa 1–6 nuclear extract or purified Sp1 were conducted as described above. Following electrophoresis, the gels were exposed to film overnight at room temperature. Gel slices containing the bound and free probe were removed. The probe was then electroeluted from the slices, extracted with phenol/CHCl3 (1:1, v/v), and precipitated with 100% ethanol. The probe was then incubated with 1m piperidine at 95 °C for 30 min, followed by three rounds of lyophilization, and resuspended in formamide loading dye (see previous section) at 1,500 cpm/μl. A total of 5,000 cpm was loaded onto a 12% sequencing gel for electrophoretic analysis at 1500 V for 1.5 h. The gel was exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. For footprinting the bottom (non-coding) strand, the following primers were employed: 1, 5′-ATATGGACATCCATCGGTGG; 2, 5′-TGTTCACACCTCCGGTCTGA; 3, 5′-CGGTCTGAGCCCACATTGCC. The primers used to footprint the top (coding) strand were: 4, 5′-TTCCTGTTGATGTCCCAGCT; 5, 5′-ACTCCGTGCACAGAGAAACC; 6, 5′-CCCTGGAGCTGGAGCAGAAA. For the unidirectional linker mix, the following oligonucleotides were used: 7, 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC; 8, 5′-GAATTCAGATC. Primers 3 and 6 were then end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Life Science) in the following manner. A concentration of 20 pmol of primer was combined with 2 μl of 10 × kinase buffer, 120 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA; 4500 Ci/mmol), and water to a final volume of 20 μl. A 1:10 dilution of polynucleotide kinase (30 units/ml) was prepared with kinase buffer, and 1 μl of this solution was added to the reaction tube. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, after which a second 1-μl aliquot of enzyme was added and incubation"

Since the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) is a common target of sequence-specific transcriptional activators, we suspected that RXR might regulate target genes via an interaction with TFIIB. Co-immunoprecipitation, far Western analysis, and glutathioneS-transferase binding studies indicated that murine RXRβ (mRXRβ) was capable of binding to human TFIIB in vitro. Functional analysis with a dual-hybrid yeast system and cotransfection assays revealed the interaction of mRXRβ with TFIIB to be ligand-dependent in vivo. Truncation experiments mapped the essential binding regions to the carboxyl region of mRXRβ (amino acids (aa) 254–389) and two regions in the carboxyl region of TFIIB (aa 178–201 and aa 238–271). Furthermore, the Δ390–410 mRXRβ mutant bound to TFIIB in vitro but was not active in the dual-hybrid yeast system, suggesting that the extreme carboxyl region of RXR was required for in vivo interaction with TFIIB. These data indicate that interaction of mRXRβ with TFIIB is specific, direct, and ligand-dependent in vivo and suggest that gene activation by RXR involves TFIIB.

Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the potential involvement of RXR in the function of many receptors, ligand-dependent transcription by the RXR must be tightly regulated to ensure that specific cellular responses are properly initiated (reviewed in Refs. 26Beato M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational states of the RXR ligand-binding domain (LBD) could determine the ability of the receptor to bind specific transcription factors in vivo. In a cell-free system, addition of RXR to the PIC reproducibly enhanced TFIIB·TBP complex formation (27Katzenellenbogen J.A. O'Malley B.W. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar); however, a RXR·TFIIB·TBP complex was not observed in native gel electrophoresis, suggesting thatin vitro the complex might be unstable. Since RXRs have been shown to bind proteins in the transcription complex, it is possible that RXRs might actively augment binding of receptor proteins to the transcription complex (i.e. not as a silent partner), perhaps in a holocomplex with CBP (29Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

In support of this mechanism, several proteins interact in a ligand-dependent manner with the carboxyl (AF-2 or τc) region of nuclear hormone receptors that heterodimerize with RXRs (21Halachmi S.

Also against an indirect or silent partner role for RXR is the observation that a dominant negative RXR mutant (e.g. ΔAF-2 or τc) could abrogate the ability of a heterodimer to augment gene activation (64Minucci S.

Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) or N-CoR (17Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

Similarly, an indirect mechanism of action does not explain the ability of RXR to function as a homodimer (68Medin J.A. Minucci S. Driggers P.H. Lee I.J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 105: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies have specifically revealed the ability of liganded RXR to alter the response of a heterodimer complex associated with DNA (63Minucci S. Leid M. Toyama R. Saint-Jeannet J.-P.

These observations suggest that RXRs may actively participate in assembly of the transcription complex.In an effort to clarify some of the molecular mechanisms of gene activation by RXRs, we have tested the interaction of the general transcription factor TFIIB with mRXRβ. Using several experimental approaches, we observed the association of mRXRβ with TFIIB to be ligand-dependent, specific, and direct. Furthermore, interaction required the carboxyl region of mRXRβ and two distinct regions within TFIIB. These data support the conclusion that RXR may contribute directly to the recruitment of essential transcription factors involved in ligand-dependent gene activation.DISCUSSIONSeveral nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to interactin vitro with the general transcription factor, TFIIB (10Ing N.H.

Using zero-length protein-DNA cross-linking, we have mapped histone-DNA contacts in isolated core particles at ionic conditions affecting DNA stiffness, which may change the nucleosomal DNA conformation. We found that the alterations in histone-DNA contacts induced by an increase in DNA stiffness in isolated core particles are identical to those observed in nucleosomes during chromatin unfolding. The change in the pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion of linker histone-depleted chromatin at ionic conditions affecting chromatin compaction also suggests that the stretching of the linker DNA may alter the nucleosomal DNA conformation, resulting in a structural transition in the nucleosome which may play a role in rendering the nucleosome competent for transcription and/or replication.

A number of reports have suggested that the nucleosome structure in active chromatin is changed (12Prior C.P. Cantor C.R. Johnson E.M. Littau V.C. Allfrey V.G.

Mendez E. Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. Allfrey V.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since only a few experiments have distinguished between transcriptionally competent and actively transcribed chromatin (3van Holde K.E. Lohr D.E. Robert C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2837-2840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Morse R.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), very little is known about the structural details of these changes. Transcriptionally active chromatin is unfolded and significantly depleted of linker histones (16Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which play a key role in chromatin compaction (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 18Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 365-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that certain histone-DNA contacts in the nucleosome core are heavily attenuated during chromatin unfolding (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating that the nucleosome structure is changed at the first step of chromatin activation, chromatin decondensation. These changes may facilitate the second step, which involves either remodeling or removal of the nucleosome. The binding of histone H1 to linker DNA considerably reduces its electrostatic free energy which determines linker DNA bending during chromatin folding into the higher order structure (20Clark D.J. Kimura T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In contrast, in linker histone-depleted chromatin, the distance between the points where the linker DNA enters and leaves the nucleosome core may be increased by repulsion between adjacent linker DNA segments (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar,21Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Revet B. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and thereby can affect the conformation of the nucleosome core DNA. To address the question of whether or not the alterations in histone-DNA contacts during chromatin unfolding, which we observed earlier (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), are caused by the changes in the nucleosome core DNA conformation, we have analyzed the histone-DNA contacts in isolated core particles under ionic conditions affecting DNA stiffness. Several physical and biochemical studies have demonstrated that a reduction of the monovalent ion concentration below 10 mmhas a significant effect on the nucleosome core structure (reviewed in Ref. 25van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, NY1989Crossref Google Scholar). It has also been well documented that the loss of counter-ions at low ionic strengths increases the electrostatic repulsion of unneutralized DNA phosphate groups, resulting in an increase in DNA stiffness (26Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). This increase in the stiffness may cause stretching of the nucleosomal DNA that in turn may change the conformation of the nucleosome (27Marky N.L. Manning G.S. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1543-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and affect histone-DNA contacts. In the present paper, we show that the alterations in histone-DNA contacts in isolated core particles induced at low ionic strength are caused by a decrease in the neutralization of negative DNA charges and are identical to those observed in nucleosomes during chromatin unfolding (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggests that the conformational changes in nucleosome core particles at low ionic strength and in nucleosomes in chromatin during chromatin unfolding are due to the stretching of the nucleosome core DNA. Based on these observations, we propose a model for the reversible structural transition yielding a new nucleosome conformation in an unfolded chromatin. Nucleosome core particles were isolated from chicken erythrocyte nuclei as described previously (28Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V. Bavykin S.G. Mirzabekov A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 491-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Bavykin S.G. Usachenko S.I. Lishanskaya A.I. Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V. Undritsov I.M. Strokov A.A. Zalenskaya I.A.

Protein-DNA cross-linking under various ionic conditions, purification, and histone-labeling of cross-linked complexes with 125I were performed as described (30Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. Gavin I.M. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsky A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V.

Linker histone-depleted chromatin prepared from chicken erythrocyte nuclei as described earlier (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was digested with micrococcal nuclease (3 μg/1 mg of DNA) in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and either 0.3 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2 for the time course of 20, 40, and 80 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 4 mm. DNA from nucleosomes released by the micrococcal nuclease digestion of linker histone-depleted chromatin was analyzed in a 9% denaturing gel containing 7m urea following digestion with Pronase (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C (32Maniatis T. Jeffrey A. van deSande H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3787-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Histone-DNA contacts were mapped by the “protein version” of two-dimentional gel electrophoresis of 125I-histone-labeled cross-linked complexes as described earlier (31Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsky A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For the qualitative analysis of relative intensities of certain signals, the autoradiographs of two-dimensional gels from at least three sets of experiments were scanned in a SL-504-XL Zeineh soft laser scanning densitometer (Biomed Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA). To study the histone-DNA interactions in isolated core particles under different ionic conditions, we used the method of chemically induced zero-length protein-DNA cross-linking (31Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsky A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cross-linking causes a single-stranded nick of the nucleosomal DNA at the site of cross-linking such that only the 5′-terminal DNA fragment becomes attached to a histone molecule (33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Therefore, the length of the DNA fragment cross-linked to a particular histone is the precise distance of a protein cross-linking site from the 5′-end of the nucleosomal DNA and can be assessed by the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To map the histone-DNA contacts in nucleosome core particles under different ionic conditions, we have used a protein version of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system (31Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsky A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the denaturing first dimension SDS gel, the mobility of125I-labeled histone-DNA cross-linked complexes depends on the molecular weight of the histones and the size of the cross-linked DNA fragment. After separation of cross-linked complexes in the first dimension, the DNA is hydrolyzed directly in the gel according to a modified Burton's procedure (31Mirzabekov A.D. Bavykin S.G. Belyavsky A.V. Karpov V.L. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Shick V.V. Ebralidse K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 386-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Burton K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12: 222-224Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and released125I-labeled histones are separated in the second dimension SDS gel (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) according to their size. In the first dimension, the mobility of histones is decreased proportionally to the size of DNA fragments cross-linked to a particular histone (33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As a result, in the gel of the second dimension, the 125I-labeled histones are arranged as spots on different horizontal lines (Figs.1 and 2). The position of these spots indicates the location of the DNA cross-linking site for a particular histone in the nucleosome (33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Figure 2The effect of divalent cation concentrations on the strength of histone H2B/H4-DNA contacts attenuated at low ionic strength. The concentrations and type of divalent cations are indicated in the upper right corner of each gel. For other details see text and legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The qualitative analysis of two-dimensional gels shown in Fig. 1revealed that the position of signals corresponding to histone-DNA contacts in core particles cross-linked in the range of decreasing ionic strengths from 100 to 2 mm NaCl is the same. However, relative intensities of some signals vary. In this work, using densitometric analysis, we qualitatively assessed the variation in histone H2B and H4 signal intensities representing the extent to which a particular histone is cross-linked to a particular site of the nucleosomal DNA. The main cross-linking sites on the nucleosomal DNA for histone H2B are around nucleotides 109, 119, and 129 and for histone H4 are around nucleotides 57, 66, and 93 from the 5′-end of the nucleosomal DNA (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Bavykin S.G. Usachenko S.I. Lishanskaya A.I. Shick V.V. Belyavsky A.V.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To estimate the extent of variation in these contacts, we compared their relative intensity within the same histone line and within the same gel because, as shown previously, such a comparison prevents ambiguity caused by choosing the reference spot at different exposures of different gels (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Usachenko S.I. Bavykin S.G. Gavin I.M. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The data represented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that by decreasing the concentration of Na+ from 100 to 2 mm, the relative intensities of the above-mentioned signals vary, showing a gradual attenuation of contacts H2B(129) and H4(66) compared with contacts H2B(109) and H4(57), respectively (numbers in parentheses indicate the distance in nucleotides from the 5′-end of one strand of nucleosome core DNA to the particular histone contact). It should be mentioned that the same alterations in the same histone-DNA contacts were observed recently as a result of the stretching of a linker DNA during chromatin unfolding in linker histone-depleted chromatin (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This indicates that an increase in the nucleosomal DNA stiffness, induced by low ionic strength, affects the analyzed histone-DNA contacts in isolated core particles much the same as the stretching of linker DNA during chromatin unfolding and suggests similar changes in the conformation of the nucleosomal DNA, which may result in the structural transition of the nucleosome (27Marky N.L. Manning G.S. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1543-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggestion is supported by the recent observation of an alteration in the shape of core particles from the oblate to the prolate form at the same low salt concentrations (36Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3677-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The elevation of salt concentration causes electrostatic blocking of DNA phosphate groups, which depends on the charge of cations (26Manning G.S. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 179-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). The experimentally measured persistence length of DNA increases rapidly when the concentration of monovalent cations is decreased below 10 mm, whereas the same effect for divalent cations was observed at concentrations below 0.1 mm (37Hagerman P.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 265-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, our data, represented in Fig. 2, demonstrate a similar change in the relative intensities of the analyzed contacts after the addition of divalent cations at 2 orders of magnitude less concentrations than monovalent cations. The weak intensity of contacts H2B(129) and H4(66) in 5 mm HEPES (Fig. 2 A) is noticeably increased upon addition of 0.1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 2 B). A further increase in the concentration of divalent cations up to 2 mm causes an additional increase in the intensities of contacts H2B(129) and H4(66) (Fig. 2 C). The relative intensities of the analyzed contacts at 100 and 30 mmmonovalent cations (Fig. 1, A and B) resemble those at 2 and 0.1 mm divalent cations, respectively (Fig.2, B and C) confirming previous observations that monovalent cations affect the nucleosome structure at approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher concentrations than divalent cations (36Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3677-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,38Libertini L.J. Small E.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3327-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 39Wu H.-M. Dattagupta N. Hogan M. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3960-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We also tested various monovalent and divalent cations, such as K+, Li+, Cs+, Mg2+, Zn2+ for their ability to change histone H4/H2B contacts, and as expected, different cations that have the same charge had an identical effect on the analyzed contacts at the same concentrations. Cross-linking analysis also reveals that anions have no impact on the conformational transition induced by low ionic strength (not shown). Obtained results suggest that the conformational transition, observed as alterations in relative intensities of histone H2B/H4-DNA contacts at low ionic strength, is caused by the repulsion of adjacent unneutralized negative charges of DNA phosphate groups resulting in an increase in DNA stiffness. The level of chromatin compaction induced by 1–2 mm divalent cations is similar to that observed at physiological concentrations of monovalent cations (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 18Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 365-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An increase in the salt concentration also results in folding of linker histone-depleted chromatin and bending of linker DNA (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 40Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stanik V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 41Yao J. Lowary P.T. Widom J.

To investigate how this salt-induced chromatin condensation might change the nucleosome conformation, we have analyzed the pattern of micrococcal nuclease digestion of linker histone-depleted chromatin at different concentrations of divalent cations (Fig.3). The first time point in the course of digestion at 0.3 mm Ca2+ yields nucleosome core particles with 146-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s). DNA represented in the gel by a single band (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). These nucleosomes are further digested to the level of subnucleosomes (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and3). In contrast, the first time point at 2 mmCa2+ yields a set of core particles and particles with 157- and 168-bp DNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 1), which then turn into particles with 146-bp DNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The bending of linker DNA induced by 2 mm divalent cations (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 43Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) facilitates the wrapping of an additional ∼20-bp DNA around the histone octamer (21Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Revet B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Zivanovic Y. Duband-Goulet I. Schultz P. Stofer E. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This renders linker DNA regions less accessible to micrococcal nuclease yielding nucleosomes with 157- and 168-bp DNA (Fig. 3 B). The interaction of core histones with the end regions of nucleosomal DNA in particles with 155- and 165-bp DNA at monovalent salt concentrations above 30 mm has been demonstrated by protein-DNA cross-linking in isolated chromatin (44Belyavsky A.V. Bavykin S.G. Goguadze E.G. Mirzabekov A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 139: 519-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), in nuclei (45Bavykin S.G. Usachenko S.I. Zalensky A.O. Mirzabekov A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and in H1-depleted nucleosomes (46Davies N. Lindsey G.G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1129: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, at concentrations of divalent cations below 0.3 mm, linker DNA is stretched (17Thoma F. Koller Th Klug A. J. Cell. Biol. 1979; 83: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) such that the end regions of the nucleosomal DNA become susceptible to micrococcal nuclease. As a result, nucleosomes with 157- and 168-bp DNA are not observed under these conditions (Fig.3 A). It has been shown that micrococcal nuclease activity is only slightly reduced in 0.3 mm Ca2+ compared with 2 mm Ca2+ (47Cuatrecasis P. Fuchs S. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1541-1547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the specificity of the enzyme remains the same (48Afinsen C.B. Cuatrecasas P. Tanguchi H. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. IV. Academic Press, NY1971: 177-204Google Scholar). This indicates that the observed difference in micrococcal nuclease digestion pattern reflects the change in the chromatin structure rather than the activity of the micrococcal nuclease, which is supported by early studies where a similar effect was observed at various concentrations of monovalent cations (49Weischet W.O. Allen J.R. Riedel G. van Holde K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 1843-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 50Ruiz-Carrillo A. Jorcano J.L. Eder G. Lurz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3284-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have demonstrated that a structural transition in isolated core particles induced by low concentrations of monovalent cations is caused by the change in the nucleosomal DNA conformation that alters the analyzed histone H2B/H4-DNA contacts. These altered contacts are located at sites ± 5.5 and ± 1 (Fig.4), which are very close to the sharply bent regions of the nucleosomal DNA (51Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F.

Dyn. 1989; 6: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the change in nucleosomal DNA conformation induced by low ionic strength in isolated core particles or by the stretching of linker DNA during chromatin unfolding can in turn affect histone interactions with these DNA sites. Since the analyzed contacts are located close to the sharply bent DNA regions, they would be expected to be very sensitive to conformational changes in the nucleosomal DNA.

A. 1994; 91: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that histone H4 cross-links via His-18 to three major sites, at nucleotides 57, 66, and 93, which are extended over 1.2 helical turns of the nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 4). The cross-linking domain of histone H4 has divergent structure within the nucleosome core (51Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar), suggesting that these contacts may be formed by different histone H4 molecules, which may cross-link to two discrete sites at a given time: to nucleotide 66 around site ± 1 and to nucleotides 57 and/or 93 due to the oscillation of His-18 through the minor groove of the nucleosomal DNA around site ± 2 (Fig. 4). This is supported by our observations that the relative intensities of contacts H4(57) and H4(93) are not changed at low ionic strength (Fig.Figure 1, Figure 2) and during chromatin unfolding (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The change in the nucleosome conformation induced by low ionic strength or chromatin unfolding may affect the local interaction of the DNA-binding domain of histone H4 with nucleotide 66 and would result in a less intensive cross-linking of its His-18 to this DNA site. The highly basic N-terminal domain of histone H2B also cross-links to nucleosome DNA (59Guschin D.Yu. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D. J. Molec. Biol. 1991; 25: 1400-1411Google Scholar); however, it is still unknown whether the observed contacts are formed by the same domain or by different regions of histone H2B. The crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle recently resolved at 2.8 Å resolution suggests that loop 2 of histone H2B contacts DNA around sites ± 3.5 while loop 1 makes contact around sites ± 4.5 (51Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). Since the methodology used in this study detects protein-DNA cross-linking mainly through histidine residues (33Pruss D. Bavykin S.G. Methods. 1997; 12: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it is possible that histidine 79 at the C terminus of α-helix 2 cross-links to the DNA site at nucleotide 109 while histidine 46 located in the loop 1 cross-links to the site around the 129th nucleotide. Straightening of the nucleosomal DNA at low ionic strength or during chromatin unfolding may affect the interaction of the end fragments of the nucleosomal DNA with loop 1 of histone H2B, resulting in the loss of histone H2B cross-linking to nucleotide 129. Two models for the conformational transition of a nucleosome core caused by the straightening of the nucleosomal DNA have been proposed (27Marky N.L. Manning G.S. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 1543-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the model for a radial transition, the nucleosomal DNA straightening increases radius of gyration resulting in an oblate conformation of the nucleosome core. In the case of an axial transition, DNA straightens along the superhelical axis and thereby stretching the nucleosome core into the prolate form. Recent observations of the altered core particle shape to a prolate form (36Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3677-3683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that have a decreased (36Czarnota G.J. Ottensmeyer F.P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1983; 133: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) radius of gyration at concentrations of monovalent cations below 30 mm provide strong support for the second model. This model is also in agreement with the expected repulsion of adjacent superhelical turns of the nucleosomal DNA induced by low salt concentrations, which also tends to stretch the core particle in the direction of the superhelical axis. The axial straightening of DNA may also cause deformation of the histone octamer, which is consistent with the observed alteration in the histone octamer compaction with decreasing ionic strength from 30 to 10 mm NaCl (62Chung D.G. Lewis P.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8028-8036Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on the results of this work and the observations of other investigators, we suggest a model for the structural transition of the nucleosome core that may occur during chromatin unfolding (Fig.5). In condensed chromatin, the linker DNA is bent such that the histone octamer interacts with an additional 20 bp of DNA (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, during chromatin decondensation after depletion or rearrangement of linker histones, stretching of the linker DNA may increase DNA tension along the polynucleosomal chain and change the nucleosome conformation in a way similar to that observed for isolated core particles at monovalent salt concentrations below 10 mm. This stretching would cause partial sliding of DNA off the histone octamer and make the additional 20-bp accessible to micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 5 B). This model is also consistent with the observed salt-dependent release of nucleosomal DNA termini resulting in the change in the linking number of DNA in minichromosomes (21Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Revet B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Zivanovic Y. Duband-Goulet I. Schultz P. Stofer E. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in the altered nucleosome morphology in linker histone-depleted chromatin (21Goulet I. Zivanovic Y. Prunell A. Revet B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Zivanovic Y. Duband-Goulet I. Schultz P. Stofer E. Oudet P. Prunell A. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 257: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The association of the alterations in the analyzed histone H2B/H4-DNA contacts with the level of chromatin compaction and activity demonstrates the importance of these changes in chromatin structural/functional relationships (19Usachenko S.I. Gavin I.M. Bavykin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3831-3836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The alterations in the contacts formed by the highly basic histone domains may result in destabilization of the nucleosomes in unfolded chromatin facilitating nucleosome remodeling or/and removal during transcription and replication. This is strongly supported by the observation that a deletion of the histone H2B cross-linking domain changes the minichromosome topology in vivo, suggesting that this domain is required for the proper folding of DNA in the nucleosome (63Lenfant F. Mann R.K. Thomsen B. Ling X. Grunstein M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3974-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

It should be mentioned also that the cross-linking domain of histone H4 contains sites for post-translational acetylation and phosphorylation (76Wu R.S. Panusz H.T. Hatch C.L. Bonner W.N. CRC Crit. Rev.

The cellular response to histamine is subject to dynamic control, and exaggerated histamine reactivity in response to cysteinyl leukotrienes and other stimuli is important in a variety of different pathological conditions. The molecular mechanisms controlling histamine responsiveness are still unresolved. In investigating histamine responses in embryonic stem (ES5) and F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, we encountered a novel mechanism controlling the cellular reaction to histamine. Unstimulated cells displayed neither [3H]pyrilamine binding nor histamine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Pretreatment of these cells, however, with leukotriene D4, leukotriene E4, serotonin, or fetal calf serum induced an immediate and transient ability of these cells to respond to histamine with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This effect could be inhibited by pertussis toxin and was mimicked by GTP analogues. Importantly, the latter compounds also provoked immediate high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding. We conclude that in these cells histamine responsiveness is directly controlled by pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors, whose activation enables the H1 receptor to bind its ligand.

Histamine, a biogenic amine formed by decarboxylation of the amino acid l-histidine (1Werle E. Biochem. Z. 1936; 288: 292-293Google Scholar), is found in large quantities in most tissues, mainly in the granules of mast cells, although numerous other cell types are capable of histamine synthesis as well (2Kahlson G. Rosengren E. Physiol. Rev. 1968; 48: 155-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Histamine controls a multitude of physiological functions by activating specific receptors on target cells. Three types of receptors for histamine have been described, denominated as the H1, H2, and H3 receptor and are distinguished on the basis of their sensitivity to specific agonists and antagonists (3Leurs R. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 66: 413-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In general, the H3 receptor is implicated in autoinhibition of histamine synthesis and release and the H2 receptor in gastric acid secretion, whereas the H1 receptor is involved in inflammatory responses, mediating for instance blood vessel and bronchial constriction, vascular permeabilization, and synthesis of other inflammatory agents (4Hill S.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 45-83PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine receptors are subject to dynamic regulation, receptor activity being increased or diminished in response to various conditions (5Smit M.J. Bloemers S.M. Leurs R. Tertoolen L.G.J.

Inhalational challenge with these inflammatory eicosanoids increases histamine responsiveness of the airways (8Kern R. Smith L.J. Patterson R. Krell R.D. Bernstein P.R. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 133: 1127-1132PubMed Google Scholar, 9Arm J.P. Spur B.W. Lee T.H. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1988; 82: 654-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Kaye M.G.

Walters E.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, other signaling molecules stimulate histamine responsiveness. Especially serotonin, platelet-activating factor, and thromboxanes are known to enhance histamine reactivity (14Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Iwami T. Nagai H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1994; 51: 95-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Gerthoffer W.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 800-807PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms, however, by which such stimuli can provoke increased histamine responsiveness have remained obscure.In the present study we describe a molecular mechanism by which external stimuli can enhance histamine reactivity by directly controlling the affinity of the histamine H1 receptor for its ligand. We have reported earlier that the P19 embryo carcinoma (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, embryo carcinoma; ES, embryonic stem; FCS, fetal calf serum; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [3H]pyrilamine, [pyridinyl-5-3H]pyrilamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: EC, embryo carcinoma; ES, embryonic stem; FCS, fetal calf serum; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [3H]pyrilamine, [pyridinyl-5-3H]pyrilamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). cell, a pluripotent cell type resembling the inner cell mass of the embryo, expresses functional histamine H1 receptors (16Bloemers S.M. Leurs R Smit M.J. Verheule S. Tertoolen L.G. Timmerman H. de Laat S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 191: 118-125Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although its function with respect to embryogenesis is not clear. To obtain more insight into the function of histamine receptor expression in uncommitted cells, we decided to investigate the presence of cellular responses to histamine in other pluripotent cells. We observed that F9 EC cells and embryonic stem (ES5) cells displayed neither high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding nor histamine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. A pretreatment of these cells with cysteinyl leukotrienes, serotonin, or FCS, however, induced an immediate and transient ability of these cells to react to histamine. This effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin and was mimicked by GTP analogues. Importantly, induction of histamine responses coincided with the appearance of high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding sites on these cells. Apparently pertussis toxin-activating agents can regulate histamine responses by inducing high-affinity binding sites for histamine. These findings define for the first time a molecular mechanism by which cysteinyl leukotrienes and other external stimuli can increase histamine responsiveness and identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors.DISCUSSIONIn the present study we show that H1 receptor signaling in F9 EC cells and ES5 cells required prestimulation of the cells with either fetal calf serum, serotonin, leukotriene D4, or leukotriene E4, whereas bradykinin and ATP did not produce this effect. This sensitizing effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin, whereas it was mimicked by GTPγS and AlF4−. Therefore, pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are probably mediating this regulation of H1 receptor action. The molecular basis for the induction H1receptor responsiveness appears to be the appearance of high affinity ligand binding sites, as control cells did not display high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding, but introduction of GTPγS or treatment with AlF4− immediately provoked such high affinity [3H]pyrilamide binding sites. These findings strongly suggest that histamine responses in these cells are controlled by agents that induce high affinity binding sites for histamine and define a molecular mechanism by which external stimuli can control histamine H1 receptor action.The molecular details, however, by which external stimuli enable the H1 receptor to interact with its ligand, remain unclear. An explanation for the impaired H1 receptor function in unstimulated cells may be a physical impossibility for histamine to interact with its receptor. Generally, receptors may be continuously recycled between plasma membrane and endosomes. Although this process has not been reported for H1 receptors, it has been found to occur with several other G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. Ref. 22Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the H2 receptor (7Smit M.J. Roovers E. Timmerman H. Van de Vrede Y. Alewijnse A.E. Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and some of the signaling elements involved have been identified (e.g. Refs. 23Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar and 24Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that in cell types that require sensitization for histamine responsiveness, the balance between endosome and plasma membrane localization is shifted to the endosomal state, and that sensitization releases this shift. Such a scheme would imply that in unstimulated F9 EC and ES5 cells the large majority of histamine receptors has an endosomal location. In other cells types, however, which show unconditional histamine responses, the balance between endosomal and plasma membrane-localized receptors should be shifted in favor of a plasma membrane location. In this context it is interesting to note that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins have been implicated in the stimulation of vesicle fusion (e.g. Refs. 25Lang J. Boulay F. Li G.D. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2671-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Vitale N. Thierse D. Aunis D. Baden M.F. Biochem.

Northrop A.J. Mason W.T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism, however, can not explain the absence of high affinity binding of [3H]pyrilamine in whole cell membrane preparations of uninduced F9 EC cells, prompting alternative explanations for induction of histamine responses in these cells.Therefore, control of the histamine response by SH-FCS, leukotrienes, and serotonin may be mediated by the induction of a conformational change of the histamine H1 receptor, resulting in increased ligand affinity. Our experiments using the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid in F9 EC cells implicate a serine/threonine phosphorylation event in the stimulus-dependent sensitization of the histamine response, opening the possibility that a phosphorylation of the receptor underlies this conformational change. In agreement, mutational analysis of the H2 receptor has shown that relatively small changes in the intracellular domain can have profound influences on ligand affinity (7Smit M.J. Roovers E. Timmerman H. Van de Vrede Y. Alewijnse A.E. Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the primary sequence of the H1 receptor contains a number of serine and threonine residues that may serve as potential phosphorylation sites for an affinity controlling kinase (Yamashita et al. (30Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)). Such a mechanism would contrast the proposed regulation of rhodopsin and the a2-adrenergic receptor, where receptor phosphorylation is associated with deactivation (29Yamashita M. Fukui H. Sugama K. Horio Y. Ito S. Mizuguchi H. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11515-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Further biochemical and mutational characterization of the H1receptor is required to determine whether specific phosphorylation sites are involved in the regulation of the receptor affinity and activity.H1 receptor activation has been implicated in processes like inflammation and anaphylaxis, and therefore H1receptor action must be carefully regulated. It is to be expected that mechanisms have evolved for controlling the signaling by the H1 receptor. The regulation of histamine responsiveness as described in the present study provides such a control mechanism because for stimulation of the H1 receptor in these cells, both a pre-stimulus as well as histamine are necessary. Interestingly, in pathological conditions like asthma and allergy, exaggerated histamine reactivity is associated with the formation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (13Thien F.C.K. Walters E.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and serotonin (15Gerthoffer W.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 800-807PubMed Google Scholar), but no molecular details are known. The findings described in this study for inducing histamine responsiveness define for the first time a molecular mechanism by which such control of histamine reactivity may be exerted, but further studies are required to assess the importance of this mechanism in these pathological conditions. These studies are currently under progress. Histamine, a biogenic amine formed by decarboxylation of the amino acid l-histidine (1Werle E. Biochem. Z. 1936; 288: 292-293Google Scholar), is found in large quantities in most tissues, mainly in the granules of mast cells, although numerous other cell types are capable of histamine synthesis as well (2Kahlson G.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1990; 42: 45-83PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine receptors are subject to dynamic regulation, receptor activity being increased or diminished in response to various conditions (5Smit M.J. Bloemers S.M. Leurs R. Tertoolen L.G.J.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes have been implicated in the stimulation of histamine reactivity. Inhalational challenge with these inflammatory eicosanoids increases histamine responsiveness of the airways (8Kern R. Smith L.J. Patterson R. Krell R.D. Bernstein P.R. Am. Rev. Respir.

Walters E.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Also, other signaling molecules stimulate histamine responsiveness. Especially serotonin, platelet-activating factor, and thromboxanes are known to enhance histamine reactivity (14Sakurai T. Yamaguchi S. Iwami T. Nagai H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1994; 51: 95-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Gerthoffer W.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 278: 800-807PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms, however, by which such stimuli can provoke increased histamine responsiveness have remained obscure. In the present study we describe a molecular mechanism by which external stimuli can enhance histamine reactivity by directly controlling the affinity of the histamine H1 receptor for its ligand. We have reported earlier that the P19 embryo carcinoma (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, embryo carcinoma; ES, embryonic stem; FCS, fetal calf serum; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [3H]pyrilamine, [pyridinyl-5-3H]pyrilamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: EC, embryo carcinoma; ES, embryonic stem; FCS, fetal calf serum; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); [3H]pyrilamine, [pyridinyl-5-3H]pyrilamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; GDPβS, guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate). cell, a pluripotent cell type resembling the inner cell mass of the embryo, expresses functional histamine H1 receptors (16Bloemers S.M. Leurs R Smit M.J. Verheule S. Tertoolen L.G. Timmerman H. de Laat S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 191: 118-125Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), although its function with respect to embryogenesis is not clear. To obtain more insight into the function of histamine receptor expression in uncommitted cells, we decided to investigate the presence of cellular responses to histamine in other pluripotent cells. We observed that F9 EC cells and embryonic stem (ES5) cells displayed neither high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding nor histamine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. A pretreatment of these cells with cysteinyl leukotrienes, serotonin, or FCS, however, induced an immediate and transient ability of these cells to react to histamine. This effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin and was mimicked by GTP analogues. Importantly, induction of histamine responses coincided with the appearance of high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding sites on these cells. Apparently pertussis toxin-activating agents can regulate histamine responses by inducing high-affinity binding sites for histamine. These findings define for the first time a molecular mechanism by which cysteinyl leukotrienes and other external stimuli can increase histamine responsiveness and identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors. DISCUSSIONIn the present study we show that H1 receptor signaling in F9 EC cells and ES5 cells required prestimulation of the cells with either fetal calf serum, serotonin, leukotriene D4, or leukotriene E4, whereas bradykinin and ATP did not produce this effect. This sensitizing effect was inhibited by pertussis toxin, whereas it was mimicked by GTPγS and AlF4−. Therefore, pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins are probably mediating this regulation of H1 receptor action. The molecular basis for the induction H1receptor responsiveness appears to be the appearance of high affinity ligand binding sites, as control cells did not display high affinity [3H]pyrilamine binding, but introduction of GTPγS or treatment with AlF4− immediately provoked such high affinity [3H]pyrilamide binding sites. These findings strongly suggest that histamine responses in these cells are controlled by agents that induce high affinity binding sites for histamine and define a molecular mechanism by which external stimuli can control histamine H1 receptor action.The molecular details, however, by which external stimuli enable the H1 receptor to interact with its ligand, remain unclear. An explanation for the impaired H1 receptor function in unstimulated cells may be a physical impossibility for histamine to interact with its receptor. Generally, receptors may be continuously recycled between plasma membrane and endosomes. Although this process has not been reported for H1 receptors, it has been found to occur with several other G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. Ref. 22Von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the H2 receptor (7Smit M.J. Roovers E. Timmerman H. Van de Vrede Y. Alewijnse A.E. Leurs R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and some of the signaling elements involved have been identified (e.g. Refs. 23Ferguson S.S.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that in cell types that require sensitization for histamine responsiveness, the balance between endosome and plasma membrane localization is shifted to the endosomal state, and that sensitization releases this shift. Such a scheme would imply that in unstimulated F9 EC and ES5 cells the large majority of histamine receptors has an endosomal location. In other cells types, however, which show unconditional histamine responses, the balance between endosomal and plasma membrane-localized receptors should be shifted in favor of a plasma membrane location. In this context it is interesting to note that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins have been implicated in the stimulation of vesicle fusion (e.g. Refs. 25Lang J. Boulay F. Li G.D. Wollheim C.B.

Northrop A.J. Mason W.T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism, however, can not explain the absence of high affinity binding of [3H]pyrilamine in whole cell membrane preparations of uninduced F9 EC cells, prompting alternative explanations for induction of histamine responses in these cells.Therefore, control of the histamine response by SH-FCS, leukotrienes, and serotonin may be mediated by the induction of a conformational change of the histamine H1 receptor, resulting in increased ligand affinity. Our experiments using the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid in F9 EC cells implicate a serine/threonine phosphorylation event in the stimulus-dependent sensitization of the histamine response, opening the possibility that a phosphorylation of the receptor underlies this conformational change. In agreement, mutational analysis of the H2 receptor has shown that relatively small changes in the intracellular domain can have profound influences on ligand affinity (7Smit M.J. Roovers E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the primary sequence of the H1 receptor contains a number of serine and threonine residues that may serve as potential phosphorylation sites for an affinity controlling kinase (Yamashita et al. (30Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)). Such a mechanism would contrast the proposed regulation of rhodopsin and the a2-adrenergic receptor, where receptor phosphorylation is associated with deactivation (29Yamashita M. Fukui H. Sugama K. Horio Y. Ito S. Mizuguchi H. Wada H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11515-11519Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Further biochemical and mutational characterization of the H1receptor is required to determine whether specific phosphorylation sites are involved in the regulation of the receptor affinity and activity.H1 receptor activation has been implicated in processes like inflammation and anaphylaxis, and therefore H1receptor action must be carefully regulated. It is to be expected that mechanisms have evolved for controlling the signaling by the H1 receptor. The regulation of histamine responsiveness as described in the present study provides such a control mechanism because for stimulation of the H1 receptor in these cells, both a pre-stimulus as well as histamine are necessary. Interestingly, in pathological conditions like asthma and allergy, exaggerated histamine reactivity is associated with the formation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (13Thien F.C.K. Walters E.H. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and serotonin (15Gerthoffer W.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the substrate specificity of the system is not only determined by the periplasmic maltose-binding protein but that a further level of substrate specificity is contributed by the inner membrane integral membrane components of the system, MalF and MalG.We have isolated and characterized an altered substrate specificity mutant that transports lactose. The mutation responsible for the altered substrate specificity results in an amber stop codon at position 99 of MalF. The mutant requires functional MalK-ATPase activity and hydrolyzes ATP constitutively. It also requires MalG.

The maltose transport system of the Gram-negative bacteriumEscherichia coli is responsible for the unidirectional uptake of maltooligosaccharides (α[1,4]-linkedd-glucose polymers) (1Ferenci T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 108: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This system comprises five proteins. The LamB protein (also known as the maltoporin or λ-receptor) in the outer membrane, the periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MBP), 1The abbreviation used is: MBP, maltose-binding protein.1The abbreviation used is: MBP, maltose-binding protein. and the MalF, MalG, and MalK polypeptides that together (MalFGK2) form the inner membrane complex (2Silhavy T.J. Brickman E. Bassford P.J. Casadaban M.J. Shuman H.A. Schwartz V. Guarente L. Schwartz M. Beckwith J.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 174: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The LamB protein, encoded by the lamBgene is responsible for the diffusion of maltooligosaccharides into the periplasm of the cell (3Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). MBP, a soluble periplasmic protein encoded by the malE gene, binds maltooligosaccharides with a high affinity (K d = 0.1–1 μm) (4Ferenci T. Muir M. Lee K.S. Maris D. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1983; 258: 13665-13672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MBP is absolutely required for the transport of maltose (7Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of MBP has been determined in both the liganded and unliganded forms (9Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MalF and MalG proteins are integral membrane proteins that traverse the membrane eight and six times, respectively (10Boyd D. Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8525-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Froshauer S. Green G.N. Boyd D. McGovern K. Beckwith J. J. Mol.

MalK is an ATPase located on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane that is thought to be the energy-coupling component of the maltose transport system (3Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 14Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MalK shares strong sequence homology with other ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins (16Higgins C. Hiles I. Salmond G. Gill D. Downie J. Evans I. Nature. 1986; 323: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The stoichiomtry of the inner membrane complex is (MalFGK2) (17Davidson A.L. Nikaidi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4254-4260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MBP has long been regarded as the prime determinant of substrate specificity for the maltose system. However, several observations suggest that the inner membrane complex plays an important role in determining substrate specificity. First, MBP-independent mutants of MalF and MalG have been isolated that transport maltose in the absence of MBP (8Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even in the absence of MBP, these mutants still retain substrate specificity for maltooligosaccharides, which suggests that the inner membrane complex alone is capable of maintaining the specificity of the system. These MBP-independent mutants share a similar K m for maltose transport of approximately 2 mm, but they each display a V maxthat varies from wild-type values to approximately 20-fold lower. Therefore, they all bind maltose equally well, which is suggestive of a similar substrate binding site, but they translocate with different efficiencies. The observation that the ATP-binding cassette components of two members of the ABC superfamily, the Ugp and Mal transport systems, could be exchanged without any loss of substrate specificity suggests that this component does not play a role in determining the overall specificity of the system (21Hekstra D. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6546-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ugp transport system of E. colitransports sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. The UgpC and MalK proteins of these systems are highly homologous and both couple energy via ATP-hydrolysis (21Hekstra D. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6546-6552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two other components of the maltose transport system inner membrane complex, MalF and MalG, must be contributing to the specificity of the system. Mutants of MalF have been isolated that alter the range of substrates transported by the maltose transport system (22Ehrle R. Pick C. Ulrich R. Hoffman E. Ehrmann M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The various mutations map to the malF gene and cause alterations in transmembrane domains 6, 7, and 8 of MalF. The mutants could only recognize either maltose or longer maltodextrins, but not both. The mutations cluster along the transmembrane helices, and suppressor mutations in neighboring helices of MalF suggest a physical interaction. Studies on other members of the ABC superfamily, such as P-glycoprotein and the HlyB transporter, have also suggested that the transmembrane helices play an important role in determining substrate specificity (23Raviv Y.

In the present study, we describe a mutant of the maltose transport system (MalF540) that transports lactose efficiently. The MalF540 mutant we isolated carries a mutation in the malF gene that changes a glutamine codon at position 99 of MalF to an amber stop codon. This mutant suggests a novel mechanism for altering substrate specificity. The isolation and characterization of this mutant with respect to transport efficiency, maltose transport components required, and substrate specificity is described.

The mating was plated on minimal glucose plates that select only for HS3238. Recipients of the F′ were selected and screened by sensitivity to VCS-M13 phage. Independent overnight cultures of the transconjugants in LB were plated on tetrazolium maltose plates, and Mal− colonies were selected. Some of these should represent a gene conversion event between the malGamV67 on the episome and malG on the chromosome. The malTp1Tp7 allele is easily lost, so the Mal− colonies were screened for the presence ofmalTp1Tp7 by testing the ability to hydrolyze pNPG2 when lysed with chloroform. This is due to the overproduction of MalZ in response to the elevated levels of MalT. The presence of the malGamV67 was further confirmed by complementation of the Mal− phenotype with the plasmid pMR24, which carries wild-type malG, and by complementation with the φ80SupF amber suppressor phage. The pAB1 and pLH22 plasmids were introduced into the resulting strain by transformation. The malF deletion strains, GM1368 and GM1369, were constructed by conjugating the strain carrying F′ KLF10 ΔmalF argE::Tn10, HS3419, with themalTp1Tp7 strain, HS3238. F′ recipients were selected on minimal glucose plates containing tetracycline. Independent overnight cultures of the transconjugants in LB containing tetracycline were plated on tetrazolium maltose plates, and Mal− colonies were selected. Some of these should represent a gene conversion event between the ΔmalF3 on the F′ and malF on the chromosome. Mal− colonies were then screened for the presence of malTp1Tp7. The presence of theΔmalF3 was further evaluated by complementation of the Mal− phenotype with the plasmid pMR28, which carries wild-type malF. The pAB1 and either the pGM7 or pLH22 plasmids were introduced into the resulting strain by transformation. The plasmid pGM1, which carries themalE gene under control of the ptac promoter, was constructed by ligating the malE-containingEcoRI/StuI fragment from λNF630 (31Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) phage DNA, to EcoRI/SmaI-digested pMMB207 plasmid vector DNA. pGM7, which carries the malK and malG genes under the malB promoter, was constructed by ligating themalK-containing EcoRI/ScaI fragment from pHS4, to the malG-containingEcoRI/SnaBI fragment from pMR24. pLac2SM was constructed by digesting pLac2 with SacI andMfeI, thus deleting the portion of malF distal to the specificity mutation, “end-filling” and “chewing back” the respective overhangs with DNA polymerase I (Klenow) and T4 DNA-polymerase, and then ligating the resulting large DNA fragment to itself. pLH9SM was constructed in the same way except that the pLH9 plasmid was used. pLac2F′ was constructed by ligating thePstI/BsmI fragment from pLac2 containing the 5′-end of the truncated malF540 gene including the mutation, to the PstI/BsmI fragment from pBR322 that contains the origin of replication. Pt-pLac2SM was constructed by ligating the PstI/BstEII fragment from pMR38 containing the Ptrc promoter and the 5′-end of themalF gene to the PstI/BstEII fragment from pLac2SM containing the 3′-end of truncated malF540 andmalG. A plasmid carrying the malF502 MBP-independent allele, pLH5, was mutagenized in the mutator strain KD1087 (32Dengen D.A. Cox E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strain contains themutD5 allele, which increases the frequency of mutational events 50–100 times above that observed in a wild-type strain (mut +). KD1087 was transformed with the pLH5 plasmid, and transformants were selected on LB plates containing carbenicillin. Individual transformants were then grown in LB containing carbenicillin at 37 °C overnight. Plasmid DNA was purified from these independent cultures and used to transform the lactose indicator strain GM1305. Transformants were plated on minimal 1% lactose plates containing carbenicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and 0.2% arginine. Those transformants that grew on the indicator media after 1–3 days of incubation at 37 °C were purified by passing three times on minimal 1% lactose plates. Plasmid DNA was purified from these isolates and used to retransform the lactose indicator strain to ensure that the mutation responsible for the Lac+ phenotype is linked to the pLH5 plasmid. The nucleotide sequence of malF and malG alleles carried on pLac2 and various amber mutant plasmids (pGM8-pGM12) was determined by using double-stranded DNA templates and 13 oligonucleotide primers (33Covitz K.M. Panagiotidis C.H. Hor L.I. Reyes M. Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1752-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA templates were purified, denatured, and annealed with the primers as described (34Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinwald L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-546PubMed Google Scholar). The Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (35Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52250) Google Scholar) was used to determine the nucleotide sequences. Maltose and lactose transport activity was estimated by measuring the uptake of [14C]maltose (360 mCi/mmol) or [14C]lactose (57 mCi/mmol) as described previously (7Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5455-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When sugars were tested for their ability to inhibit radioactive sugar uptake, cells were incubated in the presence of inhibitor sugar for 5 s prior to the addition of radioactive substrate. [14C]Maltose was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals, Inc. [14C]Lactose was obtained from Amersham International, plc. To measure the ATPase activity of the mutant maltose systems, the respective proteins must be overproduced. We used the strain HS3309, which carries the pMR11 plasmid that has the malK gene under the Ptac promoter. This strain was transformed with either pBR322 as a vector control; pNT11, which carries the malF502MBP-independent allele under Ptrc; or pt-Lac2SM, which carries the malF540 allele under Ptrc. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from transformants induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and ATPase activity was measured as described (14Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Reyes M. Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 918-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit from Pierce. The plasmids carrying mutations in malF resulting in amber stop codons in place of amino acids Glu39, Tyr55, Glu130, Lys275, and Tyr317 were constructed by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The following oligomers were used in this experiment: GM1, 5′-GGCGAACAGGTACTACCCTTGTGCG-3′, Glu39 to amber stop; GM2, 5′-CGATTGGCGAAAATCTACAGCCCCG-3′, Tyr55 to amber stop; GM3, 5′-CGCCAGTTGCCACTAATCGCCCGC-3′, Glu130 to amber stop; GM4, 5′-GGCGAGGAACGGCTACTGAATGCC-3′, Lys275 to amber stop; GM5, 5′-GCAGGACGCTAGACCGGCTTTGC-3′, Tyr317 to amber stop. The underlined bases are those that are changed in the mutants. Single-stranded plasmid DNA was made from a VCS-M13 phage lysate of thedut ung strain CJ236 carrying the pLH9 (wild-typemalF and malG) plasmid. The oligomers were phosphorylated and annealed to the template as described (38Geisselsoder J. Witney P. Yuckenburg P. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 786-791Google Scholar). Double-stranded pDNA was then synthesized in vitro by Klenow fragment and circularized by T4 DNA ligase. An aliquot of the reaction mixtures was used to transform DH5α. Plasmid DNA was purified from individual transformants and analyzed by enzymatic digestion, and the nucleotide sequence of the region of interest was determined to verify the presence of the amber mutations. Gel electrophoresis was carried out by the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205516) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted in sample buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in 12% polyacrylamide gels. Protein was visualized by staining the gels with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in methanol-acetic acid-water (5:1:5) and destaining in 7.5% acetic acid, 5% methanol. We examined the ability of Triton X-100 to solubilize the MalFGK proteins as described previously (14Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some alterations. 250 μg of protein from the inside-out membrane vesicles was incubated in 1.0 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl containing 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for ½ h. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 20 min. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl; 5 μl of this sample was loaded on gels for Coomassie staining and 15 μl for Western blots after boiling for 4 min along with 3 μl of 50% glycerol and 10 μl of sample buffer. The supernatant was added to 2.0 ml of cold ethanol and placed on dry ice for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. The ethanol supernatant was removed, and the percipitated proteins were resuspended in 40 μl of 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. 6 μl of this sample was loaded on gels for Coomassie staining and 17 μl for Western blots after boiling for 4 min along with 3 μl of 50% glycerol and 10 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to sheets of nitrocellulose (BAS 0.45-μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting (20 V, overnight) as described elsewhere (40Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheets were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in TBST for 1 h and then incubated with the appropriate dilution of anti-MalK or anti-MalF rabbit antibody. After extensive washing with TBST, goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase was added for 1 h. The resulting blot was then developed using the ECL-Western blotting kit from Amersham Life Science. The indicator strains used to detect altered substrate specificity mutants of the maltose transport system that transport lactose share some common attributes. They all have a deletion of the chromosomal lactose operon but carry the lacZ gene on a plasmid or F′-episome. Thus, these strains can metabolize intracellular lactose but are incapable of transporting it into the cell. The strains also carry themalTp1Tp7 allele (41Chapon C. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) ensuring constitutive malgene expression in all growth media. Plasmids carrying either wild-type malF and malGor MBP-independent alleles of these genes under the control of themalB promoter on the pBR322 replicon were mutagenized in themutD5 mutator strain KD1087 (32Dengen D.A. Cox E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 477-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lactose indicator strains were transformed with the mutagenized plasmids, and mutants were selected for the ability to utilize lactose as a sole carbon source on minimal lactose plates. To confirm that the Lac+phenotype is linked to the plasmid, prospective mutant plasmids were retransformed into the lactose indicator strains and evaluated on minimal lactose plates. Although many plasmid-linked mutants were isolated by this technique, only one mutant displayed a strong Lac+ phenotype. This mutant allele, malF540, is carried on the plasmid pLac2. The pLac2 plasmid was derived from the mutagenized pLH5 parent plasmid (42Hor L.I. Genetic Studies on the Mechanism of Periplasmic Binding Protein-dependent Transport.Ph.D. dissertation. Columbia University, 1991Google Scholar) that carries the MBP-independent allele malF502 (8Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 654-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was isolated as an allele that is dominant to wild-type malF andmalG because the indicator strain used (GM1305) had all of the chromosomal maltose transport genes intact (TableII).Table IILactose phenotype in various indicator strainsPlasmidPlasmid descriptionLactose phenotype2-aLactose phenotype was scored as growth on M63 minimal plates containing 1% lactose, ampicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and 0.2% arginine after 2 days at 37 °C.GM13052-bChromosome: wild-type malF,G,K; plasmid:malK + .GM11912-cChromosome: ΔmalB101; plasmid:malK + .GM 13682-dChromosome: ΔmalF; plasmid:malK + .GM 14082-eChromosome: malGamV67; plasmid:malK + .GM13612-fChromosome: wild-type malF,G,K; plasmid:malK +, malG + .GM13692-gChromosome: ΔmalF; plasmid:malK +, malG + .GM13802-hChromosome: ΔmalF.pBR322Vector−−−−−−−pTE18lacY+++++++++++++++++++++pLH9Wild-typemalF,G−−−−−−−pLH5malF502−−−−−−−pLac2malF540,malG+++2-iPapillated and small colony morphology.

Open table in a new tab The mutation responsible for the phenotype of the MalF540 mutant was mapped by performing a series of DNA fragment exchanges between the pLac2 plasmid, which carries the malF540 allele, and the pLH5 parent plasmid (Fig. 1). These exchanges suggest that the mutation is located proximal to the SacI site on the pLac2 plasmid, somewhere at the very beginning ofmalF. Not shown in Fig. 1 is the second restriction site used in these experiments, a PstI site located in the ampicillin resistance gene. The PstI-SacI DNA fragment was also used to perform exchanges between the pLac2 plasmid and the pLH9 plasmid (Fig.1). pLH9 carries the wild-type malF and malGgenes. A fragment containing the region"
