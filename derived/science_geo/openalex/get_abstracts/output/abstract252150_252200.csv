https://openalex.org/W2157681979,"Kinetochore attachment to spindle microtubule plus-ends is necessary for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division in all eukaryotes. The centromeric DNA of each chromosome is linked to microtubule plus-ends by eight structural-protein complexes. Knowing the copy number of each of these complexes at one kinetochore-microtubule attachment site is necessary to understand the molecular architecture of the complex, and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying kinetochore function. We have counted, with molecular accuracy, the number of structural protein complexes in a single kinetochore-microtubule attachment using quantitative fluorescence microscopy of GFP-tagged kinetochore proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that relative to the two Cse4p molecules in the centromeric histone, the copy number ranges from one or two for inner kinetochore proteins such as Mif2p, to 16 for the DAM-DASH complex at the kinetochore-microtubule interface. These counts allow us to visualize the overall arrangement of a kinetochore-microtubule attachment. As most of the budding yeast kinetochore proteins have homologues in higher eukaryotes, including humans, this molecular arrangement is likely to be replicated in more complex kinetochores that have multiple microtubule attachments."

The RING finger protein Ring1B is an E3 ligase that participates in the ubiquitination of lysine 119 of histone H2A, and the binding of Bmi-1 stimulates the E3 ligase activity. We have mapped the regions of Bmi-1 and Ring1B required for efficient ubiquitin transfer and determined a 2.5-Å structure of the Bmi-1-Ring1B core domain complex. The structure reveals that Ring1B “hugs” Bmi-1 through extensive RING domain contacts and its N-terminal tail wraps around Bmi-1. The two regions of interaction have a synergistic effect on the E3 ligase activity. Our analyses suggest a model where the Bmi-1-Ring1B complex stabilizes the interaction between the E2 enzyme and the nucleosomal substrate to allow efficient ubiquitin transfer.

The PRC1 complex has at least two biochemical functions. One of which is to bind chromatin and prevent it from being remodeled by ATP-dependent remodeling factors (13.Shao Z. Raible F.

A recent study revealed that a human PRC1 complex composed of Bmi-1, HPH2, PC3, and Ring proteins (Ring1A and Ring1B), which are homologs of Drosophila Posterior Sex Combs, Polyhomeotic, Polycomb, and dRing, respectively, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mono-ubiquitinates lysine 119 of nucleosomal histone H2A (15.Wang H.

To gain mechanistic insights into the assembly and enzymatic activity of the PRC1 complex, we have determined the structural requirements for the Bmi-1-Ring1B interaction and the basis for stimulation of the E3 ligase activity. Protein Expression and Purification—Human Ring1B and a Bmi-1 fragment encompassing residues 1-230 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as an untagged and a GST fusion protein, respectively. A pCDFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) was used for the overexpression of Ring1B (cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites). Bmi-1 was produced with a pGEX-KG-6P vector (Amersham Biosciences) carrying a preScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) cleavage site between the GST tag and the protein encoded by the cDNA fragment, which was cloned between the BamHI and SalI sites. Point mutants of Bmi-1 (T41R and D72R) and Ring1B (R70D) were generated by PCR and verified by DNA sequencing. The two proteins were coexpressed in the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli. Both the wild-type and mutant Bmi-1-Ring1B complexes were first purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column. The GST tag was then removed by in-column digestion with the preScission protease, and the eluted Bmi-1-Ring1B complex was further purified by hydrophobic and gel-filtration column chromatography using a phenyl-Sepharose and a Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences) column, respectively. Domain Mapping and Mass Analysis—The Bmi-1-Ring1B complex eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose column was subject to treatment with elastase at an ∼1:100 (w/w) enzyme to protein ratio for 2 h at room temperature. The stable Bmi-1-Ring1B core was then purified using the same procedure described above. The identities of the elastase-digested products were analyzed by mass spectrometry according to the following procedures: the samples was diluted directly into MALDI matrix (a saturated solution of 3-indole acrylic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid) and spotted directly onto the MALDI plate. Spectra were acquired using an ABI 4700 mass spectrometer in linear mode. Another aliquot of sample was reduced and alkylated using TCEP and iodoacetamide and then digested with trypsin for 6 h in 50 mm diammonium phosphate (pH 8.0). Following digestion the sample was desalted using micro reverse phase columns, mixed with MALDI matrix, and spotted directly onto the MALDI plate. Spectra were acquired using the ABI 4700, and matching peptides were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. The resulting data were analyzed using the MASCOT search engine. Ubiquitin E3 Ligase Assay—Oligonucleosomes (5 μg) were incubated with recombinant proteins in a 40-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 10 μm okadaic acid, 0.1 μg of ubiquitin activation enzyme E1 (Calbiochem), 0.6 μg of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5c, 1 μg of FLAG-ubiquitin (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The proteins were resolved in 8-15% SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The elastase-treated mini Bmi-1-Ring1B core was concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol for crystallization. The protein complex was crystallized by hanging-drop vapor diffusion in 0.1 m Hepes (pH 7.5) and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000. The crystal belongs to the P63 space group with cell dimensions of a = b = 120.3 Å and c = 27.2 Å. X-ray absorption spectra at the zinc edge revealed the presence of zinc ions in the crystal, and three sets of zinc multiwavelength anomalous dispersion diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the X25 beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed using the HKL program (23.Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Method Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and an additional zinc ion was identified using difference Fourier analysis. Model building was carried out using the graphic program O. Refinement was initially carried out using REFMAC (26.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) of the CCP4 program suite (27.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and the statistics are shown in Table 1. The figures were prepared with the programs PYMOL (28.DeLano W.L. The PYMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar) and GRASP (29.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The PDB accession code is 2H0D. Characterization of Bmi-1-Ring1B Interaction and Ubiquitin Ligase Activity—We first sought to determine the region of Bmi-1 that interacts with Ring1B. Because three mammalian Posterior Sex Combs homologs, Bmi-1, Mel-18, and MBLR, share significant sequence homology within the ∼230 residue N-terminal region (Fig. 1A), we reasoned that this region of Bmi-1 might be involved in interaction with Ring1B. To test this idea, we co-expressed full-length Ring1B with GST-tagged Bmi1-(1-230) in E. coli. The two proteins associate with each other throughout the purification process, which includes affinity purification using glutathione-agarose resins at 0.5 m salt concentration as well as hydrophobic and gel-filtration column chromatography. As shown in lanes 2-4 of Fig. 1B (top panel), the two proteins appear to be in a 1:1 complex at the end of the purification process. Furthermore, the Ring1B-Bmi1-(1-230) complex has a significantly elevated ubiquitin ligase activity compared with Ring1B alone (Fig. 1B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2-4 of the bottom panel). At equimolar amounts of Ring1B, we estimate that the Ring1B-Bmi1-(1-230) complex is ∼25-fold more active than Ring1B alone. In comparison, the full-length Bmi-1-Ring1B complex expressed in insect cells is ∼100-fold more active than that of equimolar Ring1B (Fig. 1B, lane 8). Thus, we conclude that Bmi1-(1-230) binds Ring1B and contains essential elements for stimulating the E3 ligase activity of Ring1B. To further define the domains required for both Bmi-1-Ring1B interactions and the E3 ligase activity, we carried out proteolytic mapping of the Ring1B-Bmi1-(1-230) complex. Digestion with elastase resulted in a stable band of ∼12 kDa (Fig. 1B, top panel, lanes 5-7). Analyses using MALDI-TOF and TOF/TOF mass spectrometry revealed that the ∼12-kDa band is a heterodimer of a Bmi-1 fragment encompassing residues 1-102 and a Ring1B fragment encompassing residues 5-115. The elastase-processed complex of Bmi1-(1-102) and Ring1B-(5-115), which we refer to as the mini Bmi-1-Ring1B complex, is stable and can be further purified through column chromatography. More importantly, the purified mini complex exhibits a level of ubiquitin ligase activity comparable to that of the Ring1B-Bmi1-(1-230) complex (Fig. 1B, bottom panel, lanes 5-7). Because Bmi-1 alone has no E3 ligase activity (15.Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 19.Cao R. Tsukada Y.I. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), we thus conclude that Ring1B-(5-115) encompasses the region required for the histone H2A monoubiquitination E3 ligase activity, and Bmi1-(1-102) is sufficient for the stable interaction with Ring1B and stimulation of its E3 ligase activity. Structure of the Bmi-1-Ring1B Mini Complex—To reveal the mechanism by which Bmi-1 binds to and stimulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring1B at atomic resolution, we determined the crystal structure of the Bmi1-(1-102)-Ring1B-(5-115) binary complex. The structure was determined to 2.5 Å by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using anomalous scattering signals from zinc ions that were co-purified and crystallized with the proteins. The refined structure has an R-factor of 21% and R-free of 25%. The structure also has good stereochemical properties, because 90.4% of the residues are in the most favored region and none in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot calculated using PROCHECK (30.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 24: 946-956Google Scholar). Detailed statistics of the crystallographic analyses are shown in Table 1. The structure shows that both Bmi1-(1-102) and Ring1B-(5-115) contain a canonical RING domain, which is composed of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet in the 2 → 1 ↓ 3 → configuration, two zinc binding loops, and an α-helix (αB) immediately C-terminal to β2 (Fig. 2, A and B). The above secondary structure elements, together with a short helix (αA) at the N-terminal end (a helical turn in Ring1B) and a C-terminal helix (αC), constitute the RING domains of Bmi-1 and Ring1B. In each protein, the first zinc binding site is composed of a CXXC motif from the first zinc binding loop (L1) and another CXXC motif from αB. The second zinc binding site is composed of a CXXC motif from the second zinc binding loop (L2) andaCXH motif located in β2. The RING domains of Bmi-1 and Ring1B are quite similar: they share ∼30% sequence identity and ∼45% similarity. The two domains can be superimposed with a root-mean-squared deviation of 0.9 Å using the Cα atoms of 61 of the 70 Ring1B RING domain residues for alignment with the corresponding Cα positions of Bmi-1. In addition to the RING domain, Bmi1-(1-102) contains a 16-residue helix (αD) at the C terminus that projects away from the body of the RING domain, whereas Ring1B-(5-115) has a 25-residue N-terminal tail that wraps around Bmi-1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The extensive interaction between Bmi1-(1-102) and Ring1B-(5-115) buries a total pairwise surface area of 2459 Å2. The two RING domains are closely juxtaposed and related by an approximate 2-fold rotation (Fig. 2A). They pack against each other through a mixture of hydrophobic and polar interactions involving residues located on the central β-sheet, as well as, the N- and C-terminal helices (αA and αC) of both proteins (Fig. 2C). The packing of the RING domains contributes to the burial of a total surface area of 1055 Å2. In addition, the long N-terminal tail of Ring1B makes extensive interaction with the C-terminal helix, αD, and with the surface area of Bmi-1 opposite to the interface between the RING domains (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). The interaction between the N-terminal tail of Ring1B and Bmi-1 buries a surface area of 1361 Å2. Structure-based Biochemical Analyses of the E3 Ligase Activity—Ideally we would like to quantitatively correlate the Bmi-1-Ring1B interaction with the E3 ligase activity of the binary complex using separately purified Bmi-1 and Ring1B wild-type or mutants proteins. However, this is not possible because each protein aggregates when purified separately and they do not form a binary complex efficiently when mixed together. Thus, we sought to introduce mutations that selectively perturb the interaction in different regions without completely disrupting the complex formation; hence the complexes were prepared by co-expression. Because both the RING domain and the N-terminal tail of Ring1B interact with Bmi-1, we reasoned that, if the interactions at both regions are important for the E3 ligase activity, a simultaneous change of interactions involving both regions would have a greater effect than those to each region individually. To alter the interaction between the N-terminal tail of Ring1B with Bmi-1 we changed Thr41 of Bmi-1 to an arginine (T41R), because it occupies a central position in the interaction with Ring1B through contacting both Glu-23 and Arg-26 (Fig. 2E). As shown in lanes 1 and 4 of Fig. 3 (bottom panel), the T41R mutant of Bmi1-(1-230) still forms a complex with Ring1B, and the mutant complex exhibits a level of E3 ligase activity similar to that of the wild-type complex (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4 of the top panel). The T41R mutant of Bmi1-(1-230) is used as a negative control (Fig. 3, top panel, lane 3), because Bmi-1 alone is not known to possess the E3 ligase activity, and the insect cell expressed full-length Bmi-1-Ring1B complex and the mini Bmi-1-Ring1B complex are shown for comparison of E3 activity levels (Fig. 3, Ctrl and lane 2 of the top panel). The T41R result suggests that changing the Bmi-1-Ring1B interaction at the N-terminal tail region of Ring1B alone does not cause detectable changes of the E3 ligase activity. We next changed Asp-72 of Bmi-1, which is located in the RING domain and forms a salt bridge with Arg-70 of Ring1B in the middle of the RING domain interface (Fig. 2B), to an arginine (D72R). Similar to the T41R mutation, the D72R mutant complex also had an E3 ligase activity level similar to that of the wild-type complex (Fig. 3, lane 5). Because Asp-72 of Bmi-1 interacts with Arg-70 of Ring1B via a salt bridge, we made an R70D mutant of Ring1B and tested the degree to which it affects the E3 ligase activity. The Ring1B R70D mutant complex with the wild-type Bmi1-(1-230) exhibits reduced enzymatic activity in comparison with the wild-type complex (Fig. 3, lane 6). Thus, the two residues involved in the salt-bridge interaction appear to affect the E3 ligase activity of the heterodimeric complex to different degrees. A dramatic reduction of the E3 ligase activity is displayed by the complex of the T41R mutant of Bmi1-(1-230) and the R70D mutant of Ring1B (Fig. 3, lane 7), which changes the interaction between Bmi-1 and Ring1B in both contacting regions. It should be pointed out that the T41R-R70D complex is noticeably less stable than other Bmi-1-Ring1B complexes used in this study, because a significant fraction of the mutant complex falls apart during the purification process. A contaminant band co-purified with Bmi1-(1-230) also co-purifies with the mutant complex (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 7 of the bottom panel). It is possible that the sample shown in lane 7 is a mixture of the mutant protein complex and uncomplexed Bmi-1. The apparent instability of the T41R-R70D complex and the lack of detectable E3 ligase activity (Fig. 3, lane 7 of the upper panel) confirms our hypothesis that both of the Bmi-1-Ring1B interaction regions identified from our structural study are important for the E3 ligase activity. We next sought to restore the interaction between the two proteins by combining the R70D mutant of Ring1B with the D72R mutant of Bmi-1, because this combination should restore the salt-bridge interaction. Indeed, the mutant complex of Ring1B R70D and Bmi-1 D72R rescues the reduction of enzymatic activity caused by the R70D mutation of Ring1B (Fig. 3, lane 6) and displays a wild-type E3 ligase activity level (Fig. 3, lane 8). Given the practical difficulty of quantitatively measuring the binding between Bmi-1 and Ring1B using separately purified proteins, the above mutagenesis and binding data reveal a positive correlation between stable Bmi-1-Ring1B interaction and the E3 ligase activity of the binary complex. We have biochemically and structurally characterized the Bmi-1 and Ring1B domains required for both a stable interaction and stimulation of the E3 ligase activity. The structure revealed that Ring1B interacts with Bmi-1 via both the RING domain and the extended N-terminal tail. Comparing the structure of the mini Bmi-1-Ring1B complex with the only other heterodimeric RING domain structure, the BRCA1-BARD1 RING-RING complex (31.Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M.C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), reveals that the two RING domains in the Bmi-1-Ring1B complex are positioned in a fashion similar to that of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex (Fig. 4A), although detailed conformations and residues mediating the intermolecular interactions differ between the two structures. It is likely that the observed packing of RING domains represent a general mode of interaction between RING domains. Interestingly, the RING domain of BRCA1 also has in vitro E3 ligase activity, and the binding of BARD stimulates the E3 activity of BRCA1, although the physiological substrates remain elusive (32.Hashizume R.

Chen H.W. Verma I.M. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The most significant differences between the two structures are between the N-terminal regions of Ring1B and BRCA1 and the C-terminal regions of Bmi1 and BARD, both of which are involved in intermolecular interactions (Fig. 4A). Previous structural studies have indicated that E3 ligases may function to position the substrate and the E2 enzyme in a stable configuration that allows efficient transfer of ubiquitin. The structure of the RING finger E3 ligase c-Cbl in complex with its E2 enzyme, UbcH7, shows that the E2 enzyme binds to a region spanning the two zinc-binding loops and the intervening helix (αB in our nomenclature) of the RING domain of c-Cbl (34.Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the E2-E3 interactions appear to be structurally conserved. The E3 binding sequences of UbcH7 and UbcH5 are highly similar, which allows us to infer the E2 binding site of the Bmi-1-Ring1B mini complex using the c-Cbl-UbcH7 structure as a reference. As seen in Fig. 4B, the E2 binding site is mapped to the Ring1B surface encompassing the two Zinc binding loops and αB, which is not involved in Bmi-1-Ring1B interactions. The corresponding region of the BRCA1 RING domain has been demonstrated to bind UbcH5, which further supports the idea that this region of Ring1B binds the E2 enzyme (35.Brzovic P.S. Keeffe J.R. Nishikawa H. Miyamoto K. Fox 3rd, D. Fukuda M. Ohta T. Klevit R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). How does the binding of Bmi-1 stimulate the E3 ligase activity? There are two possibilities: 1) the binding of Bmi-1 may relieve the inhibitory effect of a part of Ring1B, such as the N-terminal tail; 2) Bmi-1 may play a more active role in the chemical transfer of ubiquitin. The first scenario is unlikely because our mutagenesis data show that the E3 ligase activity is lost even when the two proteins are still associated with each other in the Bmi-1 T41R and Ring1B R70D combination, whereas the R70D mutant of Ring1B alone has a reduced but respectable E3 ligase activity. Another support of our reasoning is that Mel-18, a Bmi-1 homolog that only differs by seven residues within the regions of interest here (and none of these regions are located in the interface with Ring1B), lacks the ability to stimulate the E3 ligase activity even though it interacts with Ring1B (19.Cao R. Tsukada Y.I. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). A more likely scenario is that Bmi-1 actively promotes ubiquitination through binding the substrate. An analysis of the distribution of the residues different between Bmi-1 and Mel-18 shows that they are enriched in a region distant from the implicated E2 binding site (Fig. 4C), which suggests that the different ability of Bmi-1 and Mel-18 in stimulating the E3 ligase activity of Ring1B is not due to direct involvements with E2 binding but rather in substrate binding. Interestingly, a portion of the N-terminal tail is located within the putative substrate binding region (Fig. 4C), making it likely that this part of Ring1B participates in the positioning of nucleosomal substrates together with Bmi-1. It is interesting to note that the proposed binding sites for the nucleosomal substrate and the E2 enzyme are far apart. In fact this phenomenon is exactly what has been implicated in previous structural studies (36.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Although E3 enzymes differ widely, a consensus theme of their function is emerging, which is to provide a scaffold for positioning the E2 enzyme and the substrate (36.Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Combining the knowledge from previous studies with our current analyses, a model of the Bmi-1-Ring1B E3 ligase function is depicted in Fig. 4D, which provides a basis for further in-depth studies of nucleosomal substrate specificity and mechanisms of E3 ligase activation of the PRC1 complex.

In this study, we identify, by using mass spectrometry techniques and specific anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, Ser87 and Thr56 as the Bcl-2 residues phosphorylated by p38 MAPK and show that phosphorylation of these residues is always associated with a decrease in the antiapoptotic potential of Bcl-2 protein. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that p38 MAPK-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation plays a key role in the early events following serum deprivation in embryonic fibroblasts. Both cytochrome c release and caspase activation triggered by p38 MAPK activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation are absent in embryonic fibroblasts from p38α knock-out mice (p38α-/- MEF), whereas they occur within 12 h of serum withdrawal in p38α+/+ MEF; moreover, they can be prevented by p38 MAPK inhibitors and are not associated with the synthesis of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Fas. Thus, Bcl-2 phosphorylation by activated p38 MAPK is a key event in the early induction of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress. The antiapoptotic role of Bcl-2 can be regulated by its phosphorylation in serine and threonine residues located in a nonstructured loop that links BH3 and BH4 domains. p38 MAPK has been identified as one of the kinases able to mediate such phosphorylation, through direct interaction with Bcl-2 protein in the mitochondrial compartment.

Thus, Bcl-2 phosphorylation by activated p38 MAPK is a key event in the early induction of apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress. Bcl-2 family proteins play differential roles in the regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, by either promoting or inhibiting the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria to the cytosol (1Breckenridge D.G. Xue D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Marzo I. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1998; 52: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins modulate the mitochondrial permeability through interaction with adenine nucleotide translocator, voltage-dependent anion channel, by ADP/ATP exchange, or by interfering with oxidative phosphorylation during apoptosis (2Marzo I. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1998; 52: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of Bcl-2 proteins suggests that they are also capable of forming channels in mitochondrial membranes (3Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W.

Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar).Recent evidence indicates that the antiapoptotic functions of Bcl-2 can be regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (6Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), dimerization (7Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), and/or proteolytic cleavage (8Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). There is still controversy over the significance of Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and two opposing models were initially proposed, the “taxol-induced” and the “interleukin-3-induced” Bcl-2 phosphorylation (6Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the first model, Bcl-2 phosphorylation induces a strong inhibition of the antiapoptotic potential and is related to hyperphosphorylation of several kinases, including Raf-1 kinase, but is independent of protein kinase C (9Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1851-1854PubMed Google Scholar). In the second model, stimulation with growth factors, such as interleukin-3, induces Bcl-2 phosphorylation, which increases the antiapoptotic potential of the protein (10Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), whereas, in contrast, interleukin-3 deprivation inhibits Bcl-2-phosphorylation and induces cell death. However, subsequent reports clearly show that hyperphosphorylated Bcl-2 cannot be considered a hallmark of the growth/survival mechanism of action and that triggering specific tyrosine kinase receptors decreases Bcl-2 phosphorylation still inhibiting cell death (6Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For example, binding of insulin receptor substrate proteins to Bcl-2, triggered by insulin/insulin-receptor interaction, inhibits its phosphorylation and has been proposed as one of the survival mechanisms induced by insulin (11Ueno H.

Probably, both phenomena are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may reflect the function of Bcl-2 in different cellular contexts, able to induce directly or indirectly Bcl-2 phosphorylation. An alternative explanation is that such phenomena simply reflect the action of different Bcl-2 kinases, which phosphorylate different residues of the protein.In fact, Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurs in at least one of the four serine and threonine residues located in a nonstructured loop that links the BH3 and BH4 domains (15Srivastava R.K.

JNK was repeatedly indicated as a potential Bcl-2 kinase, and it has been shown to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation at four serine/threonine sites (Thr56, Ser70, Thr74, and Ser87) (19Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

However, recent reports suggest that, although paclitaxel-induced JNK activation is crucial for Bcl-2 phosphorylation, other kinases, such as CDK1, are responsible for it (20Vantieghem A. Xu Y.

Consistently, during paclitaxel treatment, lack of synchrony between JNK activation (early event) and Bcl-2 phosphorylation (late event) has been reported (21Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H.

Cell Res. 2004; 298: 632-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation induced by p38 MAPK always leads to proapoptotic events, as indicated by the release of cytochrome c both in cellular systems and in “cell-free” experiments (14Torcia M. De Chiara G. Nencioni L. Ammendola S. Labardi D. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Marlier L.N. Bonini P. Dello S.P. Palamara A.T. Zambrano N. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39027-39036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In contrast to JNK, Bcl-2 phosphorylation is synchronous with p38 MAPK activation and is mediated by a direct interaction between Bcl-2 and the activated enzyme in the mitochondrial compartment, resulting in cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Cellular apoptosis, triggered a few hours after p38 MAPK activation, does not require de novo protein synthesis and can efficiently be blocked by p38 MAPK-specific inhibitors. On the whole, these data support the hypothesis that several kinases can phosphorylate specific Bcl-2 residues and evoke different biologic events, thus underscoring the need to assess precisely those residues. In this study, we identified, by using mass spectrometry techniques and specific anti-phosphopeptide antibodies, Ser87 and Thr56 as the Bcl-2 residues phosphorylated by p38 MAPK. Consistently, substitution of these residues with alanine inhibits cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria after the addition of activated p38 MAPK. We also showed that deletion of the p38α MAPK gene strongly delays apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in embryonic fibroblasts and that Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by p38 MAPK plays a key role in the early induction of apoptosis following serum deprivation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from p38α MAPK+/+ and p38α MAPK-/- embryos were kindly donated by Dr. Micheal Karin (University of California, San Diego) (24Tamura K.

For MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) analysis, mass spectra were acquired in positive and negative ion mode using an Applied Biosystems/Sciex Q-Star XL instrument. All of the experiments were carried out with an oMALDI 2 ion source (oMALDI-QqTOF), setting the N2 laser power to 20 μJ with a pulse rate of 20 Hz.Cythochrome c Release—MDCK cells, detached by trypsin-EDTA, were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 8 ml of mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4).

The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet containing the mitochondrial fraction was incubated for 30 min on ice and 15 min at 22°C, with or without extracts of E. coli cells (8.5%, v/v), expressing native or mutated Bcl-2-His6 or transformed with the empty plasmid, obtained by lysing the cells with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% CHAPS. 0.25 ng of active p38 MAPK, with or without 25 μm SB203580, was then added, and the phosphorylation reaction was performed in the presence of 200 μm ATP (Amersham Biosciences). p38 MAPK-untreated mitochondria were also used as control. Mitochondrial mixture reactions were then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant and pellet proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was probed with anti-human cytochrome c peptide monoclonal antibody (7H8.2C12 clone; BD Biosciences), diluted to 1:500, followed by a secondary probe (1:5,000 dilution) with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoblotting Techniques—Lysates of p38α+/+ MEF and p38α-/- MEF cells, grown under conditions of serum deprivation for different time periods, and lysates of CESS cells, cultured in the presence of 200 nm K252A (Calbiochem) as apoptotic stimuli for 2 h, were separated on SDS-PAGE and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were stained with the indicated primary antibodies (1 μg/ml) followed by secondary probes (1:5,000 dilution) with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Kinase Assay—For detection of Bcl-2 phosphorylation sites, a kinase assay was performed by incubating 0.25 μg of recombinant active p38 MAPK-GST or active JNK-GST and 0.25 μg of recombinant Bcl-2-GST in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 200 μm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 25 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem). In another set of experiments, the kinase assay was performed by incubating 0.5 μg of recombinant Bcl-2-GST or T56A Bcl-2-GST or S87A Bcl-2-GST and 0.25 μg of recombinant active p38 MAPK-GST in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. p38 MAPK-untreated Bcl-2 proteins were used as controls. Protein mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and stained with anti-phospho-Bcl-2 (Thr56 and Ser87) antibodies. The reaction was visualized by an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences).To assess the activity of recombinant enzymes, 0.25 μg of active rp38 MAPK-GST or recombinant JNK-GST were incubated with 0.25 μg of rATF-2-GST in kinase buffer for 30 min in the presence of 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed.Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, p38α+/+ and p38α-/- MEF were seeded on glass coverslips in 35-mm plates at a concentration of 7 × 104 cells/glass; 24 h later, cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for different times (6, 9, and 12 h). At the indicated time points, cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 30 min at 4 °C in 4% formaldehyde, incubated with 0.25 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min at 22 °C, and then permeabilized for 3 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. After incubation with 3% (v/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min to block nonspecific binding, the cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c antibody (6H2.B4 clone; BD Pharmingen) in PBS plus 1.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. The coverslips were then rinsed three times in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody, rinsed again in PBS, and examined by a Leika fluorescence microscope coupled to a CCD camera, equipped with a ×100 oil immersion lens.RESULTSp38 MAPK Phosphorylation of Thr56 and Ser87 Bcl-2 Residues Induces Release of Cythocrome c from Mitochondria: Biological Evidence and Relevance—A variety of protein kinases, including the MAPK family members, have been reported to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation (16Chen C.Y.

By transfecting lymphoid cells with Bcl-2 mutants in which each Thr56, Ser87, Ser70, and Thr74 was substituted with alanine, we demonstrated that only T56A and S87A Bcl-2 mutants protected cells from apoptosis induced by p38 MAPK activation, thus indicating these sites as possible targets of the kinase (14Torcia M.

Following insertion of recombinant proteins in the membranes, activated p38 MAPK was added to the reaction mixture, and the release of cytochrome c was assessed as a measure of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic function. Fig. 1A shows that, after 2 h of incubation, p38 MAPK induced the release of cytochrome c from Bcl-2 WT-bearing mitochondria, and the phenomenon was inhibited by SB203580, a pyrimidyl imidazole-specific inhibitor of the enzyme (29Lee J.C. Kassis S. Kumar S. Badger A. Adams J.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). By contrast, the p38 MAPK-induced release of cytochrome c was not evident from mitochondria bearing the Bcl-2 Δloop and was strongly decreased from Bcl-2 S87A or Bcl-2 T56A mutants compared with that elicited from Bcl-2 WT-bearing mitochondria. Consistently, the Bcl-2 T56A/S87A double mutant-bearing mitochondria were completely resistant to p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 1B). Moreover, p38 MAPK failed to induce release of cythochrome c from mitochondria not exposed to Bcl-2, thus indicating that the Bcl-2/p38 MAPK interaction was causally related to the observed phenomenon, as previously demonstrated (14Torcia M. De Chiara G. Nencioni L. Ammendola S. Labardi D. Lucibello M. Rosini P. Marlier L.N. Bonini P. Dello S.P. Palamara A.T. Zambrano N. Russo T. Garaci E. Cozzolino F. J. Biol.

The reaction mixtures were separated on one-dimensional SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and gel slices corresponding to phosphorylated or native Bcl-2 protein were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Digested peptides were extracted from gels, dried, and analyzed for mass differences by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Table 1, by monitoring the single charged ions of the two serine- and threonine-carrying fragments, two peptides, referred to hereafter as peptides A and B, respectively, were identified.TABLE 1Peptides deriving from trypsin digestion of Bcl-2 proteinPeptideBcl-2 sequence(M + H)+ molecular weightA27-633,596.69B69-982,886.62 Open table in a new tab First, we focused our analysis on peptide A, since peptide B contains the three potentially phosphorylatable residues Ser70, Ser87, and Thr74, a condition not allowing the identification of the exact site phosphorylated by p38 MAPK. The unphosphorylated sample was used as negative control. Both the +80 mass (corresponding to the phosphate group) of the peptide A (as monoprotonated) and its phosphate fragment were detected in the p38 MAPK-phosphorylated sample. Fig. 2 shows enlarged portions, corresponding to peptide A mass range, of mass spectra of the peptide mixture from untreated Bcl-2 digest (Fig. 2A) and p38 MAPK-treated Bcl-2 digest (Fig. 2B).

However, the mechanism by which Rex-1 is regulated in pluripotent cells remains unresolved. Here we report that Nanog, an Nk-2 homeodomain protein known for its role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency, is a transcription activator for the Rex-1 promoter. Knockdown of Nanog in embryonic stem cells resulted in a reduction of Rex-1 expression, whereas forced expression of Nanog in P19 stimulated Rex-1 expression. Employing a Rex-1 reporter, we demonstrate that Nanog transactivates Rex-1 directly. Serial deletion studies mapped the Nanog-responsive element between –187 and –286 of the Rex-1 promoter. Although Oct-3/4 and Sox2 can both transactivate Rex-1 promoter, only Sox2 cooperates with Nanog in up-regulating Rex-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the C terminus of Nanog is responsible for transactivating the Rex-1 promoter, a function that can be substituted for by a viral transactivator Vp16 efficiently in NIH3T3 cells but less so in P19 cells. Taking these findings together, we conclude that Rex-1 is a direct target of Nanog, which is augmented by Sox2 and Oct-3/4.

Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both EC and ES cells can be induced to differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells by treatment with retinoic acid (RA) with the down-regulation of pluripotency markers such as Rex-1 (1Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J. Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5623-5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 2Rogers M.B. Hosler B.A. Gudas L.J.

In addition to being a well known pluripotent marker, Rex-1 has also been implicated in regulating the pluripotent state. F9 cells lacking both alleles of Rex-1 (Rex-1–/–) differentiate into the parietal endoderm, as indicated by the expression of several parietal endoderm markers such as thrombomodulin and laminin B1 upon RA induction, whereas wild type F9 cells require both RA and cyclic AMP analogs to differentiate into parietal endoderm (4Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On the other hand, F9 Rex-1–/– cells were unable to differentiate into the visceral endoderm lineage after RA treatment, suggesting that Rex-1 may regulate the differentiation of F9 cells along several distinct cell lineages in early embryogenesis (4Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 195: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism governing the expression of Rex-1 during early development and differentiation remains largely unknown. The promoter of Rex-1 has been shown to contain an octamer motif that is required for its activity in undifferentiated F9 cells and is involved in RA-mediated down-regulation (5Hosler B.A. Rogers M.B. Kozak C.A. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2919-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis has demonstrated that Oct-3/4 and Oct-6 can regulate the activity of Rex-1 promoter through this octamer motif in a dose-dependent manner (6Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Sox2, a member of the HMG (high mobility group) domain DNA-binding protein family, forms a ternary complex with Oct-3/4 protein on the enhancer element of Fgf4 and regulates its expression as a binary complex (7Ambrosetti D.C.

Nanog is a newly identified transcription factor that maintain mouse ES cells in the pluripotent state independently of leukemia inhibitory factor (9Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K.

We have recently demonstrated that Nanog functions as a transcription activator through binding to a consensus recognition motif determined by SELEX, despite the fact that Nanog was originally proposed as a transcription repressor to inhibit the expression of genes important for cell differentiation (9Mitsui K.

Interestingly, Nanog is regulated by an adjacent pair of highly conserved Octamer- and Sox-binding sites through an interaction between Oct-3/4 and Sox2 (13Kuroda T. Tada M. Kubota H. Kimura H. Hatano S. Suemori H. Nakatsuji N. Tada T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Our recent work has demonstrated that transcription factors Oct-3/4, Nanog, Sox2, and FoxD3 anchor a negative feedback loop to maintain the expression of pluripotent factors at a steady state (14Pan G.-j. Li J. Zhou Y.-L. Zheng H. Pei D. FASEB J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence that Rex-1 is regulated by Nanog, Oct-3/4, and Sox2 at the transcription level. Cell Lines and Plasmids—Cells (293T, NIH3T3, P19, and F9) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells, CGR8 cell lines, described in Ref. 10Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Austin S.

All culture supplements were from Invitrogen. The expression plasmids Nanog, Oct-3/4, Sox2, Dmu-mSox2, and FoxD3 have been described or will be detailed elsewhere (12Pan G.J. Pei D.-Q.

Nanog-GFP was made by cloning the full-length Nanog cDNA into EcoRV site in-frame to a FLAG and GFP coding sequence in vector-pCR3.1. Nanog N1 was described previously (12Pan G.J. Pei D.-Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Vp16 chimera was prepared by inserting a PCR fragment encoding amino acids of the Vp16 activation domain to the modified N1 mutant. Rex-1 promoter fragments were amplified by PCR from the mouse liver genome DNA and inserted into the SmaI site of a promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The forward primers were: 5′-ccttgccacagcctcaccctgatag-3′ for the promoter of 1500-bp Rexp1500; 5′-cggctgccaatgcattttttaaaacgc-3′ for the promoter of 1000-bp Rexp1000; 5′-tggaaaaagttcaggcaactagtgtac-3′ for the promoter of 500-bp Rexp500; 5′-gaggtactgagatgtgactgagtctca-3′ for the promoter of 286-bp Rexp286; and 5′-cgacccaagacaaggggacagctct-3′ for the promoter of 187-bp Rexp187). The reverse primer was 5′-ctccttggacccctccctttttagatg-3′. The Nanog siRNA construct was prepared by inserting annealed oligonucleotides encoding a double-stranded RNA for Nanog to pBSU6 vector. The target sequence is ggg aac gcc tca tca atg cct for Nanog. A complete GFP expression cassette, including a cytomegalovirus promoter, GFP coding sequence, and poly(A), was inserted into the siRNA vector for the purpose of visualization. RT-PCR—Total RNAs were extracted form NIH3T3, P19, F9, and ES cells (and from the P19 and F9 cells transfected with Nanog-GFP and Nanog siRNA, respectively), using TRIzol reagent (Sangon, Shanghai, China; or an RNA kit from Qiagen). First strand cDNAs were synthesized and analyzed by PCR to detect the expression of Nanog, Rex-1, and β-actin. The Nanog primers were: forward, 5′-gcggactgtgtgttctctcaggc-3′; reverse, 5′-ttccagatccgttcaccagatag-3′. The Rex-1 primers were: forward, 5′-tgacaaaggggacgaagcaagag-3′; reverse, 5′-gccatcaaaaggacacacaaag-3′. The β-actin primers were: forward, 5′-cggctccggcatgtgcaaag-3′; reverse, 5′-aggggccacacgcagctcattg-3′. Amplification following hot start (94 °C for 5 min) was carried out for 25 cycles for β-actin, 25 cycles for Nanog, and 30 cycles for Rex-1. For real-time PCR, the Nanog primers were: forward, 5′-ctcaagtcctgaggctgaca-3′; reverse, 5′-tgaaacctgtccttgagtgc-3′. The Rex-1 primers were: forward, 5′-aggccagtccagaataccag-3′; reverse, 5′-taggtatccgtcagggaagc-3′. The β-actin primers were: forward, 5′-agtgtgacgttgacatccgt-3′; reverse, 5′-tgctaggagccagagcagta-3′. Transfection and Reporter Assay—All cells were seeded in 24 wells and transiently transfected with Rex-1 promoter reporters (0.25 μg/well) and effector plasmids (control empty vector, Nanog expression construct, and Nanog siRNA vector) with increasing doses (0.25–0.75 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. pCMV-Renilla plasmid (200 ng/transfection, Promega) was included in each transfection as an internal reference, and the amount of total DNA for each transfection was normalized to the same level using the control pCR3.1 empty vector. 24 h later, cells were lysed in 50 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a TD2020 luminometer (Turner Design). Each transfection was replicated at least twice and carried out in duplicate. We use Student's t test to assess whether the difference between two means was significant (p value at 0.05). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—For ChIP assays, F9 cells were cultured in three 100 cm2 dishes. The cells were washed in PBS and then incubated in 1% formaldehyde dissolved in PBS for 10 min at room temperature for cross-linking. Then 0.125 m glycine was added to stop the reaction. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and collected in 0.5 ml of PBS and 1× protease inhibitor. After centrifugation (2000 rpm, 2 min, 4 °C), the cells were lysed in 0.6 ml of ChIP sonication buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor) and sonicated to an average fragment length of 2000 bp. The fragments were collected by centrifugation and then supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor and bovine serum albumin (0.1%). The chromatin preparations were divided into three portions. One portion was precipitated with Nanog antibody (5 μl), the second portion was precipitated with nonimmune antibody as control, and the third was stored as input (positive control for further experiments) at 4 °C on a rotator overnight. The complexes were absorbed in 40 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μg of herring sperm DNA (Promega) per sample and incubated for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The resins were then washed once with PBS, once with high salt wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and once with PBS. The complexes were eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.01 mg/ml herring sperm DNA). Then the cross-links were reversed by adding 20 μl of NaCl per sample and incubation at 65 °C for 3–4 h. After digestion with proteinase K for 1 h at 55 °C, DNAs were extracted and precipitated before being analyzed by PCR using the primers: forward, 5′-gaggtactgagatgtgactgagtctca-3′; reverse, 5′-ctccttggacccctccctttttagatg-3′. Regulation of Rex-1 Expression by Nanog—Nanog and Rex-1 are two transcription factors for which mRNA is expressed at relatively high levels in pluripotent cells, including ES cells and F9 EC cells, but diminishes during the differentiation of these ES and EC cells or normal embryonic development (1Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J.

Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). As Nanog is a critical factor in maintaining the self-renewal of ES cells and Rex-1 is a commonly used ES cell marker gene (1Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J. Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5623-5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S.

Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar), we attempted to establish a regulatory relationship between them. We first knocked down the expression of Nanog in ES cells by a Nanog siRNA construct (14Pan G.-j. Li J. Zhou Y.-L. Zheng H. Pei D. FASEB J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) and extracted the RNA from the ES cells transfected with either the control vector (pBSU6 vector) or the Nanog siRNA construct (14Pan G.-j. Li J. Zhou Y.-L. Zheng H. Pei D. FASEB J. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar) 72 h after transfection for RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Nanog siRNA inhibited the expression of endogenous Nanog (bottom panel, lane 3 versus 2). Interestingly, the mRNA of Rex-1 was also inhibited in ES cells transfected with the Nanog siRNA construct (Fig. 1A, middle panel, lane 3 versus 2), suggesting that Rex-1 is regulated by Nanog. One may argue that the decline of Rex-1 expression in ES cells with Nanog knocked down (Fig. 1A) may be the consequence of ES differentiation triggered by the suppression of Nanog expression by Nanog siRNA. To establish a direct relationship between Nanog and Rex-1, we activated Rex-1 by Nanog in cells that normally express no or very little Rex-1. Indeed, P19 cells appear to express no detectable Rex-1 mRNA (1Hosler B.A. LaRosa G.J. Grippo J.F. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5623-5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and a much reduced level of Nanog as well (10Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Austin S. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). To this end, we transfected P19 cells with either pCR3.1GFP or pCR3.1-NanogGFP and extracted their RNAs 48 h post-transfection for RT-PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, we observed the induction of Rex-1 by Nanog in P19 cells (middle panel, lane 3 versus 2), whereas the mRNAs for actin are comparable in both cells and those for Nanog were elevated as expected (top and bottom panels). Because Rex-1 expression decreases during retinoic acid induced differentiation in F9 cell, we then determined the expression kinetics of both Nanog and Rex-1 during F9 cell differentiation. As shown in Fig. 1C, both Rex-1 and Nanog declined about 40% after 48 h of RA treatment (lane 3 versus 1). Between 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4), Nanog declined faster than Rex-1 during RA treatment, and the level of Rex-1 and Nanog mRNA both declined to about 20% at 96 h (lane 5 versus 1). These results suggest that Nanog regulates the expression of Rex-1, perhaps in conjunction with other regulatory proteins. Nanog Activates the Rex-1 Promoter in Both differentiated and Pluripotent Cells—We then screened several more cell lines for Rex-1 expression by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, mouse ES cells and F9 EC cells express Rex-1 as detected by RT-PCR, whereas P19 and NIH3T3 do not (lanes 4 and 5 versus 2 and 3). This expression pattern suggests that Rex-1 is regulated differentially in these cells. Furthermore, these cell lines could serve as models to characterize the mechanism of Rex-1 regulation. To this end, we cloned a 1529-bp-long promoter of Rex-1 into pGL-Basic vector bearing the luciferase reporter (Fig. 2B), designating it as Rexp1500. As shown in Fig. 2C, the activity of this reporter functions as expected with relatively high activities in F9 and ES cells and no or lower activities in P19 and NIH3T3 cells, in agreement with the Rex-1 mRNA levels shown in Fig. 2A. To test whether Nanog can transactivate Rex-1 promoter directly, we cotransfected the Rex-1 reporter together with the control or Nanog expression constructs into NIH3T3, P19 and F9 cells. Luciferase activities in these cells were determined, normalized (with Renilla), and are presented in Fig. 2D. Nanog up-regulated the Rex-1 reporter significantly in NIH3T3 (>3-fold), P19 (1.5-fold), and F9 (1.4-fold) cells compared with the control expression vector (Fig. 2D, lanes 2, 4, and 6 versus lanes 1, 3, and 5). Although Nanog can activate Rex-1 promoter in both differentiated cells (NIH3T3) and pluripotent cells (P19 and F9), the magnitude of activation appears to be greater in NIH3T3 cells than in P19 and F9 cells, perhaps because of the high endogenous levels of Nanog in both of the latter cells (data not shown). To test this possibility, we tested the dependence of Rex-1 expression in F9 cells by knocking down Nanog through siRNA in F9 cells. We considered F9 cells an ideal model because of high levels of expression for both endogenous Nanog and Rex-1 mRNAs (10Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Austin S. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). First, we tested the efficiency of Nanog knockdown by extracting the mRNA of the cells transfected with pBSU6-GFP and siNanog. As shown in Fig. 2F, Nanog siRNA inhibited most of the expression of endogenous Nanog after a 24-h transfection (top panel, lane 3 versus 2). Then we cotransfected the Rex-1 reporter construct with control and the Nanog siRNA constructs into F9 cells and measured luciferase activities 24 h later. As shown in Fig. 2E, the Nanog siRNA construct inhibited the Rex-1 reporter significantly (3.8-fold) compared with the control siRNA vector (lane 3 versus 2), demonstrating that Nanog plays a critical role in sustaining Rex-1 promoter activity. Localization of Nanog-responsive Element between –187 and –286 in Rex-1 Promoter—Recent evidence from our group demonstrated that Nanog activates a reporter construct bearing multiple copies of its consensus binding motif (11Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nanog activates its downstream target directly through DNA binding. To localize the DNA sequence that is responsive to Nanog-mediated activation, we generated a series of promoter deletion constructs (shown in Fig. 3A) bearing Rex-1 promoter sequences up to –1000, –500, –286, and –187, respectively, from the transcription start site at +1. To assess their responsiveness to Nanog, we transfected these deletion constructs with Nanog expression vector into P19 cells. A constant amount (0.25 μg) of each deletion Rex-1 promoter construct was cotransfected with control vector (Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17) or increasing amounts of the Nanog expression construct (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4, 6–8, 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20), respectively, to measure a dose-dependent activation of the reporter by Nanog in P19 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, the luciferase activities driven by Rexp1500, Rexp1000, Rexp500, and Rexp286 Rex-1 promoter sequences were stimulated by Nanog in a dose-dependent fashion (lanes 5–20), whereas those by Rexp187 were not (lanes 1–4). Therefore, these results suggest that Nanog bind to the Rex-1 promoter between –187 and –286. Interestingly, the luciferase activities driven by Rexp1500 and Rexp1000 were less responsive than the Rexp500 and Rexp286 to Nanog, suggesting that additional effectors may modify the Nanog-mediated activation of Rex-1. Nanog has been shown to bind an ATTA-containing motif (9Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar, 15Loh, Y.-H., Wu, Q., Chew, J.-L., Vega, V. B., Zhang, W., Chen, X., Bourque, G., George, J., Leone, B., Liu, J., Wong, K.-Y., Sung, K. W., Lee, C. W. H., Zhao, X.-D., Chiu, K.-P., Lipovich, L., Kuznetsov, V. A., Robson, P., Stanton, L.

We then screened the Rex-1 promoter between –187 to –286 and found a similar sequence at –244 (ATTC). To determine whether this motif is responsible for Nanog-mediated activation of Rex-1, we designed and generated four mutations within this motif (Fig. 3C, upper portion). Reporters bearing these mutations were analyzed by co-transfecting increasing amounts of the Nanog in P19 cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4, 6–8, 10–12, 14–16, and 18–20). As shown in Fig. 3C, the luciferase activities driven by 286-mut-1, 286-mut-2, 286-mut-3, and 286-mut-4 mutant promoter sequences were no longer responsive to Nanog (lower portion, lanes 5–20), whereas Rexp286 was responsive to Nanog in a dose-dependent fashion (lanes 1–4). These results demonstrate that the ATTC motif is responsible for Nanog-mediated activation of Rex-1 promoter. To confirm the binding of Rex-1 by Nanog inside the cells, we performed ChIP analysis in ES, F9, and NIH3T3 cells. Anti-Nanog antibody was able to precipitate the chromatin fragments bearing the 287-nucleotide sequence of Rex-1 in ES and F9 cells, whereas anti-IgG antibody could not, as shown in Fig. 3D (top and middle panels, lane 2 versus lane 1). As a negative control, no binding was observed in NIH3T3 cells, which expressed no detectable Nanog (Fig. 3D, bottom panel, lane 2). These results demonstrate that Nanog binds to the Rex-1 promoter directly at nucleotide –244. Regulation of Rex-1 Promoter by Sox2 and Oct-3/4 but Not FoxD3—Recent data from ChIP-on-ChIP experiments revealed that Nanog, Sox2, and Oct-3/4 co-occupy common sites on the Rex-1 promoter of their target genes (16Bhattacharya B. Miura T. Brandenberger R. Mejido J. Luo Y. Yang A.X. Joshi B.H. Ginis I. Blood. 2004; 103: 2956-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Because Oct-3/4 can bind to the OCTA site on the Rex-1 promoter as described (6Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), we tested whether Oct-3/4 and its partner Sox2 could activate Rex-1 promoter. We cotransfected the Rexp500 constructs with increasing amounts of Sox2, FoxD3, or Oct-3/4 into 293T, NIH3T3, and P19 cells and measured their activities, as described in the legend for Fig. 4. As expected, Oct-3/4 activated the Rex-1 promoter significantly in 293T and P19 cells but not in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, the Oct-3/4 partner, Sox2, activated the Rex-1 promoter in an almost identical pattern (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 1 and 8–10), whereas FoxD3 did not have any effect on the Rex-1 promoter in any of these cells (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 1 and 5–7). These results clearly demonstrated that whereas either Sox2 or Oct-3/4 could activate the Rex-1 promoter, Foxd-3 could not. Furthermore, neither Sox2 nor Oct-3/4 could activate the Rex-1 promoter in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 4B), in contrast to Nanog (Fig. 2D). We further evaluated whether Sox2 activated Rex-1 specifically. We cotransfected the Rexp500 reporter with a Sox2 mutant, Dmu-mSox2, which has much lower activity. 4W. Shi, H. Wang, G. Pan, Y. Geng, Y. Guo, and D. Pei, manuscript in preparation. As expected, Dmu-mSox2 activated the Rexp500 reporter poorly in 293T and P19 cells (Fig. 4, B and C, lanes 11–13). The fact that Nanog, Oct-3/4, and Sox2 can all activate the Rex-1 promoter raises the possibility that these proteins may synergize with each other. To test this possibility, we cotransfected Nanog alone or in combination with Oct-3/4, Sox2, and Dmu-mSox2 with Rexp500 in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4D, Sox2 appear to be able to superactivate the Rex-1 promoter already activated by Nanog (lanes 3 and 4 versus 2), whereas Dmu-mSox2 failed to do so. On the other hand, Oct-3/4 plus Nanog and Oct-3/4 plus Sox2 failed to achieve any additional activation beyond the activity of Oct-3/4, Nanog, or Sox2 alone (data not shown). Unfortunately, the cooperativity among these three factors could not be demonstrated in P19 cells, suggesting that additional proteins may participate in the regulation of Rex-1. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that Nanog is able to regulate Rex-1 with Sox2. Role of Nanog C Terminus in Mediating Rex-1 Activation—We have shown previously that the C-terminal domain of Nanog contains the main transactivation activity toward synthetic reporter constructs bearing Nanog-binding sites (11Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Pan G.J. Pei D.-Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the C terminus of Nanog is responsible for the observed activation of Rex-1. To this end, we tested the N1 Nanog mutant against the Rex-1 reporter. As shown in Fig. 5B, N1 is about one-third as active as the wild type Nanog in activating Rexp500 in NIH3T3 cells (lane 3 versus 1). However, N1 appeared to be inactive against Rex-1 reporter in P19 cells (Fig. 5C, lane 3 versus 1). Together, these data demonstrate that the C terminus of Nanog is required for Nanog-mediated Rex-1 activation. Given the fact that CD2 of Nanog is a potent transactivator, even comparable with the most active transactivator Vp16 from human herpesvirus (12Pan G.J. Pei D.-Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we constructed a chimera between Nanog and the transactivation domain from the viral protein Vp16 of human herpesvirus (Fig. 5A) and tested its activity on Rex-1 reporter. As shown in Fig. 5B, the chimera is a very robust activator of Rex-1 reporter in NIH3T3, outperforming the wild type Nanog significantly (Fig. 5B, lane 4 versus 2). Curiously, the same chimera is less active than the wild type Nanog in P19 cells, suggesting that the C terminus of Nanog interacts with factors that are specifically expressed in P19 or ES cells in mediating Rex-1 activation. We report here that Nanog can regulate the expression of Rex-1 by binding to its promoter. This regulation is likely mediated by the C-terminal transactivator of Nanog. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that Sox2, not Oct-3/4, appears to cooperate with Nanog in regulating Rex-1 activity, suggesting that Rex-1 is under the control of a network of transcription factors. Rex-1 is regulated by multiple transcription factors. As a well known and much analyzed marker for stem cell pluripotency, Rex-1 has attracted considerable attention recently. However, little is known about why Rex-1 is expressed only in ES and EC cells (2Rogers M.B. Hosler B.A. Gudas L.J. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, Oct-3/4 has been identified as a regulator of Rex-1 expression (6Ben-Shushan E. Thompson J.R. Gudas L.J. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1866-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our findings in this study suggest that two additional factors known to regulate stem cell pluripotency, Nanog and Sox2, also regulate Rex-1 expression. These results reveal for the first time a validated target for Nanog. Furthermore, it appears that Nanog cooperates with Sox2 in regulating Rex-1 expression. Interestingly, we detected little cooperativity between Oct-3/4 and Nanog, suggesting that these two factors may be functioning in the same pathway. Surprisingly, Oct-3/4 and Sox2, known to regulate fgf4 cooperatively, exhibited no cooperativity toward Rex-1 promoter. Thus, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 may regulate common targets but through distinct mechanisms. We reported earlier that Nanog regulates gene transcription through two strong transactivation domains at the C terminus, the CD2 and W-repeat domains, employing synthetic reporters (11Pan G. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1401-1407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Pan G.J. Pei D.-Q. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we show for the first time that these two C-terminal domains are required for Nanog to activate a natural promoter from an important ES cell marker, Rex-1. Although the role of the C-terminal domain of Nanog in maintaining stem cell pluripotency remains unclear, the fact that it is involved in Rex-1 expression suggests that it plays an important role in ES cell self-renewal. The interactive partner for the C terminus of Nanog has not been identified. The Rex-1 promoter-based reporter of this study may serve as an important tool to evaluate Nanog function at the biochemical level and may help to unravel the role of Nanog in mediating stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency.

As measured by media lactate dehydrogenase levels, and staining with propidium iodide, acute exposure to low micromolar concentrations of the Aβ1-42 oligomer significantly induced cell death. This was accompanied by activation of the ERK1/2 signal transduction pathway in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. Notably, this resulted in caspase-3 activation by a process that led to proteolytic cleavage of Tau, which was recently confirmed to occur in AD brains. Tau cleavage likely occurred in the absence of overt synaptic loss, as suggested by the preserved levels of synaptophysin, a presynaptic marker. Moreover, among the pharmacological agents tested to inhibit several kinase cascades, only the ERK inhibitor significantly attenuated Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced toxicity concomitant with the reduction of activation of ERK1/2 and caspase-3 to a lesser extent. Importantly, the caspase-3 inhibitor also decreased Aβ oligomer-induced cell death, with no appreciable effect on the ERK signaling pathway, although such treatment was effective in reducing caspase-3 activation and Tau cleavage. Therefore, these results suggest that local targeting of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to reduce Tau cleavage, as occurs with the inhibition of caspase-3 activation, may modulate the neurotoxic effects of soluble Aβ oligomer in the hippocampus and provide the rationale for symptomatic treatment of AD.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, fibrillar Aβ1-42 can induce ERK activation, and sustained activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, mediated by fibrillar Aβ, can lead to abnormal phosphorylation of Tau, the generation of dystrophic neurites, and progressive neuronal degeneration (22.Ferreira A. Lu Q. Orecchio L. Kosik K.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 220-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23.Rapoport M. Ferreira A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the signaling events associated with neurotoxicity triggered by soluble Aβ oligomer in the AD brain are largely unknown. On the other hand, a potential role for the proteolytic cleavage of Tau, the microtubule-stabilizing protein, in fibrillar Aβ-induced neuronal degeneration, has also been implicated. A previous study showed that truncated Tau was present in AD brains but not in age-matched controls (24.Novak M. Kabat J. Wischik C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In addition, the cleavage of Tau, by caspases, has been demonstrated both in neurons treated with aggregated Aβ and in AD brains (25.Rapoport M. Dawson H.N. Binder L.I. Vitek M.P. Ferreira A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6364-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 26.Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F.

Alzheimers Dis. 2005; 7: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies provided evidence supporting a key role of truncated Tau either by caspases or calpain in fibrillar Aβ-induced neurodegeneration and enhancement of pathological Tau filament assembly in neurons. Interestingly, Aβ-mediated Tau cleavage appears to occur as an early event that may precede hyperphosphorylation, in the evolution of the AD tangle pathology (27.Rissman R.A. Poon W.W. Blurton-Jones M. Oddo S. Torp R. Vitek M.P. LaFerla F.M. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These findings imply that aberrant Tau truncation, in addition to Tau hyperphosphorylation, may represent novel cellular mechanisms functionally linking amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in AD. However, despite such extensive studies of the fibrillar form of Aβ, as a key neuropathological factor in AD, there is little known about the precise role of the soluble Aβ oligomer in the modulation of neuronal loss and the molecular basis for the altered signal transduction associated with neurotoxicity in response to this molecule in the hippocampus, a region that is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of AD and that underlies the type of memory deficit detected in early AD (29.Backman L. Small B.J. Fratiglioni L. Brain. 2001; 124: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Furthermore, few studies have tried to understand how Aβ oligomer affects Tau cleavage and how the Aβ oligomer may modulate this process at the molecular level. Therefore, this study investigated the intracellular signaling mechanisms triggered by soluble Aβ oligomer, and determined how they correlate with the Aβ oligomer-mediated neurotoxic effect on the hippocampus. By using a rat organotypic hippocampal slice culture, which maintains the cytoarchitecture of the intact brain, direct toxicity of Aβ1-42 oligomer was determined by measuring the propidium iodide (PI) uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. We also assessed whether caspase-3 activation mediates Aβ1-42 oligomer-induced neuronal cell death in the hippocampus. Finally, the Aβ oligomertriggered signaling cascade, and specifically ERK1/2 activation, was assessed to determine its relation to Aβ oligomer-induced apoptotic cell death. To this end, we analyzed the effect of the Aβ oligomer on the proteolysis of Tau, recently identified as a downstream substrate of caspase-3 (26.Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Investig. 2004; 114: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), and we evaluated the modulation of Tau proteolysis by the ERK inhibitor in comparison with the caspase-3 inhibitor. Our data constitute the first evidence that Aβ oligomer-induced toxicity in the hippocampus occurs through the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade. In addition, this study posits a possible link between Aβ oligomer-mediated toxicity and Tau cleavage, which occurs through caspase-3 activation upon stimulation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade, in AD pathology. Materials—Specific inhibitors of several protein kinases, including U0126 (an inhibitor MAPK kinase kinase (MEK1/2)), SB202580 (an inhibitor of p38 MAPK), SP600125 (an inhibitor of Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)), SB216763 (an inhibitor of GSK-3β), and LY294002 (an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) were all obtained from Calbiochem. The general caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, the caspase-3 specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, and the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, were also obtained from Calbiochem. PI, nucleic acid stain, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-Aβ 6E10 was purchased from Signet Labs, Inc. (Dedham, MA). Anti-β-actin antibody and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Preparation of Homogeneous Populations of Amyloid Peptide Monomer and Oligomer—Aβ1-42 peptide was synthesized as described previously (3.Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar). Soluble Aβ1-42 monomers and oligomers were prepared as described previously (30.Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 mg of Aβ1-42 peptide was dissolved in 400 μl of hexafluoroisopropanol for 10-20 min at room temperature, and 100 μl of the resulting seedless solution was added to 900 μl of doubledistilled water in a siliconized Eppendorf tube. After a 10-20-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant fraction (pH 2.8-3.5) was transferred to a new tube and subjected to a gentle stream of N2 for 10 min to evaporate the hexafluoroisopropanol. Vehicle was prepared the same way except with no peptide. The monomer solutions were used immediately after evaporation of hexafluoroisopropanol. For soluble oligomers, the samples were then stirred at 500 rpm using a Teflon-coated micro stir bar for 48 h at 22 °C. Aβ1-42 oligomer was confirmed by dot blot assay using oligomer-specific A11 antibody (3.Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) and was further verified by Western blotting using 6E10 antibody as described below. Hippocampal Slice Cultures—All experimental procedures were carried out under protocols approved by the University of California, Irvine, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as described previously (31.Fan R. Tenner A.J. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal slice cultures were prepared from 10-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA). Slices were cut at 400 μm on a McIlwain tissue chopper, transferred to Millicell (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membrane inserts (0.4 μm), and placed in 6-well culture plates. The upper surfaces of the slices were exposed to a humidified 37 °C atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Slice culture media consisted of basal Eagle's medium with Earle's balanced salt solution, 20% heat-inactivated horse serum, and the following supplements: 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.7 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 26.7 mm HEPES, 26.6 mm l-glutamine, 48 mm l-(+)-glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin, pH 7.25. The medium was changed every other day. Slices were examined periodically for viability, and any dark or abnormal slices were discarded. Experimental Treatment—On days 10-11 post-dissection, treatment of the slices was started. All reagents were added to serum-free medium (no horse serum), which was equilibrated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 before their addition to the slices. Monomeric or oligomeric Aβ1-42 was added to slice cultures as described previously (31.Fan R. Tenner A.J. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, slices were pretreated with various pharmacological agents, as described in the text. All concentrations were selected on the basis of the maximal effects of these drugs on their specified targets. Peptide was then added to cultures in serum-free medium at various concentrations up to 2 μm as noted in the text. Vehicles were treated the same way except with no peptide. The effect of vehicle alone on cell viability was not detectable. At the indicated times after treatment initiation, slices were rinsed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, then harvested by removing the Millicell membrane insert after freezing samples on dry ice, and processed for immunoblotting as described below. Assessment of Neuronal Cell Death—To visualize neuronal cell death, hippocampal slices were stained by adding PI into the culture medium at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (5 μg/ml of media) throughout the Aβ or vehicle treatment, and the degree of hippocampal neuronal death was evaluated by microscopic observation of PI uptake as described previously (32.Belmadani A. Kumar S. Schipma M. Collins M.A. Neafsey E.J. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 2093-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33.Zou J.Y. Crews F.T. Brain Res. 2005; 1034: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). PI is a polar compound that is not toxic to neurons and is impermeable to an intact cell membrane, but it penetrates damaged cell membranes of dying cells and binds to nuclear DNA to generate a bright red fluorescence. PI fluorescence images were captured at different time points after treatment as indicated. The PI images were recorded with an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy, Göttingen, Germany) with an AxioCam (Zeiss) digital camera controlled by AxioVision program (Zeiss). Images were analyzed with the KS 300 analysis program (Zeiss) and neuronal cell death, in the different cultures, was expressed as an arbitrary unit of PI uptake. Lactate Dehydrogenase Activity—LDH enzymatic activity in the culture medium was used to evaluate the extent of cellular damage produced in cultured slices subjected to the different treatments as described previously (34.Li M. Pisalyaput K. Galvan M. Tenner A.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium was collected after incubation of slices, as indicated in the figures, and from the vehicle-treated control cultures. 100-μl aliquots of culture media were taken for determination of LDH activities using Tox-7 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's directions. The activity was expressed as the relative percentage of neuronal death using respective values for vehicle- or Aβ1-42-treated slice cultures as 100%. Dot Blot Assay—The monomeric and oligomeric Aβ peptides were prepared as described above and applied to nitrocellulose membrane. Dot blot assay was performed as described previously (3.Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the membrane was blocked with 3% nonfat milk in TBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris base, and 0.1% Tween 20; pH 7.4) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed with TBS-T and probed with anti-oligomer A11 antibody (1:5,000) or 6E10 (1: 5,000) in 1% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, it was probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase- or antimouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody solution (1:3,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were developed by using ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). PAGE and Western Blotting—Immunoblotting was carried out as recently described in detail (31.Fan R. Tenner A.J. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 185: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34.Li M. Pisalyaput K. Galvan M. Tenner A.J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, slices were homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with the protease inhibitors pepstatin (2 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The protein concentration was determined by the method of BCA (Pierce). Equal amounts (20 μg) of sample proteins were separated according to their molecular weight on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After transfer, membranes were blocked with 3% milk in TBS-T for 0.5 h. Membranes were probed with the primary antibody diluted with 1% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The following antibodies were used: anti-Tau ((clone Tau-5); 1:1000; Pharmingen), anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:1000; Promega, Madison, WI), anti-ERK1/2 (1:1000; Promega, Madison, WI), anti-synaptophysin (1:3000; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), and anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma). The signal was obtained using the ECL system after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Densitometric values were normalized using β-actin as internal controls as indicated. Aβ oligomer present in the slice culture media after 24 h of incubation was detected under nondenaturing condition using 6E10 antibody, which detects all forms of Aβ. Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using the fluorometric caspase-3 activity assay kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence was measured after cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate (DEVD) labeled with a fluorescent molecule, 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC), to AFC by caspase-3. Briefly, hippocampal slices, treated with 2 μm Aβ1-42 oligomer as described above, were harvested in extraction buffer and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was incubated with the caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-AFC) for 1 h at 37°C. The fluorescence was assessed using a fluorescent plate reader with a 400 nm excitation and a 505 nm emission according to the manufacturer's protocol. Caspase-3 activity is expressed as a relative percentage of vehicle- or Aβ1-42-treated samples as 100%. Tau in Vitro Cleavage Assay—For experiments using purified caspase-3 (Sigma), total lysates were prepared from hippocampal slices and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants (20 μl) were then incubated with recombinant caspase-3 (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C, as described previously (35.Kelly B.L. Vassar R. Ferreira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31746-31753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by adding 1 volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using Tau-5 antibody that recognizes total Tau. Protease Inhibitor Treatment—To inhibit caspase activation, the caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-fmk or Ac-DEVD-CHO were added to the medium of hippocampal slice cultures 1 h prior to and for the duration of the Aβ treatment. The supernatants, prepared as described above, were subjected to Western blot analysis using Tau antibodies. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. of the values from the number of experiments indicated in the corresponding figures. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance with an unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Treatment of Cultured Hippocampal Slices with Aβ1-42 Oligomer Increases PI Uptake and LDH Release—Homogeneous populations of Aβ monomer and prefibrillar Aβ oligomers were prepared as described above. As shown in Fig. 1A, the oligomeric Aβ preparation was confirmed by dot blot assay using a conformationally directed antibody against amyloid oligomers (larger than tetramer), A11, which is highly specific for toxic oligomer subspecies as characterized (3.Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar, 36.Lesné S. Koh M.T. Kotilinek L. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yang A. Gallagher M. Ashe K.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). The monomeric preparation contained a small amount of detectable Aβ oligomers. This Aβ oligomer preparation was shown to have an approximate molecular mass of ∼90 kDa by size exclusion chromatography, contained very little material of lower molecular mass, and consisted of spherical vesicles with diameters of ∼3-5 nm (30.Demuro A. Mina E. Kayed R. Milton S.C. Parker I. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17294-17300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that this Aβ oligomer was detected as a stable, SDS-resistant band, corresponding to an ∼24-mer, in the culture medium from Aβ oligomer-treated slices after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 1B). In order to investigate the direct toxic effect of the Aβ1-42 oligomer on neuronal viability, in the organotypic hippocampal slices, we first examined the degree of cell death by measuring the PI uptake and LDH release. PI uptake has been confirmed as an accurate quantitative measure of neuronal death in hippocampal slice cultures with other measures of neuronal death, including release of LDH (32.Belmadani A. Kumar S. Schipma M. Collins M.A. Neafsey E.J. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 2093-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33.Zou J.Y. Crews F.T. Brain Res. 2005; 1034: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The organotypic hippocampal slice culture is a good model system to study the mechanisms of neurodegeneration. This is because several features of hippocampal circuitry, including the maturation of synapses, receptors, and intrinsic fiber pathways, are preserved in vivo, and the preparation is well suited for prolonged pharmacological treatment and recovery, which would be difficult to perform in an intact animal system (37.Holopainen I.E. Lauren H.B. Neuroscience. 2003; 118: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38.Noraberg J. Poulsen F.R. Blaabjerg M. Kristensen B.W. Bonde C. Montero M. Meyer M. Gramsbergen J.B. Zimmer J. Curr. Drug Targets CNS Neurol. Disord. 2005; 4: 435-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the amount of LDH in the media containing hippocampal slices treated with the Aβ1-42 oligomer was significantly increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner above control levels, indicating that cell death had occurred. Exposure to 1 μm Aβ1-42 oligomer for 24 h increased the percentage of LDH release to approximately 3.5-fold over the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2A), and there was approximately a 6-fold increase in the degree of cell death when the concentration of Aβ1-42 oligomer was increased to 2 μm (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the LDH results, Aβ1-42 oligomer caused a time-dependent increase in PI uptake in the hippocampus, which was first detectable within 10 h and continued to increase at 24 h (Fig. 3, B and C). Exposure to 0.5 μm Aβ1-42 oligomer for 24 h induced PI uptake, which was evident in the hippocampal CA1, a region important for memory formation but not seen in vehicle-treated slices. The degree of PI uptake clearly increased, and the area of staining extended to other hippocampal regions when the c"

https://openalex.org/W1988104771,"We determined the impact of HER2 signaling on two proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), and on an antiangiogenic factor, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). Re-expression of HER2 in MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cells that endogenously express low levels of HER2 resulted in elevated expression of VEGF and IL-8 and decreased expression of TSP-1. Inhibition of HER2 with a humanized anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab, or Herceptin) or a retrovirus-mediated small interfering RNA against HER2 (siHER2) decreased VEGF and IL-8 expression, but increased TSP-1 expression in BT474 breast cancer cells that express high levels of HER2. These in vitro results were further evaluated by treatment of BT474 xenografts in immunosuppressed mice with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab inhibited growth of BT474 xenografts and decreased microvascular density associated with downregulation of VEGF and IL-8 and with upregulation of TSP-1 expression. Inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway decreased VEGF and IL-8 expression. AKT1 overexpession increased VEGF and IL-8 expression, but did not increase TSP-1 expression. A p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, instead blocked TSP-1 expression and a p38 activator, MKK6, increased TSP-1 expression. Trastuzumab stimulated sustained p38 activation and SB203580 attenuated the TSP-1 upregulation induced by trastuzumab. HER2 signaling therefore influences the equilibrium between pro- and antiangiogenic factors via distinct signaling pathways. Trastuzumab inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth, at least in part, through activation of the HER2-p38-TSP-1 pathway and inhibition of the HER2-PI3K-AKT-VEGF/IL-8 pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2069949978,"Claudins form a large family of tight junction proteins that have essential roles in the control of paracellular ion flux and the maintenance of cell polarity. Many studies have shown that several claudin family members are abnormally expressed in various cancers. In particular, CLDN4 (encoding claudin-4) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer. However, although CLDN4 overexpression is well established, the mechanisms responsible for this abnormal regulation remain unknown. In the present study, we delineate a small region of the CLDN4 promoter critical for its expression. This region contains two Sp1 sites, both of which are required for promoter activity. However, because of the ubiquitous expression of Sp1, these sites, although necessary, are not sufficient to explain the patterns of gene expression of CLDN4 in various ovarian tissues. We show that the CLDN4 promoter is further controlled by epigenetic modifications of the Sp1-containing critical promoter region. Cells that overexpress CLDN4 exhibit low DNA methylation and high histone H3 acetylation of the critical CLDN4 promoter region, and the reverse is observed in cells that do not express CLDN4. Moreover, the CLDN4-negative cells can be induced to express CLDN4 through treatment with demethylating and/or acetylating agents. Because CLDN4 is elevated in a large fraction of ovarian cancer, the mechanism leading to deregulation may represent a general pathway in ovarian tumorigenesis and may lead to novel strategies for therapy and an overall better understanding of the biology of this disease.

Claudins are major components of tight junctions, which are essential in the control of paracellular ion flux and the maintenance of cell polarity. The presence of phosphorylation sites and PDZ-binding motifs in claudins suggest a role in signal transduction for these proteins (1Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

So far, 23 members of the claudin family have been identified, and the expression of the various claudins has been shown to vary among or even within tissues, probably depending on the exact physiological requirements (1Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). The gene for claudin-4, CLDN4, is normally expressed in the epithelial cells of colon mucosa, mammary gland, renal tubules, and thyroid gland. Recently, several claudin genes have been shown to be abnormally expressed in human malignancies (4Morin P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9603-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In particular, CLDN4 has now been shown to be significantly elevated in several malignancies such as breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovary (4Morin P.J.

In ovarian cancer, we and several other groups have shown that the genes for CLDN3 and CLDN4, as well as their corresponding proteins (claudin-3 and-4) are frequently up-regulated (5Hough C.D.

Because many CA125-negative ovarian cancers overexpress these claudins, they may represent diagnostically useful biomarkers for this disease (11Rosen D.G. Wang L. Atkinson J.N. Yu Y. Lu K.H.

Furthermore claudin-3 and claudin-4 are receptors for the cytotoxic Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (12Katahira J. Sugiyama H. Inoue N. Horiguchi Y. Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26652-26658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and intra-abdominal administration of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin might represent an interesting new avenue for ovarian cancer therapy (13Santin A.D.

Although the exact roles of claudin overexpression in cancer remain unclear, recent data suggest that CLDN3 and CLDN4 overexpression may lead to increased invasion, motility, and cell survival in ovarian cells (14Agarwal R. D'Souza T. Morin P.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7378-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting important roles for these proteins in ovarian tumorigenesis. In addition, there is evidence that CLDN4 may be elevated in cisplatin-resistant tumors (15Stewart J.J. White J.T. Yan X. Collins S. Drescher C.W. Urban N.D. Hood L. Lin B. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In trying to clarify the regulation of CLDN4, recent work has shown that in mouse Eph4 and CSG1 epithelial cells, Snail suppressed Cldn4 expression (16Ikenouchi J. Matsuda M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have also been shown to induce CLDN4 expression in a human gastric cancer cell line (17Mima S. Tsutsumi S. Ushijima H. Takeda M. Fukuda I. Yokomizo K. Suzuki K. Sano K. Nakanishi T. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms leading to CLDN4 overexpression in ovarian and other cancers remain unclear. In the present study, we investigate the transcriptional regulation of CLDN4 gene in ovarian cancer cells and report that Sp1 is crucial for CLDN4 promoter activity. In addition, we find that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modification also play important roles in the regulation of this gene. Cell Lines and Tissue Samples—Ovarian cancer lines OVCAR-4, OVCAR-5, UCI101, HEY, and BG-1 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A growth medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 2The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; siRNA, small interfering RNA; MeCP2, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2; MBD2, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2; MeCP1, methyl-CpG-binding protein 1; TSA, trichostatin A; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Ovarian cancer cell line A2780 was cultivated in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 μg/ml human recombinant insulin (Invitrogen), and antibiotics. HOSE-B, an ovarian surface epithelial cell line immortalized with E6 and E7 (18Gregoire L. Munkarah A. Rabah R. Morris R.T. Lancaster W.D. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was cultivated in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. ML-3, an SV40-immortalized ovarian cystadenoma cell line (19Luo M.P. Gomperts B. Imren S. DeClerck Y.A. Ito M. Velicescu M. Felix J.C. Dubeau L. Gynecol. Oncol. 1997; 67: 277-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was cultivated in McCoy's supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. C32, a melanoma cell line, was cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Ten frozen primary ovarian cancers were obtained through the Collaborative Human Tissue Network Gynecologic Oncology Group (Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH). In addition, four paraffin-embedded ovaries were obtained from the Department of Pathology of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (Baltimore, MD). Primary T cells were kindly given by Dr. Vishwa Deep Dixit (NIA, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD). Isolation of Promoter Fragments and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The 5′ region (-1866 to +188, relative to the major transcriptional start site, as determined by ovarian expressed sequence tag analysis) of human CLDN4 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid was designated pGL3-C4P(-1866). Nested deletions of the CLDN4 promoter were made from pGL3-C4P(-1866) using an Exo III/mung bean deletion kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After narrowing down the critical promoter region, three putative transcription factor-binding sites (two sites for Sp1, designated as Sp1A and Sp1B, and one site for PPUR) were identified by using the Transcription Element Search System (TESS) (Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and TFSEARCH (Real World Computing Partnership, Tokyo, Japan). A mutant construct for each of the putative transcription factorbinding sites was made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cell Transfection and Reporter Assay—Transfection experiments of BG-1 and A2780 cells were performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were grown in 12-well tissue culture plates so that the cell layer was 50-60% confluent on the day of transfection. For each well, 50 μ l of medium containing 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 was mixed with 500 ng of reporter plasmid and 50 ng of pCMVβ-gal vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). For OVCAR-5, transfection was done at 80% cell confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For each well, 1.6 μg of each reporter plasmid and 160 ng of pCMVβ-gal mixture in 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen) was transfected with 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted with 100 μl of OPTI-MEM I. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the firefly luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiency, and each luciferase activity was calculated relative to that of the pGL3 Promoter vector (Promega). All of the experiments were repeated three times in duplicate. 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) and Trichostatin A (TSA) Treatment—A2780 cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 μm) of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-dC (Sigma) for 48 h and histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA (Sigma). TSA was added for the last 24 h at a final concentration of 300 nm. UCI101, HEY, HOSE-B, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-4, and BG-1 cells were treated with 10 μm of 5-aza-dC for 48 h either without TSA or with 300 nm of TSA for the last 24 h. Quantitative Analysis of CLDN4 mRNA Levels by Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from cell lines (treated or untreated) and ovarian cancer tissue samples according to the manufacturer's protocol. In tissues, cancer cells were manually microdissected using hematoxylinstained frozen sections of these ovarian cancer samples under a microscope according to the NCI protocol (cgap-mf.nih.gov/Protocols/). One μg of total RNA was used to generate cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The SYBR Green I assay and the 7300 real time PCR system (PE Applied Biosystems) were used for detecting the PCR products of CLDN4 as described (6Rangel L.B.A. Agarwal R. D'Souza T. Pizer E.S. Alò P.L. Lancaster W.D. Gregoire L. Schwartz D.R. Cho K.R. Morin P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2567-2575PubMed Google Scholar). The comparative CT method (PE Applied Biosystems) was used to determine the relative CLDN4 expression level of each sample using the CT value observed in untreated A2780 cells as reference. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase values were used for normalization. Relative CLDN4 expression levels of other cell lines, UCI101, HEY, HOSE-B, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-4, and BG-1, were calculated in similar fashion. Immunoblotting—Ninety percent confluent cell cultures were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), and whole cell lysates were made using cell lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, and 2% SDS). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Twenty μg of total proteins were separated by 14% SDS-PAGE (Trisglycine gels; Invitrogen) for claudin-4 immunoblotting and 10-20% SDS-PAGE for Sp1 and Sp3 immunoblotting and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), probed with the primary antibody (anti-claudin-4, 1:250 (Invitrogen); anti-Sp1, 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Sp3, 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)), washed, and incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, 1:10,000; Amersham Biosciences). For detection, enhanced chemiluminescence was carried out using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Bisulfite Sequencing of CLDN4 Promoter—Ovarian cancer cells or normal ovarian surface epithelial cells were isolated using a PALM MicroLaser System (P.A.L.M. Mirolaser Technologies, Bernried, Germany) from frozen or paraffin-embedded sections, respectively. Genomic DNA extraction and treatment of genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite were performed according to available protocols (www.protocol-online.org/prot/Detailed/3160.html). Genomic DNA of cell lines and primary human T cells were extracted using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) and treated as described above. To investigate DNA methylation profiles surrounding the Sp1-binding sites, bisulfite sequencing was performed. PCR amplifications of the relevant regions was performed using the following primers: for the 231-bp sequence, forward 5′-GAGATTGGATAGTGATTTAGGGATT and reverse 5′-CAAACCAACAAATATAAACAAACCA, and for the 335-bp sequence, forward 5′-TGGAAGGAATTGGTTTGTTTATATT and reverse 5′-CATAAACCCTCCCAAATAATCTAC. The thermal cycle conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s and then 72 °C for 15 min. PCR fragments were ligated into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Following transformation, plasmids from individual bacterial colonies were isolated, and the PCR fragments were sequenced. The DNA methylation profile of each sample was determined by the sequence results of at least five clones. Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from BG-1 cells were prepared using a TransFactor extraction kit (Clontech) and quantified using the BCA assay kit (Pierce). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (sequences available from the authors) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Radiolabeled probes (1 × 105 cpm) were incubated with 3 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20 μl of binding reaction (7.5% glycerol, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 500 ng of salmon sperm DNA) for 30 min at room temperature. For competition assays, a 100-fold excess amount of unlabeled competitor was premixed with radiolabeled probe before being added to the binding mixture. To demonstrate the presence of Sp1 protein in the DNA-protein complex, nuclear protein extracts were preincubated at room temperature with 2 μ g of specific antibodies (Sp1 and Sp3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min before incubating with the radiolabeled wild type DNA probes. The reaction products were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 2.5 h. The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed overnight to a Phosphor Screen. The relevant protein-DNA probe complexes were quantified with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ) using ImageQuant software. In Vitro Methylation of the Critical CLDN4 Promoter Region—Plasmids pGL3-C4P(-105) containing the critical CLDN4 promoter region and pGL3-C4P(-49), which lacks this region, were in vitro methylated by HhaI, HpaII, and SssI methylases (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The extent of methylation was verified by digesting the methylated DNA with restriction enzymes HhaI, HpaII, and BstUI (New England Biolabs), respectively. The unmethylated control (mock), consisted of pGL3-C4P(-105) and pGL3-C4P(-49) mixed with all of the components required for in vitro methylation except methylases. Nuclease Accessibility Assay—The nuclei of BG-1, OVCAR-4, OVCAR-5, and A2780 cells were prepared as described (20Gerber A.N. Klesert T.R. Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) with minor modifications and digested with restriction enzyme Eco0109I (New England Biolabs). DNA from Eco0109I-digested nuclei was amplified by PCR with primer sets of CL4P-N-1 (5′-CTGAGACTGGATAGTGACTC-3′), CL4P-N-3 (5′-AGCCATATAACTGCTCAACC-3′), and CL4P-N-5 (5′-TTGCACCGTGAGTCAGGAG-3′), and the PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The primer set of CL4P-N-1 and CL4P-N-5 and the set of CL4P-N-3 and CL4P-N-5 were designed to amplify a 272-bp fragment (-177 to +95) and a 129-bp fragment (-34 to +95), respectively. ChIP Assay—A detailed protocol is available from the authors upon request. Briefly, BG-1 and A2780 cells (3.0 × 107 cells/cell line) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were harvested with SDS lysis buffer, and DNA was sheared to 200-1000 bp by sonication. After preclearing the lysates, 4 μg of specific antibodies (anti-Sp1, anti-MBD2, and anti-acetylated histone H3; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; anti-Sp3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-MeCP2, abcam, Cambridge, MA) were used to immunoprecipitate the protein-DNA complexes. DNA was quantified by real time PCR using CLDN4-specific primers. The primers for the CLDN4 promoter region were 5′-TGCCTTTGTTGGCCTGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGCGCAAGCCAGCAAGTG-3′ (reverse). Each experiment was repeated three times. RNA Interference—RNA interference was achieved by using siRNA pools of Sp1 and Sp3 (SMARTpool reagent; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). A functional, nontargeting siRNA (siCONTROL™ nontargeting siRNA number 1; Dharmacon) was used as a control for potential nonspecific effects caused by siRNA transfection. BG-1 cells were transfected at 80% confluency with Lipofectamine 2000 (100 nm of each siRNA pool). The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection, and whole cell lysates were prepared using the lysis buffer described above. Identification of a Critical CLDN4 Promoter Region—To delineate a critical region within the promoter of CLDN4, a nested series of reporter plasmids containing various lengths of the promoter region were constructed (Fig. 1A). These constructs were transfected into BG-1, OVCAR-5, and A2780 cell lines for the analysis of promoter activity. BG-1 and OVCAR-5 were chosen as representatives for CLDN4-expressing cells, and A2780, which has very little amount of CLDN4 mRNA, was chosen as nonexpressing cells (CLDN4 expression was measured by real time RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1A, the luciferase activity of all three cell lines decreased significantly from clone pGL3-C4P(-105) to clone pGL3-C4P(-49), suggesting the presence of important promoter elements between bp -105 and -49. Although A2780 cells only express low levels of CLDN4 mRNA, the patterns of luciferase activity for the different constructs in this line were similar to the patterns measured in BG-1 and OVCAR-5, two cell lines expressing high levels of CLDN4. The same pattern of luciferase activity was also found in three additional ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-4, HOSE-B, and UCI101), regardless of their CLDN4 expression status (data not shown), suggesting additional mechanisms of CLDN4 gene regulation in vivo. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the CLDN4 Promoter—Using the TESS and TFSEARCH software to scan the minimal promoter region identified above, we found two putative binding sites for Sp1 (labeled Sp1A and Sp1B) and one PPUR putative binding site. Reporter constructs containing mutated sequences for each of these sites, as well as clones pGL3-C4P(-105) and pGL3-C4P(-49), were transfected into BG-1, OVCAR-5, and A2780 cells. Mutating either of the Sp1 sites brought the promoter activity level down to basal level in all three lines, but mutation of the PPUR site did not significantly affect luciferase activity (Fig. 1B), clearly implicating the Sp1 sites as essential for the activity of the minimal CLDN4 promoter region. Again, the promoter activity patterns were similar in all three lines regardless of endogenous CLDN4 expression. These findings indicate that the basal transcription machinery, in which Sp1 is involved, is intact in A2780 cells, and that mechanism(s) are involved in silencing CLDN4 in low expressing cells such as the A2780 cell line. Induction of CLDN4 mRNA and Protein Expression by 5-aza-dC and TSA—We next considered the possibility of epigenetic modification of the CLDN4 promoter as a mechanism of silencing in nonexpressing cells. A2780 cells were treated with 5-aza-dC and TSA to investigate the involvement of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, respectively, in CLDN4 gene silencing. 5-aza-dC treatment of the A2780 cell line led to dose-dependent increases in CLDN4 mRNA 49.8-fold from basal level, and these increases were synergistically enhanced 252-fold by adding TSA to the cultures (Fig. 2A). TSA itself also induced CLDN4 mRNA 9.6-fold from the basal level (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, although the claudin-4 protein is not expressed in A2780, it was induced by treatment with 5-aza-dC and TSA. However, there was no direct correlation between mRNA and protein levels (see immunoblot in Fig. 2A), suggesting additional mechanisms of regulation. To explore epigenetic modification of the CLDN4 promoter in other ovarian cell lines, UCI101, HEY,HOSE-B,OVCAR-5,OVCAR-4, and BG-1 cells were also treated with 5-aza-dC and TSA, and the levels of CLDN4 were measured by real time RT-PCR. CLDN4 mRNA was significantly induced with the treatment of 5-aza-dC in UCI101, HEY, and HOSE-B cell lines, which have low basal levels of CLDN4 mRNA (Fig. 2B). In the UCI101 cell line, TSA induced CLDN4 mRNA expression when used alone and synergistically enhanced induction of CLDN4 mRNA with 5-aza-dC, similar to what we observed in A2780 cells (Fig. 2A). However, TSA had no significant effects on CLDN4 promoter activity in HEY and HOSE-B cell lines. 5-aza-dC and TSA did not induce CLDN4 mRNA in OVCAR-5, OVCAR-4, and BG-1 cell lines, all of which already express high levels of CLDN4 mRNA (Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are involved in CLDN4 gene silencing and suggest an absence of silencing by epigenetic modifications in cells that express high levels of CLDN4. DNA Methylation Profile of the Critical CLDN4 Promoter Region—Bisulfite sequencing covering the region between Sp1-binding sites and half of the CpG island, which is located just downstream of the Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 3A), was performed to investigate the methylation profile of the critical CLDN4 promoter region. The DNA fragment amplified for bisulfite sequencing contains a total of 25 CpGs (regions I and II in Fig. 3A). The cell lines and the tissues were divided into two groups: Group 1, which expresses high levels of CLDN4 mRNA (and detectable claudin-4 protein), and Group 2, which expresses lower levels of CLDN4 mRNA (and undetectable claudin-4 protein). Group 1 included four normal paraffin-embedded ovaries that were used to obtain ovarian surface epithelial cells by laser capture microdissection. Two of four normal ovarian surface epithelial cell samples were also used for immunohistochemistry of claudin-4, and its expression was weakly positive in both samples (data not shown). Although sparse DNA methylation was found in the Sp1-binding sites (the CpG site -48) of some cell lines and ovarian cancer tissues in Group 1, the maximum DNA methylation level observed was 20%. Therefore, the Sp1-binding sites can be considered to be hypomethylated in Group 1. The downstream region of Sp1 binding was more methylated, although the maximum DNA methylation level was still under 50%. In OVT-9, the Sp1-binding sites was completely unmethylated. By contrast, DNA methylation levels of the Sp1-binding sites in Group 2 were over 80% except UCI101, in which the DNA methylation level was 20% (Fig. 3C). However, the DNA methylation levels of the other sites in UCI101 were over 40%. Therefore, the Sp1-binding sites can be considered to be hypermethylated in Group 2. In addition to hypermethylation of Sp1-binding sites, the downstream region in Group 2 was also strongly hypermethylated except in ML-3, where the methylation levels was low downstream of the Sp1-binding sites (the CpG sites +88, +112, and +121 had DNA methylation level of 20%). Interestingly, the C32 cell line (melanoma) and normal primary T cells, both of which had low levels of CLDN4, also exhibited hypermethylation of this critical region, suggesting that this mechanism of regulation may not be tissue-specific. Together, these results show that the DNA methylation of the Sp1-binding sites and the downstream region was strongly correlated with CLDN4 gene silencing.FIGURE 3Methylation analysis of the CLDN4 promoter in ovarian cell lines and tissues. A, schematic of the CLDN4 gene showing the CpG island and Sp1-binding sites relative to the 3′-untranslated region, Coding region, and 5′-untranslated region. The nucleotide numbering system is relative to the transcriptional start site. Two regions, I (-175 to +56) and II (+22 to +356), were analyzed by bisulfite sequencing. These two regions encompass the Sp1-binding sites and the 5′-half side of the CpG island. B, DNA methylation profiles of the CLDN4 promoter region in cells expressing high levels of CLDN4.25 CpGs, located from -150 to +332, were scored for their methylation status in 10 primary ovarian cancer cells (OVT1-10), four normal ovarian surface epithelial cells (NOSE1-4), and the indicated cell lines. The basal level of CLDN4 mRNA expression (relative to A2780) is indicated on the right. The expression of claudin-4 in NOSEs was assessed by immunohistochemistry.

We purified macromolecular complexes containing BCL-2 from ER membranes and found that BCL-2 co-purified with the main two subunits of the serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A. The association of endogenous PP2A and BCL-2 at the ER was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and microcystin affinity purification. Knock down or pharmacological inhibition of PP2A caused degradation of phosphorylated BCL-2 and led to an overall reduction in BCL-2 levels. We found that this degradation was due to the action of the proteasome acting selectively at the ER. Conversely, overexpression of PP2A caused elevation in endogenous BCL-2. Most importantly, we found that PP2A knock down sensitized cells to several classes of death stimuli (including ER stress), but this effect was abolished in a genetic background featuring knock in of a non-phosphorylatable BCL-2 allele. These studies support the hypothesis that PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of BCL-2 is required to protect BCL-2 from proteasome-dependent degradation, affecting resistance to ER stress.

Apoptosis is an orderly process of cell demise with distinct morphological and biochemical features (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). The BCL-2 family plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis. There are both pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members that respond to specific death signals to promote or inhibit cell death (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem.

In general, the anti-apoptotic members like BCL-2 display sequence conservation throughout four BCL-2 homology domains (BH1-4). Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 members can be further subdivided into more fully conserved, “multidomain” members possessing homology in BH1-3 domains (e.g. BAX and BAK) or “BH3-only” members that display only ∼9 amino acids of sequence homology within their BH3 domains (e.g. BID, BIM, and BAD) (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis operates at the surface of subcellular organelles, of which the mitochondrion has been extensively studied (3Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Several BCL-2 family members have also been shown to operate at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; OA, okadaic acid; shRNA, small hairpin ribonucleic acid; IP3R-1, type I inositol trisphosphate receptor; UPR, unfolded protein response; LM, light membrane; HM, heavy membrane; IP, immunoprecipitation; WT, wild type; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. The ER is the major storage site for intracellular calcium and is also vital for the modification and secretion of proteins. Consequently, agents that perturb ER function, including those that induce Ca2+ release from the ER (e.g. H2O2) or those that block protein modification/secretion and trigger an unfolded protein response (UPR) (e.g. tunicamycin and brefeldin A), can induce apoptosis (4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). BAX, BAK, and BCL-2 localize to the ER. Deletion of BAX and BAK, or overexpression of BCL-2, causes resistance to death stimuli that operate both through ER Ca2+ and the UPR (6Wei M.C. Zong W.X.

Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Resistance of these cells to Ca2+-dependent death stimuli is due to reductions of resting Ca2+ in the ER (9Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J.

There is evidence that BCL-2 regulates ER Ca2+ in a mechanism involving the type 1 inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R-1) (11Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 12Oakes S.A. Scorrano L.

However, the mechanism by which BCL-2 protects against UPR-mediated death is unclear. In general, regulators of BCL-2 activity at the ER are unknown. To this end, we took an unbiased approach to identify BCL-2-interacting protein partners at the ER membrane. We identified the main two subunits of PP2A, a tripartite serine/threonine phosphatase composed of one catalytic C subunit and one A subunit acting largely as a scaffold, and one of four classes of regulatory B subunits (13Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The activity of several BCL-2 family proteins is regulated by post-translational modifications, and a number of groups have found that BCL-2 phosphorylation results in its inactivation (14Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Simizu S. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated BCL-2 has recently been shown to be predominantly localized to the ER, and mutation of the phosphorylation sites leads to protection against cell death from both classes of ER-dependent death stimuli and affects Ca2+ levels in the ER (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, the coordination of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of BCL-2 by kinases and phosphatases is predicted to regulate BCL-2 activity at the ER. We found that PP2A regulates BCL-2 phosphorylation and subsequent anti-apoptotic activity in an unexpected manner. Modulation of PP2A activity by pharmacological inhibition, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knock down, or protein overexpression revealed that PP2A surprisingly influences proteasome-dependent degradation of phosphorylated BCL-2 at the ER. In summary, here we report that PP2A is a critical regulator of BCL-2 stability and hence the apoptotic threshold of the cell. Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Whole brain was dissected from >30 C57/BL6 mice and homogenized using a glass dounce in isotonic buffer (200 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm Ca2+, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). The homogenate was fractionated by a series of centrifugation steps, first at 600 × g for 10 min (1×) to pellet nuclei and unbroken tissue. Second, the supernatant was centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min (≥3×) to pellet the heavy membrane (HM). Third, the supernatant was centrifuged 280,000 × g (1×) to pellet ER-rich light membrane (LM). The LM pellet was solubilized in 1% CHAPS-containing buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 10% glycerol). To purify BCL-2, the solubilized LM fraction was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 40%. The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed into 1% CHAPS buffer. Proteins were bound to a MonoQ column and eluted off the column with an increasing linear gradient of 0.1 m−1 to m NaCl. Fractions that contained BCL-2 were dialyzed into 1% CHAPS buffer and separated by a Superose 6 column. Positive fractions were dialyzed into 4 mm CHAPS, 800 mm ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed proteins were bound to a TSK-Phenyl column and eluted with a decreasing linear gradient of 0.8-0 m ammonium sulfate. After a final dialysis into 1% CHAPS buffer, the BCL-2 fractions were separated through a Superdex 200 column. Proteins were identified by silver staining (Bio-Rad) and subsequent liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry sequencing using a Deca XP instrument (Thermo Finnigan). PP2A peptides were identified using XCorr cut-off values of 1.8, 2.1, and 2.8 for 1+, 2+, and 3+ peptides, respectively, and a dCN value of 0.08. Cell Lines—Jurkat T cells were transfected with hBCL-2WT or hBCL-2 T69A,S70A,S87A = hBCL-2AAA (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell.

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from C57/BL6 wild-type or mBCL-2AAA knock-in mice were transformed with SV40 genomic DNA, and clones of similar growth and morphology were selected. 5M. C. Bassik, unpublished results. Wild-type or BCL-2AAA knock-in MEFs were transduced by lentivirus with shRNA directed at mPP2AC (1-CGGCAGATCACACAAGTGTAT; 2-GCTGCTATCATGGAATTAGAT; 3-GCCCAATGTGTGATCTCTTAT) or mPP1C (1-GCTGTTTGAGTATGGTGGCTT; 2-CGTGGTGTCTCCTTTACCTTT). shPP2AC and shPP1C vectors were courtesy of Harvard/MIT Broad Institute RNAi Consortium. Transduced MEFs were selected in 2 μg/ml of puromycin. SV40-transformed BCL-2null MEFs expressing hBCL-2 were transduced by lentivirus with shPP2AC or shPP1C. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells immortalized with hTERT, H-Ras, and large T antigen (20Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar) were transduced by retrovirus with shB56γ or B56γ and selected for green fluorescent protein expression by flow cytometry (21Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K.T. Plattner C.A. Pallas D.C. Hahn W.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 supplanted with β-mercaptoethanol, minimal amino acids, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. MEFs were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplanted with minimal amino acids, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK cells were grown in minimal Eagle's medium α containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunoprecipitation—Brain ER was solubilized in 1% CHAPS buffer, precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate, and dialyzed back into 1% CHAPS buffer. To immunoprecipitate BCL-2, 1 mg of ER protein was incubated with 10 μg of IgG and 10 μl of protein A/G beads for 2 h. The beads were spun down, and supernatant lysate was transferred to a fresh tube. Concurrently, 20 μg of BCL-2 N-19 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was incubated with 30 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) for 2 h. The beads were washed with 1 ml of 1% CHAPS buffer, and the precleared lysate was incubated with antibody-bound beads overnight. Following overnight incubation, beads were washed three times with 1% CHAPS buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. To immunoprecipitate PP2A and avoid co-migration of the Ig light chain with BCL-2, 1 mg of ER protein was incubated with PP2A A subunit 6F9 antibody (Covance) covalently coupled to a gel matrix using a ProFound co-immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce). To immunoprecipitate B56γ, mouse monoclonal antibodies were generated from full-length B56γ3 (distributed by Novus or Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Western blotting antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml. Subcellular Fractionation—1.5 liters of hBCL-2-expressing Jurkat T cells were incubated with 10 nm okadaic acid or vehicle for 24 h. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 3 ml of Jurkat cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma) to create whole cell lysate. The remaining cells were suspended in HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma). Cells were disrupted using a glass dounce, followed by passage through 27- and 30-gauge needles (10 times for each). The crude fraction containing nuclei and unbroken cells was removed at 600 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 7000 × g to pellet the HM fraction. The subsequent supernatant was centrifuged two more times to pellet the HM pellet, followed by centrifugation at 280,000 × g to bring down the LM fraction. The HM pellet was resuspended in HIM buffer and spun down once more at 600 × g and then 7000 × g. The resulting HM pellet was resuspended in HIM buffer, where an aliquot was lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer. The remaining HM pellet was further purified from contaminating LM using a Percoll gradient (22Danial N.N. Gramm C.F. Scorrano L. Zhang C.Y. Krauss S. Ranger A.M. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Licklider L.J. Lowell B.B. Gygi S.P. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Samples were run on Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE containing 10% acrylamide to assess BCL-2 phosphorylation (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cell Death Assay—Wild-type or BCL-2AAA knock-in MEFs transduced with shPP2AC 1 or control vector were treated with tunicamycin, brefeldin A, thapsigargin, H202, taxol, etoposide, and staurosporine (all purchased from Sigma) as indicated in the figure legends. Annexin-V-Cy3 (Biovision) was used according to the manufacturer and quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated from MEFs using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers using Superscript III. Real-time PCR was performed for bcl-2 (forward primer, 5′-AGTACCTGAACCGGCATCTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCTGAGCAGGGTCTTCAGAG-3′) as previously described using Ribosome protein L4 for normalization (forward primer, 5′-AAGATGATGAACACCGACCTTAGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCTTCTCTGGAACAACCTTCTCG-3′) (23Wei G. Guo J. Doseff A.I. Kusewitt D.F. Man A.K. Oshima R.G. Ostrowski M.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1374-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purification of BCL-2-interacting Partners at the Endoplasmic Reticulum—The ER-enriched light membrane fraction from mouse brain was solubilized in 1% CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent previously shown to preserve the conformation of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members (24Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). CHAPS concentrations up to 1% yielded BCL-2 in high molecular weight complexes as assessed by native gels (data not shown). BCL-2 was first purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by four sequential chromatography steps of MonoQ, Superose 6, TSK-Phenyl, and Superdex 200 (Fig. 1, A and B). BCL-2-containing column fractions from the final Superdex 200 separation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and sequenced by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (Fig. 1C). The proteins enriched in these fractions were subunits of the vacuolar ATPase, SNAP-α, SNAP-γ, synaptogyrin, and α-contractin (actin homolog). These band assignments had either weak mass spectrometry coverage or their associations with BCL-2 could not be verified by co-immunoprecipitation (IP). Calcineurin, a well characterized BCL-2 protein partner (25Shibasaki F. Kondo E. Akagi T. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was also identified, validating our purification scheme (Fig. 1C). This association was verified by co-IP of endogenous ER proteins (Fig. 1D). Among the protein species identified, two that had the largest coverage by mass spectrometry corresponded to 65 and 36 kDa and were identified as components of the same enzyme complex. 12 peptide sequences covering 32% of the 65-kDa band identified the A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and 6 peptide sequences covering 26% of the 36-kDa band identified the C subunit of PP2A (Fig. 1C). The anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-2 is known to be influenced by phosphorylation specifically at the ER (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); however, the phosphatase involved has never been identified. Although there are reports that PP2A associates with BCL-2, the ER had never been considered to host an interaction between the two proteins (26Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). More importantly, mechanisms by which dephosphorylation regulates the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-2 have remained unclear. Therefore, we decided to examine in detail the interaction of PP2A and BCL-2 at this organelle. We first verified a previous finding that PP2A is capable of dephosphorylating BCL-2 in vitro (26Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Because PP2A has never been thought to interact with BCL-2 at the ER, we next used IP of endogenous brain ER proteins to confirm that PP2A co-precipitated with BCL-2 at this organelle (Fig. 1D). Additional evidence for a PP2A-BCL-2 ER complex comes from purification from ER fractions with beads coupled to microcystin, an approach previously used to purify PP1 and PP2A enzyme complexes (28Moorhead G. MacKintosh R.W. Morrice N. Gallagher T. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). PP2A Inhibition Using Okadaic Acid Leads to Degradation of Phosphorylated BCL-2—To examine the effect of PP2A-mediated BCL-2 dephosphorylation, we treated Jurkat T cells that stably express hBCL-2 with okadaic acid (OA), another PP1/PP2A inhibitor. These cells have been previously used to follow the phosphorylation status of BCL-2 by molecular weight shift and by using an antibody to phospho-serine 70 (S70P) (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), although additional sites are also most likely phosphorylated. We treated the cells with several concentrations of OA. Low concentrations of OA up to 10 nm led to an increase of hyperphosphorylated BCL-2, consistent with previous reports (26Deng X. Ito T. Carr B. Mumby M. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34157-34163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Simizu S. Tamura Y. Osada H. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, bracket 1). To determine where in the cell PP2A affects BCL-2 phosphorylation, we incubated cells with 10 nm OA and fractionated them into mitochondria-containing heavy membrane and ER-containing light membrane (Fig. 2B). We found that the HM fraction contained significant LM contamination until being further purified through a Percoll gradient (Fig. 2B). OA caused a phosphorylation shift of BCL-2 in contaminated HM, but this phosphorylation shift disappeared in pure mitochondrial HM (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the phosphorylation shift was readily apparent in the LM, which is free of mitochondrial contamination and argues that PP2A principally regulates BCL-2 at the ER. Hyperphosphorylated BCL-2 levels were reduced as OA levels were increased. (Fig. 2A, bracket 2). The biphasic nature of this response suggested that OA might enhance levels of phosphorylation at lower concentrations and enhance the degradation of the phosphorylated species at higher concentrations. Co-incubation of cells with MG132 stabilized the phosphorylated form of BCL-2 at high OA concentrations, arguing that phospho-BCL-2 is specifically targeted for proteasome degradation and influences endogenous BCL-2 levels (Fig. 2C). BCL-2 is phosphorylated in response to microtubule-damaging agents such as taxol at Thr-69, Ser-70, and Ser-87 (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Mutation of these sites (BCL-2AAA) abolishes the ability of taxol to induce BCL-2 hyperphosphorylation (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). To determine whether PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation specifically targets Thr-69, Ser-70, and Ser-87, hBCL-2AAA-expressing Jurkat cells were treated with 30 nm OA and MG132. In contrast to wild-type (WT) hBCL-2, OA and MG132 incubation of hBCL-2AAA cells resulted in no phosphorylation shift (Fig. 2D). Knock Down of PP2A Catalytic Subunit Causes a Decrease in Endogenous BCL-2 That Is Dependent on BCL-2 Phosphorylation—Because OA is a general PP1/PP2A inhibitor, we wanted to investigate the role of PP2A in BCL-2 regulation more specifically. Therefore, we obtained shRNAs against the C β catalytic subunit of mPP2A (shPP2AC). Partial knock down of PP2AC caused a reduction in the level of endogenous BCL-2 without a corresponding decrease in BCL-2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine whether phosphorylation is a prerequisite for PP2A-mediated degradation, we expressed shPP2AC in MEFs derived from BCL-2AAA knock-in mice. Knock-in MEFs have similar protein levels of BCL-2 as WT MEFs in the whole cell lysate and the ER fraction.5 Although PP2AC was reduced to a similar degree in BCL-2AAA MEFs as in WT, endogenous BCL-2 protein levels were preserved in the BCL-2AAA setting (Fig. 3C). This finding further supports our hypothesis that phosphorylation of BCL-2 is required for its degradation in vivo. It was interesting that the differences in BCL-2 protein levels were still apparent even though shPP2AC appeared to give an incomplete knockdown. PP2AC levels may reflect the fact that the antibody used sees both the C α and β isoforms of the catalytic subunit or the fact that substantial loss of PP2AC is lethal and could select out cells with complete PP2AC knockdown (30Gotz J. Probst A. Ehler E. Hemmings B. Kues W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12370-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The other major phosphatase affected by OA, PP1, was also examined in comparison with PP2A. We observed almost complete knock down of the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1C) using two separate shRNA vectors with no effect on BCL-2 levels (Fig. 3D). In contrast, three unique shRNA vectors to PP2AC all caused significant reductions in BCL-2 (Fig. 3D). Because the S70P antibody specifically recognizes overexpressed human phospho-BCL-2 (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), we transduced shPP2AC and shPP1C into bcl-2−/− MEFs that express hBCL-2. BCL-2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by shPP2AC with no change in non-phosphorylated protein, in agreement with our Jurkat cell data (Fig. 3E). shPP1C did not influence BCL-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). We attempted to further demonstrate that PP2A affects BCL-2 levels by overexpressing PP2AC in WT MEFs. In contrast to inhibition, PP2A overexpression resulted in enhancement of BCL-2 protein levels (Fig. 3F). Together, these findings argue that PP2A influences total BCL-2 protein levels by modulating its phosphorylation. Proteasome-dependent degradation involves the modification of protein substrates by ubiquitin. To determine whether BCL-2 is ubiquitinated, hBCL-2 MEFs were lysed and hBCL-2 was isolated by IP and probed for ubiquitin. Multiple high molecular weight ubiquitin bands were observed and enhanced when proteasome activity was inhibited by MG132, suggesting that BCL-2 is modified by ubiquitination (Fig. 3G). Knock Down of PP2A Regulatory Subunit B56γ Mimics Knock Down of the Catalytic Subunit—As an alternative approach to inhibit PP2A activity without deleterious effects to cells, we knocked down one of the regulatory B subunits of PP2A. Knock down of regulatory subunit B56γ has been demonstrated to reduce intracellular phosphatase activity of PP2A, and B56 has been reported to associate with BCL-2 (21Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K.T. Plattner C.A. Pallas D.C. Hahn W.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 31Ruvolo P.P. Clark W. Mumby M. Gao F. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To determine whether B56 influences BCL-2 degradation, we obtained immortalized HEK epithelial cells that express shRNA against B56γ. Like shPP2AC, shB56γ caused a significant decrease in BCL-2 protein levels in HEK cells with no effect on BAX (Fig. 4A). The reduction of BCL-2 most likely reflects a degradation of the phosphorylated species, although our S70P antibody does not detect endogenous BCL-2 phosphorylation. We assessed whether B56 regulates BCL-2 degradation via proteasome activity by adding MG132 to the medium. MG132 treatment led to an elevation of BCL-2 protein in shB56γ HEK cells, suggesting that BCL-2 is degraded by the proteasome in these cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, BCL-XL protein levels were not affected by MG132 in shB56γ HEK cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, overexpression of B56γ elevated the protein levels of BCL-2 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, modulation of B56γ expression levels can phenocopy modulation of PP2AC with respect to BCL-2 protein levels. Together, these data support the hypothesis that hyperphosphorylated BCL-2 is targeted for degradation through the proteasome. Endogenous BCL-2 Phosphorylation Affects the Sensitivity of the Cells to Death Stimuli when PP2AC Is Knocked Down—To investigate whether cell death is affected by PP2A-mediated phosphorylation/degradation of BCL-2, we examined several death stimuli in shPP2AC MEFs. WT MEFs that express shPP2AC (Fig. 3A) were significantly more sensitive to both tunicamycin and brefeldin A, two death stimuli that trigger UPR-mediated death by blocking protein modification/secretion at the ER (Fig. 5, A and C). To determine whether this enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis was due to BCL-2 phosphorylation or other cellular targets of PP2A, we examined the same stimuli in BCL-2AAA knock-in MEFs expressing shPP2AC (Fig. 3C). shPP2AC had no effect on tunicamycin- or brefeldin A-induced cell death in BCL-2AAA MEFs (Fig. 5, B and D). These data suggest that BCL-2 dephosphorylation status is the major mechanism through which PP2A regulates apoptosis driven by ER/UPR stress, arguing against a pleiotropic effect of PP2AC knock down on cellular survival. Thapsigargin induces UPR-mediated death by blocking ER Ca2+ uptake, and shPP2AC again sensitized WT cells to this death stimulus (Fig. 5E). BCL-2AAA knock-in MEFs were also sensitized by shPP2AC but to a lesser extent than in the WT setting (Fig. 5F). This suggests that BCL-2 phosphorylation is not as important for PP2A to regulate thapsigargin-induced death as it is for tunicamycin- or brefeldin A-induced death. We next examined other classes of cell death inducers. H2O2 generates oxidative stress that triggers ER Ca2+ release. Of three H2O2 concentrations tested, only one led to differences between WT and BCL-2AAA MEFs. WT shPP2AC MEFs were significantly more sensitive to 400 μm H2O2 than vector control cells but significantly less so in the BCL-2AAA setting (Fig. 5, G and H). However, there was minimal difference in sensitivity between WT and BCL-2AAA using 200 and 600 μm H2O2, suggesting that, like thapsigargin, BCL-2 phosphorylation has a far lesser role for PP2A to regulate H2O2-induced death. Death stimuli that are known to be affected by BCL-2AAA, but do not signal directly through the ER, were also tested (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Taxol triggered significantly more cell death in WT shPP2AC cells than those with control, but the difference was reduced in the BCL-2AAA setting (Fig. 5, I and J). Treatment of WT shPP2AC MEFs with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, resulted in significantly more cell death than treatment of WT control MEFs, but there was no difference in the BCL-2AAA setting (Fig. 5, K and L). Therefore, PP2A and BCL-2 phosphorylation can affect death stimuli not specific to the ER and is consistent with the ability of BCL-2 and PP2A to associate elsewhere in the cell. We also used staurosporine, a pan-kinase inhibitor that triggers classic mitochondrial apoptosis. WT shPP2AC MEFs were slightly more sensitive to staurosporine compared with control, but to a lesser degree than to the other death stimuli tested (Fig. 5M). In addition, staurosporine sensitized BCL-2AAA shPP2AC MEFs to approximately the same degree as in the WT setting (Fig. 5N). Thus, PP2A does not require BCL-2 phosphorylation for sensitizing cells to staurosporine. A number of groups have observed that phosphorylation attenuates the anti-apoptotic activity of BCL-2 (14Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying this effect has largely remained incompletely understood. In this study we describe a model whereby phosphorylation regulates BCL-2 activity by triggering its degradation. Using mouse brain endoplasmic reticulum, we purified the A and C subunits of PP2A in a macromolecular complex with BCL-2. Of note, we did not identify any B subunits of PP2A from our purification. It is possible that a B subunit associates with BCL-2 but was lost in earlier purification steps. This appears to be the case with IP3R-1, an ER resident that associates with BCL-2 (11Chen R. Valencia I. Zhong F. McColl K.S. Roderick H.L. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Mignery G.A. Velez P. Distelhorst C.W. J.

A. 2005; 102: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This is the first report that PP2A can regulate BCL-2 protein levels. Our observations suggest that the phosphatase activity of PP2A protects BCL-2 from proteasome degradation. To examine BCL-2 phosphorylation in vivo, we used cells that overexpress the human protein (19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Inhibiting PP2A with OA selectively degraded the phosphorylated species of overexpressed BCL-2, and blocking proteasome activity with MG132 could rescue this degradation. We have been unable to directly track the phosphorylation of endogenous BCL-2, but our genetic studies support the hypothesis that BCL-2 phosphorylation is requisite for PP2A-mediated degradation. Knocking down PP2AC led to a substantial reduction in total endogenous BCL-2 protein levels in WT MEFs but did not reduce the protein levels of MEFs containing non-phosphorylatable BCL-2AAA. Moreover, HEK cells with shRNA knock down of the PP2A regulatory subunit B56γ also reduced endogenous BCL-2 protein levels. MG132 elevated BCL-2 in these cells and not in control HEK cells, suggesting that BCL-2 was degraded because its phosphorylation was enhanced. We cannot distinguish whether B56γ influences BCL-2 protein levels by specifically targeting to BCL-2 or non-specifically regulating total PP2A activity. We observed an increase in phospho-BCL-2 levels with low concentrations of OA and proteasome degradation at higher concentrations, suggesting that we were measuring its effects on BCL-2 and on the degradation machinery itself with OA. BCL-2 degradation may not depend on its phosphorylation status alone. For example, we observed a linear increase in BCL-2 phosphorylation with no sign of degradation when cells were incubated with taxol (data not shown). PP2A subunit levels appear to be regulated by degradation (32Strack S. Cribbs J.T. Gomez L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47732-47739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), suggesting there might be a relationship between PP2A activity and proteasome mechanics. In support of this interpretation, genetic knock down of two different PP2A subunits resulted in BCL-2 degradation, whereas overexpression of those subunits elevated BCL-2 protein levels. Most importantly, we found that PP2AC knock down sensitized MEFs to ER stress-induced apoptosis but had minimal effect in BCL-2AAA knock-in MEFs. The same was true with selected other death stimuli tested. These findings strongly suggest that PP2A can regulate BCL-2 levels and thus influence the ability of the cell to resist death stimuli. It appears that apoptotic sensitization by PP2AC knock down is more dependent on BCL-2 phosphorylation for certain classes of death stimuli than others. Specifically, non-phosphorylatable BCL-2AAA protected cells from shPP2AC in response to inhibitors of protein modification/secretion at the ER (i.e. tunicamycin and brefeldin A) and inhibitors of cell cycle progression (i.e. taxol and etoposide), settings in which phosphorylation of BCL-2 is thought to be important (17Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 19Bassik M.C. Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). BCL-2AAA MEFs were significantly less protected or not protected from Ca2+-associated death stimuli (i.e. thapsigargin and H2O2) and not protected from pan-kinase inhibition (i.e. staurosporine), suggesting PP2A mediates the effects of cell survival under select settings. It is significant that specific PP2A complexes can act as tumor suppressors, such as those with B56γ. The shB56γ HEK cells that have reduced BCL-2 protein levels also grow anchorage independently in culture and cause tumor formation in mice (21Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K.T. Plattner C.A. Pallas D.C. Hahn W.C. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These studies imply apoptosis resistance may actually be reduced in certain tumorigenic cells, perhaps a sensitive target for therapy. On the other hand, a PP2A-based approach could be used to degrade BCL-2 in BCL-2-dependent tumors. In summary, we have isolated PP2A as part of a macromolecular complex with BCL-2 at the endoplasmic reticulum. Together, our functional studies in three cell systems strongly suggest that dephosphorylation of BCL-2 by PP2A protects BCL-2 from proteasome-dependent degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum and fine-tunes the sensitivity of the cell to several cellular stresses, especially stresses at the ER.

Upon injury, keratinocytes migrate directionally into the wound bed to initiate re-epithelialization, essential for wound repair and restoration of barrier integrity. Keratinocytes express a high level of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-ARs) that appear to play a role in cutaneous homeostasis as aberrations in either keratinocyte β2-AR function or density are associated with various skin diseases. Here we report the novel finding that β-AR antagonists promote wound re-epithelialization in a “chronic” human skin wound-healing model. β-AR antagonists increase ERK phosphorylation, the rate of keratinocyte migration, electric field-directed migration, and ultimately accelerate human skin wound re-epithelialization. We demonstrate that keratinocytes express two key enzymes required for catecholamine (β-AR agonist) synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, both localized within keratinocyte cytoplasmic vesicles.

Although their expression in human skin was noted over 30 years ago (1Tseraidis G.S. Bavykina E.A. Vestn. Dermatol. Venerol. 1972; 46: 40-45PubMed Google Scholar), only recently has their functional significance in this tissue been recognized. The β2-AR subtype is the only subtype of β-ARs expressed on the membranes of the major cell types in skin: keratinocytes (2Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Pittelkow M.R. Swanson N.N. Steinkraus V. Arch.

Dermatol. 2004; 123: 346-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, aberrations in either keratinocyte β2-AR function or density have been associated with cutaneous disease. Keratinocytes derived from patients with atopic eczema display a point mutation in the β2-AR gene and a low β2-AR density (7Schallreuter K.U. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1997; 2: 37-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In psoriasis, keratinocytes within the psoriatic lesions demonstrate a low cAMP response to β2-AR activation (8Eedy D.J. Canavan J.P. Shaw C. Trimble E.R. Br. J. Dermatol. 1990; 122: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings point to a role for the β2-AR in maintaining epidermal function and integrity. Here we provide data to support a role for the β2-AR in regulating wound repair as well. Cutaneous wound healing is a complex and well orchestrated biological process requiring the coordinated migration and proliferation of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts, as well as other cell types. Wounding the epidermis prompts the epidermal and dermal cells to generate cytokines, growth factors, and proteases and to synthesize extracellular matrix components, all of which can regulate the processes of keratinocyte migration and proliferation, essential for re-epithelialization (9Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3791) Google Scholar, 10Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4740) Google Scholar). Upon injury, the cells migrate directionally toward the center of the wound bed to initiate repair and restore epithelial integrity. Many cues play a role in wound-induced keratinocyte directional migration including contact inhibition and chemotaxis (11Wilson S.E. Mohan R.R. Ambrosio Jr., R. Hong J. Lee J. Prog. Retin. Eye. Res. 2001; 20: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 12Lu L. Reinach P.S. Kao W.W. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2001; 226: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Additionally, electric fields (EFs) play an important role in epithelial cell directional migration (13Zhao M. Agius-Fernandez A. Forrester J.V. McCaig C.D. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2548-2558PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhao M. Agius-Fernandez A. Forrester J.V. McCaig C.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1405-1414PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhao M. McCaig C.D. Agius-Fernandez A.

Indeed, increasing or decreasing corneal wound currents pharmacologically correlates directly with an increased or decreased rate of healing in the rat cornea (19Reid B. Song B. McCaig C.D. Zhao M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The first clues to a biological function for β2-AR in wound repair came from an early study demonstrating that β-AR agonists delay skin wound healing in newt limbs (20Donaldson D.J. Mahan J.T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C. 1984; 78: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in other epithelia, however, have yielded conflicting results. For example, β-AR antagonists have been reported to either delay (21Haruta Y. Ohashi Y. Matsuda S. Eur. J. Ophthalmol. 1997; 7: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Liu G.S. Trope G.E. Basu P.K. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. 1990; 6: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or enhance (23Reidy J.J. Zarzour J. Thompson H.W. Beuerman R.W. Br J. Ophthalmol. 1994; 78: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) corneal epithelial wound healing. Recently, Denda et al. (24Denda M. Fuziwara S. Inoue K. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 142-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) reported that the β-AR could modulate epidermal barrier permeability by measuring transepidermal water loss. Here we investigate the effects of β-AR antagonists on scratch wound healing, keratinocyte single cell migration, ERK phosphorylation, keratinocyte galvanotaxis, cytoskeletal organization, proliferation, and, ultimately, human skin wound reepithelialization in a “chronic” wound healing model. We demonstrate that the β-AR antagonist is pro-motogenic, promoting human skin re-epithelialization. Ultimately, we explore the mechanism for the β-AR antagonist-mediated acceleration of wound repair, reporting the expression of protein for two key catecholamine (β-AR agonist) synthesis enzymes that are localized within keratinocyte cytoplasmic granules/vesicles. Finally, we confirm that keratinocytes synthesize epinephrine. Thus, our work uncovers an endogenous β-AR mediator network in the skin that upon blockade accelerates wound healing. Clearly, further investigation of this network will improve our understanding of the skin wound repair process and hopefully lead to the development of new therapies to enhance wound healing. Materials—Timolol (β-adrenergic antagonist) and the antivinculin antibody were purchased from Sigma. ICI 118,551 (β-adrenergic antagonist, specific for β2-AR at 10 nm) was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). The anti-ERK (number 9102), anti-phospho-ERK (number 9101), and anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (AB152) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The anti-phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT) antibody was purchased from Biogenesis (Brentwood, NH). Keratinocyte Growth—Human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins as we have reported previously (25Isseroff R.R. Ziboh V.A. Chapkin R.S. Martinez D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), under an approved exemption granted by the Internal Review Board at University of California, Davis, and cultured using a modification of the method of Rheinwald and Green (26Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3936) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) (Epilife, 0.06 mm Ca2+), supplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement (0.2 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.18 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.2% bovine pituitary extract) (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin) (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., Calabasas, CA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell strains isolated from at least three different foreskins were used in all of the experiments, performed with subcultured cells between passages 3 and 7. Scratch Assay—Three different strains of keratinocytes were grown to confluence in KGM on 35-mm culture dishes (Fisher). The cells were either untreated (control) or treated with β-AR antagonist (ICI 118,551) at a concentration specific for the β2-AR (27Bilski A.J. Halliday S.E. Fitzgerald J.D. Wale J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1983; 5: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), 10 nm, in KGM at time 0. A sterile pipette tip was used to scratch three 500-μm-wide to 1-mm-wide wounds around the center of the dish, and three demarcated areas of each wound were photographed on an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope at the time of wounding (time 0) and at 16 h post-wounding (28Haas A.F. Isseroff R.R. Wheeland R.G. Rood P.A. Graves P.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 822-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) at 10× magnification. Image J was used to measure the area of the wound at each demarcated area at time 0 and at 16 h to calculate the percentage of healing at the three positions for each wound, and all data for both the untreated and antagonist-treated wounds were statistically analyzed to determine the average percentage of healing for each condition. Single Cell Migration Assay—Glass-bottomed 35-mm dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA), were coated with collagen I (60 μg/ml) (Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Keratinocytes were plated at a density of 50 cells/mm2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were incubated with KGM alone (control) or with KGM containing 20 μm β-AR antagonist (timolol) at time 0. The 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes were placed in a heating chamber designed to maintain the medium between 35 and 37 °C and secured to the stage of an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. Individual cell migration was monitored over a 1-h period at 37 °C, as described previously (29Pullar C.E. Isseroff R.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2023-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Time lapse images of the cell migratory response were digitally captured every 10 min by Q-Imaging Retiga-EX cameras (Burnaby, Canada) controlled by a custom automation written in Improvision Open Lab software (Lexington, MA) on a Macintosh G4. After the center of mass of each cell was tracked using the Open Lab software, migration speed and distance were calculated and imported to Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). “Speed” is the average speed in μm/min that the cells travel in a 1-h period of time. Significance was taken as p < 0.01, using Student's t test (unpaired) to compare the means of two cell populations. Cell Treatments for Immunoblotting—1 × 106 plated keratinocytes were incubated with either KGM alone (control and lysates for catecholamine synthesis enzyme detection) or KGM containing 20 μm β-AR antagonist for 5-60 min. The cells were placed immediately on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4) and scraped in 50 μl of lysis buffer; (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were transferred into 1.5-ml tubes, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (30Pullar C.E. Repetto B. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1226-1232PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). The supernatants were electrophoresed immediately on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) or stored at -80 °C. Five μg (P-ERK blots) or thirty-five μg (catecholamine synthesis enzyme blots) of each protein sample was added to an equal volume of 2× reducing sample loading buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and immunoblotted with an anti-ERK (number 9102), phospho-ERK (number 9101), TH, or PNMT antibody at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer. The immunoblots were developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed on scanned images using NIH Image 1.62. Galvanotaxis—The galvanotaxis chamber construction and EF application were performed as described previously (31Pullar C.E. Isseroff R.R. Nuccitelli R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 50: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the galvanotaxis chamber is composed of a rectangular plexiglass frame with two medium reservoirs on opposite sides to which a 45 × 50-mm piece of No. 1.5 glass coverslip is attached to form the chamber bottom. This allows for continual observation of the plated cells on an inverted microscope. The keratinocytes are plated onto the collagen-coated center of the chamber between two coverslip spacers 25 × 10 mm. A third 25-mm2 coverslip is placed on top, straddling the two spacer coverslips and covering the cells plated on the collagen-coated center panel. This third coverslip rests ∼100-105 μm above the center panel and is sealed on top of the spacer coverslips with silicone high vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Midland, MI). This small height is chosen to minimize the cross-sectional area through which current flows. A small cross-section creates a high resistance pathway, resulting in a higher voltage gradient for a fixed current. The aqueduct allows for medium and current flow across the cells. The voltage across the coverslip is measured using a voltmeter via silver-sliver chloride (Ag-AgCl) wire electrodes inserted into both medium reservoirs on either side of the center panel. Six-cm-long 2% agar/phosphate buffered saline-filled pieces of polypropylene tubing connect each end of the chamber to a medium-filled well in which the Ag-AgCl electrodes are placed to separate possible electrode byproducts from the cells themselves. The current is measured with an ammeter in series, and we only use chambers for which the current flow is kept below 0.6 mA to minimize joule heating. Furthermore, the temperature of the medium in the chambers is maintained at 36 °C by placing the chamber on a metal plate heated to and maintained at 39 °C. Temperature is continuously monitored during the experiment using a YSI 400 analog temperature probe (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Inc., Yellow Springs, OH) directly attached to the metal plate and does not vary by more than 1 °C over the course of the experiment. Time Course Observation and Data Analysis—The galvanotaxis chambers rest on inverted Nikon microscopes. Time lapse images of the cell migratory response are digitally captured every 10 min over a 1-h period by a Q-Imaging Retiga-EX cameras controlled by a custom automation written in Improvision Open Lab software (Lexington, MA) on a Macintosh G4. After the center of mass of each cell is tracked using the Open Lab software, the directionality of migration is calculated and imported to Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Cosine θ describes the direction of migration and is a measure of the persistence of cathodal directedness, where θ is the angle between the field axis and the vector drawn by the cell migration path. The average cosine θ = Si cos θi/N, where Si is the summation of 70-72 individual cells from at least three different cell strains. Angle zero (θ = 00) is assigned to the negative pole (cathode) and increasing angles assigned in a clockwise manner, with θ = 1800 aligned with the positive pole (anode). Therefore, the cosine θ will provide a number between -1 and +1, and the average of all of the separate cell events yields an index of directional migration. For example, if a cell were to move directly to the negative pole, the angle (θ) = 00, and the cosine θ = 1. “Cosine” therefore refers to the average directional migration index of separate cell migration events at the end of a 1-h period. The results are given as average cosine θ ± S.E. Significance is taken as p < 0.01, using Student's t test (unpaired) to compare the means of two cell populations. Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy—Sterile glass coverslips were transferred into 12-well dishes and collagen-coated with 60 μg/ml collagen I in KGM for 1 h at 37°C as described. The coverslips were washed three times with KGM, and 3 × 104 cells were added per well and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were left untreated or treated with 20 μm β-AR antagonist for 15 min. The coverslips were processed at room temperature unless otherwise noted. The coverslips were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were washed twice in PBS between each step. The cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 with PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum with PBS (vinculin) or 5% horse serum with PBS (TH and PNMT) for 20 min. Primary monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody was added dropwise in 1% goat serum with PBS (1:100) and primary anti-TH or anti-PNMT antibody were added dropwise in 1% horse serum with PBS (1:20) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A goat anti-mouse cy3 antibody (Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA) (1:100) was added in 1% goat serum with PBS for 1 h at 37 °C (vinculin) or a donkey anti-rabbit cy3 antibody (Jackson Laboratory) (1:100) was added in 1% horse serum with PBS for 1 h at 37 °C (THand PNMT). Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:40 in PBS) was added to the vinculin-stained coverslips for 20 min. Standard controls were performed. The coverslips were incubated with the primary antibody alone or the secondary antibody alone to ensure specificity. Finally, Prolong gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to mount the coverslips onto glass microscope slides. The slides were viewed on an inverted fluorescent Nikon Diaphot microscope using a 40× pan fluor objective. The images were captured using Q-Imaging Retiga-EX cameras and pseudo-colored green for Alexa 488 Phalloidin staining (actin) and red for Cy3 staining (vinculin) or visualized in gray scale for TH and PNMT. Proliferation Assay—Keratinocytes were released from the tissue culture plate by treatment with 0.25% trypsin, 0.1% EDTA (Invitrogen), resuspended in KGM, and counted using a hemocytometer. 5 × 104 cells were plated per well in a 12-well plate in triplicate and allowed to settle and attach to the plate for 2 h. The cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of 20 μm β-AR antagonist. Triplicate wells were harvested and counted on days 2, 4, 6, and 8. The medium was changed every day. Significance was taken as p < 0.01, using Student's t test (unpaired) to compare the means of the cell populations. Chronic Human Skin Wound Healing Assay—We have previously adapted a wound healing model developed by Kratz (32Kratz G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 42: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to observe a delay in human skin re-epithelialization in the presence of β-AR agonist (33Pullar C.E. Grahn J.C. Liu W. Isseroff R.R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we have adapted a chronic wound healing model also developed by Kratz (32Kratz G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1998; 42: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have reduced the serum content of the medium from 10% to 5% to generate a chronic wound healing model, severely delaying the rate of re-epithelialization in control wounds to enable us to observe any increase in the rate of re-epithelialization in the presence 10 μm β-AR antagonist. Normal human skin was obtained from routine breast reductions or abdominoplasties under an approved exemption granted by the Internal Review Board at University of California, Davis. Under sterile conditions, excess subcutaneous fat was trimmed from 6 × 3-inch sections of skin prior to stretching and pinning onto sterile corkboard. A 3-mm punch (Sklar Instruments, West Chester, PA) was used to make wounds in the epidermis and into the superficial dermis, and the 3-mm discs of skin were excised using sterile scissors. 6-mm skin discs, with the 3-mm epidermal wound in the center, were excised using a 6-mm biopsy punch (SMS Inc., Columbia, MD). The skin samples were immediately transferred to a 12-well dish and submerged in 2 ml of FM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals, Tulare, CA) and antibiotics). The 12-well dishes were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was changed every day. Three biopsies were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde every day for 5 days. To confirm that untreated wounds retain the capacity to heal, biopsies previously cultured for 4 days in 5% serum were cultured in the presence or absence of an additional 5% serum (i.e. 10% total) for a further 4 days prior to fixation and histological processing. The formaldehyde-fixed biopsies were dehydrated through an ethanol-xylene series and embedded in paraffin. Cross-sections, 5 μm thick, taken from the center of the wound, were stained using the hematoxylin-eosin technique. Re-epithelialization was determined using light microscopy. The slides were viewed on an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope using a 10× objective. The images were captured using Q-Imaging Retiga-EX cameras. Specimens that were damaged in the histologic process or otherwise noninterpretable were excluded from the study. The percentage of re-epithelialization was calculated by measuring the linear distance covered by new epithelium and dividing that by the linear distance between the original wound edges. The new epithelium was clearly differentiated from the epithelial wound margin by the presence of a fully stratified epithelium and fully formed stratum corneum in the latter. To eliminate observer bias, the percentage of re-epithelialization was calculated from randomly numbered pictures of the wounds by a third party. Significance was taken as p < 0.01, using Student's t test (unpaired) to compare the means of the percentage of re-epithelialization of the wounds in the presence of 5 and 10% serum for days 5-8. To observe any β-AR antagonist-mediated modulation in reepithelialization, the skin samples were immediately transferred to a 12-well dish and submerged in 2 ml of FM in the presence or absence of 10 μm β-AR antagonist. Three biopsies were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formaldehyde every day for 5 days. Significance was taken as p < 0.01, using Student's t test (unpaired) to compare the means of the percentage of re-epithelialization of the control and β-AR antagonist-treated wounds on days 3-5. Enzyme Immunoassay for the Quantitative Determination of Epinephrine in Small Sample Volumes— 1 × 107 keratinocytes were extracted in 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl and sonicated on ice for 10 min. Extracts from three strains of keratinocytes were tested yin triplicate in an epinephrine enzyme immunoassay (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay kit provides materials for the quantitative measurement of epinephrine. Epinephrine is extracted using a cisdiol-specific affinity gel, then acylated to N-acylepinephrine, and after this converted enzymatically during the detection procedure into N-acylmetanephrine. The competitive enzyme immunoassay uses the microtiter plate format. Epinephrine is bound to the solid phase of the microtiter plate. Acylated epinephrine and solid phase bound epinephrine compete for a fixed number of antiserum-binding sites. When the system is in equilibrium, free antigen and free antigen-antiserum complexes are removed by washing. The antibody bound to the solid phase catecholamine is detected by an anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate using TMB as a substrate. The reaction is monitored at 450 nm with the amount of antibody bound to the solid phase being inversely proportional to the catecholamine concentration in the sample. A set of standards and two controls are included for determination of unknown concentrations (0, 5.6, 19, 83, 306, and 1550 pg of epinephrine/sample). The linear mean absorbance readings of the standards are plotted on the y axis versus the log of the concentrations of the standards (pg/sample) on the x axis, and a linear curve fit is applied. The concentration of epinephrine in the unknowns can then be calculated from the slope of the line. To standardize the levels of epinephrine measured in the keratinocyte extracts, a Bradford assay was performed on the extracts, as described, and the level of epinephrine detected was calculated as pg of epinephrine/mg of protein. β-AR Antagonists Accelerate the Healing of Scratch Wounds in Confluent Keratinocyte Cultures—To determine the effect of β-AR antagonists on keratinocyte migration, we initially measured the ability of keratinocytes to heal a “scratch wound” within a confluent sheet of cells (34Pullar C.E. Chen J. Isseroff R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22555-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A β-AR antagonist, at a concentration specific for β2-AR (10 nm) (27Bilski A.J. Halliday S.E. Fitzgerald J.D. Wale J.L. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1983; 5: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), doubles the rate of scratch wound healing. Untreated wounds are only 32 ± 8.5% healed within 16 h, whereas β-AR antagonist-treated wounds are 62 ± 2% healed within the same time frame (Fig. 1). A nons"

https://openalex.org/W2047297785,"Transcription factor Sp1 has recently been shown to be overexpressed in a number of human cancers and its overexpression contributes to malignant transformation. Sp1 regulates the expression of a number of genes participating in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis such as angiogenesis, cell growth and apoptosis resistance. To better understand the role of increased Sp1 levels on apoptosis regulation we have used retroviruses to overexpress this protein in haematopoietic Baf-3 cells and in 3T3 fibroblasts. We have also used inducible expression systems to control ectopic Sp1 levels in different cell types. Surprisingly, Sp1 overexpression on its own induces apoptosis in all the cellular models tested. The apoptotic pathways induced by Sp1 overexpression are cell type specific. Finally, using a truncated form of Sp1, we show that Sp1-induced apoptosis requires its DNA-binding domain. Our results highlight that Sp1 levels in untransformed cells must be tightly regulated as Sp1 overexpression leads to the induction of apoptosis. Our results also suggest that cancer cells overexpressing Sp1 can avoid Sp1-induced apoptosis."

Human telomerase consists minimally of a catalytic protein (hTERT) and a template-containing RNA (hTR), although other proteins are involved in regulating telomerase activity in vivo. Several chaperone proteins, including hsp90 and p23, have demonstrable roles in establishing telomerase activity both in vitro and in vivo, and previous reports indicate that hsp90 and p23 are required for the reconstitution of telomerase activity from recombinant hTERT and hTR. Here we report that hTERT and hTR associate in the absence of a functional hsp90-p23 heterocomplex. We also report that hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and novobiocin inhibit recombinant telomerase even after telomerase is assembled. Inhibition by geldanamycin could be overcome by allowing telomerase to first bind its primer, suggesting a role for hsp90 in loading telomerase onto the telomere. Inhibition by novobiocin could not similarly be overcome but instead resulted in destabilization of the hTERT polypeptide. We propose that the hsp90-p23 complex fine tunes and stabilizes a functional telomerase structure, allowing primer loading and extension.

A. 1996; 93: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the role of hsp90 in DHBV RT activity is to maintain the RT in a “protein-priming” conformation capable of binding to the viral pregenomic RNA, which serves as the template for reverse transcription. In this paper, we further elucidate the role of hsp90 in human telomerase RNP assembly and function. We show that the addition of GA or NB to a direct telomerase assay inhibits telomerase activity independent of the order of inhibitor addition (i.e. before or after telomerase assembly). We also report that hTERT and hTR are capable of interacting with each other in the absence of a functional hsp90-p23 complex, although such a complex is inactive. In these experiments, GA inhibition could only be overcome if telomerase was preincubated with its primer. This leads us to propose a model in which the mature assembly of human telomerase RNP into its final “primer-accepting” conformation requires hsp90 and its co-chaperones. hsp90 may therefore play a role in human telomerase RNP maturation and ligand binding similar to its role in establishing active DHBV RT (30.Hu J.

Antibodies and Chemical Reagents—The anti-hsp90 mouse monoclonal antibody (H90 –10) was a generous gift from Dr. David O. Toft (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) (32.Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J. Zhang Y. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GA was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, and NB was purchased from MP Biomedicals, Inc. Before use, GA and NB were dissolved in sterile Me2SO and H2O, respectively. Reconstitution of Human Telomerase—Wild-type hTR was in vitro transcribed and purified as previously described (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) except that the Ampliscribe T7 Transcription Kit was used (Epicenter Technologies). T7-tagged hTERT was transcribed and translated from pET-28c-hTERT and the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate systems kit (Promega) as previously described (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experiments requiring the visualization of hTERT utilized protein that was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Translation reactions using pET-28c (empty vector control) were used as a negative control in certain experiments. Preassembled telomerase was prepared by adding 4 μg of in vitro transcribed hTR to a 400-μl reticulocyte lysate reaction during hTERT translation. Synthesis of 32P-Labeled RNAs—RNA fragments were generated using a modification of previously described protocols (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34.Chen J.L. Greider C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA template required to transcribe the pseudoknot domain (hTR nucleotides 46 –209) and the CR4-CR5 domain (hTR nucleotides 243–328) were generated by PCR. Transcription reactions contained 1× Ampliscribe T7 reaction buffer, 7.5 mm CTP, 7.5 mm GTP, 7.5 mm UTP, 5.8 mm ATP, ∼0.7 μm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 mm dithiothreitol, Ampliscribe T7 enzyme solution, and the required linear template. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. For full length hTR, hammerhead ribozyme cleavage was initiated as described (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reactions were treated with 5 μl of RNase-free DNase 1 (1 unit/μl; Epicenter), incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 m NaOAc. RNA was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and unincorporated [α-32P]ATP was removed using a Microspin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). Synthesis of Biotin-labeled RNAs—A 100-μl Ampliscribe T7 transcription reaction contained 1× Ampliscribe T7 reaction buffer, 7.5 mm GTP, 7.5 mm UTP, 7.5 mm ATP, 6.25 mm CTP, 1.25 mm bio-11-CTP (ENZO Life Sciences), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μl of Ampliscribe T7 enzyme solution, and the appropriate DNA template. Reactions were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, treated with DNase, and purified as described above (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Telomerase Assays—Telomerase activity was quantified using a previously described primer extension assay (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In postassembly assays, hTR and hTERT were assembled in the absence of hsp90 inhibitors, and the primer-extension reaction included GA or NB. In preassembly assays, hTR and hTERT were assembled in the presence of GA or NB so that the concentration of inhibitor was maintained throughout both the assembly and primer extension reactions. For each series of assays, seven data points were used, with GA or NB concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mm. IC50 values were calculated as previously described (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Association of hTR and hTERT in the Presence of GA and NB—The ability of hTERT to associate with hTR in the presence of hsp90 inhibitors was determined using a coimmunoprecipitation assay as described previously with minor modifications (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 75-μl reactions contained T7-tagged [35S]hTERT (250 fmol) and ∼80–800 pmol of 32P-labeled pseudoknot or CR4-CR5 domain or full-length hTR (2.7–3.1 × 106 cpm/reaction). Inhibition studies also included GA (300 μm) or NB (1 mm). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and immunoprecipitated using 25 μl of preblocked anti-T7 antibody-agarose beads (Novagen). Samples were resolved on a 4 –12% bis-Tris SDS gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by phosphorimaging. The RNA band intensities were normalized to the [35S]hTERT protein bands and compared with the positive control. Association of hTR and hTERT When GA or NB Was Present during Translation of hTERT—The association of hTERT with hTR when hsp90 was inhibited during translation of hTERT was assayed by affinity purification of full-length hTR using a modification of a previously described protocol for purification of human telomerase (35.Schnapp G. Rodi H.P. Rettig W.J. Schnapp A. Damm K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3311-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). [35S]hTERT was synthesized in 50-μl reactions as described above in the presence of 5 pmol of hTR and 100 μm GA or 1 mm NB. Following a 90-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were combined with 50 μl of Ultra-Link® Immobilized NeutrAvidin™ Plus beads (Pierce) and 50 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg of yeast RNA (50 μg/ml final concentration), and 100 pmol of hTRbait, an affinity oligonucleotide complementary to the template of hTR (5′-biotin-CTAGACCTGTCATCAmGmUmUmAmGmGmGmUmUmAmG-3′ where m represents 2′-O-methyl ribose). Before use, the beads were washed once with 300 μl of buffer A, blocked twice with 250 μl of blocking buffer (buffer A supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 4 °C, and then washed with 300 μl of buffer A. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 1.5 min. The reactions were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 2 h at 4°C on a rotary platform. The resulting bead complexes were washed three times with 300 μl of buffer A supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, once with 300 μl of buffer A supplemented with 300 mm KCl, and twice with buffer A alone. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. [35S]hTERT was normalized to inputs and compared with the positive control. Controls containing Me2SO and H2O were conducted for comparison with GA and NB, respectively. The association of the CR4-CR5 and pseudoknot domains of hTR with hTERT was determined using biotin-labeled RNA. [35S]hTERT was synthesized in 50-μl reactions as described above in the presence of ∼60 pmol of the biotinylated pseudoknot domain or biotinylated CR4-CR5 domain and 100 μm GA or Me2SO carrier. Each reaction was then affinity-purified with 45 μl of preblocked MPG® Streptavidin beads (Pure Biotech, LLC). Beads were washed four times with 400 μl of wash buffer 1 and blocked twice with 250 μl of blocking buffer for 15 min at 4 °C before use. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 2 min between each step. Each 50-μl reaction was then mixed with 50 μl of blocking buffer and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in order to remove any precipitates. The supernatant was added to the blocked beads, and the samples were incubated for 45 min at room temperature on a rotary platform. The resulting bead complexes were washed three times with 350 μl of buffer A and once with 350 μl of TMG. The precipitated bead samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Immunoprecipitation with an hsp90 Antibody—Preassembled telomerase complexes were immunoprecipitated using a previously described protocol (6.Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Briefly, 75 μl of telomerase preassembled with [35S]hTERT was incubated at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μg of human telomeric primer, no telomeric primer, or 1 μg of nontelomeric primer. After 90 min, anti-hsp90 mouse monoclonal antibody (H90–10) was added to a final concentration of ∼0.5 μg/ml, and the samples were placed on ice for 1 h. Each reaction was immunoprecipitated by the addition of 22.5 μl of prewashed Protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Sciences) and was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rotation. The beads were then washed three times with 400 μl of Wash Buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The precipitated bead samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Lys-C Proteolysis of hTERT—The stability of hTERT was determined by Lys-C proteolysis using a modification of a previously described protocol (36.Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ∼700 fmol of T7-tagged [35S]hTERT and 3 μg of hTR were allowed to assemble either in the presence or absence of 100 μm GA or 1 mm NB at 30 °C for 90 min. Each reaction was then immunoprecipitated using 30 μl of preblocked anti-T7 antibody-agarose beads (Novagen), as previously described (33.Keppler B.R. Jarstfer M.B. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 334-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed with and resuspended in 80 μl of digestion buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA). Each sample was then treated with ∼90 ng of endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade; Roche Applied Science) and was incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots of each reaction were removed at various time points and quenched with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 0.72 m β-mercaptoethanol) followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved on a 4 –12% bis-Tris SDS gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by phosphorimaging. hsp90 Inhibitors Affect in Vitro Reconstituted Human Telomerase Activity both Before and After Assembly—To examine the role of hsp90 in telomerase activation, we used two hsp90 inhibitors: GA, which binds to the N-terminal ATP-binding site, and NB, which binds to the putative C-terminal ATP-binding site. Despite their separate binding sites, both compounds have been reported to inhibit human telomerase (6.Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 28.Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Rahman S. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In our hands, GA inhibited the in vitro reconstitution of telomerase activity when added before assembly with an IC50pre value of 8.4 ± 3.7 μm, and NB inhibited with an IC50pre of 148 ± 18 μm (Fig. 1). Notably, the concentrations of GA and NB were maintained throughout the assays, including both the assembly and the primer extension reactions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that hsp90 inhibitors exert their effect by preventing hsp90-dependent association between hTR and hTERT. We further tested the role of hsp90 by adding the hsp90 inhibitors to telomerase that was preassembled. Surprisingly, we found that both GA and NB inhibited telomerase activity and found IC50post values of 53 ± 7 and 408 ± 50 μm, respectively, for these drugs (Fig. 1). Although the IC50 values for GA and NB were slightly higher when added postassembly as compared with their addition preassembly, both drugs were full antagonists of assembled telomerase. We found that the addition of p23 partially suppressed inhibition by GA, so its effects are unlikely to be a direct effect on telomerase (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2p23 partially rescues GA-induced telomerase inhibition. Telomerase activity was inhibited in an assembly assay by the addition of 75 μm GA (lanes 2 and 3). p23 was added to the reaction prior to assembly at a final concentration of 20 μm (lane 3).

Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E.

To determine if hsp90 is involved in establishing the association of hTR and hTERT during telomerase assembly, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using T7-tagged [35S]hTERT and [32P]RNA in the presence of 300 μm GA or 1 mm NB. We tested the ability of GA and NB to inhibit hTERT binding to full-length hTR as well as the CR4-CR5 and pseudoknot domains, which are two regions of hTR previously shown to interact independently with hTERT (33.Keppler B.R.

In humans, the CR4-CR5 domain is well defined and contains a stem-loop termed p6.1, whose direct interaction with hTERT is required for telomerase activity (34.Chen J.L. Greider C.W.

https://openalex.org/W2141781494,"It has been shown that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression was induced during apoptosis and the anti-sense oligonucleotides and siRNA of AChE may prevent apoptosis in various cell types. However, the mechanisms underlying AChE upregulation remain elusive. We demonstrated here that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) could mediate AChE expression. In this study, both etoposide and excisanin A, two anticancer agents, induced apoptosis in colon cancer cell line SW620 as determined by Annexin V staining, the cleavage of caspase-3 and the proteolytic degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The results showed that both the agents upregulated AChE in SW620 cells. In the meantime, JNK was also activated and the expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun increased in SW620 cells exposed to the two agents. The induced AChE mRNA and protein expression could be blocked by SP600125, a specific inhibitor of SAPK/JNK, and small interfering RNA directed against JNK1/2. Transfection with adenovirus-mediated dominant negative c-Jun also blocked the upregulation of AChE expression. Together, these results suggest that AChE expression may be mediated by the activation of JNK pathway during apoptosis through a c-Jun-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2033624161,"The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) is overexpressed by malignant melanomas compared with benign naevi, and mediates proliferation, motility and protection from apoptosis. However, the utility of IGF1R targeting as anti-cancer therapy may be limited by activating mutations in downstream signaling intermediates. We previously showed that IGF1R knockdown blocked survival of prostate cancer cells in which Akt activation was deregulated by PTEN loss. The current study investigated effects of IGF1R targeting in cells harboring activating RAS-RAF mutations, found in 70–80% of human melanomas. We assembled a panel of eight human melanoma cell lines: two expressing wild-type (WT) B-RAF and N-RAS, two with activating N-RAS mutations and four harboring V600E B-RAF. We also generated isogenic cell populations overexpressing WT or V600E B-RAF. Cells expressing V600E B-RAF were relatively resistant to apoptosis. However, IGF1R gene silencing was capable of inducing significant inhibition of survival, enhancement of apoptosis, and ∼two-fold sensitization to cisplatin and temozolomide. These effects were independent of mutation status and were associated with reduced activation of Akt and also, unexpectedly, of ERKs. These results support development of IGF1R targeting as therapy for melanoma, regardless of the presence of activating mutations in the RAS-RAF pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2129658431,"The cysteinyl leukotriene1 (CysLT1) receptor (CysLT1R) enhances survival and proliferation of intestinal cells via distinct pathways. Here, we have demonstrated that there is significant endogenous production of CysLTs from both non-tumour- and tumour-derived intestinal epithelial cells. Treatment of two non-tumour cell lines, Int 407 and IEC-6, with CysLT1R antagonists led to shrinkage and detachment of cells, confirmed as apoptotic cell death, and a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation. However, in the tumour intestinal cell lines Caco-2, SW480, HCT-116 and HT-29, treatment with CysLT1R antagonists significantly reduced proliferation, but had no effect on apoptosis. A unique characteristic of intestinal cancer cells is the presence of nuclear CysLT1Rs, which are inaccessible to receptor antagonists. In these cells, inhibition of the endogenous production of CysLTs indirectly, by 5-lipoxygenase inhibition, impaired CysLT1R signalling throughout the cell, and resulted in apoptosis of the tumour cells. These data reveal the existence of constitutive CysLT1R signalling that mediates both survival and proliferation in intestinal cells. Importantly, we propose that tumour-derived intestinal cells are resistant to CysLT1R antagonist-induced apoptosis, a phenomena that could be explained by nuclear CysLT1R signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2056922005,"The toxicity of naturally occurring or designed antimicrobial peptides is a major barrier for converting them into drugs. To synthesize antimicrobial peptides with reduced toxicity, several amphipathic peptides were designed based on the leucine zipper sequence. The first one was a leucine zipper peptide (LZP); in others, leucine residues at the a- and/or d-position were substituted with single or double alanine residues. The results showed that LZP and its analogs exhibited appreciable and similar antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. However, the substitution of alanine progressively lowered the toxicity of LZP against human red blood cells (hRBCs). The substitution of leucine with alanine impaired the binding and localization of LZP to hRBCs, but had little effect on the peptide-induced damage of Escherichia coli cells. Although LZP and its analogs exhibited similar permeability, secondary structures, and localization in negatively charged membranes, significant differences were observed among these peptides in zwitterionic membranes. The results suggest a novel approach for designing antibacterial peptides with modulation of toxicity against hRBCs by employing the leucine zipper sequence. Also, to the best of our knowledge, the results demonstrate that this sequence could be utilized to design novel cell-selective molecules for the first time.

There is a demand for the design and identification of novel antibiotics because of the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to conventional drugs. A large number of antimicrobial peptides, which exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against microorganisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and even tumors, have been identified from a wide variety of animals, including humans (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 2Lehrer R.I. Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Annu. Rev.

Because the antimicrobial peptides cause damage to microbial cell membranes and thereby destroy their cellular integrity within a short time, it is believed that bacterial resistance will not be developed easily against these peptides (4Zasloff M.

Therefore, antimicrobial peptides have drawn the attention of many researchers as the lead molecules for the development of new antimicrobial drugs. Structure-function studies of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have demonstrated the requirements of the amphipathic properties and the presence of positive charges in their microbicidal activities.

Although most of these peptides are random coils in aqueous environments, they adopt helical structures in hydrophobic environments.

Despite extensive studies, the molecular basis of cell selectivity of an antimicrobial peptide is not clearly understood, and the design of antimicrobial peptides with reduced toxicity is a challenging issue. Recent studies suggest that self-association of an antimicrobial peptide in an aqueous environment and its localization and secondary structure in membranes could influence its target cell specificity (17Perez-Paya E.

Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the peptide with the higher aggregation property in an aqueous environment also showed higher toxicity than the other. Recently, we identified a leucine zipper motif in melittin, which seemed to play a crucial role in maintaining the toxicity of melittin, but not its antibacterial activity (19Asthana N. Yadav S.P. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55042-55050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The substitution of heptadic leucine with alanine disturbed the assembly in aqueous environments, zwitterionic membrane interaction, and the toxic activity of melittin against human red blood cells (hRBCs) 3The abbreviations used are: hRBCs, human red blood cells; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Chol, cholesterol; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PC, egg phosphatidylcholine; PG, egg phosphatidylglycerol; PE, dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine; NBD, 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MICs, minimum inhibitory concentrations; LZP, leucine zipper peptide; SASA, single alanine-substituted analog; DASA, double alanine-substituted analog. without affecting its interaction with negatively charged membranes and its antibacterial activity. The results indicated that assembly or peptide-peptide interaction in melittin is a key factor in maintaining its interaction with zwitterionic membranes, and therefore, the substitution of heptadic leucine with alanine affected its toxic activity. The results further suggested that this alteration in the assembly of melittin associated with the same amino acid substitution had a little effect on its amphipathic properties and probably therefore did not affect its interaction with negatively charged membranes and thus its antibacterial activity. We hypothesized that it is possible to modulate the toxic activity of novel model antimicrobial peptides designed based on the leucine zipper sequence by altering their assembly without affecting their antibacterial activities. To develop model antimicrobial peptides with simultaneous modulation of their toxicity by altering their assembly, we characterized several novel amphipathic antibacterial peptides designed based on the leucine zipper sequence. To understand the molecular basis of the antibacterial and toxic activities of the designed peptides, their assembly in an aqueous environment and their detailed interaction with zwitterionic and negatively charged lipid vesicles were studied. Furthermore, to find a correlation between their phospholipid membrane interaction and biological activities, their localization was studied in live hRBCs, and also the peptides' effect on bacteria was examined under an electron microscope. Materials—Rink amide-4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (loading capacity, 0.63 mmol/g) and all of the N-α-Fmoc- and side chain-protected amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem. Coupling reagents for peptide synthesis (1-hydroxybenzotriazole, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate, and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine), trifluoroacetic acid, and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased from Sigma. Dichloromethane, N,N′-dimethylform-amide, and piperidine were standard grade and procured from reputed local companies. Acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was obtained from Merck. Egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were procured from Northern Lipids Inc. (Vancouver, Canada). 3,3′-Dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide and 4-fluoro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The rest of the reagents were analytical grade and procured locally; buffers were prepared in Milli-Q water. Peptide Synthesis, Fluorescent Labeling, and Purification— Stepwise solid-phase syntheses of all of the peptides were carried out manually on rink amide-4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (0.15 mmol) utilizing standard Fmoc chemistry as reported previously (19Asthana N.

The experimental molecular masses of the peptides (detected by MALDI-TOF analysis) corresponded very closely to the desired values (see Table 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). The concentrations of the peptides were determined by measuring their absorbances at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride using tryptophan extinction coefficients of 5690 m−1 cm−1.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences, calculated and observed masses, and reverse-phase HPLC retention times Amino acids at the a- and d-positions are in shown boldface, and substituted amino acids are shown in boldface and underlined.

The lipid concentration was determined by phosphorus estimation (23Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Experiments—CD spectra of the peptides were recorded in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in the presence of phospholipid vesicles utilizing a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The samples were scanned at room temperature (∼30 °C) in a capped quartz cuvette (0.20-cm path length) at a wavelength range of 250-195 nm. The fractional helicities were calculated using mean residue ellipticity values at 222 nm by the following equation as reported previously (24Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (3322) Google Scholar, 25Wu C.-S.C. Ikeda K. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar): Fh = ([θ]222 - [θ]0222)/([θ]100222 - [θ]0222), where [θ]222 is the experimentally observed mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. [θ]100222 and [θ]0222 (which correspond to 100 and 0% helical content, respectively) were considered to have mean residue ellipticity values of −32,000 and −2000, respectively, at 222 nm. Determination of Membrane Permeability of the Peptides— The ability of the peptides to destabilize the PE/PG vesicles was determined by assay of the peptide-induced dissipation of the diffusion potential (26Sims P.J. Waggoner A.S. Wang C.H. Hoffmann J.F. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3315-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 27Loew L.M. Rosenberg I. Bridge M. Gitler C.

In brief, lipid vesicles prepared in K+ buffer (50 mm K2SO4 and 25 mm HEPES sulfate, pH 6.8) were mixed with isotonic (K+-free) Na+ buffer, followed by the addition of the potential sensitive dye 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide. After the addition of valinomycin to the vesicle suspension when the fluorescence of the dye exhibited a steady level, the respective peptide was added. The peptide-induced dissipation of the diffusion potential as detected by an increase in fluorescence (at 670 nm with excitation at 620 nm) was measured in terms of the percentage of fluorescence recovery (Ft), defined by Ft = ((It - I0)/(If - I0)) × 100%, where It is the fluorescence after the addition of a peptide at time t, I0 is the fluorescence after the addition of valinomycin, and If is the total fluorescence observed before the addition of valinomycin. The membrane permeability of the peptides in PC/Chol and PC/PG vesicles was determined by the peptide-induced release of calcein from calcein-entrapped lipid vesicles (21Yadav S.P. Kundu B. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51023-51034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 29Allen T.M. Cleland L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 597: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Calcein-entrapped lipid vesicles were prepared with a self-quenching concentration (60 mm) of the dye in 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4. A thin film of lipid (either PC/PG or PC/Chol) was resuspended in calcein solution, vortexed for 1-2 min, and then sonicated in a bath-type sonicator. The non-encapsulated calcein was removed from the suspension of lipid vesicles by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-50 column. Usually, lipid vesicles are diluted to ∼10-fold after passing through a Sephadex G-50 column. The eluted calcein-entrapped vesicles were diluted further to the desired final lipid concentration for the experiment. Peptide-induced release of calcein from the lipid vesicles was monitored by the increase in fluorescence due to the dilution of the dye from its self-quenched concentration. Fluorescence was monitored at room temperature with excitation and emission wavelengths fixed at 490 and 520 nm, respectively. Calcein release as measured by the fluorescence recovery is defined by the same equation as used to determine the dissipation of the diffusion potential. However, in this case, If, the total fluorescence, was determined after the addition of Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) to the dye-entrapped vesicle suspension. Enzymatic Cleavage Experiments—Enzymatic cleavage experiments were performed to detect the location of the peptides in their membrane-bound states by employing their NBD-labeled versions (19Asthana N. Yadav S.P. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55042-55050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Yadav S.P. Kundu B. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15451-15462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, lipid vesicles were first added to the NBD-labeled peptide. When all of the peptide molecules were bound to lipid vesicles as indicated by the saturation of the fluorescence level, proteinase K (20.0 μg/ml final concentration) was added. In this experiment, the fluorescence of the NBD-labeled peptide was recorded at 527 nm with respect to time (seconds), with the excitation wavelength set at 467 nm. Hemolytic Activity Assay—The hemolytic activity of these designed peptides was assayed against fresh hRBCs that were collected in the presence of an anticoagulant from a healthy volunteer by a standard procedure (8Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Asthana N. Yadav S.P. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55042-55050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Peptides (dissolved in water) were added to the suspension of hRBCs (6% (v/v) final concentration) in PBS to a final volume of 200 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 35 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and the release of hemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance (Asample) of the supernatant at 540 nm. hRBCs in PBS (Ablank) and in Triton X-100 (0.2% (v/v) final concentration; ATriton) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The percentage of hemolysis was calculated according to the following equation (8Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Asthana N. Yadav S.P.

Assay of the Antibacterial Activity of the Peptides—The antibacterial activity of the peptides was assayed in LB medium under aerobic conditions (8Oren Z. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1826-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Asthana N. Yadav S.P. Ghosh J.K. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 2602-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Different concentrations of each of the peptides (dissolved in water) were added in duplicate to 100 μl (final volume) of medium containing the inocula of the test organism (∼106 colony-forming units) in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth and incubated for 18-20 h. The peptides' antibacterial activity, expressed as their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; the peptide concentration that resulted in 100% inhibition of microbial growth), was assessed by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm. The microorganisms used were Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144) and Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 and DH5α). Transmission Electron Microscopic Experiments—E. coli cells (∼106 colony-forming units/ml) in LB medium were incubated in the absence and presence of the leucine zipper peptide (LZP) and its analogs at and below their MICs for 2 h and then centrifuged. After resuspending the pellets, a drop of suspension was deposited onto a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid at pH 6.8. The grids were examined under an FEI/Philips transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Confocal Microscopic Experiments—The localization and binding of the peptides to hRBCs were determined using their NBD-labeled analogs and a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 inverted microscope. Fresh hRBCs (6% in PBS), as used in the hemolytic activity assays, were incubated with the same concentration of the NBD probe, NBD-LZP, NBD-LZP(L8A) (a single alanine-substituted analog (SASA)), or NBD-LZP(L8A/L11A) (a double alanine-substituted analog (DASA)) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed, and confocal microscopic images of the live cells were taken with an argon ion laser set for NBD excitation at 457 nm. The setting of the photomultiplier was constant during the entire experiment. Design of Novel Peptides Based on the Leucine Zipper Sequence—The leucine zipper is a special class of a heptad repeat in which the a- and d-positions are occupied mostly by leucine and isoleucine. Mere substitution of amino acids at the a- and d-positions can alter the assembly of protein(s) containing this motif (31Hu J.C. O'Shea E.K. Kim P.S. Sauer R.T. Science. 1990; 250: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Kouzarides T. Ziff E. Nature. 1988; 336: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Because self-assembly of an antimicrobial peptide seems to have a profound effect on its cell selectivity/toxicity (10Chen Y. Mant C.T. Farmer S.W. Hancock R.E.W. Vasil M.L. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11921-11930Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we envisioned that substitution only of one or two amino acids at the a- and/or d-position might affect the toxicity of the leucine zipper-based antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, a series of 21-residue amphipathic peptides were designed based on the leucine zipper sequence with minor changes at the a- and/or d-position (Table 1). The first one was designed based on a classical leucine zipper motif sequence (LZP), comprising leucine, alanine, and lysine residues (Fig. 1). To induce antibacterial activity, the amino acids were arranged so that the peptide was amphipathic with broad hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. Tryptophan was included to study the intrinsic fluorescence of the peptides. In the first three analogs, a single leucine from the a- or d-position of LZP was substituted with alanine (SASA). In the other three analogs, two leucine residues in the a-position and the a- or d-position were replaced with two alanine residues (DASA). The number and position of the positive charges were kept the same in all of the peptides. Alanine was chosen for its helix propensity and appreciable hydrophobicity so that the amphipathic characteristics of these peptides would be maintained. The Designed Novel Peptides Exhibit Appreciable Antibacterial Activity—The designed novel peptides were tested for growth-inhibiting activity in liquid cultures against two Gram-positive and one Gram-negative bacteria of two different strains. Tetracycline was used as a positive control. LZP exhibited appreciable antibacterial activity (Table 2) against the tested bacteria with a MIC (∼6 μm) comparable with those of the other designed and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (7Javadpour M.M. Juban M.M. Lo W.-C.J. Bishop S.M. Alberty J.B. Cowell S.M. Becker C.L. McLaughlin M.L. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3107-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the antibacterial activities of SASAs and DASAs were close to that of LZP. The results indicated that the antibacterial activity of LZP was almost intact after the substitution of leucine with alanine at its a- and/or d-position.TABLE 2Antibacterial activity of LZP and its analogsPeptide/antibioticMICS. aureus ATCC 9144B. subtilis ATCC 6633E. coli ATCC 10536E. coli DH5αμmμmμmμmLZP5.8 ± 0.65.8 ± 0.66.0 ± 0.67.2 ± 0.7LZP(L4A)5.6 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.8LZP(L8A)6.2 ± 0.66.7 ± 0.86.2 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.8LZP(L11A)6.2 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.66.8 ± 0.7LZP(L4A/L8A)6.2 ± 0.66.0 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.66.8 ± 0.7LZP(L4A/L11A)6.2 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.66.2 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.8LZP(L8A/L11A)6.6 ± 0.87.8 ± .86.2 ± 0.67.4 ± 0.8Tetracycline1.0 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab To understand the mode of action of the peptides on the bacteria, electron microscopic experiments were performed. A total change in the morphology and lysis of E. coli cells was observed in the presence of LZP, SASAs, and DASAs at their MICs after 2 h of treatment under a transmission electron microscope (Fig. 2). The electron micrographs of the bacteria after treatment with LZP, LZP(L8A) (a SASA), and LZP(L8A/L11A) (a DASA) are shown (Fig. 2). An initial change in morphology and damage to the bacterial cell wall were evident upon treatment with LZP(L8A/L11A) at 75% of its MIC. Modulation of the Hemolytic Activity of the Peptides by Substitution of Leucine at the a- and/or d-position with Alanine— The hemolytic activity of all of the designed novel peptides against hRBCs was examined to measure their toxic activity. LZP exhibited the maximum hemolytic activity against hRBCs. Hemolytic activity was significantly reduced in SASAs and was further decreased in DASAs, rendering them negligibly active up to a concentration of 30 μm (Fig. 3A). Thus, the results indicated that modulation of the toxic activity of the designed peptides against hRBCs was achieved by the substitution of leucine at the a- and/or d-position with alanine. To investigate the basis of reduction of the toxic activity of LZP analogs, the localization of the peptides to hRBCs was studied by confocal microscopic experiments with NBD-labeled LZP, LZP(L8A) (a SASA), and LZP(L8A/L11A) (a DASA).

Glycosylation of intracellular proteins is a dynamic process that in several cases competes with and acts as a reciprocal modification system to phosphorylation. O-Linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) levels are highest in the brain, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease have been shown to involve abnormally phosphorylated key proteins, probably as a result of hypoglycosylation. Here, we show that the neurodegenerative disease protein ataxin-10 (Atx-10) is associated with cytoplasmic OGT p110 in the brain. In PC12 cells and pancreas, this association is competed by the shorter OGT p78 splice form, which is down-regulated in brain. Overexpression of Atx-10 in PC12 cells resulted in the reconstitution of the Atx-10-OGT p110 complex and enhanced intracellular glycosylation activity. Moreover, in an in vitro enzyme assay using PC12 cell extracts, Atx-10 increased OGT activity 2-fold. These data indicate that Atx-10 might be essential for the maintenance of a critical intracellular glycosylation level and homeostasis in the brain.

Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the modification of intracellular proteins by a single GlcNAc moiety has emerged as a major signaling event involving a growing number of proteins (2.Vosseller K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3.Zachara N.E. Cheung W.D. Hart G.W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 284: 175-194PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in O-GlcNAc glycosylation levels were shown to have a regulatory effect on diverse cellular processes such as proteasome activity (4.Zhang F. Su K. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), transcription (5.Gao Y. Miyazaki J. Hart G.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 415: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and enzyme function (6.Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol.

The enzyme OGT 2The abbreviations used are: OGT, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase; Atx-10, ataxin-10; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeats; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CKII, casein kinase. is encoded by a single gene, which is highly conserved among metazoans (7.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Several splice forms have been described that vary in the length of the protein N terminus and subcellular localization (8.Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Full-length OGT is a 110-kDa polypeptide consisting of two domains. The N-terminal half contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) that adopt a bent superhelical fold related to the armadillo repeat motif (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion shows glycosyltransferase activity, whereas the TPR domain is responsible for substrate binding and OGT oligomerization (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10.Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Originally, the enzyme was isolated from rat liver cytosol as an apparent heterotrimer consisting of two p110 subunits and one p78 subunit (12.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The p110 subunit, which exerts full catalytic activity by itself, is ubiquitously expressed, whereas the p78 splice variant that lacks most of the TPR repeats appears to be restricted to certain tissues such as liver, kidney, and muscle (13.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Dysregulated OGT activity leading to hyper- or hypoglycosylation of target proteins is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as type II diabetes (6.Parker G.J. Lund K.C. Taylor R.P. McClain D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10022-10027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alzheimer's Dis. 2004; 6: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protein glycosylation with GlcNAc may directly compete for serine and threonine residues with phosphorylation, thus creating a sensitive balance between positive and negative regulatory signals (16.Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2493-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Perturbations of this reciprocal relationship might lead to cell degeneration as in the case of hyperphosphorylated tau (17.O'Donnell N. Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 18.Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Hart G.W. Gong C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10804-10809Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It has become evident from several observations that O-GlcNAc glycosylation is exceptionally important in neuronal tissues (17.O'Donnell N. Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 19.Khidekel N. Ficarro S.B. Peters E.C. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13132-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). OGT expression is significantly up-regulated in the brain with the most prominent activity being localized in the cerebellar cortex (20.Akimoto Y. Comer F.I. Cole R.N. Kudo A. Kawakami H. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Brain Res. 2003; 966: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cerebellar neurons have been shown to react directly to changes of protein kinase activity with reciprocal changes in OGT activity (21.Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate binding of OGT p110 to the neurode-generative disease protein Atx-10 in the brain. Although ubiquitously expressed, both proteins show highest expression levels in the central nervous system, indicating a crucial regulatory effect of Atx-10 on intracellular glycosylation in the brain. Isolation of OGT-interacting Proteins Using the Cytotrap Screen—Atx10 was isolated as an OGT-interacting protein using the CytoTrap™ system according to the manufacturer's protocols (Stratagene) (22.Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23.Andrali S.S. Marz P. Ozcan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the mitochondrial version of human OGT (7.Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9316-9324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pSos vector (Stratagene) in-frame with human Sos protein. The screen was carried out with a mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cDNA library in the pMyr vector (Stratagene) (23.Andrali S.S. Marz P. Ozcan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24.Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). After screening of about 1 × 106 colonies, Atx10 was isolated as an OGT-interacting protein in three independent experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC number: CRL-1721) and maintained as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were subcultured once a week. Transient transfection of PC12 cells with a pCDM8-Atx-10 expression plasmid was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). On day 1 after transfection, increasing concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc substrate were added to the cells for 2 h. Preparation and Gel Filtration Analysis of PC12 Cell and Rat Tissue Lysates—3 × 107 PC12 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed on ice by passing several times through a 0.6-gauge syringe needle. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cytosolic fraction was passed through a 0.45-μm filter before being submitted to gel filtration. Gel filtration was performed using a prepacked Superdex S75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer. 0.3 ml-fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. Freshly prepared rat organs from adult male Wistar rats (RCC Ltd., Füllinsdorf) were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cells were disrupted using a mortar. The cell lysate was taken up in 1 ml of lysis buffer and cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Filtered supernatants were then submitted to gel filtration under the same conditions as used for the PC12 cell lysates. For competition assays, cell lysates were incubated with recombinant Atx-10 or TPR6-7 protein for 1 h at 4 °C before gel filtration. The apparent molecular masses were estimated using a mixture of standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences) that were loaded onto the column in an independent run. Western Blot Analysis—For detection of Atx-10, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a large C-terminal fragment (228-476) of the protein was used (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). OGT proteins were detected using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a peptide comprising the 12 C-terminal amino acid residues common to all enzyme splice variants. Proteins modified by O-GlcNAc were detected using a RL2 monoclonal antibody to N-acetylglucosamine (Alexis Corp.). Monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma) was used for the loading control. All antibodies were applied at 1:1000 dilution. For detection of primary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-bodies were applied at 1:4000 dilution. Densitometric analysis of bands was performed using the Gel-Pro Express software (Media Cybernetics). Recombinant Expression of Proteins—Recombinant rat Atx-10 was expressed in HEK293 cells as described previously (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Supernatants of stably transfected cells were harvested frequently until the cells detached, pooled, and passed through a syringe filter. Conditioned medium was then purified using nickel-NTA agarose chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). GST and OGT-GST fusion protein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using a pGex-2T vector. Cells were transformed and cultured in LB medium at 37 °C, and expression was induced at OD 0.6 by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) for 4-6 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton and lysed by several freeze-thaw steps and subsequent sonication. GST-OGT fusion protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The TPR6-7 fragment was generated by PCR using 5′-GCTCTAGACATATGTTTGCAGTAGCTTGG-3′ as forward and 5′-CCGGATCCTCTCATGCGTGATTTGGACTC-3′ as reverse primer and expressed together with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells using a peET19b vector (Novagen). After expression, inclusion bodies containing TPR6-7 protein were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and purified under denaturing conditions using nickel-agarose chromatography. The purified His-tagged TPR6-7 protein with a molecular mass of 12 kDa was refolded while bound to the agarose by changing the buffer to physiological conditions (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The eluted protein was finally dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Immunohistochemistry—C57BL/6J mice, 20-30 g in body weight (n = 6), were used. Animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (Vetanarcol®, 0.04 g/kg, applied intraperitoneally), and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The dissected brains were immersed in fixative overnight. Serial sagittal 30-μm sections were cut with a vibratome and collected in cold Tris-phosphate-buffer (0.05 m). Free-floating sections were washed thoroughly and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline for 90 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with normal goat serum for 2 h, and then sections were incubated with Atx-10 antibody (rabbit, 1:250 or 1:500) or OGT antibody (1:400) for 48 h at room temperature. Biotinylated goat-anti rabbit IgG (1:100; Antibodies Inc.) and the avidinbiotin complex (Vector) were applied for 90 min each. Immunoreaction was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.1% H2O2 in Tris-phosphate-buffer. All sections were mounted on coated slides, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared with xylol, and coverslipped in Eukitt (Kindler, Freiburg, Germany). For control, the first antibody was omitted from the immunoreaction. Sections were viewed with an Axiophot microscope equipped with an Axiovision imaging system (Zeiss, Germany). Immunoprecipitation—Lysates of PC12 cells and rat brain were generated as for the gel filtration experiments. After adjusting total protein concentrations, lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with an excess (10 μg) of recombinant Atx-10 protein in a total volume of 200 μl. Recombinant Atx-10 was precipitated from the mixture using Ni-NTA agarose. The precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Co-precipitated OGT protein was detected by Western blotting using OGT antibody. Recombinant Atx-10 was precipitated with a GST-OGT fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose. As control, recombinant Atx-10 was incubated with GST alone. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis was performed in the linear, positive ion mode with blanking (<700 m/z) and pulsed (time-delayed) extraction using a Shimadzu Biotech Axima TOF 2The abbreviations used are: OGT, O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase; Atx-10, ataxin-10; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeats; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight; NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; CKII, casein kinase. instrument (Shimadzu Biotech Deutschland, Duisburg, Germany). All reagents and protein standards were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 50% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (all % v/v)) was used as a matrix. Sample positions on the steel 384-position sample plate were washed once with matrix solution. A1-μl drop of the TPR6-7 preparation was allowed to dry onto the sample plate at room temperature, and the TPR6-7 preparation was then washed with a small drop of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, applied for ∼10 s. Immediately after removal of the trifluoroacetic acid, 1 μl of matrix solution was added to the sample, and it was allowed to dry at room temperature. The standard proteins (about 1 pmol of insulin, ubiquitin, cytochrome C, myoglobin, aldolase, or β-galactosidase) were spotted onto the washed plate, and an equal volume (usually 1 μl) of matrix was immediately added to the protein drop. Each protein standard was analyzed separately, and a combined calibration of the near external standards was employed to determine the mass/charge (m/z) values. OGT Assay—The OGT assay was essentially performed as described by Marshall et al. (26.Marshall S. Duong T. Wu T. Hering M.A. Yada J. Higgins S. Orbus R.J. Yan Z.H. Rumberger J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). 10 μl of an OGT peak fraction (0.3 mg/ml) obtained by gel filtration of PC12 cell lysate was mixed with 100 μm of casein kinase (CKII) peptide (PGGSTPVSSANMM), and the reaction was started with 20 μm (0.1 μCi) of [3H]UDP-GlcNac (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 50 μl. For testing the influence of Atx-10, different concentrations of recombinant Atx-10 were added before starting the reactions. The samples were incubated at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid. 3H-labeled glycosylated CKII peptide was separated from free [3H]UDP-GlcNac by precipitation. The pellets were washed once with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in scintillation solution, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. OGT p110 Is Associated with Atx-10 in the Brain but Not in PC12 Cells—Using the yeast cytotrap screen assay with the mitochondrial splice form of human OGT as bait, we have isolated the SCA10 gene product, Atx-10, as an interacting partner of OGT from a mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cDNA library. In rat brain cytosol, Atx-10 co-eluted with the OGT p110 subunit during gel filtration (Fig. 1A) with the peak fractions lying in a molecular mass range of about 200-300 kDa. We did not detect any dissociated OGT and Atx-10 signals in this experiment, indicating that Atx-10 binding to OGT p110 is constitutive in the brain. Recombinant Atx-10 could be co-precipitated by a GST-OGT fusion protein confirming our in vivo results (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, in cytosol of PC12 cells, Atx-10 was not associated with OGT and eluted in a lower molecular mass region (about 150-200 kDa) (Fig. 1D), which corresponds to its homotrimeric state observed in previous experiments (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead, OGT p110 co-eluted with the OGT p78 subunit, which was not detectable in brain cell lysates, and apparently prevented binding of Atx-10 to OGT p110 in PC12 cells. Co-precipitation of OGT p110 from cell lysates using recombinant Atx-10 showed higher binding activity for brain than for PC12 cell lysate (Fig. 1C), confirming the stronger association between the two OGT isoforms as compared with the OGT p110-Atx-10 binding. Immunocytochemical Detection of Atx-10 and OGT in Mouse Brain—Colocalization of Atx-10 and OGT in neuronal tissues was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry using mouse brain sections (Fig. 2). As described previously for mouse and human brain (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), Atx-10 protein is present in the cerebellar system, i.e. the cerebellar cortex and the inner cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 2A), the inferior olive (Fig. 2E), and the pontine nuclei (not shown). OGT staining coincided with that of Atx-10 in the cerebellum (Fig. 2B), in the inferior olive (Fig. 2H), and in the pontine nuclei (not shown) with a few exceptions. In the cerebellar cortex, low levels of Atx-10 were outlining the perikarya of Purkinje cells and their dendrites (Fig. 2C). OGT protein accumulated in the soma of the Purkinje cells. In addition, inhibitory interneurons of the molecular layer labeled for OGT (Fig. 2D) but not for Atx-10, whereas Golgi cells in the granule cell layer were positive for both markers. Neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 2, E and F) and in afferent cerebellar projection areas, as exemplified here for the inferior olive (Fig. 2, G and H), stained for Atx-10 or OGT in a similar manner. However, intracellular distribution was different in that the rather homogenous cytosolic distribution of Atx-10 was contrasted by a preferential perinuclear accumulation of OGT. Expression of OGT Isoforms and Atx-10 in Different Rat Organs—To analyze how Atx-10, OGT p110, and OGT p78 were distributed in other tissues as compared with brain, we looked for the respective protein levels in multiple rat organs. Both OGT p110 and Atx-10 were expressed ubiquitously, although markedly up-regulated in the brain (Fig. 3, A and B). Significant expression levels of OGT p78 were restricted to liver, spleen and, most prominently, to pancreas (Fig. 3C). A basal OGT p78 signal could be detected in all organs by longer film exposition, indicating that its expression is ubiquitous, too, but generally down-regulated (not shown). Expression levels of Atx-10 protein are highest in brain and testis (Fig. 3D) and reflect the pattern of the mRNA transcript as described recently (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other OGT splice forms than p110 or p78 could not be detected in this experiment, probably due to their lesser abundance and localization to subcellular organelles. Gel filtration of pancreas tissue cytosol showed a similar result as that of PC12 cell cytosol, confirming that the presence of OGT p78 prevents OGT p110-Atx-10 association (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, in pancreas, the cytoplasmic concentration of OGT p78 even exceeded that of OGT p110. OGT p78 and Atx-10 Compete for OGT p110 Binding—To verify whether OGT p78 directly competes with Atx-10 for OGT p110 binding, we incubated PC12 cell cytosol with an excess of recombinant Atx-10 protein (∼5 μm) prior to gel filtration. As shown in Fig. 4A, recombinant Atx-10 protein applied at high concentrations inhibited OGT p78/p110 association (compare Fig. 1D) by displacing OGT p78 and binding to OGT p110. As the cytosolic concentration of OGT p78 does not apparently exceed that of endogenous Atx-10 in PC12 cells, we conclude that OGT p110 binds to OGT p78 with a significantly higher affinity than to Atx-10. Jinek et al. (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the TPR repeats 6 and 7 function as the dimer contact region of OGT. As Atx-10 and the OGT TPR domain share a common structural motif, we speculated that Atx-10 might associate via the TPR6-7 region with OGT. We have expressed the TPR6-7 fragment in E. coli to analyze whether it was able to compete the Atx-10-OGT p110 interaction. MALDI-TOF analysis of the TPR6-7 preparation showed two major peaks: one at an m/z of 10,555 and the other at an of m/z 21,100. The m/z value of 10,555 is smaller than that expected for the full-length TPR6-7 protein (12.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is suggestive of proteolysis during purification. As laser power was incrementally increased, the first peak to appear above background was the 21,100 m/z peak followed by the 10,555 m/z peak. At higher laser powers, the 10,555 peak predominated. These observations confirm that the TPR6-7 protein forms stable dimers in solution as predicted by the structural data (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Incubation of rat brain lysate with an excess of recombinant TPR6-7 protein (∼20 μm) led to a clear dissociation of the Atx-10 and OGT p110 signals during gel filtration, indicating that Atx-10 uses the homo-oligomerization domain of OGT p110 for binding (Fig. 4B). The TPR6-7 protein was detected in fractions containing both OGT p110 and Atx-10, indicating that it associated with both proteins. The same experiment performed with PC12 cell lysate led to the formation of a second OGT p110/p78 peak in a lower molecular mass region (as compared with Fig. 1D) but not to a dissociation of the complex (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that the TPR6-7 fragment does not compete with OGT p78 for binding sites and that it can associate with OGT p110 in addition to OGT p78, probably by competing homo-oligomer formation of OGT p110. As the OGT p110-Atx-10 interaction is competed by TPR6-7 (Fig. 4B), it might be concluded that the competition of Atx-10 and OGT p78 for OGT p110 binding is mainly due to steric hindrance. The TPR6-7 protein was detectable in this experiment throughout the OGT and Atx-10 peaks with some signal being found also in the void volume of the column (not shown), indicative of self-aggregation. Influence of Atx-10 Binding on Glycosyltransferase Activity—How does binding of OGT p78 or Atx-10 influence the enzymatic activity of OGT p110? As the expression levels of OGT p110 and Atx-10 are markedly up-regulated in the brain, we assumed that the OGT p110-Atx-10 complex corresponds to high glycosyltransferase activity, whereas dissociation of this interaction by OGT p78 might induce a down-regulation of intracellular glycosylation. To answer this question, we transfected PC12 cells with a cytoplasmic expression vector for Atx-10 and monitored intracellular glycosylation in the presence of different UDP-GlcNAc concentrations. Cells were kept in high glucose medium before the experiment as we assumed that high glucose concentrations maintain expression of OGT p78. Atx-10 overexpression led to a detectable increase of several O-linked GlcNAc-modified proteins in transfected cells with the peak activity lying at UDP-GlcNAc concentrations of about 10 μm and activity decreasing again at higher substrate levels (Fig. 5A). Some proteins in the higher molecular weight range showed dose-dependent increase in O-glycosylation up to 32 μm UDP-GlcNAc. In a control experiment, untransfected PC12 cells did not respond to the addition of UDP-GlcNAc with increased levels of cellular GlcNAc-modified proteins, indicating that the glycosyltransferase activity was saturated at cellular Atx-10 levels and the glucose concentration provided in the cell culture medium (Fig. 5B). The stimulation of OGT activity by Atx-10 could be quantified using CKII peptide as target and [3H]UDP-GlcNac as substrate (26.Marshall S. Duong T. Wu T. Hering M.A. Yada J. Higgins S. Orbus R.J.

Measuring a time course of OGT activity obtained from PC12 cell extract indicated that after 15 min, approximately twice as much CKII peptide is labeled in the presence of 1 μm Atx-10 than in its absence (data not shown). Interestingly, the amount of labeled peptide levels off at that point, which indicates a balance of peptide labeling and unlabeling processes, most likely due to the activity of acetylglucosaminidase and/or proteases. To investigate the Atx-10 concentration dependence of this stimulation, we incubated PC12 extract with various amounts of Atx-10 for 15 min as indicated in Fig. 6. The data follow a hyperbolic curve with a Kd value of about 0.1 μm, which indicates a fairly tight binding of Atx-10 to OGT under these particular conditions. As expected, OGT activity from brain extract, which does not contain OGT p78, did not show any significant additional stimulation by Atx-10 and is comparable with the values of OGT activity in PC12 cells obtained under saturating conditions of Atx-10 (data not shown). Nucleocytoplasmic modification with O-GlcNAc is an abundant and dynamic process involving a growing number of target proteins (19.Khidekel N. Ficarro S.B. Peters E.C. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13132-13137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Unlike N- and O-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, intracellular glycosylation is uniform and may directly change the functional state of a protein by competing with phosphorylation for the same serine and threonine side chains (27.Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1673: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is catalyzed by the activity of a single enzyme, OGT, which shows a broad substrate spectrum (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and thus transmits extracellular stress and nutrient signals to diverse cellular processes. OGT p110 has been shown to reflect the main O-GlcNac transferase activity in the cell. OGT p78 is the only other OGT variant found in the cytoplasmic compartment, and it is distinguished by being the shortest OGT splice form with only two TPR repeats (8.Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The other isoform with a molecular mass of 103 kDa appears to be restricted to mitochondria (28.Love D.C. Kochan J. Cathey R.L. Shin S.H. Hanover J.A. Kochran J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). By gel filtration analysis, OGT was originally defined as a p110 homotrimer or p110/p78 heterotrimer complex (12.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Jinek et al. (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated the crystal structure of a dimeric OGT TPR domain with a central contact region lying within TPR repeats 6 and 7. Our mass spectrometry measurements confirm that the TPR6-7 domain is able to form stable dimers in solution. In their study, Jinek et al. (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) stated a close structural relation of the OGT substrate binding domain with armadillo repeat proteins such as importin-α. In the present study, we demonstrate a constitutive association of OGT p110 with the SCA10 gene product, Atx-10, in brain tissue. The SCA10 gene shows an unusual pentanucleotide expansion in patients suffering from spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (29.Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P. Watase K. Khajavi M. McCall A.E. Davis C.F. Zu L. Achari M. Pulst S.M. Alonso E. Noebels J.L. Nelson D.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Ashizawa T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized Atx-10 as a 55-kDa armadillo repeat protein that is predominantly expressed in neuronal subpopulations as well as different brain regions (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Knockdown of SCA10 gene expression by RNA interference resulted in increased apoptosis of primary rat cerebellar neurons, indicating that Atx-10 is essential for cell survival in this CNS region (25.Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35542-35550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). OGT expression reveals a congruent pattern being highest in the brain and especially enriched in Purkinje cells (30.Akimoto Y. Kawakami H. Yamamoto K. Munetomo E. Hida T. Hirano H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3802-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our immunohistochemical data confirmed that Atx-10 and OGT colocalize in the cerebellum and associated nuclei to a major degree, although the OGT signal was more pan-neuronal as compared with the Atx-10 signal, which might be due to OGT isoforms that are not associated with Atx-10. Akimoto et al. (30.Akimoto Y. Kawakami H. Yamamoto K. Munetomo E. Hida T. Hirano H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3802-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) demonstrated that high expression levels of OGT corresponded to high levels of GlcNAc-modified proteins in the respective neuronal cells, indicating that elevated modification with GlcNAc is critical for cellular functions in this tissue. OGT p110 was the only cytosolic splice form of the enzyme we found in the brain, whereas in tissues that are involved in glucose storage and metabolism, such as liver and pancreas, OGT p78 was equally present. Kreppel et al. (13.Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) have shown that OGT p78 is also found in kidney and, to a lesser amount, in muscle tissues. Our gel filtration experiments clearly showed that the presence of OGT p78 in the cell cytosol leads to a dissociation of the OGT p110-Atx-10 complex. Thus, PC12 cells can serve as a model system for tissues with high OGT p78 levels in which Atx-10 is dysfunctional in respect of OGT activity. What is the influence of OGT p78 expression on the function of the enzyme? OGT isoforms have been shown to differ in their N terminus, exhibiting different numbers of TPR repeats (8.Hanover J.A. Yu S. Lubas W.B. Shin S.H. Ragano-Caracciola M. Kochran J. Love D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The TPR domain forms a substrate binding groove in the concave surface of the superhelix, whereas the dimerization site lies at the convex surface (9.Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Several groups (11.Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 31.Lubas W.A. Hanover J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10983-10988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) have shown that the removal of a significant number of TPR repeats (>5) dramatically decreases glycosylation efficiency. This implies that the truncated 2-TPR domain of OGT p78, although still being capable of competing for UDP-GlcNAc binding by the catalytic domain, does not allow for efficient substrate processing. In a recent publication, Lazarus et al. (32.Lazarus B.D. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have shown that recombinantly expressed OGT p78 does not show any glycosylation activity. We therefore speculate that OGT p78 expression might correspond to a negative regulatory signal, probably in response to high intracellular glucose levels in the respective tissues. This assumption is strengthened by the fact that neuronal tissues, which show the highest levels of OGT activity, lack OGT p78 expression, whereas pancreas, a regulatory organ for glucose metabolism, exhibits the most pronounced OGT p78 expression level. Furthermore, our data suggest that reconstitution of the OGT p110-Atx-10 complex in a cell type with high OGT p78 expression restores the capacity to respond to higher levels of UDP-GlcNAc. On the kinetic level, Atx-10 induced a 2-fold increase of OGT activity at saturating concentrations. Interestingly, Kreppel and Hart (11.Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) have reported that different subunit compositions can modulate the transferase activity of OGT p110. Our study demonstrates that Atx-10 and the OGT p78 splice form are competitors for OGT p110 binding. Atx-10 binding to OGT p110 appears to be constitutive in tissues where OGT p78 is absent, whereas OGT p78 binding to OGT p110 is constitutive in tissues even in the presence of Atx-10. Structural analysis and competition assays suggest a heterodimer formation of OGT p110 and Atx-10 by mimicry of OGT p110 homodimerization. As Atx-10 shows a similar structural motif as the OGT TPR domain, it may be discussed that Atx-10 serves as an adaptor molecule, which is able to alter and broaden the substrate spectrum of the enzyme. A dysregulated intracellular glycosylation resulting from a mutated SCA10 gene would therefore offer an explanation for the selective neurodegeneration of cerebellar cells in SCA10 patients. Knockdown of SCA10 expression by RNA interference, although inducing apoptosis, did not significantly alter intracellular glycosylation levels in primary cerebellar neurons (not shown), indicating that Atx-10 has additional cellular functions. This is strengthened by the observation that Atx-10 levels are not down-regulated in tissues in which Atx-10 and OGT p110 do not interact. We assume that the control of the OGT p78 isoform expression is a key mechanism regulating tissue-specific intracellular glycosylation activity. The challenge for future studies will be to unravel the molecular basis for the strong OGT p110-p78 interaction and to address the question how OGT p78 expression is controlled on the genetic level.

PGLYRP2 has a high constitutive expression in the liver but is not expressed in healthy human skin. PGLYRP2 mRNA is also not expressed in cultured human keratinocytes but is highly induced upon exposure to bacteria. In this study we identified the transcription start site for pglyrp2 and demonstrated that the differential expression of PGLYRP2 in hepatocytes and keratinocytes is regulated by different transcription factors whose binding sequences are located in different regions of the pglyrp2 promoter. Induction of pglyrp2 in keratinocytes is regulated by sequences in the distal region of the promoter and requires transcription factors NF-κB and Sp1, whereas constitutive expression of pglyrp2 in a hepatocyte cell line is regulated by sequences in the proximal region of the promoter and requires transcription factors c-Jun and ATF2. Regulation of constitutive and inducible expression of pglyrp2 is important for systemic and local innate immune responses to bacterial infections.

Mammals have a family of 4 PGRPs, which were initially named PGRP-S, PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, and PGRP-Iβ (for “short,” “long,” or “intermediate” transcripts, respectively), by analogy to insect PGRPs (7Liu C.

Recently, the Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee changed their names to peptidoglycan recognition protein 1, 2, 3, and 4 (PGLYRP1, PGLYRP2, PGLYRP3, and PGLYRP4), and this new nomenclature is used in this article. Mammalian PGLYRPs were originally thought to be pattern recognition receptors similar to insect PGRPs, however, recent data have demonstrated an effector role for these molecules. PGLYRP1 is produced in granulocytes and is antibacterial (7Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol.

We initially demonstrated differential and selective expression of the four PGLYRPs in various human tissues (7Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recently, we have analyzed the expression and induction of PGLYRP2 mRNA in various human tissues and cell types (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PGLYRP2 has a high constitutive expression in the liver, low expression in some parts of the intestinal tract and cornea, and is not expressed in healthy human skin. PGLYRP2 mRNA is also not expressed in cultured human keratinocytes but is highly induced upon exposure to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. PGLYRP2 mRNA is also induced by bacteria in cultured human corneal epithelial cells, but there is no expression or induction in human primary endothelial cells and other non-epithelial cells, such as the U373 astrocytoma cell line or peripheral blood monocytes (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The induction of PGLYRP2 correlates with expression of differentiation markers and stress response and requires activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to analyze the basis for this differential regulation of PGLYRP2 expression in hepatocytes and keratinocytes and to identify transcription factors that are involved in the constitutive expression of pglyrp2 in hepatocytes and in the induction of pglyrp2 transcription in keratinocytes stimulated by bacteria. Cells and Cell Stimulation—Human epidermal keratinocytes, isolated from neonatal foreskin, were obtained from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and grown in EpiLife medium with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement. These cells were used between the 3rd and 5th passage, and before stimulation the cells were maintained in medium without supplement for 18–24 h as described previously (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The hepatocyte cell line C3A (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 stably expressing Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (21Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% defined fetal calf serum. Keratinocytes and HEK293 cells were stimulated with 2 × 108 cells/ml of heat-killed (70 °C, 30 min) Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) or Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047). C3A cells were not stimulated for most experiments because our initial data showed that exposure of C3A cells to bacteria (as above) did not increase the already high constitutive expression of PGLYRP2 in these cells. RNA and Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA from normal human liver and skin were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively. RNA from cultured keratinocytes and C3A cells was isolated with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). In experiments with the calpain inhibitor ALLN (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), keratinocytes were cultured with the inhibitor (100 μm) for 1 h before stimulation. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR was done using TaqMan reagents and the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System as described previously (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For quantitative real time PCR, the comparative cycle threshold method was used with 18 S RNA as an endogenous control. Mapping the Transcription Start Site for pglyrp2—The transcription start site for pglyrp2 was mapped by two different methods, primer extension and 5′ RACE cloning. Primer extension was done using the Primer Extension System from Promega. Total RNA was isolated from 3 × 107 stimulated and unstimulated keratinocytes and from unstimulated C3A cells using the RNeasy Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The primer used for extension (Table 1) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. 100 fmol of labeled primer was annealed to 20 μg of RNA and used for the synthesis of cDNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. A sequencing reaction was run in parallel using the same primer and clone P2(–2005)Luc for a template using Sequenase version 2.0 (United States Biochemicals) and labeled with [α-32P]dATP. The products were analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide-sequencing gel and then visualized by autoradiography.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this studyNameSequence 5′ → 3′Oligonucleotide used for primer extension P2(-18)RTTCCAAGGGGTATTTCTGGTTGGOligonucleotides used for the 5′ RACE reaction P2(+47)RTGACCACAGTAGCAATCCGAGTAGG P2(+514)RCTGGGGAGGAGGTGGCTCTTACATCOligonucleotides used for constructing the PGLYRP2 promoter-luciferase plasmids P2(-2005)FGAGGTACCTGTAATCTCAGCTCCTTGGGAG P2(-1807)FTAGGTACCAGGCCGAGGCAGGAGGATTGCTT P2(-1606)FTAGGTACCGGTTCAAGACCAGCCTGGCCTA P2(-1411)FTAGGTACCACAGAGCGAGACTCCGTCTCAA P2(-1205)FGAGGTACCAGTGTCCCCCATTCACTCTATC P2(-1010)FGAGGTACCTGGAAACTCCCCGGGCTGGTTT P2(-607)FTAGGTACCAGCAGGAGGCAGTGCCAACTT P2(-400)FTAGGTACCGCTACAGAGCCGTCACTATGGG P2(-281)FTAGGTACCGATGGGCCTGGCTTACTGACCA P2(-260)FATGGTACCTGACCTCAGCCTAGGAGGGAC P2(-249)FCTGGTACCTAGGAGGGACAGAAGAGACT P2(-157)FTAGGTACCCACAGCTCTACGAGAGGCAGG P2(-100)FTAGGTACCGCTCTGCTCAGTTCTCTGTGC P2(-54)FTAGGTACCGTTCTCTGCCGAGGCCAACCAGA AATACCCCTTGGAAGCTGCTAGCAC P2(-18)RCAGCTAGCTTCCAAGGGGTATTTCTGGTTGGOligonucleotides used for gel shift P2 NFκB1FGCCCCCAGGGGAATCCCAG P2 NFκB1RAGGCCTGGGATTCCCCTGGGG P2 NFκB2FTCAGGCTGGACATTCCCAGG P2 NFκB2RAGGCCTGGGAATGTCCAGCCTGA P2 Sp1FGAGGCCGAGGCAGGAGGATTG P2 Sp1RGCAATCCTCCTGCCTCGGC P2 AP1FCCTGGCTTACTGACCACTGACCTCAG P2 AP1RCTAGGCTGAGGTCAGTGGTCAGTAAGOligonucleotides used for ChIP P2 NFκBFchGAGGTCCCCAGAAAGAGGACACCTG P2 NFκBRchCTCAAAACCAGCCCGGGGAGTTTCCA P2 Sp1FchTGACAGAGGGAGACCCTGCCTCA P2 Sp1RchTTTATCGGCCGGGCATGGTGG P2 AP1FchCAGTACAGCAGGCGGCAGCTGAGA P2 AP1RchGACAGACCTGCCTCTCGTAGAGCTG P2 CtrlFchGGAGACCAGGATGCCCAGATGAC P2 CtrlRchGCACAGAGAACTGAGCAGAGCCTOligonucleotides used for constructing mutant plasmids Homologous to PGLYRP2 promoter P2 NFκB1mTGGCCCCCAGGtGAAgCaCAGGCCTGGCTCA P2 NFκB2mTGGCTCAGGCTGtACgTTaCCAGGCCTGCCCT P2 Sp1mGAGGCCGAGGCAttAGGATTGCTTGHomologous to pGL3 Trans XmnI to EcoRVGCTCATCATTGGATATCGTTCTTCGGG Open table in a new tab The 5′ end of PGLYRP2 mRNA was also mapped by 5′ RACE using liver Marathon-Ready cDNA from Clontech.

More than 30 clones were analyzed for each primer. pglyrp2 Promoter Constructs—The pglyrp2 promoter, –2005 to –15 bp upstream of the start codon, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into the KpnI and NheI sites of the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic (Promega). This clone is referred to as P2(–2005)Luc. The promoter region was sequenced and aligned with the human genomic sequence in GenBank™ (AC011492). All deletion constructs were made using P2(–2005)Luc as template for PCR and the same reverse primer as that used for the original construct. All deletion constructs had the same 3′ end but different 5′ ends. The P2(–54)Luc plasmid was constructed with a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning –54 to –15 bp 5′ of the start codon. Constructs with site-specific mutations were made using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Clontech as described before (22Xu Z. Dziarski R. Wang Q. Swartz K. Sakamoto K.M. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6975-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Primers used for PCR and site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table 1. Restriction sites for KpnI and NheI were added to all upstream and downstream PCR primers, respectively. All constructs were analyzed by restriction digestion and sequencing (University of Chicago Cancer Center Sequencing Facility, Chicago, IL). Activation of pglyrp2 Promoter—Keratinocytes, C3A, and HEK293 cells were cultured at 0.2 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates (0.5 ml/well) in complete medium. Subconfluent cells were transfected in duplicate with the different pglyrp2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids or empty vector (pLuc) at 0.8 μg/ml for keratinocytes and 0.2 μg/ml for C3A and HEK293 cells. In co-transfection experiments keratinocytes were transfected with P2(–2005)Luc and 0.03 μg/ml of a control vector or the constitutive repressor of IκB, IκBΔN (21Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), or with NFκB-Luc (21Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and the dominant negative forms of p38 or ERK1 (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). C3A cells were transfected with P2(–607)Luc and 0.03 μg/ml of a control vector or the dominant negative forms of ATF2 (23Ronai Z.R. Yang Y.-M. Fuchs S.Y. Adler V.A. Sardana M. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or c-Jun (24Jonathan H. Babij C. Whitfield J. Pfarr C.M. Lallemand D. Yaniv M. Rubin L.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). All transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following transfection keratinocytes were maintained in medium without supplement for 18–24 h and then stimulated with bacteria (as above) for 12 h and cell lysates were prepared (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were stimulated with bacteria (as above) for 12 h immediately following transfection and cell lysates were prepared (21Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). C3A cells were not stimulated and cells were harvested 18–24 h after transfection. Expression of the pglyrp2 gene (activation of the pglyrp2 promoter) and NF-κB-regulated transcription was measured as luciferase activity and determined in the cell lysates as described previously (22Xu Z. Dziarski R. Wang Q. Swartz K. Sakamoto K.M. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6975-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as a direct count of luciferase activity, or as percent of the P2(–2005)Luc, P2(–281)Luc, P2(–607)Luc, or NFκB-Luc constructs. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Keratinocytes and C3A cells were cultured at 0.35–0.4 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates (1.0 ml/well) for 16–20 h. Keratinocytes were stimulated as described above and in the figure legends. Cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides homologous to specific regions in the pglyrp2 promoter (shown in Table 1) were labeled with [α-32P]dATP and incubated with nuclear proteins for 30 min at 22 °C (25Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To identify the protein(s) that binds an oligonucleotide, nuclear extracts were preincubated with specific antibodies for 30 min at 22 °C followed by incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide. Antibodies to p50, p65, and c-Rel were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and antibodies to Sp1, c-Jun, and ATF2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To determine specificity of binding, samples were preincubated with an excess of unlabeled specific or nonspecific oligonucleotide for 20 min at 22 °C. All samples were then separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography (25Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP assay was performed using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, keratinocytes and C3A cells were cultured at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 10-cm tissue culture plates (12 ml/plate). One group of keratinocytes was stimulated for 25 min with Enterobacter and another group was not stimulated. The DNA was fixed with 1% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and then treated with 1 m glycine for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were harvested and lysed in SDS lysis buffer and sonicated 4 × 20 s with 10 min on ice between each sonication. The DNA fragments were analyzed on a gel and were 200 to 1000 bp in size. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C and stored in aliquots at 80 °C. Aliquots were used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies against p65, Sp1, c-Jun, ATF2, or mock immunoprecipitated. Input DNA was not immunoprecipitated. The protein-DNA complexes were heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-linking and DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Regions of the pglyrp2 promoter that contained the NF-κB, Sp1, or AP-1 sites were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1. Primers that amplified a different region of the promoter were used as control (Table 1). Degradation of IκB and Western Blots—Keratinocytes were cultured and stimulated as described above for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Whole cell lysates were prepared, separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon P as described previously (25Gupta D. Kirkland T.N. Viriyakosol S. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23310-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB was determined by Western blotting with an antibody specific to IκB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mapping of the Transcription Start Site of PGLYRP2 mRNA and Analysis of the pglyrp2 Promoter—We have previously shown that PGLYRP2 mRNA is differentially expressed in various human tissues (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To identify the regulatory elements and transcription factors that are involved in this complex expression of PGLYRP2 we first mapped the 5′ end of the PGLYRP2 mRNA by two different methods: primer extension and 5′ RACE reaction. Primer extension with RNA from keratinocytes and C3A cells gave two products that mapped the 5′ end to G at 107 bp or A at 102 bp upstream of the start codon (Fig. 1A). Primer extension products with keratinocytes stimulated with bacteria were more prominent than the products obtained with unstimulated keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). This increase indicates the induction of PGLYRP2 mRNA in keratinocytes exposed to bacteria. RNA from unstimulated C3A cells also had strong primer extension products, which indicates the high constitutive expression of PGLYRP2 in liver. The 5′ RACE reactions using liver Marathon Ready cDNA resulted in clones with 5 different 5′ ends (Fig. 1B). One of these 5′ ends was identical to the G that was mapped as a 5′ end in the primer extension experiment and this G at the –107 bp position is considered the transcription start site of PGLYRP2 mRNA and the region upstream as the promoter. We analyzed about 2000 bases upstream of the translation start site using both Match and Patch programs in the Transfac 7.0 data base (Biobase). The pglyrp2 promoter does not have a TATA or a CAAT box, however, numerous potential transcription factor-binding sites were identified. Putative sites on the distal promoter included 2 NF-κB, Sp1, C/EBP, AP-2, and NF-1, whereas the proximal promoter had several AP-1 binding elements (Fig. 1B). PGLYRP2 mRNA and pglyrp2 Promoter-Luciferase Plasmids Show Differential Expression in the Liver and Skin, and This Requires Different Regions of the pglyrp2 Promoter—We have previously shown and confirmed in this study that PGLYRP2 mRNA is differentially expressed in the liver and skin (Fig. 2A). To determine the mechanisms that regulate this differential expression between the liver and skin we analyzed the expression of PGLYRP2 mRNA in the C3A human liver cell line and in primary human keratinocytes. C3A cells have high constitutive expression of PGLYRP2 mRNA, which did not change in the presence of bacteria (Fig. 2B). In contrast, keratinocytes do not express PGLYRP2 mRNA, however, stimulation of cells by Bacillus or Enterobacter induced high expression (Fig. 2B) as shown previously (20Wang H. Gupta D. Li X. Dziarski R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7216-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To identify regions of the promoter that regulate the expression of PGLYRP2 in keratinocytes and C3A cells we constructed pglyrp2 promoter-luciferase plasmids. We first made plasmids with about 2 kbp (P2(–2005)Luc) or 1 kbp (P2(–1010)Luc) upstream regions of the start codon and these plasmids were transfected into keratinocytes, C3A cells, and HEK293 cells and pglyrp2 transcription was determined by measuring luciferase activity. Both P2(–2005)Luc and P2(–1010)Luc plasmids were highly expressed in C3A cells (Fig. 2C) and the expression did not change in the presence of bacteria (data not shown). These results indicate that the regulatory elements required for high constitutive expression of PGLYRP2 in the liver lie within the 1-kbp region of the promoter and we have termed this the proximal promoter. Both plasmids had no promoter activity in unstimulated keratinocytes, however, P2(–2005)Luc, but not P2(–1010)Luc, was highly induced by both Bacillus and Enterobacter (Fig. 2, C and D). These results indicate that the regulatory elements that are necessary for induction of pglyrp2 transcription in keratinocytes stimulated with bacteria lie within the 1–2 kbp upstream region of the pglyrp2 promoter, which we are calling the distal promoter. Neither construct is expressed or induced in HEK293 embryonic kidney cells expressing TLR2 (Fig. 2, C and D), which respond to stimulation with bacteria by activating NF-κB and inducing interleukin-8 mRNA expression (21Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To narrow down the region of the distal promoter that is required for the induction of PGLYRP2 expression in keratinocytes stimulated with bacteria, we next tested the expression of pglyrp2 promoter luciferase plasmids with serial deletions within the 1–2-kbp upstream region (Fig. 3). These plasmids were not expressed in unstimulated keratinocytes but were induced upon exposure to bacteria, however, the induction is reduced and eventually lost as the promoter is deleted to 1 kbp (see P2(–1010)luc construct). Two regions within the distal promoter were necessary for the induction of pglyrp2 transcription in keratinocytes stimulated with bacteria (Fig. 3B). The first region is between –1198 and –1010 bp and the second is between –1809 and –1604 bp on the promoter (Fig. 3B). Numerous putative transcription factor binding sites are located within these two regions of the pglyrp2 promoter, including, NF-κB, Sp1, AP1, and AP2 (Figs. 1 and 3). Because constitutive expression of PGLYRP2 in C3A cells requires the 1-kb region of the promoter we tested the expression of pglyrp2 promoter luciferase plasmids with serial deletions within this region of the promoter. The P2(–281)Luc construct is the highest expressed in C3A cells (Fig. 3C). The sequence upstream of –281 bp may contain repressor elements indicated by lower expression of the P2(–1010)Luc construct as compared with the P2(–281)Luc construct. The region of the promoter between –281 and –157 bp is required for the maximal expression of pglyrp2 in C3A cells, however, sequences in the 5′-untranslated region of PGLYR2 mRNA control the low expression of PGLYRP2 mRNA (see P2(–100)Luc construct). Expression of all plasmids in C3A cells was constitutive and did not change in the presence of bacteria (data not shown). These results indicate that different regions of the pglyrp2 promoter are involved in up- and down-regulation of pglyrp2 transcription in C3A cells. In this study we focused on the region between –281 and –157 bp of the pglyrp2 promoter, because this region is required for the maximal expression of PGLYRP2 mRNA in C3A cells. Nuclear Proteins from Keratinocytes Stimulated with Bacteria Bind NF-κB Consensus Sequences in the pglyrp2 Promoter—The two regions of pglyrp2 promoter required for maximal induction of PGLYRP2 mRNA contain binding sites for several different transcription factors, including NF-κB and Sp1. NF-κB is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses and we next determined whether NF-κB is involved"
https://openalex.org/W2080553938,"TFF1 is overexpressed in inflammatory diseases and human cancers of the digestive and urogenital systems. To examine the transforming potential of TFF1 in human colon epithelial cells, premalignant PC/AA/C1 adenoma cells (PC) derived from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were transformed by the TFF1 cDNA and used as a model of the adenoma–carcinoma transition. Constitutive expression of TFF1 increased anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar, and induced or potentiated the growth of colon PC-TFF1 and kidney MDCKts.src-TFF1 tumor xenografts in athymic mice. This resulted in reduction of thapsigargin-induced apoptosis and promotion of collagen type I invasion through several oncogenic pathways. Using the differential display approach to identify TFF1 target genes, we found that the dual specific phosphatases Cdc25A and B implicated in cell cycle transitions are strongly upregulated under active forms in both PC-TFF1 and HCT8/S11-TFF1 colon cancer cells. Accordingly, TFF1 expression is absent in normal human colon crypts but is induced in correlation with Cdc25a and b transcript levels and tumor grade in familial and sporadic colon adenomas and carcinomas. We propose that TFF1 and Cdc25A-B cooperate with other dominant oncogenic pathways to induce the adenoma and adenocarcinoma transitions. Agents that target TFF1/Cdc25 signaling pathways may be useful for treating patients with TFF1-positive solid tumors."

These enzymes or their catalytic products have been causatively linked to the elaboration of vascular networks and the regulation of capillary function. The amount of ATP generated extracellularly is small, requiring sensitive analytical methods for quantification. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to revisit extracellular ATP synthesis using a reliable tetrazolium reduction assay and multiwell plate cultures. Test conditions compatible with AK stability were established. Extracellular AK activity was found to be <1% of the total (intracellular and extracellular), raising the possibility that the external enzyme could have leaked from living cells and/or a few dying cells. To determine whether AK inadvertently leaked from the cells, the activity of another cytoplasmic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), was also measured. G6PD is present in the cytoplasm in similar abundance to AK. The activity ratio of G6PD (extracellular/total) was found to be similar to that of AK. Because G6PD in the medium was probably due to leakage, other cytoplasmic macromolecules, including AK, should be released proportionately from the cells. The role of plasma membrane ATP synthase in extracellular ATP formation was examined using Hanks' balanced salt solution with and without selective inhibitors of AK and ATP synthase activities. With P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate (inhibitor of AK activity), no extracellular ATP synthesis was detected, whereas with oligomycin, piceatannol, and aurovertin (inhibitors of F1F0-ATP synthase and F1-ATPase activities), no inhibition of extracellular ATP synthesis was observed.

It is described and its suitability for this study confirmed at the beginning “Results.” Its use in studies of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a line of human embryonic lung fibroblasts (WI38) in culture suggests that enough AK does indeed leak from cells to account for the observed extracellular ATP formation from ADP. Cells—Low passage number (3–10 passages) HUVECs from three different sources (American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1730), Cascade Biologics, and GlycoTech Corp.) were used in this study. The American Type Culture Collection HUVECs were of passage number >10. Most of the experiments reported here involved HUVECs from GlycoTech Corp., and the results using them were substantiated with HUVECs from Cascade Biologics and American Type Culture Collection. They were cultivated in HUVEC medium (1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml heparin, 15 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) in 100-mm tissue culture plates or T-75 tissue culture flasks and, for experimental purposes, in collagen-coated multiwell plates. WI38 cells (ATCC CCL-75) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with the above antibiotics and 10% FBS. Reagents—AMP (acid form, type V), ADP (disodium salt, equine muscle), ATP (disodium salt, trihydrate), Glu-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1.1.1.49; recombinant, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity), hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mixture of isozymes as a crystalline suspension in ammonium sulfate, type C-130), AK (rabbit or chicken muscle, essentially salt-free, lyophilized powder), Ap5A, Triton X-100, penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, phenazine methosulfate, heparin (sodium salt, porcine intestinal mucosa), and phosphate determination reagent (Fiske-SubbaRow) were obtained from Sigma. Other materials were obtained as indicated: β-NADP (sodium salt), U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH); Tris, Fisher; Bradford reagent, Bio-Rad; p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT), Lancaster Synthesis (Windham, NH); crystalline porcine trypsin, Worthington; basal culture medium (50:50 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium), Invitrogen; rat tail collagen, BD Biosciences; FBS, Serologicals Corp. (Norcross, GA); Isoton, Coulter Electronics, Inc. (Hialeah, FL); and endothelial cell growth supplement (also called endothelial mitogen), Biomedical Technologies, Inc. (Stoughton, MA). Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and DPBSA (DPBS lacking Mg2+ and Ca2+) were prepared according to Freshney (22Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1983Google Scholar). Cell Culture Protocol—Cells were grown to near confluence in the indicated medium in 100-mm tissue culture plates or T-75 tissue culture flasks, with nutrient replenishment 1 day prior to use. The culture vessels used for experiments were coated with type 1 rat tail collagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. The inoculum for an experiment was prepared by incubating the cell layer at 37 °C in trypsin/EDTA solution (0.01% crystalline porcine trypsin and 0.1% EDTA in DPBSA) until the cells had detached from the dish, terminating the tryptic action by adding a small volume of medium containing 5% FBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged briefly at low speed (300 rpm) in a clinical centrifuge, and the cells were suspended in the appropriate medium. The cell density was determined by electronic particle counting in Isoton on a CASY 1 Model TT counter and sizer (Schärfe System GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany). The cells were diluted in medium to the desired density, seeded in culture vessels, and incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2 and 95% air) at 37.5 °C. Assay Mixture and Protocol—The principles and protocol for preparing the secondary assay mixture (see Table 1) have been described by Haslam et al. (23Haslam G. Wyatt D. Kitos P.A. Cytotechnology. 2000; 32: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Haslam G. Richter M.L. Wyatt D. Ye Q.-Z. Kitos P.A. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The crystalline suspension of G6PD was diluted 1:8 in 60 mm Tris (pH 7.8), dispensed in small volumes in sealed vials, and stored at –20 °C. To test for AK activity, the cells were seeded in collagen-coated 6- or 12-well plates at densities needed to attain the desired confluence (usually total) during the growth period (1–4 days); 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate reached confluence overnight. The growth medium was then removed; the plates were washed as indicated; the primary assay mixture (see Table 1) was added; and the plates were incubated, usually for 30 min at 37 °C. The supernatant liquid was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing 20 μl of 9.75 mm Ap5A, an inhibitor of AK activity (25Sinev M.A. Sineva E.V. Ittah V. Ilaas E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6425-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), at 0 °C; centrifuged at 3000 × g for 1 min; and transferred to a clean tube on ice. The liquid was dispensed at 0.15 ml/well in a 96-well plate using a multichannel pipetter, and 0.05 ml of secondary assay mixture (see Table 1) was added, avoiding bubble formation. The plate contents were mixed for 30 s on a plate shaker or Vortex mixer (fast enough to stir the contents without causing spillage or foaming) and then incubated at 37 °C. At the specified times, the plates were again vortexed, and the A492 values were determined on a multiwell plate reader (AutoReader II, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc., Raritan, NJ).TABLE 1Assay mixtures for Steps 1 and 2 of the AK/INT assayPrimary assay mixture in HBSSSecondary assay mixture in waterADP, 200 μmTris, 0.333 m (pH 7.8)BSA, 20 μg/mlNADP, 0.5 mmHK, 8.45 milliunits/mlINT, 1.25 mmTriton X-100, 0.2% (w/v)PMS, 0.02 mmG6PD, 141 milliunits/ml Open table in a new tab When cellular G6PD activity was being tested, the primary assay mixture was modified. ADP, hexokinase, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were omitted, and 0.125 mm NADP was added where indicated to stabilize G6PD; also where indicated, DPBS, DPBSA, or another medium was substituted for HBSS. In the secondary assay mixture, G6PD was omitted; 4.2 mm Glu-6-P was added; and the NADP concentration was adjusted to compensate for the amount added to the primary assay mixture. All subsequent steps were identical to those in the AK assay protocol. F1-ATPase Assay—Soluble mitochondrial F1-ATPase was prepared from beef heart according to the method of Knowles and Penefsky (26Knowles J. Penefsky H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6617-6623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity was determined according to Taussky and Shorr (27Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), measuring inorganic phosphate formed from ATP/mg of F1-ATPase protein, determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). To determine F1-ATPase activity and its inhibition by test substances, the enzyme solution (5 μg/ml) was incubated with Ap5A or a putative inhibitor for 5 min at 37 °C in 25 mm Tricine (pH 8.0). Then, 0.5 ml of the assay mixture (25 mm Tricine (pH 8.0), 25 μm NaSO3, 4 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid and chilled to 0 °C. One ml of Fiske-SubbaRow color reagent was added, and the system was held at 0 °C for another 5 min and then warmed to room temperature. Absorbances at 740 nm were determined on a spectrophotometer. Cell Proliferation Studies—To determine the effects of potential inhibitors of ATP synthase on proliferation, the cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 0.5 ml of medium containing the test substance in 12-well plates. At specified times thereafter, the cells were trypsinized, suspended in Isoton, counted, and sized on a CASY 1 Model TT counter. Multiwell Colorimetric Assay for AK—AK activities were determined using a 96-well plate tetrazolium reduction assay (AK/INT assay) (Fig. 1). The methodology was based in part on similar assays: the lactate dehydrogenase/INT (23Haslam G. Wyatt D. Kitos P.A. Cytotechnology. 2000; 32: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and G6PD/INT (24Haslam G. Richter M.L. Wyatt D. Ye Q.-Z. Kitos P.A. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) assays for determining viable cell numbers and the ATP/INT assay for measuring ATP concentrations in solution. 3K. K. Colvert, A. P. Pirotte, G. Haslam, J. A. Knight, H. S. Samra, P. A. Kitos, and M. L. Richter, submitted for publication. The reactions of the AK/INT assay were carried out in two steps. In Step 1, samples with unknown AK activity were incubated at 37 °C for a specified time in the primary assay mixture (Table 1). AK catalyzed the conversion of ADP to ATP plus AMP, and in turn, the ATP phosphorylated glucose to Glu-6-P. The AK-catalyzed reaction was halted at selected times by adding Ap5A and chilling to 0 °C. When the AK activity of cells was being determined, the solutions were centrifuged after Step 1 for 1 min at 3000 × g to remove cellular debris. In Step 2, 0.15-ml aliquots of the mixtures from Step 1 were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate; 0.05-ml portions of the secondary assay mixture were added to each well; and the plate was incubated for at least 60 min at 37 °C, long enough for stoichiometric conversion of INT to INT formazan (INT-F) via the Glu-6-P produced in Step 1 (Fig. 1). Suitability of the AK/INT Assay for Measuring AK Activity—In a model study of AK activity using the AK/INT assay, three different concentrations of rabbit muscle AK (27, 53, and 107 milliunits/ml) were used in 3.5 ml of primary assay mixture in the wells of a 6-well plate. AK activity was terminated at selected times by transferring 1.5-ml aliquots of the mixture to tubes containing Ap5A (final Ap5A concentration of 130 μm) on ice. Then, 0.15-ml aliquots were transferred to wells of a 96-well plate, and the secondary assay mixture was added. The 96-well plate was incubated at 37 °C with periodic A492 measurements. At 27 milliunits/ml AK, the rate of formation of ATP from ADP was constant for at least 30 min (Fig. 2A). At higher AK activities, the rate of ATP formation in Step 1 departed from linearity after 10 min of incubation because of ADP depletion. During the first 10 min, however, the rate of ATP formation from ADP was proportional to the activity of AK (Fig. 2B). ATP reference standards (200 μm ATP in the primary assay mixture instead of ADP and hexokinase) eliminated Reaction a in Fig. 1 and were used in this and all AK/INT assays. INT reduction in Step 2 was complete by 60 min (net A492 = 1.53 at 60 min; 1 absorbance unit at 492 nm = 20 nmol of INT-F/well in a 96-well plate) (Fig. 2C). Stability of Rabbit Muscle AK in HBSS—AK was unstable at 37 °C in dilute aqueous solution (half-time of ∼8 min) (Fig. 3A), but could be stabilized, at least in part, by BSA. The concentration of BSA needed for half-maximal stabilization (EC50) of rabbit muscle AK was ∼1 μg/ml (Fig. 3B). Whether other substances in the AK/INT assay stabilize the enzyme was explored. Commercial rabbit muscle AK was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with AMP, ADP, ATP, Mg2+, Triton X-100, or BSA, and its activity was determined by the AK/INT assay. Of these reagents, only BSA prevented rapid and complete loss of AK activity (Fig. 3C). Stability of Rabbit Muscle AK in HBSS in the Presence of Living Cells—To determine the stability of extracellular AK in the presence of living cells, HUVECs were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate containing 3 ml of HUVEC medium. Additional wells had medium only; the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the wells were washed zero to three times, 3 ml/wash, with HBSS. Then, 1 ml of a solution of rabbit muscle AK (prepared freshly on ice at 156 milliunits/ml in HBSS) with or without 20 μg/ml BSA was added to designated wells, and the plates were incubated at either 37 or 0 °C for 30 min. The supernatant solutions were transferred to tubes on ice and centrifuged, and 0.15-ml portions of the supernatants were transferred to the wells of a 96-well plate on ice. Then, 0.05 ml of modified secondary assay mixture was added, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C. The modified secondary assay mixture contained 600 μm ADP and 25.35 milliunits/ml hexokinase, so the concentrations of these components were equal to those used in the standard primary incubation. The final concentrations of all reagents were the same as those used in the AK/INT assay. The absorbances at 492 nm were determined at 60 min (Table 2). At 37 °C without BSA and cells, AK was completely inactivated by 30 min of preincubation (Table 2, row 3). Even at 0 °C, much of the activity was lost (row 1); but with 20 μg/ml BSA, the activity was maximal (row 2). At 37 °C in the presence of BSA but without a cell monolayer, a substantial portion of the activity was lost (row 4). At 37 °C in the presence of cells that had been washed zero to three times with HBSS, AK was stabilized (rows 5–8), apparently unaffected by the HBSS washings.TABLE 2Stabilization of rabbit muscle AK by BSA and by HUVECsWell no.Temp. during preincubationCellsBSA (200 μg/ml)No. of washesA492 at 60 min of secondary incubation (±S.D.)°C10--00.687 (0.030)20-+01.309 (0.016)337--00.006 (0.004)437-+00.728 (0.028)537+-01.306 (0.016)637+-11.109 (0.026)737+-21.122 (0.031)837+-31.218 (0.034) Open table in a new tab Relative Abundance of AK Inside and Outside HUVECs—Intracellular and extracellular AK activities of HUVECs were determined as follows. Cells were seeded at two different densities (2.5 × 105 cells/well for external AK activity and 5 × 104 cells/well for total AK activity) in 6-well plates with 3 ml of HUVEC medium and incubated for 24 h. The cultures were washed once with 3 ml of HBSS with and without 20 μg/ml BSA. To the denser cultures was added 1 ml of primary assay mixture with and without BSA, and to the less dense cultures was added 1 ml of primary assay mixture containing 0.05% Triton X-100, which lysed the cells. The plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the supernatant solutions were collected in centrifuge tubes containing Ap5A on ice. The tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to the wells of a 96-well plate at 0.15 ml/well. The secondary assay mixture was added; the plates were incubated for 55 min; and the absorbances at 492 nm were obtained (Table 3). BSA in the primary incubation made little difference to the AK activity of either the supernatant medium or the medium plus cells. Extracellular AK was found to be a very small fraction (∼0.6%) of the whole cultures.TABLE 3Intra- and extracellular AK activities in HUVEC culturesWell no.BSA in washBSA in primary incubationTriton X-100 in primary incubationA492 at 55 min of secondary incubationATP formed from ADPnmol/h/1 × 106 cells1---0.030 (0.008)40.0 (10.7)2+--0.031 (0.004)41.3 (5.3)3++-0.026 (0.009)34.7 (12.0)4--+0.968 (0.027)6454 (180)5+++0.977 (0.037)6514 (247) Open table in a new tab Extracellular and Intracellular G6PD Activities—To determine whether the abundance of AK in the HUVEC medium was unusually large, a comparison was made with that of another major cytoplasmic enzyme, G6PD. G6PD can be stabilized in aqueous solution by the addition of NADP, one of its substrates, and assayed using a modified secondary assay mixture via Reactions c and d (Fig. 1). G6PD was omitted from the modified mixture; the only G6PD present was cell-derived, and in this system, it was rate-limiting. The substrate Glu-6-P was added at 4 mm to the modified mixture, and the NADP concentration was adjusted to compensate for that added to stabilize the enzyme. HUVECs were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of medium in a 6-well plate and incubated overnight. The cultures were washed with HBSS and incubated for 30 min with 1.5 ml of HBSS, DPBS, or DPBSA supplemented with 0.125 mm NADP; one well was incubated with HBSS without NADP. The incubation solutions were chilled, centrifuged, and dispensed at 0.15 ml/well in a 96-well plate. The modified secondary assay mixture was added and the plate incubated. To the fifth well of the 6-well plate was added 1.5 ml of fresh medium plus 0.5 ml of secondary assay mixture, modified as described above but with NADP at the standard concentration. The contents of this well were mixed by pipetting up and down, distributed at 0.2 ml/well in the 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 °C. The A492 values were determined periodically. The sixth well of the 6-well plate was used to obtain a cell count. The rate of INT reduction with the whole culture extract (fifth well) was much greater than with the supernatant medium (first four wells), and an A492 value was obtained within the first 10 min of incubation. The kinetics of the assays of the supernatant medium are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that, in HBSS and DPBS, the cells released similar amounts of G6PD during the primary incubation. In DPBSA, the release was somewhat greater. The G6PD activities/h/1 × 106 cells, determined by linear regression analysis, are shown in Table 4.TABLE 4Total and extracellular G6PD activities in HUVECsWell no.Culture fractionAssay mediumGlu-6-P oxidized (±S.D.)nmol/h/1 × 106 cells1Extracellular mediumHBSS+NADP36.2 (2.4)2Extracellular mediumHBSS4.1 (1.8)3Extracellular mediumDPBSA+NADP55.8 (3.3)4Extracellular mediumDPBS+NADP39.6 (4.0)5Total (cells + medium)HUVEC3972 (70) Open table in a new tab AK Activities in Human Endothelial and Non-endothelial Cell"
https://openalex.org/W2041605978,"Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter region CpG islands is associated with gene silencing and serves as an alternative to mutations in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. We identified a gene TMS1 (for Target of Methylation-mediated Silencing) that is subject to such epigenetic silencing in a significant proportion of human breast and other cancers. Also known as ASC and PYCARD, TMS1 encodes a bipartite intracellular signaling molecule with proposed roles in apoptosis and inflammation. However, the precise role of this protein in the pathogenesis of breast and other cancers has not been clearly defined. In this study, we examined the role of TMS1/ASC in death receptor signaling. We found that TMS1/ASC is upregulated in response to treatment with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in breast epithelial cells, but not in human fibroblasts. This upregulation was not dependent on the synthesis of a TNFα-regulated intermediate or alterations in mRNA stability, suggesting a direct effect on TMS1/ASC transcription. Induction of TMS1/ASC by TNFα was blocked by co-expression of a dominant negative IκBα, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RelA/p65, or concurrent treatment with SP600125, indicating a requirement for the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and jun kinase signaling pathways. Although previous work has suggested that TMS1/ASC may be directly regulated by p53, we found that whereas treatment of breast epithelial cells or normal diploid fibroblasts with DNA damaging agents resulted in the stabilization of endogenous p53 and a concomitant increase in p21, it had little impact on the expression of TMS1/ASC mRNA or protein. We further show that whereas TMS1/ASC is not required for TNFα or TRAIL-induced activation of NF-κB or caspase-8, it can promote caspase-8 activation independently of death receptor–ligand interactions. Taken together, these data suggest that upregulation of TMS1/ASC by TNFα and subsequent activation of caspase-8 could function to amplify the apoptotic signal induced by death receptors in some cell types, including breast epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026783949,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression has been linked to cell survival, transformation, and hyperproliferation. We examined the regulation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and p53 target genes by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in human synovial fibroblasts (HSF). PGE2 induced a time-dependent increase in p53 Ser15 phosphorylation, with no discernible change in overall p53 levels. PGE2-dependent Ser15 phosphorylation was apparently mediated by activated p38 MAP kinase as SB202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, blocked the response. Overexpression of a MKK3 construct, but not MKK1, stimulated SB202190-sensitive p53 Ser15 phosphorylation. PGE2-stimulated [phospho-Ser15]p53 transactivated a p53 response element (GADD45)-luciferase reporter in transiently transfected HSF (SN7); the effect was compromised by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant (dnm) of p53 or excess p53S15A expression plasmid but mimicked by a constitutively active p53S15E expression construct. PGE2, wtp53 expression in the presence of PGE2, and p53S15E suppressed steady-state levels of MEKK1-induced MMP-1 mRNA, effects nullified with co-transfection of p53 dnm or p53S15A. MEKK1-induced MMP-1 promoter-driven luciferase activity was largely dependent on a c/EBPβ-NF-κB-like enhancer site at –2008 to –1972 bp, as judged by deletion and point mutation analyses. PGE2, overexpression of p53wt with PGE2, or p53S15E abolished the MEKK1-induced MMP-1 promoter luciferase activity. Gel-shift/super gel-shift analyses identified c/EBPβ dimers and c/EBPβ/NF-κB p65 heterodimers as binding species at the apparent site of MEKK1-dependent transactivation. PGE2-stimulated [phospho-Ser15]p53 abrogated the DNA binding of c/EBPβ dimers and c/EBPβ/NF-κB p65 heterodimers.

In response to distinct forms of cellular stress, the tumor suppressor gene product p53 becomes activated and functions to maintain cellular and tissular homeostasis by protecting genomic integrity. The latter is largely accomplished through the promotion of cell cycle checkpoints and/or activation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) (1.Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W.

The stabilization and activation of p53 is regulated by protein-protein interactions (e.g. with MDM2 ubiquitin ligase) (10.Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 175-186PubMed Google Scholar) and through multiple post-translational covalent modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumolation, occurring largely in the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. For example, CBP/p300-dependent acetylation of Lys383 of p53 is required for the transcriptional induction of p21 subsequent to cellular DNA damage (genotoxicity) (11.Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H.

Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase or mutating Ser33 and Ser46 to alanine abrogated UV-induced p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent apoptosis (12.Bulavin D. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K.

Interestingly, Ser15 and Ser37 phosphorylation also occurs following UV exposure in transformed cell lines and is contingent on efficient Ser33 and Ser46 phosphorylation, suggesting that extensive N-terminal phosphorylation of p53 may be necessary for full activity (12.Bulavin D.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder, with systemic features and joint involvement, resulting in erosive synovitis with hyperproliferation of synovial lining cells, cartilage matrix degradation, and joint destruction (15.Firestein G.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 19-24Crossref Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular basis of matrix degradation is thought to be dependent on the action of a number of proteolytic enzymes (matrix metalloprotease, MMPs) that may be produced by both soft and hard tissue elements and by inflammatory cells (16.Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 423-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The etiology of synovial hyperproliferation is ill defined with anecdotal reports of elevated/aberrant oncogene, growth factor and adhesion molecule synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 15.Firestein G.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 19-24Crossref Scopus (2785) Google Scholar). Firestein et al. (17.Firestein G.S. Nguyen K. Aupperle K.R. Yeo M. Boyle D.L. Zvaifler N.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2413-2451Google Scholar) reported that RA lining cells expressed elevated levels of p53 and that mutant p53 transcripts, identical to those isolated from human tumors, are also present in a subset of RA synovium (18.Firestein G.S.

The mechanism sustaining p53 expression remains unclear although it is hypothesized that a putative genotoxic environment in RA joints may cause DNA strand breaks. A role for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in neoplasmic transformation has attracted considerable attention particularly in light of the clinical studies indicating that COX-2 inhibitors may have chemotherapeutic value (reviewed in Ref. 19.Fosslien E. Ann. Clin. Lab Sci. 2000; 30: 3-21PubMed Google Scholar). As yet no consensus has been achieved on mechanistic aspects of the putative chemopreventive effects. We recently demonstrated that elevated and persistent expression of COX-2 in RA-affected synovial membranes may be the result of a controlled positive feedback loop involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (20.Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31720-37731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Ambient levels of PGE2 are very high in the RA synovial environment (21.He Q.W. Pelletier J.-P. Martel-Pelletier J. Laufer S. Di Battista J.A. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar) and the eicosanoid sustains COX-2 through a prostaglandin E2 EP4 receptor/MKK3/6/p38 MAP kinase/protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated process involving transcriptional but primarily post-transcriptional mechanisms (20.Faour W.H.

In RA synovial tissue explants, PGE2-dependent effects account for elevated levels of AP-1 family members (c-Jun excepted) and the potent cell growth stimulating transcription factor, Egr-1 (22.He Q.W. He Y. Faour W. Di Battista J.A. Osteoarthritis Cart. 2001; 9B: S9Google Scholar, 23.Faour W.H. Alaaeddine N. Mancini A. He Q.W. Jovanovic D. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, the eicosanoid potently suppresses interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) as well as the matrix-destructive metalloprotease MMP-1 to the extent that the latter substances are only detectable when the membranes are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (21.He Q.W. Pelletier J.-P. Martel-Pelletier J. Laufer S. Di Battista J.A. J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29: 546-553PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Faour W.H. Alaaeddine N. Mancini A. He Q.W. Jovanovic D. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Given the plausible link established between p53, MMP-1 overexpression, and RA synovial hyperproliferation (24.Sun Y. Sun Y. Wenger L. Rutter J.L. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cheung H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11535-11540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we sought to clarify the role COX-2 expression and associated prostaglandin release in synovial pathology by examining the response of p53 and MMP-1 to PGE2 signaling. In principle, the results could also provide a paradigm for the role of COX in cellular transformation to a cancerous phenotype, tumor invasion, and metastasis. The data presented here show that stress kinase (MEKK1)-induced MMP-1 expression in human arthritis-affected synovial cells was mediated, in large part, by c/EBPβ (NF-κBp65) promoter transactivation. Furthermore, PGE2-dependent suppression of MEKK1-induced MMP-1 expression occurred, in large measure, through the transcriptional activation of p53, a process dependent on specific Ser15 phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase. We provide evidence that [phospho-Ser15]p53 may physically interact with c/EBPβ or induce proteins that interact with c/EBPβ to reverse MMP-1 promoter activation. Chemicals—Sodium fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, dithiothreitol, sodium orthovanadate, ethidium bromide, and bovine serum albumin were products of Sigma-Aldrich Canada. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and SB202190 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). SDS, acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, agarose, ammonium persulfate, and Bio-Rad protein reagent originated from Bio-Rad. Tris-base, EDTA, MgCl2, CaCl2, chloroform, dimethylsulfoxide, anhydrous ethanol (95%), methanol (99%), formaldehyde, and formamide were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), phosphate-free, and phenol-red-free DMEM, TRIzol reagent, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and an antibiotic mixture (10,000 units of penicillin (base), 10,000 μg of streptomycin (base)) were products of Invitrogen. Specimens and Cell Culture—Human synovial fibroblasts (HSF) were released from non-diseased and RA/OA articular synovia by sequential enzymatic digestion as described previously (20.Faour W.H. He Y.

Arthritis patients undergoing arthroplasty were diagnosed based on the criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology Diagnostic Subcommittee for OA/RA (mean age 67 ± 19: F/M 5:1). Cells thus released were transferred to culture dishes for propagation in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics and were routinely used from the 2nd to the 7th passage so that our cell population was confined largely to type B synovial fibroblasts. Our HSF cell strains were screened for optimal transfection efficiency (40–70%) and three of them SN (synovia normal) 3, SN5, and SN7, isolated from fetal donors at necropsy, were used routinely for stable and transient transfections as previously described (20.Faour W.H.

Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—50 –100 μg of nuclear protein extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 450 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF) or in hot SDS-PAGE loading buffer (total cellular protein), were subjected to SDS-PAGE through 8 –12% gels (16 × 20 cm, final concentration of acrylamide) under reducing conditions, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Western blotting procedures were performed as previously described (20.Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31720-37731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and membranes were prepared for autoradiography (ECL chemiluminescence reagent, Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) for semiquantitative measurements as previously described (20.Faour W.H.

The following polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Waverly MA): Total (independent of phosphorylation state) p53; anti-phospho-p53 (Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser37, Ser46, Ser392); total and anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182); total MKK3 and MKK1. Anti-human GADD45 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Northern Blot Analysis of mRNA—Total cellular RNA was isolated (1 × 106 cells = 10 –20 μg of RNA) using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent, and 5 μg of total RNA were resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred electrophoretically (30 V overnight at 4 °C) to Hybond-N™ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5× Tris/acetate/EDTA (TAE) buffer, pH 7 (20.Faour W.H.

After prehybridization for 24 h, hybridizations were carried out at 50 °C for 24 –36 h, followed by high stringency washing at 68 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The following probes, labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP by random priming, were used for hybridization; human interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) cDNA (1.0 kb, EcoRI-BamHI fragment, kindly provided by Dr. D. R. Edwards, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada); 780-bp PstI/XbaI fragment from GAPDH cDNA (1.2 kb; American Type Culture Collection). This latter probe served as a control of RNA loading as GAPDH is constitutively expressed. All blots were subjected to a digital imaging system (Alpha G-Imager 2000; Canberra Packard Canada) for semiquantitative measurements. RT-PCR—2 μg of total RNA, extracted with the TRIzol reagent, were reverse-transcribed and then subjected to PCR with the enzymes and reagents of the GeneAmP RNA PCR kit manufactured by PerkinElmer Cetus (Norwalk, CT) as previously described (20.Faour W.H.

Both the RT and PCR reactions were done in a Gene ATAQ Controller (Amersham Biosciences). We found a linear range (log luciferase/GAPDH versus log cycle number) between 10 and 17; as such we chose 11–13 cycles depending on the type of experiment. The sequences for the luciferase primers were as follows: 5′-ACGGATTACCAGGGATTTCAGTC-3′, and 5′-AGGCTCCTCAGAAACAGCTCTTC-3′ (antisense) for the luciferase fragment of 367 bp (20.Faour W.H. He Y.

Plasmid Constructs, Transfections, and Reporter Assays—The wtpCMV-p53 expression vector and dominant-negative mutant (pCMV-p53mt135) were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and differ only by a conversion of G → A at nucleotide 1017 (amino acid Cys → Tyr). The mutant can form heterotetramers with p53wt but does not bind DNA specifically because of conformational changes in the protein. The p53 amino acid substitution mutants, S15E (Ser → Glu) and S15A (Ser → Ala) were constructed from p53wt expression vector using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) as previously described (23.Faour W.H.

The core primer used was as follows (sense): 5′-CTA GCG TCG AGC CCC CTC TG-GAA(E) and GCA(A). The p53RE(GADD45)-LUC reporter construct, pCMV-MEK3 (MKK3/6) and pCMV MEK1 (MKK1) expression plasmids were purchased from Stratagene. The latter expression constructs code for full-length rat and human kinases, respectively. The human MMP-1 promoter-LUC construct (–4372–+63) was a generous gift from Dr. Constance Brinckerhoff (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). Deletion mutants were developed by restriction endonuclease cleavage and/or by PCR. Point mutations in the region of interest (–2008 to –1972 bp) were generated using specific primers and QuikChange technology. Point mutations at the NF-κB and/or c/EBP-like site were established with the following sense primers: 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA AAT CCT GTC CAA TCA CAG ATG-3′; 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA TTT CCT GTC CGG TCA CAG ATG-3′; 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA AAT CCT GTC CGG TCA CAG ATG-3′. Plasmids containing AP-1 (7×), NF-κB (5×), PPRE (5×), GRE (4×), c/EBP (5×), CRE/ATF-2 (4×), Egr-1 (4×), and ISRE (5×) enhancer elements fused to a basic promoter element (TATA box) and a CAT reporter were purchased from Stratagene or constructed by inserting the tandem enhancer element array in the multiple cloning site of the pFR CAT plasmid (Stratagene). The latter signal transduction pathway reporting plasmids were used in cotransfection experiments with the human MMP-1 promoter LUC reporter system as signaling decoys as previously described (26.Faour W.H.

A human c/EBPβ eukaryotic expression vector pSCT-LAP was kindly provided by Dr. Lee Wall (University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Transient transfection experiments were conducted in 6-well cluster plates as previously described (20.Faour W.H. He Y. He Q.W. de Ladurantaye M. Quintero M. Mancini A. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol.

Transfections were conducted using the FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000™ reagents (Invitrogen) method for 5–6 h according to the manufacturer's protocol with cells at 30–40% confluence. Cells were exposed to fresh complete culture medium for 4 –16 h and, where indicated, synchronized for 1–3 h in 1% serum containing culture medium prior to experimentation. Transfection efficiencies were controlled in all experiments by cotransfection with 0.1 μg of pHSV-TK Renilla luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The total amount of DNA/well was kept constant by the addition of carrier DNA. Luciferase values, expressed as enhanced relative light units, were measured in a Lumat LB 9507 dual-channel luminometer (EG&G, Stuttgart, Germany) and normalized to the levels of Renilla luciferase and cellular protein (bicinchoninic acid procedure; Pierce). Extraction of Nuclear Proteins and EMSA Experiments—Confluent control and treated cells in 4-well cluster plates (3–5 × 106 cells/well) were carefully scraped into 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleted by brief centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (23.Faour W.H. Alaaeddine N. Mancini A. He Q.W. Jovanovic D. Di Battista J.A. J. Biol.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing wild-type and mutant sequences from the MMP-1 promoter (–2008 to –1972) were obtained from Invitrogen custom synthesis services, annealed in 100 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA buffer at 65 °C for 10 min, cooled for 1–2 h at room temperature, and finally end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The sense sequences of the oligos tested were as follows: NF-κB/c/EBP-like site MMP-1 promoter (–2008 to –1972): wt, 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA AAT CCT GTC CAA TCA CAG ATG-3′; 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA TTT CCT GTC CGG TCA CAG ATG-3′; 5′-TGA CGT CTT AGG CAA AAT CCT GTC CGG TCA CAG ATG-3′. In addition, consensus oligos were used routinely to assess cellular levels of NF-κB and c/EBP family members under basal and experimental conditions: 5′-AGC TTG GGG TAT TTC C (GCCGTATAACCmut) AG CCG-3′ and 5′-CTA GGG CTT GGC CAA T (TACCCmut)CT ATA TTC G-3′. Binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 2.5 μg of poly (dI-dC). Binding reactions were conducted with 15 μg of nuclear extract and 100,000 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 22 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 10 μl. For supershift analysis, 2 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-p52, C-Rel, p50, p65, and anti-c/EBPα, β, δ, and, γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were incubated for 10 min with the nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the radioactive probe. Binding complexes were resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through 6% gels in a Tris borate buffer system, after which the gels were fixed, dried, and prepared for autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—All results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of 2–5 experiments as indicated. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical treatment of the data were performed by parametric (Student's t test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) analysis if Gaussian distribution of the data could not be confirmed. Significance was acknowledged when the probability that the null hypothesis was satisfied at <5%. Prostaglandin E2 Induces p53 Transactivation Through p38-mediated Phosphorylation of Serine 15—Preliminary studies showed that PGE2 treatment of SN7-HSF transiently transfected with a p53RE (GADD45)-LUC reporter construct resulted in increased Luciferase activity that was judged to be p53-mediated because cotransfection of a dominant negative mutant of p53 abrogated this response (see below and Fig. 2A). Pursuing this line of investigation further, we observed that the eicosanoid induced a time-dependent increase in p53 Ser15 phosphorylation, with no change in overall p53 protein synthesis (Fig. 1A, top and middle panels). Endogenous levels of p53 were modest but stable under our culture conditions. The PGE2-dependent Ser15 phosphorylation was apparently mediated by p38 MAP kinase as SB202190, a selective inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase activity, blocked the response (Fig. 1A, top panel). The time course of p38 MAP kinase Thr180/Tyr182 phosphorylation in PGE2-treated HSF was coincident with p53 Ser15 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, top and middle panels). Furthermore, overexpression of"
