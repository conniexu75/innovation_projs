However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology."
https://openalex.org/W2419175238,"The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the non-trivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding the ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high accuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of prototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus offering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem."
https://openalex.org/W2586590237,"Resistance on a background of tolerance Bacteria survive antibiotic exposure either because they are quiescent when antibiotics are around in the highest concentrations (i.e., tolerance) or because they acquire active biochemical resistance mechanisms (i.e., resistance). Both tolerance and resistance involve the acquisition of mutations from the wild type. Levin-Reisman et al. used in vitro evolution experiments to show that populations of bacteria that become genetically resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin most quickly do so on a background of tolerance mutations (see the Perspective by Lewis and Shan). Because the probability of a tolerant organism surviving is higher, it has a greater chance of subsequently acquiring resistance mutations. Tolerance is often overlooked in the clinic but should in future be screened for and targeted more precisely to reduce the rates of acquired resistance. Science , this issue p. 826 ; see also p. 796"
https://openalex.org/W2589849966,"Measurement error adds noise to predictions, increases uncertainty in parameter estimates, and makes it more difficult to discover new phenomena or to distinguish among competing theories. A common view is that any study finding an effect under noisy conditions provides evidence that the underlying effect is particularly strong and robust. Yet, statistical significance conveys very little information when measurements are noisy. In noisy research settings, poor measurement can contribute to exaggerated estimates of effect size. This problem and related misunderstandings are key components in a feedback loop that perpetuates the replication crisis in science."

Mutations in Na v channels cause neurological and cardiovascular disorders, making the channels important therapeutic targets. Shen et al. determined a high-resolution structure of a Na v channel from the American cockroach by electron microscopy. The structure affords insight into voltage sensing and ion permeability and provides a foundation for understanding function and disease mechanism of Na v and the related Ca v ion channels.

https://openalex.org/W2593943479,"Cysteine can be specifically functionalized by a myriad of acid-base conjugation strategies for applications ranging from probing protein function to antibody-drug conjugates and proteomics. In contrast, selective ligation to the other sulfur-containing amino acid, methionine, has been precluded by its intrinsically weaker nucleophilicity. Here, we report a strategy for chemoselective methionine bioconjugation through redox reactivity, using oxaziridine-based reagents to achieve highly selective, rapid, and robust methionine labeling under a range of biocompatible reaction conditions. We highlight the broad utility of this conjugation method to enable precise addition of payloads to proteins, synthesis of antibody-drug conjugates, and identification of hyperreactive methionine residues in whole proteomes."

We demonstrate that double heterojunctions designed into colloidal semiconductor nanorods allow both efficient photocurrent generation through a photovoltaic response and electroluminescence within a single device. These dual-functioning, all-solution-processed double-heterojunction nanorod light-responsive light-emitting diodes open feasible routes to a variety of advanced applications, from touchless interactive screens to energy harvesting and scavenging displays and massively parallel display-to-display data communication."
https://openalex.org/W2587087311,"There is increasing interest in the role of physical exercise as a therapeutic strategy for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed the effect of 26 weeks (6 months) of a supervised aerobic exercise program on memory, executive function, functional ability and depression in early AD.This study was a 26-week randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise vs. non-aerobic stretching and toning control intervention in individuals with early AD. A total of 76 well-characterized older adults with probable AD (mean age 72.9 [7.7]) were enrolled and 68 participants completed the study. Exercise was conducted with supervision and monitoring by trained exercise specialists. Neuropsychological tests and surveys were conducted at baseline,13, and 26 weeks to assess memory and executive function composite scores, functional ability (Disability Assessment for Dementia), and depressive symptoms (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia). Cardiorespiratory fitness testing and brain MRI was performed at baseline and 26 weeks. Aerobic exercise was associated with a modest gain in functional ability (Disability Assessment for Dementia) compared to individuals in the ST group (X2 = 8.2, p = 0.02). There was no clear effect of intervention on other primary outcome measures of Memory, Executive Function, or depressive symptoms. However, secondary analyses revealed that change in cardiorespiratory fitness was positively correlated with change in memory performance and bilateral hippocampal volume.Aerobic exercise in early AD is associated with benefits in functional ability. Exercise-related gains in cardiorespiratory fitness were associated with improved memory performance and reduced hippocampal atrophy, suggesting cardiorespiratory fitness gains may be important in driving brain benefits.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01128361."
https://openalex.org/W3125357912,"Many-body entanglement is often created through system evolution, aided by non-linear interactions between the constituting particles. The very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock condensate of $\sim11000$ atoms by driving a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing spin mixing through two consecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of $10.7\pm0.6$ dB and normalized collective spin length of $0.99\pm0.01$. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of $\sim6$ dB beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of $\sim910$ atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs."
https://openalex.org/W2592178905,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA targets in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-target interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in space and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the stimulation of miRNA maturation. Single-synapse stimulation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a target mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression."
https://openalex.org/W2594441346,"A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and magnetized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular magnetic field and nebula are poorly constrained. We present paleomagnetic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation."
https://openalex.org/W2592706484,"The maintenance of duplicated genes is thought to protect cells from genetic perturbations, but the molecular basis of this robustness is largely unknown. By measuring the interaction of yeast proteins with their partners in wild-type cells and in cells lacking a paralog, we found that 22 out of 56 paralog pairs compensate for the lost interactions. An equivalent number of pairs exhibit the opposite behavior and require each other's presence for maintaining their interactions. These dependent paralogs generally interact physically, regulate each other's abundance, and derive from ancestral self-interacting proteins. This reveals that gene duplication may actually increase mutational fragility instead of robustness in a large number of cases."
https://openalex.org/W2594104586,"Autophagy is important in a variety of cellular and pathophysiological situations; however, its role in immune responses remains elusive. Here, we show that among B cells, germinal center (GC) cells exhibited the highest rate of autophagy during viral infection. In contrast to mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1–dependent canonical autophagy, GC B cell autophagy occurred predominantly through a noncanonical pathway. B cell stimulation was sufficient to down-regulate canonical autophagy transiently while triggering noncanonical autophagy. Genetic ablation of WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide–interacting protein 2 in B cells alone enhanced this noncanonical autophagy, resulting in changes of mitochondrial homeostasis and alterations in GC and antibody-secreting cells. Thus, B cell activation prompts a temporal switch from canonical to noncanonical autophagy that is important in controlling B cell differentiation and fate."
https://openalex.org/W2586647872,"Siren molecule calls loudly to mosquitoes People infected by malaria become more attractive to the mosquito vectors of the disease, which facilitates the spread of malaria. Emami et al. found that red blood cells of the host respond to a parasite-derived isoprenoid called HMBPP by increasing the production of carbon dioxide and several monoterpenes and aldehydes. Mosquitoes fed HMBPP-spiked blood displayed malaria parasite–specific changes in gene transcription, which reinforced attractiveness for the mosquito. HMBPP also stimulates mosquito feeding and malaria parasite reproduction. Thus, the parasite manipulates its mammalian host to make it more attractive to the insect vectors and exploits the same molecule to amplify transmission. Science , this issue p. 1076"
https://openalex.org/W2594807712,"Evolutionary theory has long proposed a connection between trait evolution and diversification rates. In this work, we used phylogenetic methods to evaluate the relationship of lineage-specific speciation rates and the mode of evolution of body size and tooth morphology in the Neogene and Quaternary radiation of horses (7 living and 131 extinct species). We show that diversification pulses are a recurrent feature of equid evolution but that these pulses are not correlated with rapid bursts in phenotypic evolution. Instead, rapid cladogenesis seems repeatedly associated with extrinsic factors that relaxed diversity bounds, such as increasing productivity and geographic dispersals into the Old World. This evidence suggests that diversity dynamics in Equinae were controlled mainly by ecological limits under diversity dependence rather than rapid ecomorphological differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2586289557,"The WHO Consensus Document on the epidemiology of the SARS epidemic in 2003, included a report on a concentrated outbreak in one Hong Kong housing block which was considered a 'super-spreading event'. The WHO report conjectured that the sanitary plumbing system was one transmission route for the virus. Empty U-traps allowed the aerosolised virus to enter households from the sewerage system. No biological evidence was presented. This research reports evidence that pathogens can be aerosolised and transported on airstreams within sanitary plumbing systems and enter buildings via empty U-traps. A sanitary plumbing system was built, representing two floors of a building, with simulated toilet flushes on the lower floor and a sterile chamber with extractor fan on the floor above. Cultures of a model organism, Pseudomonas putida at 106-109 cfu ml-1 in 0·85% NaCl were flushed into the system in volumes of 6 to 20 litres to represent single or multiple toilet flushes. Air and surface samples were cultured on agar plates and assessed qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. Flushing from a toilet into a sanitary plumbing system generated enough turbulence to aerosolise pathogens. Typical sanitary plumbing system airflows (between 20-30 ls-1) were sufficient to carry aerosolised pathogens between different floors of a building. Empty U-traps allowed aerosolised pathogens to enter the chamber, encouraging cross-transmission. All parts of the system were found to be contaminated post-flush. Empty U-traps have been observed in many buildings and a risk assessment indicates the potential for high risk cross-transmission under defect conditions in buildings with high pathogen loading such as hospitals. Under defective conditions (which are not uncommon) aerosolised pathogens can be carried on the airflows within sanitary plumbing systems. Our findings show that greater consideration should be given to this mode of pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2588679125,"The Deccan Traps in west-central India constitute one of Earth’s largest continental flood basalt provinces, whose eruption played a role in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. The unknown mantle structure under the Indian Ocean at the start of the Cenozoic presents a challenge for connecting the event to a deep mantle origin. We used a back-and-forth iterative method for time-reversed convection modeling, which incorporates tomography-based, present-day mantle heterogeneity to reconstruct mantle structure at the start of the Cenozoic. We show a very low-density, deep-seated upwelling that ascends beneath the Réunion hot spot at the time of the Deccan eruptions. We found a second active upwelling below the Comores hot spot that likely contributed to the region of partial melt feeding the massive eruption."
https://openalex.org/W2586625512,"The aim of this study was to integrate a gaze training intervention (i.e., quiet eye training; QET) that has been shown to improve the throwing and catching skill of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), within an approach (i.e., group therapy) that might alleviate the negative psychosocial impact of these motor skill deficits. Twenty-one children with DCD were split into either QET (8 male 3 female, mean age of 8.6 years (SD = 1.04) or technical training (TT) groups (7 male 3 female, mean age of 8.6 years (SD = 1.84). The TT group were given movement-related instructions via video, relating to the throw and catch phases, while the QET group were also taught to fixate a target location on the wall prior to the throw (QE1) and to track the ball prior to the catch (QE2). Each group partook in a 4-week, group therapy intervention and measurements of QE duration and catching performance were taken before and after training, and at a 6-week delayed retention test. Parental feedback on psychosocial and motor skill outcomes was provided at delayed retention. Children improved their gaze control and catching coordination following QET, compared to TT. Mediation analysis showed that a longer QE aiming duration (QE1) predicted an earlier onset of tracking the ball prior to catching (QE2) which predicted catching success. Parents reported enhanced perceptions of their child's catching ability and general coordination in the QET group compared to the TT group. All parents reported improvements in their child's confidence, social skills and predilection for physical activity following the trial. The findings offer initial support for an intervention that practitioners could apply to address deficits in the motor and psychosocial skills of children with DCD.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02904980."
https://openalex.org/W2587005527,"Reactive oxygen species generate potentially cytotoxic and mutagenic lesions in DNA, both between and within the nucleosomes that package DNA in chromatin. The vast majority of these lesions are subject to base excision repair (BER). Enzymes that catalyze the first three steps in BER can act at many sites in nucleosomes without the aid of chromatin-remodeling agents and without irreversibly disrupting the host nucleosome. Here we show that the same is true for a protein complex comprising DNA ligase IIIα and the scaffolding protein X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), which completes the fourth and final step in (short-patch) BER. Using in vitro assembled nucleosomes containing discretely positioned DNA nicks, our evidence indicates that the ligase IIIα-XRCC1 complex binds to DNA nicks in nucleosomes only when they are exposed by periodic, spontaneous partial unwrapping of DNA from the histone octamer; that the scaffolding protein XRCC1 enhances the ligation; that the ligation occurs within a complex that ligase IIIα-XRCC1 forms with the host nucleosome; and that the ligase IIIα-XRCC1-nucleosome complex decays when ligation is complete, allowing the host nucleosome to return to its native configuration. Taken together, our results illustrate ways in which dynamic properties intrinsic to nucleosomes may contribute to the discovery and efficient repair of base damage in chromatin.

https://openalex.org/W2586961524,"Knowing the phylogeographic structure of invasive species is important for understanding the underlying processes of invasion. The micromoth Phyllonorycter issikii, whose larvae damage leaves of lime trees Tilia spp., was only known from East Asia. In the last three decades, it has been recorded in most of Europe, Western Russia and Siberia. We used the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene region to compare the genetic variability of P. issikii populations between these different regions. Additionally, we sequenced two nuclear genes (28S rRNA and Histone 3) and run morphometric analysis of male genitalia to probe for the existence of cryptic species. The analysis of COI data of 377 insect specimens collected in 16 countries across the Palearctic revealed the presence of two different lineages: P. issikii and a putative new cryptic Phyllonorycter species distributed in the Russian Far East and Japan. In P. issikii, we identified 31 haplotypes among which 23 were detected in the invaded area (Europe) and 10 were found in its putative native range in East Asia (Russian Far East, Japan, South Korea and China), with only two common haplotypes. The high number of haplotypes found in the invaded area suggest a possible scenario of multiple introductions. One haplotype H1 was dominant (119 individuals, 67.2%), not only throughout its expanding range in Europe and Siberia but, intriguingly, also in 96% of individuals originating from Japan. We detected eight unique haplotypes of P. issikii in East Asia. Five of them were exclusively found in the Russian Far East representing 95% of individuals from that area. The putative new cryptic Phyllonorycter species showed differences from P. issikii for the three studied genes. However, both species are morphologically undistinguishable. They occur in sympatry on the same host plants in Japan (Sendai) and the Russian Far East (Primorsky krai) without evidence of admixture."
https://openalex.org/W2587693457,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, fibroinflammatory cholangiopathy (disease of the bile ducts) of unknown pathogenesis. We reported that cholangiocyte senescence features prominently in PSC and that neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) is activated in PSC cholangiocytes. Additionally, persistent microbial insult (e.g. LPSs) induces cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A/p16INK4a) expression and senescence in cultured cholangiocytes in an NRAS-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in LPS-induced cholangiocyte senescence and NRAS-dependent regulation of CDKN2A remain unclear. Using our in vitro senescence model, we found that LPS-induced CDKN2A expression coincided with a 4.5-fold increase in ETS1 (ETS proto-oncogene 1) mRNA, suggesting that ETS1 is involved in regulating CDKN2A. This idea was confirmed by RNAi-mediated suppression or genetic deletion of ETS1, which blocked CDKN2A expression and reduced cholangiocyte senescence. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of a predicted ETS-binding site within the CDKN2A promoter abolished luciferase reporter activity. Pharmacological inhibition of RAS/MAPK reduced ETS1 and CDKN2A protein expression and CDKN2A promoter-driven luciferase activity by ∼50%. In contrast, constitutively active NRAS expression induced ETS1 and CDKN2A protein expression, whereas ETS1 RNAi blocked this increase. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR detected increased ETS1 and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) at the CDKN2A promoter following LPS-induced senescence. Additionally, phospho-ETS1 expression was increased in cholangiocytes of human PSC livers and in the Abcb4 (Mdr2)−/− mouse model of PSC. These data pinpoint ETS1 and H3K4Me3 as key transcriptional regulators in NRAS-induced expression of CDKN2A, and this regulatory axis may therefore represent a potential therapeutic target for PSC treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2586558018,"Cyclin F protein, also known as FBXO1, is the largest among all cyclins and oscillates in the cell cycle like other cyclins. Apart from being a G2/M cyclin, cyclin F functions as the substrate-binding subunit of SCFcyclin F E3 ubiquitin ligase. In a gene expression analysis performed to identify novel gene modulations associated with cell cycle dysregulation during HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells, we observed down-regulation of the cyclin F gene (CCNF). Later, using gene overexpression and knockdown studies, we identified cyclin F as negatively influencing HIV-1 viral infectivity without any significant impact on virus production. Subsequently, we found that cyclin F negatively regulates the expression of viral protein Vif (viral infectivity factor) at the protein level. We also identified a novel host-pathogen interaction between cyclin F and Vif protein in T cells during HIV-1 infection. Mutational analysis of a cyclin F-specific amino acid motif in the C-terminal region of Vif indicated rescue of the protein from cyclin F-mediated down-regulation. Subsequently, we showed that Vif is a novel substrate of the SCFcyclin F E3 ligase, where cyclin F mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Vif through physical interaction. Finally, we showed that cyclin F augments APOBEC3G expression through degradation of Vif to regulate infectivity of progeny virions.

HIV-1 has devised numerous mechanisms to evade the host immune system and establish itself successfully within the host. To accomplish this, HIV-1 exploits a multitude of cellular host factors and even mimics some of their functions. The host system in turn employs numerous competitive strategies to inhibit the invasion of virus for its self-protection. A productive infection, hence, is the outcome of continuous conflicts between the host and the virus where the latter is able to outrun the host defense.

Therefore, approaches that disrupt the Vif-APOBEC3G interaction can help to restore APOBEC3G levels, hence reducing virion infectivity.

Of late, there have been reports of the significance of certain cellular factors associated with the cell cycle in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Cyclin T1, as well as its CDK partner CDK9, is among the foremost cyclin-CDK complexes involved in HIV-1 transcription regulation, as they form a part of the PTEF-B complex and act as a cofactor for HIV-1 Tat-induced transcription elongation of the viral genome (19.Imai K.

On the contrary, cyclin K acts as a competitor of the cyclin T1-CDK9 complex, as it binds to CDK9 and restricts its nuclear translocation in a Nef-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 gene expression and replication (21.Khan S.Z.

Cyclin F is also the pioneering member of the F-box family of proteins owing to the identification of the F-box domain in it. F-box proteins are the substrate-binding subunits of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box) E3 ligases (30.Bai C. Richman R. Elledge S.J. Human cyclin F.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6087-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

Cyclin F has also been shown to suppress B-Myb activity to ensure G2 checkpoint control in response to IR-induced DNA damage (33.Klein D.K. Hoffmann S. Ahlskog J.K. O'Hanlon K. Quaas M. Larsen B.D.

Commun. 2015; 6: 5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These cellular regulatory functions mediated by cyclin F have enabled researchers to consider cyclin F as a potential molecular target in cancer therapeutics. However, there has been no evidence thus far for any role of cyclin F in the context of HIV-1 infection. In the present work, we performed HIV-1-induced cell cycle-associated gene expression analysis in infected primary CD4+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of seronegative donors. Cyclin F was identified from the gene expression analysis as a significantly down-regulated gene during infection. Further investigation of the role of cyclin F in infection revealed its negative regulatory influence on HIV-1 viral infectivity. Subsequent analysis elucidated a novel physical interaction between cyclin F and viral protein Vif by which cyclin F regulates Vif expression in a proteasome-dependent manner, correlating with a direct implication of HIV-1 progeny virion infectivity. HIV-1 infection induces cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, as it is essential for optimal expression of the viral genome. The HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter is reported to be most active in this phase (34.Goh W.C. Rogel M.E. Kinsey C.M. Michael S.F. Fultz P.N. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. Emerman M.

Apart from induction of G2/M arrest in cells, some cell cycle-associated genes have also been identified as playing a crucial role in HIV-1 pathogenesis (19.Imai K. Asamitsu K. Victoriano A.F.

Cyclin L2 is a critical HIV dependency factor in macrophages that controls SAMHD1 abundance.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17: 98-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to specifically analyze cell cycle-associated gene modulations during HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells to identify novel host-pathogen interactions in this context. To carry out this objective, we performed gene expression profiling using a real time-based cell cycle PCR array containing primers of 84 cell cycle pathway-associated genes. CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs obtained from seronegative donors. These cells were activated using PHA/IL-2 and were infected using HIV-1 NL4-3 (0.5 m.o.i.) virus. Infection progression was monitored using a p24 antigen capture ELISA. We observed that the infection peaked at 48 h post-infection (hpi) (Fig. 1A). Cell cycle progression monitored using propidium iodide staining along the same time points showed significant G2/M arrest at 48 hpi (Fig. 1B). On the basis of the above time kinetics, cDNA from cells harvested 48 hpi was used to perform gene expression analysis. Uninfected cDNA from the same time point served as control. From the results obtained, a comparison of gene expression analysis identified several genes as modulated during HIV-1 infection. Genes that showed more than 2-fold modulation are listed in supplemental Table 1. The modulated genes are also listed on the basis of the cell cycle phases in which they are prominently present (Table 1). We further validated the expression of some of the most prominently modulated genes from different cell cycle phases in CD4+ T cells from two seronegative donors post-infection (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Selected genes in the PCR array modulated during HIV-1 infection and classified on the basis of cell cycle phasesCell cycle phaseGenes showing >2-fold modulationG1 and G1-S phaseANAPC2, CCNE1, CDC34, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1B, CDKN3, CUL3, SKP2G2 phase and G2/M transitionANAPC2, BCCIP, CCNB1, CCNT1, CDKN3, CKS2, DNM2, GTSE1, HERC5, KPNA2M phaseCCNB2, CCNF, CDC16, CDC20S phase and DNA replicationMCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5Cell cycle check point and cell cycle arrestATM, BRCA1, CCNG2, CDC34, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDKN3, CUL3, GADD45A, HUS1, KNTC1, MAD2L1, RAD1, TP53Regulation of cell cycleANAPC2, ATM, BCCIP, CCNB1, CCNB2, CCNE1, CCNF, CCNT1, CDC16, CDC20, CDK4, CDK6, CDKN1A, CDKN1B, GADD45A, KNTC1, MK167, SKP2, TFDP1Negative regulation of cell cycleATM, BRCA1, CDKN2B, RBL1, TP53 Open table in a new tab The cyclin F gene (CCNF) displayed the highest down-regulation at the mRNA level among the genes that showed significant modulation. Further expression analysis of cyclin F at mRNA (Fig. 2A) and protein (Fig. 2B) levels in infected CD4+ T cells confirmed its significant down-regulation with infection. We also observed cyclin F down-regulation in infected Jurkat cells (human CD4+ T cell line) at both the mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D). Similar down-regulation was also obtained in another CD4+ T cell line, CEM-GFP, the results for which are shown in Fig. 4A. These observations led us to further characterize the potential implication of cyclin F down-regulation in HIV-1 infection.FIGURE 4Cyclin F impairs the cellular expression of HIV-1 Vif.

HEK293T cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of cyclin F along with Nef followed by immunoblotting of the lysates. E, siRNA-mediated knockdown of cyclin F increases Vif expression.

Data represent mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The down-regulation of cyclin F expression in HIV-1 infection led us to speculate that cyclin F could have a possible role in viral pathogenesis. As cyclin F undergoes down-regulation during infection, to understand its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, we overexpressed cyclin F in CEM-GFP T cells. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were infected with 0.5 m.o.i. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus. Cells were harvested 48 hpi, and immunoblotting for p24 gag protein showed no significant difference in the relative cellular expression levels of p24 (Fig. 3A, top). The cell culture supernatants collected and used to compare virus production using p24 antigen capture ELISA also did not show significant differences in the production of virions with cyclin F overexpression (Fig. 3A, middle). Further, the viral supernatants were normalized and were used to compare viral infectivity using a TZM-bl indicator assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Here, surprisingly, we observed a significant decrease in progeny virion infectivity of viral supernatants from cyclin F-overexpressed conditions (Fig. 3A, bottom). To confirm this observation, endogenous cyclin F was silenced using siRNA pool (GE Healthcare Dharmacon) against cyclin F in CEM-GFP cells. Non-targeting control siRNA pool served as the control. After 24 h of transfection, cells were infected with 0.5 m.o.i. NL4-3 virus. Cells were harvested 48 hpi, and gene silencing was confirmed by immunoblotting using cyclin F antibody. Further we analyzed the expression of p24 using immunoblotting, and the culture supernatants collected were used to detect virus production as well as perform viral infectivity assays after normalization. In agreement with the overexpression results, we did not observe any significant variations in cellular p24 expression (Fig. 3B, top) and production of HIV-1 virions (Fig. 3B, middle). On comparison of viral infectivity of supernatants from control and cyclin F-silenced cells, we observed a significant enhancement in viral infectivity of virions produced by silencing cyclin F (Fig. 3B, bottom). The above results therefore point to an important functional implication of cyclin F in regulating the infectivity of virions produced during HIV-1 infection. As HIV-1 Vif is known to be intimately associated with viral infectivity, we speculated that cyclin F would have a possible effect on Vif expression. The expression profile of cyclin F and Vif at the protein level was simultaneously analyzed in HIV-infected CEM-GFP cells. Cyclin F, as expected, showed a progressive down-regulation, whereas Vif, a late expressing viral protein, increased and stabilized its expression with the progression of infection (Fig. 4A). To further analyze this finding, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with increasing concentrations of pCMV-FLAG-cyclin F along with pNL4-3. Protein expression analysis showed a significant and dose-dependent reduction in Vif expression with cyclin F overexpression (Fig. 4B). To confirm the inverse correlation of cyclin F and Vif expression, we co-transfected Vif expression construct along with increasing doses of cyclin F in HEK293T cells. Here again, we observed a gradual loss of Vif expression with increasing amounts of cyclin F, indicating that cyclin F-mediated Vif down-regulation is direct and is independent of the presence of other viral proteins (Fig. 4C). To confirm the specificity of cyclin F in Vif regulation, HEK293T cells were then co-transfected with increasing doses of cyclin F along with HIV-1 Nef, another viral protein known to be important for viral infectivity (12.Usami Y.

The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic variation in the expression patterns of selected genes involved in several major metabolic pathways regulating heat tolerance for two genotypes contrasting in heat tolerance to confirm their status as potential candidate genes, and to identify PCR-based markers associated with candidate genes related to heat tolerance in a colonial (Agrostis capillaris L.) x creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) hybrid backcross population. Plants were subjected to heat stress in controlled-environmental growth chambers for phenotypic evaluation and determination of genetic variation in candidate gene expression. Molecular markers were developed for genes involved in protein degradation (cysteine protease), antioxidant defense (catalase and glutathione-S-transferase), energy metabolism (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), cell expansion (expansin), and stress protection (heat shock proteins HSP26, HSP70, and HSP101). Kruskal-Wallis analysis, a commonly used non-parametric test used to compare population individuals with or without the gene marker, found the physiological traits of chlorophyll content, electrolyte leakage, normalized difference vegetative index, and turf quality were associated with all candidate gene markers with the exception of HSP101. Differential gene expression was frequently found for the tested candidate genes. The development of candidate gene markers for important heat tolerance genes may allow for the development of new cultivars with increased abiotic stress tolerance using marker-assisted selection."

https://openalex.org/W2586510774,"The genus Theobroma comprises several trees species native to the Amazon. Theobroma cacao L. plays a key economic role mainly in the chocolate industry. Both cultivated and wild forms are described within the genus. Variations in genome size and chromosome number have been used for prediction purposes including the frequency of interspecific hybridization or inference about evolutionary relationships. In this study, the nuclear DNA content, karyotype and genetic diversity using functional microsatellites (EST-SSR) of seven Theobroma species were characterized. The nuclear content of DNA for all analyzed Theobroma species was 1C = ~ 0.46 pg. These species presented 2n = 20 with small chromosomes and only one pair of terminal heterochromatic bands positively stained (CMA+/DAPI− bands). The small size of Theobroma ssp. genomes was equivalent to other Byttnerioideae species, suggesting that the basal lineage of Malvaceae have smaller genomes and that there was an expansion of 2C values in the more specialized family clades. A set of 20 EST-SSR primers were characterized for related species of Theobroma, in which 12 loci were polymorphic. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.23 to 0.65, indicating a high level of information per locus. Combined results of flow cytometry, cytogenetic data and EST-SSRs markers will contribute to better describe the species and infer about the evolutionary relationships among Theobroma species. In addition, the importance of a core collection for conservation purposes is highlighted."
https://openalex.org/W2587083743,"Abstract The retrovirus integrase (IN) inserts the viral cDNA into the host DNA genome. Atomic structures of five different retrovirus INs complexed with their respective viral DNA or branched viral/target DNA substrates have indicated these intasomes are composed of IN subunits ranging from tetramers, to octamers, or to hexadecamers. IN precursors are monomers, dimers, or tetramers in solution. But how intasome assembly is controlled remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to unravel the functional mechanisms in different intasomes. We produced kinetically stabilized Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) intasomes with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strand transfer inhibitors that interact simultaneously with IN and viral DNA within intasomes. We examined the ability of RSV IN dimers to assemble two viral DNA molecules into intasomes containing IN tetramers in contrast to one possessing IN octamers. We observed that the last 18 residues of the C terminus (“tail” region) of IN (residues 1–286) determined whether an IN tetramer or octamer assembled with viral DNA. A series of truncations of the tail region indicated that these 18 residues are critical for the assembly of an intasome containing IN octamers but not for an intasome containing IN tetramers. The C-terminally truncated IN (residues 1–269) produced an intasome that contained tetramers but failed to produce an intasome with octamers. Both intasomes have similar catalytic activities. The results suggest a high degree of plasticity for functional multimerization and reveal a critical role of the C-terminal tail region of IN in higher order oligomerization of intasomes, potentially informing future strategies to prevent retroviral integration."
https://openalex.org/W2586101071,"Preparing for and responding to outbreaks of serious livestock infectious diseases are critical measures to safeguard animal health, public health, and food supply. Almost all of the current control strategies are empirical, and mass culling or ""stamping out"" is frequently the principal strategy for controlling epidemics. However, there are ethical, ecological, and economic reasons to consider less drastic control strategies. Here we use modeling to quantitatively study the efficacy of different control measures for viral outbreaks, where the infectiousness, transmissibility and death rate of animals commonly depends on their viral load. We develop a broad theoretical framework for exploring and understanding this heterogeneity. The model includes both direct transmission from infectious animals and indirect transmission from an environmental reservoir. We then incorporate a large variety of control measures, including vaccination, antivirals, isolation, environmental disinfection, and several forms of culling, which may result in fewer culled animals. We provide explicit formulae for the basic reproduction number, R0, for each intervention and for combinations. We evaluate the control methods for a realistic simulated outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza on a mid-sized turkey farm. In this simulated outbreak, culling results in more total dead birds and dramatically more when culling all of the infected birds."

Eventually, 184 AKI patients were included in the study, including 79 elderly AKI patients (≥60 years old). During one year of follow-up, renal function changes were observed, and the risk factors that influenced the prognosis of AKI were analyzed.When AKI occurred, the urine kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) level was significantly higher in the progressive deterioration of renal function group than in the renal function stable group. The ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve for poor progressive deterioration of renal function as predicted by the uKIM-1 level was 0.681. At a cutoff point of 2.46 ng/mg, the sensitivity was 71.9% and the specificity was 70.0%. In elderly AKI patients, uKIM-1 levels exceeding 2.46 ng/mg were positively associated with poor kidney prognosis.Elderly AKI patients are at risk of developing progressive deterioration of renal function. In elderly AKI patients, the high uKIM-1 level may predict the prognosis of kidney function and may be used as an early screening indicator of poor kidney prognosis."

Circular and pedagogical reform is often occurring in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) departments. How can institutions measure whether these curriculum changes are successful? The Survey of Teaching Beliefs and Practices for Undergraduates (STEP-U) developed by Marbach-Ad et al. measures the value that students attribute to skills needed for the workplace (e.g., the ability to work in groups) and teaching practices intended to promote these skills (e.g., group assignments). Specifically, STEP-U is able to simultaneously assess student experiences and teaching practices, ultimately allowing departments to design curricula that better prepare students for the STEM workforce. STEP-U's potential for driving both departmental and institutional change is high, because it can be used to illustrate student experiences between cohorts, within subdisciplines, or between majors.

Widespread adoption of findings by public health agencies and funders. That9s the recipe for one major evidence-based public health breakthrough: oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which has helped cut childhood deaths from diarrhea and dehydration in half and saved millions of lives. ORT is credited with helping cut the number of deaths of children under age 5 from some 1.2 million per year to 600,000. In many developing nations, nearly every child suffering from diarrhea receives ORT, in either a prepackaged or homemade form. But in about 15 poor nations, the therapy is still vastly underutilized, studies suggest."

It can weakly mimic the human hormone estrogen, and leach out of products—including plastic drinking bottles and medical supplies—in small quantities. As a result, some companies and governments have moved to remove BPA from certain products, even though there is still fierce debate among regulators over BPA9s safety. Some researchers say that debate is being ill-served by rules developed in the 1960s and 970s, in response to a chemical testing scandal, that are designed to make sure regulators consider only the strongest evidence. But the critics argue the rules now prevent regulators from considering high-quality, cutting-edge academic studies that don9t follow the rules. A U.S. government–funded initiative is now trying to bridge the divide."
https://openalex.org/W2591852138,"Bill de Blasio ran for mayor of New York City in 2013 on the promise of providing free preschool to every 4-year-old in the city. After he won, his administration went looking for a high-quality prekindergarten math curriculum, one vetted by researchers, that has improved the math skills of young children in other cities. In short, the mayor wanted something that worked. In the end, school officials settled on Building Blocks, a program developed by mathematics education professors Douglas Clements and Julie Sarama, which had boosted student achievement in several other cities. But Building Blocks has a dismaying feature that is common to other preschool interventions: Children using it chalk up glowing initial results, only to see the gains fade over the next few years. The fade-out phenomenon has raised questions about how researchers and policymakers should evaluate interventions like Building Blocks, and whether they are asking the right questions."

Among his top priorities should be to nominate a science adviser and to staff the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the single agency in the government responsible for the health of the entire federal science and technology (S&T) portfolio. OSTP is the sole voice in the White House focused on using and supporting scientific research, advancing the nation's technological capability, and advising the president on all policy issues as they relate to S&T. Here, we describe the vital role of OSTP and its policy councils and offer recommendations on selecting the president's science adviser and OSTP leadership. A strong OSTP will be critical for maintaining U.S. leadership in S&T and innovation ( 1 )."

Fluorine plays a supporting role in some of the best-known hypervalent compounds, such as PF5 and SF6. Goesten et al. now suggest that the halogen can also play the lead part in constrained environs. Certain zeolites bind fluoride at the center of a box motif with silicons at each of eight vertices. Using density functional theory, the authors report that all eight engage in stabilizing Si-F orbital interactions. Whereas hypervalency is more often associated with third- and fourth-row elements, in this motif, sterics preclude analogous bonding to the heavier halides.

The morbidity and economic tolls of influenza virus are huge, regardless of its capacity to kill. Vaccines and therapies to control this persistent threat are limited. In structural studies, Kadam and Wilson show how the broad-spectrum antiviral arbidol inactivates viral hemagglutinin (HA). HA is a surface glycoprotein that recognizes the host and mediates virus fusion and disgorgement of nucleic acids into the cell. Arbidol binds in hydrophobic cavities in the upper region of the HA stem, creating a network of interactions that makes the molecule rigid and prevents cell fusion. Resolving the molecular details of the arbidol-HA interactions is essential for the optimization and global deployment of this potential new influenza drug.

The World Health Organization, for instance, has estimated that nations could prevent some 3 million premature deaths annually by 2050 if they could simply prevent outdoor soot and ozone levels from rising above 2010 levels. But although there is technical agreement that cleaner air is healthier air, there9s fierce conflict over how to calculate the economic costs and benefits of cutting pollution and how much society should pay to make it happen.

Agricultural production and crop diversity are highly sensitive to climate and local weather variables. To assess the sensitivity of child growth and weight gain to precipitation, Shiveley combined data for Uganda and Nepal collected over 30 years from several sources and controlled for multiple covariates. Positive anthropometric outcomes correlate with rainfall before birth, but, in some settings, high and unexpected rainfall can be harmful by damaging harvests or facilitating disease. The impact of increasingly variable weather on faltering agricultural productivity can be buffered by even modest improvements to roads and bridges, thus providing easier access to markets and health facilities.

Over the past few decades, the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease has declined substantially in developed countries. Statins, drugs that lower serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), have been instrumental in this trend. Not everyone responds to statins, however, and new types of cholesterol-lowering drugs are attracting great interest. Fitzgerald et al. tested inclisiran, a drug based on small interfering RNA technology, in a small phase 1 trial. Inclisiran induces degradation of the mRNA encoding PCSK9, a liver-derived protease whose activity increases serum LDL-C levels. Subcutaneous injection of inclisiran durably reduced PCSK9 levels by as much as 83% and LDL-C levels by as much as 59% without serious toxicities.
