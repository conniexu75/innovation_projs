https://openalex.org/W1978838242,"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in several physiological responses such as stomatal conductance and seed dormancy and also in protecting plants against stress conditions such as drought and cold. Recently a family of proteins known as PYR/PYL/RCAR were identified as ABA receptors, but details of the signalling pathway downstream of ABA binding remained unclear. In this paper, Zhu and colleagues reconstitute the ABA-mediated signalling in vitro and test key observations in vivo. This is the first reported reconstitution of a plant hormone signalling pathway. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a regulator of plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. Although several proteins have been reported to function as ABA receptors and many more are known to be involved in ABA signalling, the identities of ABA receptors remain controversial and the mechanism of signalling unclear. ABA-mediated signalling is now reconstituted in vitro, defining a minimal set of core components of the pathway. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates the expression of many genes in plants; it has critical functions in stress resistance and in growth and development1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Several proteins have been reported to function as ABA receptors8,9,10,11,12,13, and many more are known to be involved in ABA signalling3,4,14. However, the identities of ABA receptors remain controversial and the mechanism of signalling from perception to downstream gene expression is unclear15,16. Here we show that by combining the recently identified ABA receptor PYR1 with the type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) ABI1, the serine/threonine protein kinase SnRK2.6/OST1 and the transcription factor ABF2/AREB1, we can reconstitute ABA-triggered phosphorylation of the transcription factor in vitro. Introduction of these four components into plant protoplasts results in ABA-responsive gene expression. Protoplast and test-tube reconstitution assays were used to test the function of various members of the receptor, protein phosphatase and kinase families. Our results suggest that the default state of the SnRK2 kinases is an autophosphorylated, active state and that the SnRK2 kinases are kept inactive by the PP2Cs through physical interaction and dephosphorylation. We found that in the presence of ABA, the PYR/PYL (pyrabactin resistance 1/PYR1-like) receptor proteins can disrupt the interaction between the SnRK2s and PP2Cs, thus preventing the PP2C-mediated dephosphorylation of the SnRK2s and resulting in the activation of the SnRK2 kinases. Our results reveal new insights into ABA signalling mechanisms and define a minimal set of core components of a complete major ABA signalling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1984667039,"The ocean is a major carbon sink, absorbing perhaps a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but there are considerable uncertainties as to the distribution and rate of CO2 capture. Khatiwala et al. present an observationally based reconstruction of anthropogenic carbon uptake in the ocean during the industrial era. They map the regions where it is most concentrated, and track the accumulations over time. The findings indicate that uptake of anthropogenic CO2 in the oceans has increased sharply since the 1950s, with a small decline in the rate of increase in recent decades. The Southern Ocean is the biggest sink, with over 40% of total uptake. The results also suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO2 until the 1940s, subsequently becoming a sink. The ocean takes up 20 to 35 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but uncertainties remain as to the distribution of this CO2 in the ocean, its rate of uptake over the industrial era, and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. An observationally based reconstruction of the spatially resolved, time-dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era now allows these questions to be addressed. The release of fossil fuel CO2 to the atmosphere by human activity has been implicated as the predominant cause of recent global climate change1. The ocean plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of this perturbation to the climate system, sequestering 20 to 35 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions2,3,4. Although much progress has been made in recent years in understanding and quantifying this sink, considerable uncertainties remain as to the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean, its rate of uptake over the industrial era, and the relative roles of the ocean and terrestrial biosphere in anthropogenic CO2 sequestration. Here we address these questions by presenting an observationally based reconstruction of the spatially resolved, time-dependent history of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean over the industrial era. Our approach is based on the recognition that the transport of tracers in the ocean can be described by a Green’s function, which we estimate from tracer data using a maximum entropy deconvolution technique. Our results indicate that ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased sharply since the 1950s, with a small decline in the rate of increase in the last few decades. We estimate the inventory and uptake rate of anthropogenic CO2 in 2008 at 140 ± 25 Pg C and 2.3 ± 0.6 Pg C yr-1, respectively. We find that the Southern Ocean is the primary conduit by which this CO2 enters the ocean (contributing over 40 per cent of the anthropogenic CO2 inventory in the ocean in 2008). Our results also suggest that the terrestrial biosphere was a source of CO2 until the 1940s, subsequently turning into a sink. Taken over the entire industrial period, and accounting for uncertainties, we estimate that the terrestrial biosphere has been anywhere from neutral to a net source of CO2, contributing up to half as much CO2 as has been taken up by the ocean over the same period."
https://openalex.org/W1981765517,"Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse a thermodynamically uphill uptake of the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic cleft into the cytoplasm of glia and neuronal cells by harnessing the energy of pre-existing electrochemical gradients of ions. Crucial to the reaction is the conformational transition of the transporters between outward and inward facing states, in which the substrate binding sites are accessible from the extracellular space and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here we describe the crystal structure of a double cysteine mutant of a glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii, Glt(Ph), which is trapped in the inward facing state by cysteine crosslinking. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of Glt(Ph) in the outward facing state, the structure of the crosslinked mutant allows us to propose a molecular mechanism by which Glt(Ph) and, by analogy, mammalian glutamate transporters mediate sodium-coupled substrate uptake."

https://openalex.org/W2124486107,"Rong Lu et al. present a dynamic systems-level study of cell fate changes in mouse embryonic stem cells following a single well-defined perturbation by downregulating the pluripotency factor Nanog. They measure global changes in histone acetylation, chromatin-bound RNA polymerase II, mRNA and nuclear protein levels for five days, and find progressive widespread changes in multiple molecular regulatory layers and provide a dynamic view of information flow in the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. The interaction between the different molecular mechanisms that regulate changes in embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate is not fully understood. A dynamic systems-level study of cell fate change in murine ESCs following a well-defined perturbation is now presented; the data demonstrate how a single genetic perturbation leads to widespread changes in several molecular regulatory layers, and provide a dynamic view of information flow in the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. Molecular regulation of embryonic stem cell (ESC) fate involves a coordinated interaction between epigenetic1,2,3,4, transcriptional5,6,7,8,9,10 and translational11,12 mechanisms. It is unclear how these different molecular regulatory mechanisms interact to regulate changes in stem cell fate. Here we present a dynamic systems-level study of cell fate change in murine ESCs following a well-defined perturbation. Global changes in histone acetylation, chromatin-bound RNA polymerase II, messenger RNA (mRNA), and nuclear protein levels were measured over 5 days after downregulation of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator13,14,15. Our data demonstrate how a single genetic perturbation leads to progressive widespread changes in several molecular regulatory layers, and provide a dynamic view of information flow in the epigenome, transcriptome and proteome. We observe that a large proportion of changes in nuclear protein levels are not accompanied by concordant changes in the expression of corresponding mRNAs, indicating important roles for translational and post-translational regulation of ESC fate. Gene-ontology analysis across different molecular layers indicates that although chromatin reconfiguration is important for altering cell fate, it is preceded by transcription-factor-mediated regulatory events. The temporal order of gene expression alterations shows the order of the regulatory network reconfiguration and offers further insight into the gene regulatory network. Our studies extend the conventional systems biology approach to include many molecular species, regulatory layers and temporal series, and underscore the complexity of the multilayer regulatory mechanisms responsible for changes in protein expression that determine stem cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1963846034,"In the pseudogap state of the high-Tc copper-oxide (cuprate) superconductors, angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements have seen an Fermi arc, i.e., an open-ended gapless section in the large Fermi surface, rather than a closed loop expected of an ordinary metal. This is all the more puzzling because Fermi pockets (small closed Fermi surface features) have been suggested from recent quantum oscillation measurements. The Fermi arcs have worried the high-Tc community for many years because they cannot be understood in terms of existing theories. Theorists came up with a way out in the form of conventional Fermi surface pockets associated with competing order, with a back side that is for detailed reasons invisible by photoemission. Here we report ARPES measurements of La-Bi2201 that give direct evidence of the Fermi pocket. The charge carriers in the pocket are holes and the pockets show an unusual dependence upon doping, namely, they exist in underdoped but not overdoped samples. A big surprise is that these Fermi pockets appear to coexist with the Fermi arcs. This coexistence has not been expected theoretically and the understanding of the mysterious pseudogap state in the high-Tc cuprate superconductors will rely critically on understanding such a new finding."
https://openalex.org/W2052027760,"The use of DNA barcodes for the identification of described species is one of the least controversial and most promising applications of barcoding. There is no consensus, however, as to what constitutes an appropriate identification standard and most barcoding efforts simply attempt to pair a query sequence with reference sequences and deem identification successful if it falls within the bounds of some pre-established cutoffs using genetic distance. Since the Renaissance, however, most biological classification schemes have relied on the use of diagnostic characters to identify and place species.Here we developed a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I character-based key for the identification of all tuna species of the genus Thunnus, and compared its performance with distance-based measures for identification of 68 samples of tuna sushi purchased from 31 restaurants in Manhattan (New York City) and Denver, Colorado. Both the character-based key and GenBank BLAST successfully identified 100% of the tuna samples, while the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) as well as genetic distance thresholds, and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree building performed poorly in terms of species identification. A piece of tuna sushi has the potential to be an endangered species, a fraud, or a health hazard. All three of these cases were uncovered in this study. Nineteen restaurant establishments were unable to clarify or misrepresented what species they sold. Five out of nine samples sold as a variant of ""white tuna"" were not albacore (T. alalunga), but escolar (Lepidocybium flavorunneum), a gempylid species banned for sale in Italy and Japan due to health concerns. Nineteen samples were northern bluefin tuna (T. thynnus) or the critically endangered southern bluefin tuna (T. maccoyii), though nine restaurants that sold these species did not state these species on their menus.The Convention on International Trade Endangered Species (CITES) requires that listed species must be identifiable in trade. This research fulfills this requirement for tuna, and supports the nomination of northern bluefin tuna for CITES listing in 2010."
https://openalex.org/W1976943723,"Background Several motile, filamentous cyanobacteria display the ability to self-assemble into tightly woven or twisted groups of filaments that form macroscopic yarns or ropes, and that are often centimeters long and 50–200 µm in diameter. Traditionally, this trait has been the basis for taxonomic definition of several genera, notably Microcoleus and Hydrocoleum, but the trait has not been associated with any plausible function. Method and Findings Through the use of phylogenetic reconstruction, we demonstrate that pedigreed, rope-building cyanobacteria from various habitats do not form a monophyletic group. This is consistent with the hypothesis that rope-building ability was fixed independently in several discrete clades, likely through processes of convergent evolution or lateral transfer. Because rope-building cyanobacteria share the ability to colonize geologically unstable sedimentary substrates, such as subtidal and intertidal marine sediments and non-vegetated soils, it is also likely that this supracellular differentiation capacity imparts a particular fitness advantage in such habitats. The physics of sediment and soil erosion in fact predict that threads in the 50–200 µm size range will attain optimal characteristics to stabilize such substrates on contact. Conclusions Rope building is a supracellular morphological adaptation in filamentous cyanobacteria that allows them to colonize physically unstable sedimentary environments, and to act as successful pioneers in the biostabilization process."
https://openalex.org/W2167523852,"Background Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins through cleavage by either intracellular or extracellular proteases. In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of protease cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry, we investigated the susceptibility of a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to cleavage by various airway proteases. Methodology/Principal Findings Purified triSpike proteins were readily cleaved in vitro by three different airway proteases: trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s). The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE. Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding. The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A). Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp. The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that SARS S-protein is susceptible to airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, that protease mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conformation of SARS S-protein upon ACE2 binding. These data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system and, furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV."

https://openalex.org/W1980489179,"Extra-cytoplasmic polypeptides are usually synthesized as 'preproteins' carrying amino-terminal, cleavable signal peptides and secreted across membranes by translocases. The main bacterial translocase comprises the SecYEG protein-conducting channel and the peripheral ATPase motor SecA. Most proteins destined for the periplasm and beyond are exported post-translationally by SecA. Preprotein targeting to SecA is thought to involve signal peptides and chaperones like SecB. Here we show that signal peptides have a new role beyond targeting: they are essential allosteric activators of the translocase. On docking on their binding groove on SecA, signal peptides act in trans to drive three successive states: first, 'triggering' that drives the translocase to a lower activation energy state; second, 'trapping' that engages non-native preprotein mature domains docked with high affinity on the secretion apparatus; and third, 'secretion' during which trapped mature domains undergo several turnovers of translocation in segments. A significant contribution by mature domains renders signal peptides less critical in bacterial secretory protein targeting than currently assumed. Rather, it is their function as allosteric activators of the translocase that renders signal peptides essential for protein secretion. A role for signal peptides and targeting sequences as allosteric activators may be universal in protein translocases."

https://openalex.org/W2058126260,"Helminth pathogens prepare a Th2 type immunological environment in their hosts to ensure their longevity. They achieve this by secreting molecules that not only actively drive type 2 responses but also suppress type 1 responses. Here, we show that the major cysteine proteases secreted from the helminth pathogens Fasciola hepatica (FheCL1) and Schistosoma mansoni (SmCB1) protect mice from the lethal effects of lipopolysaccharide by preventing the release of inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin-12, from macrophages. The proteases specifically block the MyD88-independent TRIF-dependent signaling pathway of Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and TLR3. Microscopical and flow cytometric studies, however, show that alteration of macrophage function by cysteine protease is not mediated by cleavage of components of the TLR4 complex on the cell surface but occurs by degradation of TLR3 within the endosome. This is the first study to describe a parasite molecule that degrades this receptor and pinpoints a novel mechanism by which helminth parasites modulate the innate immune responses of their hosts to suppress the development of Th1 responses.

It has been proposed that helminth-secreted molecules themselves signal through TLRs, activating a different pattern of kinases compared with LPS, resulting in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase dependent inhibition of interleukin (IL)-12 production (reviewed in Ref. 6van Riet E.

Enzyme activity ascribable to the papain family of cysteine proteases (clan CA, family C1), such as cathepsin L and B, has been identified as a major component of the secretions of almost all helminth parasites of humans, livestock, and companion animals (7Tort J.

These proteases are pivotal to the parasitic lifestyle by mediating fundamental processes such as host invasion, acquisition of nutrients, and the migration through host tissues (reviewed in Ref. 9Robinson M.W. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They can also have a systemic effect on the immune responses of their hosts by cleaving immunoglobulins and preventing antibody-mediated immune effector function, which protects the parasites from immune elimination (10Berasain P. Carmona C. Frangione B. Dalton J.P. Goñi F. Exp. Parasitol. 2000; 94: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Smith A.M. Dowd A.J. Heffernan M. Robertson C.D. Dalton J.P. Int. J.

We have shown that the predominant secreted product of the human and animal helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica, a cathepsin L1 cysteine protease (FheCL1), suppressed the onset of protective Th1 immune responses in mice to infections with the respiratory microbe Bordetella pertussis, making them more susceptible to disease. In addition, injection of the cysteine protease immediately prior to immunization of mice with a B. pertussis whole-cell pertussis vaccine prevented the development of a Th1 response to the vaccine (12Brady M.T. O'Neill S.M. Dalton J.P. Mills K.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5372-5378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13O'Neill S.M. Brady M.T. Callanan J.J. Mulcahy G. Joyce P. Mills K.H. Dalton J.P.

The engagement of TLRs is a critical step in the detection of pathogenic infection and promotion of appropriate adaptive immune responses. Here, we show that the FheCL1 protease secreted by the helminth pathogen F. hepatica (liver fluke) and the major cathepsin B1 protease secreted by the related helminth Schistosoma mansoni (blood fluke) inhibit macrophage TLR recognition of bacterial ligands. Delivery of cysteine protease protects mice from LPS-induced septic shock by preventing the release of inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide, TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, by macrophages. Using various TLR agonists we found that the cysteine proteases inactivated MyD88-independent TRIF-dependent signaling pathways of TLR4 and TLR3. This inactivation is not mediated by cleavage of cell surface TLR4 or CD14 but results from specific degradation of TLR3 within the endosome. This study, therefore, describes a novel means by which parasites alter innate immune cell function and prevent the establishment of potent Th1-driven inflammatory responses that would lead to their elimination. Functionally active recombinant F. hepatica cathepsin L1 (FheCL1) and S. mansoni cathepsin B1 (SmB1) were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described (15Collins P.R.

The peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice was lavaged with 5 ml of supplemented RPMI (Invitrogen). Following determination of viability by trypan blue exclusion, peritoneal exudate cells were adjusted to 5 × 106cells/ml and cultured in six-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). After 2–3 h incubation at 37 °C, nonadherent cells were removed by washing with ice cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The remaining adherent cells were removed with a cell scraper into RPMI. For each experiment, macrophages from 10–15 mice were pooled, and preparations of 1 × 106 cells/ml were stimulated overnight for 12 h (or 6 h for mRNA expression analysis) with varying concentrations of LPS (Escherichia coli 111:B4; Sigma), CpG ODN 1826 (synthesized by Sigma Genosys), poly(IC) (Sigma), flagellin (Calbiochem) and Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4 (EMC Microcollections, Tubingen, Germany). Interferon (IFN)-γ was measured by immunoassay according to the manufacturer’s instructions using pairs of commercially available monoclonal antibodies (BD Pharmingen). Concentrations of IL-6, IL-12, and TNFα were determined by commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (BD Pharmingen). Production of nitric oxide by macrophages was assessed by measuring the increase in nitrite concentration using the Greiss reagent (Promega). Six-week-old BALB/c mice were intra-peritoneally injected with 10 mg/kg of E. coli LPS (serotype 111:B4; Sigma) and observed hourly over a 70-h period. For the analysis of inflammatory mediators, mice were sacrificed at 2 and 4 h after LPS injection by cervical dislocation. Heart punctures were performed, and blood was collected in heparinized tubes. Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Peritoneal lavage was also performed, and macrophages were isolated as described above. Both the sera and lavage supernatants were analyzed for the presence of inflammatory cytokines by ELISA. Macrophages (1 × 106cells/ml) were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with antibodies specific for CD14 (BD Pharmingen) or the TLR4·MD-2 complex (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) along with the relevant isotype controls. Antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and used at the recommended concentrations. Following incubation of macrophages with TLR agonists, cells were washed with PBS, and total RNA were isolated with Tri-reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with 50 ng of RNA, oligo(dT) primer (synthesized by Sigma Genosys), and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). First strand cDNA (5 μl) was then subjected to amplification with Taq polymerase (Sigma) using primers specific for β-actin, TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, iNOS, TLR4, IFNβ, interferon-stimulated gene 54, and TLR3 using cycle conditions optimized for each primer set. All PCR products were electrophoretically analyzed on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In some cases, quantification of PCR products was carried out by densitometric analysis of photographic negatives of agarose gels using Un-Scan-It software (Silk Scientific). The quantification method used in these assays is relative because absolute values of mRNA levels could not be determined, as internal controls for specific mRNAs were not used. Values for mRNA are expressed in relative absorbance units and are standardized per unit of β-actin per sample. A total of 1 × 106 macrophages/ml were solubilized in 100 μl of ice cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis then transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, washed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody specific for TLR3 (1:200 dilution in 5% bovine serum albumin and 5% PBS-Tween 20; Abcam), TRAF3 or TRIF (1:1,000 dilution; Abcam). Following a 3-h incubation at room temperature with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), the blots were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Sigma). Loading controls were determined using a primary antibody specific for actin (Sigma). Six-week-old BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 μg CL1 or PBS. After 2 h, peritoneal macrophages were harvested from lavages by adherence to plastic, as described above. Macrophages from 10 mice were pooled and preparations of 1 × 106 cells/ml were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips. The cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently permeabilized by incubation in the presence of 0.1% Triton-X/PBS. After this, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody specific for TLR3, His6 tag, EEA-1 or mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Abcam) diluted 1:50 in 1% fetal calf serum/PBS. Following three washes with 1× PBS, cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated (Sigma), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated, or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated (Molecular Probes) secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution) and then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml in PBS) to detect cell nuclei. Cells were examined either with a Nikon A1 confocal scanning laser microscope, and images were analyzed using NIS Elements software (Nikon) or a DeltaVision personal DV deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, Inc.), and the images were analyzed using IMARIS software (Bitplane). The statistical significance of difference was determined by the two tailed Student’s t test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. We have previously shown that the rapid suppression of interferon-γ-associated inflammatory responses during infection with F. hepatica is related to the secretion of FheCL1 cysteine proteases (14O'Neill S.M. Mills K.H. Dalton J.P. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we employed a murine sepsis model to examine whether FheCL1 suppressed macrophage-driven Th1 inflammation. When BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 μg (10 mg/kg) of E. coli LPS, fatal endotoxic shock occurred within 30 h (Fig. 1A). However, administration of a single dose (50 μg) of FheCL1, 2 h prior to LPS administration, reduced mortality by 30% (p = 0.001). A significant reduction in the levels of proinflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-12, TNFα, and IFNγ) of endotoxic shock in both the sera (Fig. 1B) and peritoneal lavage fluid (Fig. 1C) of FheCL1-treated mice was also observed. Because macrophages are the main source of pro-inflammatory mediators in the septic shock model, we examined their activation status in FheCL1-treated mice. Macrophages were removed from the peritoneal cavity of mice 2 h after treatment with a single dose of FheCL1 and stimulated ex vivo with LPS for 12 h. We found that the levels of all proinflammatory mediators, nitric oxide, IL-6, TNFα, and IL-12 secreted from these macrophages were significantly reduced compared with macrophages derived from animals pretreated with PBS (Fig. 2A). Suppression of macrophage activation by FheCL1 was negated if the enzyme was complexed with the cysteine protease specific inhibitors Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone (20 μm) or E-64 (1 μm) (Fig. 2B and data not shown) prior to administration to mice. In addition, administration of a proteolytically inactive variant of FheCL1, which has the active site cysteine replaced with a glycine, FheCL1Gly26, did not suppress the response to LPS stimulation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of macrophage responsiveness to LPS was dependent on the dose of FheCL1 delivered, with decreasing doses showing correspondingly lower suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Fig. 2C). Using similar experiments, we showed that treatment of mice with the major secreted cathepsin B1 (SmB1) protease of the helminth S. mansoni was also capable of suppressing macrophage proinflammatory cytokine secretion when given in an active form but not when complexed with the inhibitor E-64 (data not shown). Peritoneal administration of FheCL1 altered the cellular composition of the peritoneal cavity (data not shown) by increasing the number of lymphocytes to 8% of the cell population as compared with 1% following delivery of PBS. To determine whether the increase in lymphocytes contributed to the suppressive effect on macrophages, peritoneal macrophages isolated from naïve BALB/c mice were cultured in the presence of the nonadherent cellular population of peritoneal exudate isolated from FheCL1-treated mice and also in the presence of the exudate fluid. When these macrophages were subsequently (2 h later) stimulated with LPS, no suppression of IL-6 and TNFα secretion was observed (Fig. 2D). These data exclude the possibility that the increase in lymphocytes, or secretions from these cells, is responsible for the suppression of macrophage inflammatory responses in FheCL1-treated mice. To further confirm this, macrophages isolated from the peritoneal cavity of naïve BALB/c mice were exposed in vitro to PBS, FheCL1, or FheCL1Gly26 for a period of 2 h. Following removal of the cysteine protease, the macrophages were stimulated with LPS. Similar to that observed with in vivo exposure, macrophages treated with FheCL1 were less responsive to LPS stimulation, secreting significantly reduced levels of both TNFα and IL-6 compared with macrophages treated with PBS (Fig. 2E). The inactive variant FheCL1Gly26 exhibited no effect on the macrophages in vitro, further substantiating the requirement for proteolytic activity. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that helminth cysteine proteases can prevent the activation of macrophages by LPS and that this property is dependent on the hydrolytic activity of the enzymes. The core macrophage receptors recognizing LPS are CD14, TLR4, and MD-2. Bromelain, a cysteine protease of pineapple and the Arg- and Lys-specific gingipains secreted, respectively, secreted from Porphyromonas gingivalis remove CD14 but not TLR4 from the surface of macrophages (18Huang J.R. Wu C.C. Hou R.C. Jeng K.C. Immunol. Invest. 2008; 37: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Sugawara S. Nemoto E. Tada H. Miyake K. Imamura T. Takada H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), making the cells hyporesponsive to LPS stimulation. While the induction of inflammatory mediators in response to low concentrations of LPS (<10 ng/ml) requires the participation of both TLR4·MD-2 complex and CD14, responses to high concentrations of LPS (>1 μg/ml) are independent of CD14 (20Perera P.Y. Mayadas T.N. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Zaks-Zilberman M. Goyert S.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In this study, a single treatment of mice with FheCL1 suppressed the production of inflammatory mediators in response to stimulation with a range of LPS concentrations from 1 ng to 5 μg/ml (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the action of FheCL1 on macrophages does not involve proteolytic removal of CD14. This conclusion was supported by flow cytometry that revealed no difference in the levels of surface CD14 on macrophages isolated from FheCL1-treated and PBS-treated mice (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we found no reduction in the surface expression of TLR4-MD2 on macrophages from FheCL1-treated mice using flow cytometry (Fig. 3B), and no alteration in TLR4 transcript expression by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3C). We investigated whether FheCL1 exhibited its suppressive effect on macrophages by modulating TLR4 signaling pathways. Following interaction between LPS and the CD14· TLR4·MD-2 receptor complex, recruitment of MyD88 activates a series of kinases, ultimately resulting in the translocation of NFκB to the nucleus, where it mediates an increase in inflammatory cytokine gene expression leading to proinflammatory responses (reviewed in Ref. 21Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6684) Google Scholar). TLR4 recognition of LPS, however, also leads to the activation of a MyD88-independent (TRIF-dependent) pathway that, while inducing NFκB activation, primarily activates the transcription factor IRF3. IRF3 then induces the transcription of IFNβ, which, in turn, leads to STAT1 activation and the subsequent induction of STAT1-dependent genes such as iNOS and interferon-inducible protein 10 (22Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Mühlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). We found a reduction in the expression of IL-6 and TNFα transcripts in macrophages isolated from FheCL1-treated mice compared with PBS-treated mice. Although these changes failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.08 for both) when analyzed by densitometry, the decrease was reproducible between experiments. In stark contrast, FheCL1 treatment significantly suppressed the induction of both IL-12 (p = 0.0067) and iNOS (p = 0.0005) mRNA expression (Fig. 3, D and E). This differential suppression of gene expression correlates with the reduction of the respective cytokines as seen in Fig. 3A, which clearly shows that the suppression of LPS induced IL-6 and TNFα was far less significant than the reduction in nitric oxide production. This result is relevant because, while the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα in response to TLR4 binding is mediated through both TRIF and MyD88 (21Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6684) Google Scholar), induction of iNOS expression is mostly dependent on TRIF-mediated activation of IFNβ (22Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Mühlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was recently shown that IL-12 mRNA expression in macrophages is also regulated by IFNβ (23Thomas K.E. Galligan C.L. Newman R.D. Fish E.N. Vogel S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31119-31130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pronounced suppression of iNOS and IL-12 expression in macrophages caused by FheCL1 treatment was most likely mediated by selective inhibition of TRIF-dependent, IFNβ-mediated TLR signaling. To investigate the possibility that FheCL1 was specifically targeting the TRIF-dependent pathway of macrophage activation, we stimulated macrophages with poly(I·C), a synthetic agonist of TLR3, which signals exclusively via the TRIF-dependent pathway (24Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). We found that FheCL1-treated macrophages secreted significantly lower levels of IL-12, TNFα, and nitrite when exposed to poly(I·C) for 12 h compared with macrophages taken from PBS-treated or FheCL1Gly26-treated controls (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Furthermore, mRNA transcripts of these inflammatory mediators were not detected in FheCL1-treated macrophages (Fig. 4B). In contrast, FheCL1- or FheCL1Gly26-treatment of mice had no effect on the ability of macrophages to respond to ligands of TLR2 (Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4), TLR5 (flagellin), or TLR 9 (CpG DNA, Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 1), all of which mediate their effects solely through MyD88-dependent pathways. Similarly, macrophages isolated from mice after treatment with SmB1 were less responsive to stimulation with both LPS and poly(I·C) but not CpG (supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, mRNA expression of IL-12 and iNOS but not TNFα was absent from LPS-stimulated macrophages. Like FheCL1, SmB1 inhibited the expression of all three mRNAs in response to poly(I·C) (supplemental Fig. 2). Further RT-PCR analyses on macrophages isolated from FheCL1-treated mice revealed no detectable levels of IFNβ mRNA in response to LPS or poly(I·C) stimulation, in contrast to macrophages from PBS-treated mice that did express IFNβ (Fig. 5). The promoter region of IFNβ has been shown to require the cooperation of both DNA-binding transcription factors IRF3 and NFκB (25Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, activation of IRF3 alone is sufficient for the induction of ISG54 gene expression, and IL-6 is an example of a gene that is induced by activation of NFκB, independently of IRF-3 (26Andersen J. VanScoy S. Cheng T.F. Gomez D. Reich N.C. Genes Immun. 2008; 9: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Macrophages isolated from FheCL1-treated mice show no expression of either ISG54 or IL-6 in response to the ligation of TLR3 with poly(I·C), indicating the absence of activation of both IRF3 and NFκB (Fig. 5). In contrast, exposure of FheCL1-treated macrophages to LPS results in the induction of IL-6 gene expression but not ISG54, suggesting that TLR4/MyD88-dependent induction of NFκB remains intact but the TRIF-dependent activation of IRF3 in response to LPS is inhibited by FheCL1. It was shown recently that a serine protease of hepatitis C virus inhibited poly(I·C)-activated signaling via the proteolytic cleavage of the TRIF adaptor protein of TLR3 (27Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In addition, the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), an important link between the recruitment of TRIF and the activation of IRF3, is susceptible to cleavage by protease enzymes (28Lee Z.H. Lee S.E. Kwack K. Yeo W. Lee T.H. Bae S.S. Suh P.G. Kim H.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 490-496PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither TRIF nor TRAF3 were susceptible to degradation by FheCL1, likely because of their cytosolic location (Fig. 6A). Unlike viral proteases, parasite proteins are taken from the external environment by dendritic cells and macrophages (29Semnani R.T. Law M. Kubofcik J. Nutman T.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6229-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30van Liempt E. van Vliet S.J. Engering A. García Vallejo J.J. Bank C.M. Sanchez-Hernandez M. van Kooyk Y. van Die I. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and are trafficked via early endosomes to the lysosomal compartments (30van Liempt E. van Vliet S.J. Engering A. García Vallejo J.J. Bank C.M. Sanchez-Hernandez M. van Kooyk Y. van Die I. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Considering TLR3 exists in the endolysosomal compartments of cells, we therefore investigated whether FheCL1 may be exerting its suppressive effect on macrophages via the degradation of TLR3. Immunoblot analyses of proteins extracted from macrophages isolated from mice given a single injection of FheCL1 failed to detect TLR3 protein (Fig. 6B) despite there being no alteration in the level of expression of the TLR3 gene, as detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 6C). Confocal laser microscopy analysis confirmed the absence of TLR3 in macrophages treated with FheCL1 (Fig. 6D), with cells stained positively for TLR3 reduced to 20 and 40% of total cells counted in two independent experiments compared with 99.1 and 99.7% of macrophages from PBS-treated mice. To confirm that the FheCL1 degradation of TLR3 occurs as a result of direct action within the endosome, we examined the subcellular localization of FheCL1 after injection by staining the peritoneal macrophages with an anti-His6 tag antibody. No fluorescence is observed in cells isolated from PBS-treated mice and stained with the anti-His6 tag antibody (data not shown), which confirms its specificity for recombinant FheCL1. While there is some colocalization between FheCL1 and mannose-6-phosphate receptor positive compartments (Fig. 7, lower panel), the majority of FheCL1 appears to be located within the early endosome compartments (Fig. 7, upper panel). These data support our proposal that 2 h after injection into the peritoneal cavity, FheCL1 has been captured by the macrophage and is directly cleaving TLR3 from within the endosome of the macrophage and thus preventing TRIF-dependent signaling. F. hepatica secretes abundant amounts of FheCL1 protease into the tissues of its host where the enzyme functions in tissue degradation and immunosuppression (9Robinson M.W. Dalton J.P. Donnelly S.

https://openalex.org/W2055949220,"DNA is replicated by a replisome containing two polymerases that move unidirectionally, sythesizing DNA strands of opposite polarity. DNA synthesis on the leading and lagging strands therefore involves different mechanisms, although the rate of synthesis is coordinated so that movement on the two strands is equal. A previous study suggested that the leading-strand polymerase pauses when the lagging-strand polymerase synthesizes a new primer for each Okazaki fragment. Patel et al. now find no evidence for pausing; rather, they find that primers are made as DNA is being synthesized and then passed on to the polymerase. To allow for this transfer, the lagging-strand polymerase copies DNA at a faster rate than the leading strand. DNA is replicated by a replisome containing two DNA polymerase molecules, one of which copies the leading-strand template in a continuous manner while the second copies the lagging-strand template in a discontinuous manner; however, the two strands are synthesized at the same net rate. RNA primers are now shown to be made as DNA is being synthesized and then passed on to the polymerase; to allow for this transfer, the lagging-strand polymerase has a faster rate. Genomic DNA is replicated by two DNA polymerase molecules, one of which works in close association with the helicase to copy the leading-strand template in a continuous manner while the second copies the already unwound lagging-strand template in a discontinuous manner through the synthesis of Okazaki fragments1,2. Considering that the lagging-strand polymerase has to recycle after the completion of every Okazaki fragment through the slow steps of primer synthesis and hand-off to the polymerase3,4,5, it is not understood how the two strands are synthesized with the same net rate6,7,8,9. Here we show, using the T7 replication proteins10,11, that RNA primers are made ‘on the fly’ during ongoing DNA synthesis and that the leading-strand T7 replisome does not pause during primer synthesis, contrary to previous reports12,13. Instead, the leading-strand polymerase remains limited by the speed of the helicase14; it therefore synthesizes DNA more slowly than the lagging-strand polymerase. We show that the primase–helicase T7 gp4 maintains contact with the priming sequence during ongoing DNA synthesis; the nascent lagging-strand template therefore organizes into a priming loop that keeps the primer in physical proximity to the replication complex. Our findings provide three synergistic mechanisms of coordination: first, primers are made concomitantly with DNA synthesis; second, the priming loop ensures efficient primer use and hand-off to the polymerase; and third, the lagging-strand polymerase copies DNA faster, which allows it to keep up with leading-strand DNA synthesis overall."
https://openalex.org/W2089122694,"MiRNAs regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level and their dysregulation can play major roles in the pathogenesis of many different forms of cancer, including neuroblastoma, an often fatal paediatric cancer originating from precursor cells of the sympathetic nervous system. We have analyzed a set of neuroblastoma (n = 145) that is broadly representative of the genetic subtypes of this disease for miRNA expression (430 loci by stem-loop RT qPCR) and for DNA copy number alterations (array CGH) to assess miRNA involvement in disease pathogenesis. The tumors were stratified and then randomly split into a training set (n = 96) and a validation set (n = 49) for data analysis. Thirty-seven miRNAs were significantly over- or under-expressed in MYCN amplified tumors relative to MYCN single copy tumors, indicating a potential role for the MYCN transcription factor in either the direct or indirect dysregulation of these loci. In addition, we also determined that there was a highly significant correlation between miRNA expression levels and DNA copy number, indicating a role for large-scale genomic imbalances in the dysregulation of miRNA expression. In order to directly assess whether miRNA expression was predictive of clinical outcome, we used the Random Forest classifier to identify miRNAs that were most significantly associated with poor overall patient survival and developed a 15 miRNA signature that was predictive of overall survival with 72.7% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity in the validation set of tumors. We conclude that there is widespread dysregulation of miRNA expression in neuroblastoma tumors caused by both over-expression of the MYCN transcription factor and by large-scale chromosomal imbalances. MiRNA expression patterns are also predicative of clinical outcome, highlighting the potential for miRNA mediated diagnostics and therapeutics."

Studies with wild capuchin monkeys, the most encephalized simian species, have indicated a New World convergence on these cultural phenomena, involving multiple traditions and tool use. However, experimental studies to date are in conflict with such findings in concluding that capuchins, like other monkeys, show minimal capacities for social learning. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a new experimental approach in which the alpha male of each of two groups of capuchins was trained to open an artificial foraging device in a quite different way, using either a slide or lift action, then reunited with his group. In each group a majority of monkeys, 8 of 11 and 13 of 14, subsequently mastered the task. Seventeen of the successful 21 monkeys discovered the alternative action to that seeded in the group, performing it a median of 4 times. Nevertheless, all 21 primarily adopted the technique seeded by their group's alpha male. Median proportions of slide versus lift were 0.96 for the group seeded with slide versus 0. 01 for the group seeded with lift. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest a striking effect of social conformity in learned behavioral techniques, consistent with field reports of capuchin traditions and convergent on the only other species in which such cultural phenomena have been reported, chimpanzees and humans."

Methods and Findings We describe here two new mouse lines, constructed by gene targeting to the Rosa26 locus to facilitate Cre-mediated cell modification. These lines should prove particularly useful in the context of sparse labeling experiments. The R26rtTACreER line provides ubiquitous expression of CreER under transcriptional control by the tetracycline reverse transactivator (rtTA); dual control by doxycycline and tamoxifen provides an extended dynamic range of Cre-mediated recombination activity. The R26IAP line provides high efficiency Cre-mediated activation of human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP), complementing the widely used, but low efficiency, Z/AP line. By crossing with mouse lines that direct cell-type specific CreER expression, the R26IAP line has been used to produce atlases of labeled cholinergic and catecholaminergic neurons in the mouse brain. The R26IAP line has also been used to visualize the full morphologies of retinal dopaminergic amacrine cells, among the largest neurons in the mammalian retina. Conclusions The two new mouse lines described here expand the repertoire of genetically engineered mice available for controlled in vivo recombination and cell labeling using the Cre-lox system."
https://openalex.org/W2165246198,"Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal that can exert toxic effects at high concentrations, eventually leading to Parkinsonism. A major transporter of Mn in mammals is the divalent-metal transporter (DMT1). We characterize here DMT1-like proteins in the nematode C. elegans, which regulate and are regulated by Mn and iron (Fe) content. We identified three new DMT1-like genes in C. elegans: smf-1, smf-2 and smf-3. All three can functionally substitute for loss of their yeast orthologues in S. cerevisiae. In the worm, deletion of smf-1 or smf-3 led to an increased Mn tolerance, while loss of smf-2 led to increased Mn sensitivity. smf mRNA levels measured by QRT-PCR were up-regulated upon low Mn and down-regulated upon high Mn exposures. Translational GFP-fusions revealed that SMF-1 and SMF-3 strongly localize to partially overlapping apical regions of the gut epithelium, suggesting a differential role for SMF-1 and SMF-3 in Mn nutritional intake. Conversely, SMF-2 was detected in the marginal pharyngeal epithelium, possibly involved in metal-sensing. Analysis of metal content upon Mn exposure in smf mutants revealed that SMF-3 is required for normal Mn uptake, while smf-1 was dispensable. Higher smf-2 mRNA levels correlated with higher Fe content, supporting a role for SMF-2 in Fe uptake. In smf-1 and smf-3 but not in smf-2 mutants, increased Mn exposure led to decreased Fe levels, suggesting that both metals compete for transport by SMF-2. Finally, SMF-3 was post-translationally and reversibly down-regulated following Mn-exposure. In sum, we unraveled a complex interplay of transcriptional and post-translational regulations of 3 DMT1-like transporters in two adjacent tissues, which regulate metal-content in C. elegans."

Although the symptoms in humans are mild at present, fears are that further mutations in the virus could lead to a potentially more dangerous outbreak in subsequent months. As the primary immunity-eliciting antigen, hemagglutinin (HA) is the major agent for host-driven antigenic drift in A(H3N2) virus. However, whether and how the evolution of HA is influenced by existing immunity is poorly understood for A(H1N1). Here, by analyzing hundreds of A(H1N1) HA sequences since 1918, we show the first evidence that host selections are indeed present in A(H1N1) HAs. Among a subgroup of human A(H1N1) HAs between 1918 approximately 2008, we found strong diversifying (positive) selection at HA(1) 156 and 190. We also analyzed the evolutionary trends at HA(1) 190 and 225 that are critical determinants for receptor-binding specificity of A(H1N1) HA. Different A(H1N1) viruses appeared to favor one of these two sites in host-driven antigenic drift: epidemic A(H1N1) HAs favor HA(1) 190 while the 1918 pandemic and swine HAs favor HA(1) 225. Thus, our results highlight the urgency to understand the interplay between antigenic drift and receptor binding in HA evolution, and provide molecular signatures for monitoring future antigenically drifted 2009 pandemic and seasonal A(H1N1) influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2020901017,"The HNF1A, HNF1B and HNF4A genes are part of an autoregulatory network in mammalian pancreas, liver, kidney and gut. The layout of this network appears to be similar in rodents and humans, but inactivation of HNF1A, HNF1B or HNF4A genes in animal models cause divergent phenotypes to those seen in man. We hypothesised that some differences may arise from variation in the expression profile of alternatively processed isoforms between species.We measured the expression of the major isoforms of the HNF1A, HNF1B and HNF4A genes in human and rodent pancreas, islet, liver and kidney by isoform-specific quantitative real-time PCR and compared their expression by the comparative Ct (DeltaDeltaCt) method. We found major changes in the expression profiles of the HNF genes between humans and rodents. The principal difference lies in the expression of the HNF1A gene, which exists as three isoforms in man, but as a single isoform only in rodents. More subtle changes were to the balance of HNF1B and HNF4A isoforms between species; the repressor isoform HNF1B(C) comprised only 6% in human islets compared with 24-26% in rodents (p = 0.006) whereas HNF4A9 comprised 22% of HNF4A expression in human pancreas but only 11% in rodents (p = 0.001).The differences we note in the isoform-specific expression of the human and rodent HNF1A, HNF1B and HNF4A genes may impact on the absolute activity of these genes, and therefore on the activity of the pancreatic transcription factor network as a whole. We conclude that alterations to expression of HNF isoforms may underlie some of the phenotypic variation caused by mutations in these genes."

The effect of acadesine (AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside) a compound with known antileukemic effect on B cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (B-CLL) was investigated in different CML cell lines. Acadesine triggered loss of cell metabolism in K562, LAMA-84 and JURL-MK1 and was also effective in killing imatinib-resistant K562 cells and Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I-BCR-ABL mutation. The anti-leukemic effect of acadesine did not involve apoptosis but required rather induction of autophagic cell death. AMPK knock-down by Sh-RNA failed to prevent the effect of acadesine, indicating an AMPK-independent mechanism. The effect of acadesine was abrogated by GF109203X and Ro-32-0432, both inhibitor of classical and new PKCs and accordingly, acadesine triggered relocation and activation of several PKC isoforms in K562 cells. In addition, this compound exhibited a potent anti-leukemic effect in clonogenic assays of CML cells in methyl cellulose and in a xenograft model of K562 cells in nude mice. In conclusion, our work identifies an original and unexpected mechanism by which acadesine triggers autophagic cell death through PKC activation. Therefore, in addition to its promising effects in B-CLL, acadesine might also be beneficial for Imatinib-resistant CML patients."
https://openalex.org/W2009055235,"Ocular neovascularisation is a pathological hallmark of some forms of debilitating blindness including diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration and retinopathy of prematurity. Current therapies for delaying unwanted ocular angiogenesis include laser surgery or molecular inhibition of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. However, targeting of angiogenic pathways other than, or in combination to VEGF, may lead to more effective and safer inhibitors of intraocular angiogenesis. In a small chemical screen using zebrafish, we identify LY294002 as an effective and selective inhibitor of both developmental and ectopic hyaloid angiogenesis in the eye. LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, exerts its anti-angiogenic effect in a dose-dependent manner, without perturbing existing vessels. Significantly, LY294002 delivered by intraocular injection, significantly inhibits ocular angiogenesis without systemic side-effects and without diminishing visual function. Thus, targeting of PI3 kinase pathways has the potential to effectively and safely treat neovascularisation in eye disease."
https://openalex.org/W2082662662,"Background Historical studies of news media have suggested an association between reporting and increased drug abuse. Period effects for substance use have been documented for different classes of legal and illicit substances, with the suspicion that media publicity may have played major roles in their emergence. Previous analyses have drawn primarily from qualitative evidence; the temporal relationship between media reporting volume and adverse health consequences has not been quantified nationally. We set out to explore whether we could find a quantitative relationship between media reports about prescription opioid abuse and overdose mortality associated with these drugs. We assessed whether increases in news media reports occurred before or after increases in overdose deaths. Methodology/Principal Findings Our ecological study compared a monthly time series of unintentional poisoning deaths involving short-acting prescription opioid substances, from 1999 to 2005 using multiple cause-of-death data published by the National Center for Health Statistics, to monthly counts of English-language news articles mentioning generic and branded names of prescription opioids obtained from Google News Archives from 1999 to 2005. We estimated the association between media volume and mortality rates by time-lagged regression analyses. There were 24,272 articles and 30,916 deaths involving prescription opioids during the seven-year study period. Nationally, the number of articles mentioning prescription opioids increased dramatically starting in early 2001, following prominent coverage about the nonmedical use of OxyContin. We found a significant association between news reports and deaths, with media reporting preceding fatal opioid poisonings by two to six months and explaining 88% (p<0.0001, df 78) of the variation in mortality. Conclusions/Significance While availability, structural, and individual predispositions are key factors influencing substance use, news reporting may enhance the popularity of psychoactive substances. Albeit ecological in nature, our finding suggests the need for further evaluation of the influence of news media on health.

These ""large introns"" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. In invertebrates, especially Drosophila, it has been shown that larger introns can be spliced efficiently through a process known as recursive splicing-a consecutive splicing from the 5'-end at a series of combined donor-acceptor splice sites called RP-sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing. We analyzed over 15,000 non-redundant, large introns from six mammals, 1,600 from chicken and zebrafish, and 560 non-redundant large introns from five invertebrates. Our bioinformatic investigation demonstrates that, unlike the studied invertebrates, the studied vertebrate genomes contain consistently abundant amounts of direct and complementary strand interspersed repetitive elements (mainly SINEs and LINEs) that may form stems with each other in large introns. This examination showed that predicted stems are indeed abundant and stable in the large introns of mammals. We hypothesize that such stems with long loops within large introns allow intron splice sites to find each other more quickly by folding the intronic RNA upon itself at smaller intervals and, thus, reducing the distance between donor and acceptor sites."
https://openalex.org/W1991527828,"THE COMPLEXITY OF WNT SIGNALING LIKELY STEMS FROM TWO SOURCES: multiple pathways emanating from frizzled receptors in response to wnt binding, and modulation of those pathways and target gene responsiveness by context-dependent signals downstream of growth factor and matrix receptors. Both rac1 and c-jun have recently been implicated in wnt signaling, however their upstream activators have not been identified.Here we identify the adapter protein Grb2, which is itself an integrator of multiple signaling pathways, as a modifier of beta-catenin-dependent wnt signaling. Grb2 synergizes with wnt3A, constitutively active (CA) LRP6, Dvl2 or CA-beta-catenin to drive a LEF/TCF-responsive reporter, and dominant negative (DN) Grb2 or siRNA to Grb2 block wnt3A-mediated reporter activity. MMP9 is a target of beta-catenin-dependent wnt signaling, and an MMP9 promoter reporter is also responsive to signals downstream of Grb2. Both a jnk inhibitor and DN-c-jun block transcriptional activation downstream of Dvl2 and Grb2, as does DN-rac1. Integrin ligation by collagen also synergizes with wnt signaling as does overexpression of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), and this is blocked by DN-Grb2.These data suggest that integrin ligation and FAK activation synergize with wnt signaling through a Grb2-rac-jnk-c-jun pathway, providing a context-dependent mechanism for modulation of wnt signaling."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between TCF7L2 polymorphism rs7903146 and coronary artery disease in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.two populations were studied in order to assess severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events incidence. Eight-hundred and eighty nine subjects who were referred for cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease diagnosis were cross-sectionally evaluated for coronary lesions (atherosclerotic burden) and 559 subjects from the MASS-II Trial were prospectively followed-up for 5 years and assessed for major cardiovascular events incidence. As expected, rs7903146 T allele was associated with diabetes. Although diabetic patients had a higher prevalence of coronary lesions, no association between TCF7L2 genotype and coronary lesions was found in this subgroup. However, non-diabetic individuals carrying the T allele were associated with a significantly higher frequency of coronary lesions than non-diabetic non-carriers of the risk allele (adjusted OR = 2.32 95%CI 1.27-4.24, p = 0.006). Moreover, presence of multi-vessel coronary artery disease was also associated with the CT or TT genotypes in non-diabetics. Similarly, from the prospective sample analysis, non-diabetics carrying the CT/TT genotypes had significantly more composite cardiovascular end-points events than CC carriers (p = 0.049), mainly due to an increased incidence of death (p = 0.004).rs7903146 T allele is associated with diabetes and, in non-diabetic individuals, with a higher prevalence and severity of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular events. name of registry site (see list below), registration number, trial registration URL in brackets.MEDICINE, ANGIOPLASTY, OR SURGERY STUDY (MASS II): Unique identifier: ISRCTN66068876."
https://openalex.org/W1978819838,"Widespread infection of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 was reported from backyard and commercial poultry in West Bengal (WB), an eastern state of India in early 2008. Infection gradually spread to Tripura, Assam and Sikkim, the northeastern states, with 70 outbreaks reported between January 2008 and May 2009. Whole genome sequence analysis of three isolates from WB, one isolate from Tripura along with the analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of 17 other isolates was performed during this study. In the HA gene phylogenetic tree, all the 2008-09 Indian isolates belonged to EMA3 sublineage of clade 2.2. The closest phylogenetic relationship was found to be with the 2007-09 isolates from Bangladesh and not with the earlier 2006 and 2007 Indian isolates implying a third introduction into the country. The receptor-binding pocket of HA1 of two isolates from WB showed S221P mutation, one of the markers predicted to be associated with human receptor specificity. Two substitutions E119A (2 isolates of WB) and N294S (2 other isolates of WB) known to confer resistance to NA inhibitors were observed in the active site of neuraminidase. Several additional mutations were observed within the 2008-09 Indian isolates indicating genetic diversification. Overall, the study is indicative of a possible endemicity in the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, demanding active surveillance specifically in view of the critical mutations that have been observed in the influenza A H5N1 viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2100241091,"Background Macrophages are principal drivers of synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a prototype immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Conceivably, synovial macrophages are continuously replaced by circulating monocytes in RA. Animal studies from the 1960s suggested that macrophage replacement by monocytes is a slow process in chronic inflammatory lesions. Translation of these data into the human condition has been hampered by the lack of available techniques to analyze monocyte migration in man. Methods/Principal Findings We developed a technique that enabled us to analyze the migration of labelled autologous monocytes in RA patients using single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT). We isolated CD14+ monocytes by CliniMACS in 8 patients and labeled these with technetium-99m (99mTc-HMPAO). Monocytes were re-infused into the same patient. Using SPECT we calculated that a very small but specific fraction of 3.4×10−3 (0.95−5.1×10−3) % of re-infused monocytes migrated to the inflamed joints, being detectable within one hour after re-infusion. Conclusions/Significance The results indicate monocytes migrate continuously into the inflamed synovial tissue of RA patients, but at a slow macrophage-replacement rate. This suggests that the rapid decrease in synovial macrophages that occurs after antirheumatic treatment might rather be explained by an alteration in macrophage retention than in monocyte influx and that RA might be particularly sensitive to treatments targeting inflammatory cell retention."
https://openalex.org/W2039903878,"St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV; Flaviviridae, flavivirus) was the major cause of epidemic flaviviral encephalitis in the U.S. prior to the introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) in 1999. However, outbreaks of SLEV have been significantly more limited then WNV in terms of levels of activity and geographic dispersal. One possible explanation for these variable levels of activity is that differences in the potential for each virus to adapt to its host cycle exist. The need for arboviruses to replicate in disparate hosts is thought to result in constraints on both evolution and host-specific adaptation. If cycling is the cause of genetic stability observed in nature and arboviruses lack host specialization, then sequential passage should result in both the accumulation of mutations and specialized viruses better suited for replication in that host. Previous studies suggest that WNV and SLEV differ in capacity for both genetic change and host specialization, and in the costs each accrues from specializing. In an attempt to clarify how selective pressures contribute to epidemiological patterns of WNV and SLEV, we evaluated mutant spectra size, consensus genetic change, and phenotypic changes for SLEV in vivo following 20 sequential passages via inoculation in either Culex pipiens mosquitoes or chickens. Results demonstrate that the capacity for genetic change is large for SLEV and that the size of the mutant spectrum is host-dependent using our passage methodology. Despite this, a general lack of consensus change resulted from passage in either host, a result that contrasts with the idea that constraints on evolution in nature result from host cycling alone. Results also suggest that a high level of adaptation to both hosts already exists, despite host cycling. A strain significantly more infectious in chickens did emerge from one lineage of chicken passage, yet other lineages and all mosquito passage strains did not display measurable host-specific fitness gains. In addition, increased infectivity in chickens did not decrease infectivity in mosquitoes, which further contrasts the concept of fitness trade-offs for arboviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2135021997,"Evidence from field studies suggests that Culex pipiens, the primary mosquito vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the northeastern and north central United States, feeds preferentially on American robins (Turdus migratorius). To determine the contribution of innate preferences to observed preference patterns in the field, we conducted host preference trials with a known number of adult female C. pipiens in outdoor cages comparing the relative attractiveness of American robins with two common sympatric bird species, European starling, Sternus vulgaris and house sparrow, Passer domesticus. Host seeking C. pipiens were three times more likely to enter robin-baited traps when with the alternate host was a European starling (n = 4 trials; OR = 3.06; CI [1.42-6.46]) and almost twice more likely when the alternative was a house sparrow (n = 8 trials; OR = 1.80; CI = [1.22-2.90]). There was no difference in the probability of trap entry when two robins were offered (n = 8 trials). Logistic regression analysis determined that the age, sex and weight of the birds, the date of the trial, starting-time, temperature, humidity, wind-speed and age of the mosquitoes had no effect on the probability of a choosing a robin over an alternate bird. Findings indicate that preferential feeding by C. pipiens mosquitoes on certain avian hosts is likely to be inherent, and we discuss the implications innate host preferences may have on enzootic WNV transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2020113425,"Transcription activation has been proposed to require both ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of histone H2B. Here, we show that Lge1 (Large 1) is found in a complex containing Rad6.Bre1 and that it controls the recruitment of Bre1, a ubiquitin ligase, and Ubp8, a deubiquitylase, to promote ubiquitylation during the early steps in elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Lge1 associates with promoter and coding regions of actively transcribed genes in a transcription-dependent manner. Disruption of Lge1 abolished ubiquitylation of histone H2B on lysine 123 and H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 and resulted in significant sensitivity to 6-azauracil and mycophenolic acid. In particular, in Lge1-deficient cells, Bre1 recruitment was attenuated, whereas recruitment of Ubp8 was facilitated. These alterations were coincident with changes in the interaction between Bre1.Ubp8 and RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 of the C-terminal domain. We propose that Lge1 has a novel function in disrupting the balance between the recruitment of Bre1 and Ubp8, thus promoting transcription elongation."
https://openalex.org/W2046587261,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase (pol gamma) cause several progressive human diseases including Parkinson's disease, Alper's syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia. At the cellular level, disruption of pol gamma leads to depletion of mtDNA, disrupts the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and increases susceptibility to oxidative stress. Although recent studies have intensified focus on the role of mtDNA in neuronal diseases, the changes that take place in mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial axonal transport when mtDNA replication is disrupted are unknown. Using high-speed confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, we report that mutations in pol gamma deplete mtDNA levels and lead to an increase in mitochondrial density in Drosophila proximal nerves and muscles, without a noticeable increase in mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, there is a rise in flux of bidirectional mitochondrial axonal transport, albeit with slower kinesin-based anterograde transport. In contrast, flux of synaptic vesicle precursors was modestly decreased in pol gamma-alpha mutants. Our data indicate that disruption of mtDNA replication does not hinder mitochondrial biogenesis, increases mitochondrial axonal transport, and raises the question of whether high levels of circulating mtDNA-deficient mitochondria are beneficial or deleterious in mtDNA diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2052000501,"Hematophagy poses a challenge to blood-feeding organisms since products of blood digestion can exert cellular deleterious effects. Mitochondria perform multiple roles in cell biology acting as the site of aerobic energy-transducing pathways, and also an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), modulating redox metabolism. Therefore, regulation of mitochondrial function should be relevant for hematophagous arthropods. Here, we investigated the effects of blood-feeding on flight muscle (FM) mitochondria from the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a vector of dengue and yellow fever.Blood-feeding caused a reversible reduction in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, an event that was parallel to blood digestion. These changes were most intense at 24 h after blood meal (ABM), the peak of blood digestion, when oxygen consumption was inhibited by 68%. Cytochromes c and a+a(3) levels and cytochrome c oxidase activity of the electron transport chain were all reduced at 24 h ABM. Ultrastructural and molecular analyses of FM revealed that mitochondria fuse upon blood meal, a condition related to reduced ROS generation. Consistently, BF induced a reversible decrease in mitochondrial H(2)O(2) formation during blood digestion, reaching their lowest values at 24 h ABM where a reduction of 51% was observed.Blood-feeding triggers functional and structural changes in hematophagous insect mitochondria, which may represent an important adaptation to blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W2053106533,"Despite a wealth of evidence demonstrating extraordinary maximal performance, little is known about the routine flight performance of insects. We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1.6 m1.6 m1.6 m) corner-cube reflector using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3-dimensional trajectories without the need for synchronisation hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3-dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1.2 ms−1 and 2.3 ms−1, with a maximum of 2.5 ms−1. Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (−2.4 ms−1) almost double the maximum climb rate (1.2 ms−1). Modal turn rate was around 240°s−1, with maximal rates in excess of 1700°s−1. We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum tangential accelerations and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g."

They have a unique appearance characterized by abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nucleus. Their pathogenesis has remained, thus far, unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Using transgenic mice chronically expressing IFNγ in thyroid gland, we showed changes in the thyroid follicular epithelium reminiscent of the human oncocyte. Transcriptome analysis comparing transgenic to wild type thyrocytes revealed increased levels of immunoproteasome subunits like LMP2 in transgenics, suggesting an important role of the immunoproteasome in oncocyte pathogenesis. Pharmacologic blockade of the proteasome, in fact, ameliorated the oncocytic phenotype. Genetic deletion of LMP2 subunit prevented the development of the oncocytic phenotype and primary hypothyroidism. LMP2 was also found expressed in oncocytes from patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and Hürthle cell tumors. Conclusions/Significance In summary, we report that oncocytes are the result of an increased immunoproteasome expression secondary to a chronic inflammatory milieu, and suggest LMP2 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of oncocytic lesions and autoimmune hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W2003897790,"Available data suggest that the Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV) IE4 protein acts as an important regulator on VZV and cellular genes expression and could exert its functions at post-transcriptional level. However, the molecular mechanisms supported by this protein are not yet fully characterized. In the present study, we have attempted to clarify this IE4-mediated gene regulation and identify some cellular partners of IE4. By yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that IE4 interacts with three shuttling SR proteins, namely ASF/SF2, 9G8 and SRp20. We positioned the binding domain in the IE4 RbRc region and we showed that these interactions are not bridged by RNA. We demonstrated also that IE4 strongly interacts with the main SR protein kinase, SRPK1, and is phosphorylated in in vitro kinase assay on residue Ser-136 contained in the Rb domain. By Northwestern analysis, we showed that IE4 is able to bind RNA through its arginine-rich region and in immunoprecipitation experiments the presence of RNA stabilizes complexes containing IE4 and the cellular export factors TAP/NXF1 and Aly/REF since the interactions are RNase-sensitive. Finally, we determined that IE4 influences the export of reporter mRNAs and clearly showed, by TAP/NXF1 knockdown, that VZV infection requires the TAP/NXF1 export pathway to express some viral transcripts. We thus highlighted a new example of viral mRNA export factor and proposed a model of IE4-mediated viral mRNAs export."

Hacs1(-/-) mice were viable and fertile and had normal bone marrow B-cell development and normal splenic T- and B-cell populations. However, adult Hacs1(-/-) mice had increased peritoneal B1a cells (IgM(+)CD5(+)). On immunization with T-cell-independent antigen TNP-Ficoll, Hacs1(-/-) mice had increased production of anti-TNP IgM and IgG3. Purified splenic B cells from Hacs1(-/-) mice showed increased cell proliferation on BCR (B-cell receptor) stimulation. We further demonstrate that the Hacs1(-/-) B cells had increased global tyrosine phosphorylation, including tyrosine kinases Lyn and Akt. Both T-helper type 1 (T(h)1) and T-helper type 2 (T(h)2) humoral responses were enhanced in Hacs1(-/-) mice.

Microglia and DCs are major APCs in physiological and pathological conditions, respectively. In this work, primary microglia and microglia-like cells obtained by co-culturing mature dendritic cells with CNS endothelial cells in vitro were functional evaluated. We found that microglia not only cannot prime CD4 T cells but also inhibit mature DCs (maDCs) initiated CD4 T cells proliferation. More importantly, endothelia from the CNS can differentiate maDCs into microglia-like cells (MLCs), which possess similar phenotype and immune inhibitory function as microglia. Soluble factors including NO lie behind the suppression of CD4 T cell proliferation induced by both microglia and MLCs. All the data indicate that under physiological conditions, microglia play important roles in maintaining immune homeostasis of the CNS, whereas in a pathological situation, the infiltrated DCs can be educated by the local microenvironment and differentiate into MLCs with inhibitory function."
https://openalex.org/W2165354317,"Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and the proposed causative agent of localized aggressive periodontitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans is found exclusively in the mammalian oral cavity in the space between the gums and the teeth known as the gingival crevice. Many bacterial species reside in this environment where competition for carbon is high. A. actinomycetemcomitans utilizes a unique carbon resource partitioning system whereby the presence of L-lactate inhibits uptake of glucose, thus allowing preferential catabolism of L-lactate. Although the mechanism for this process is not fully elucidated, we previously demonstrated that high levels of intracellular pyruvate are critical for L-lactate preference. As the first step in L-lactate catabolism is conversion of L-lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase, we proposed a model in which the A. actinomycetemcomitans L-lactate dehydrogenase, unlike homologous enzymes, is not feedback inhibited by pyruvate. This lack of feedback inhibition allows intracellular pyruvate to rise to levels sufficient to inhibit glucose uptake in other bacteria. In the present study, the A. actinomycetemcomitans L-lactate dehydrogenase was purified and shown to convert L-lactate, but not D-lactate, to pyruvate with a Km of approximately 150 µM. Inhibition studies reveal that pyruvate is a poor inhibitor of L-lactate dehydrogenase activity, providing mechanistic insight into L-lactate preference in A. actinomycetemcomitans."

It is known that antigen-specific Treg are more potent than polyclonal Treg in suppressing pathogenic immune responses that cause autoimmunity and inflammation. However, difficulty in identifying and isolating a sufficient number of antigen-specific Treg has limited their use in research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their regulatory function and their potential role in therapy.Using a novel class II MHC tetramer, we have isolated a population of CD4(+) Foxp3(-) T cells specific for the autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase p286-300 peptide (NR286 T cells) from diabetes-resistant non-obese resistant (NOR) mice. These Foxp3(-) NR286 T cells functioned as Treg that were able to suppress target T cell proliferation in vitro and inhibit type 1 diabetes in animals. Unexpected results from mechanistic studies in vitro showed that their regulatory function was dependent on not only IFN-gamma and nitric oxide, but also on cell contact with target cells. In addition, separating NR286 Treg from target T cells in transwell assays abolished both production of NO and suppression of target T cells, regardless of whether IFN-gamma was produced in cell cultures. Therefore, production of NO, not IFN-gamma, was cell contact dependent, suggesting that NO may function downstream of IFN-gamma in mediating regulatory function of NR286 Treg.These studies identified a unique population of autoantigen-specific Foxp3(-) Treg that can exert their regulatory function dependent on not only IFN-gamma and NO but also cell contact with target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990607418,"Background Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are important tools widely used for genotyping and copy number estimation. This technology utilizes the specific affinity of fragmented DNA for binding to surface-attached oligonucleotide DNA probes. We analyze the variability of the probe signals of Affymetrix GeneChip SNP arrays as a function of the probe sequence to identify relevant sequence motifs which potentially cause systematic biases of genotyping and copy number estimates. Methodology/Principal Findings The probe design of GeneChip SNP arrays enables us to disentangle different sources of intensity modulations such as the number of mismatches per duplex, matched and mismatched base pairings including nearest and next-nearest neighbors and their position along the probe sequence. The effect of probe sequence was estimated in terms of triple-motifs with central matches and mismatches which include all 256 combinations of possible base pairings. The probe/target interactions on the chip can be decomposed into nearest neighbor contributions which correlate well with free energy terms of DNA/DNA-interactions in solution. The effect of mismatches is about twice as large as that of canonical pairings. Runs of guanines (G) and the particular type of mismatched pairings formed in cross-allelic probe/target duplexes constitute sources of systematic biases of the probe signals with consequences for genotyping and copy number estimates. The poly-G effect seems to be related to the crowded arrangement of probes which facilitates complex formation of neighboring probes with at minimum three adjacent G's in their sequence. Conclusions The applied method of “triple-averaging” represents a model-free approach to estimate the mean intensity contributions of different sequence motifs which can be applied in calibration algorithms to correct signal values for sequence effects. Rules for appropriate sequence corrections are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2043791053,"It is known that HIV-1 protease is an important target for design of antiviral compounds in the treatment of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In this context, understanding the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is of crucial importance as transition state structure directs inhibitor design. Most mechanistic proposals invoke nucleophilic attack on the scissile peptide bond by a water molecule. But such a water molecule coexisting with any ligand in the active site has not been found so far in the crystal structures.We report here the first observation of the coexistence in the active site, of a water molecule WAT1, along with the carboxyl terminal product (Q product) peptide. The product peptide has been generated in situ through cleavage of the full-length substrate. The N-terminal product (P product) has diffused out and is replaced by a set of water molecules while the Q product is still held in the active site through hydrogen bonds. The position of WAT1, which hydrogen bonds to both the catalytic aspartates, is different from when there is no substrate bound in the active site. We propose WAT1 to be the position from where catalytic water attacks the scissile peptide bond. Comparison of structures of HIV-1 protease complexed with the same oligopeptide substrate, but at pH 2.0 and at pH 7.0 shows interesting changes in the conformation and hydrogen bonding interactions from the catalytic aspartates.The structure is suggestive of the repositioning, during substrate binding, of the catalytic water for activation and subsequent nucleophilic attack. The structure could be a snap shot of the enzyme active site primed for the next round of catalysis. This structure further suggests that to achieve the goal of designing inhibitors mimicking the transition-state, the hydrogen-bonding pattern between WAT1 and the enzyme should be replicated."

In particular, we tested how monkeys value these vocalizations relative to the opportunity to get a juice reward. To test this hypothesis, monkeys chose one of two targets to get a varying juice reward; at one of those targets, in addition to the juice reward, a vocalization was presented. By titrating the juice amounts at the two targets, we quantified the relationship between the monkeys' juice choices relative to the opportunity to listen to a vocalization.

Generally, condition screening is performed in 96-well plates. While previous studies have examined the effects of protein construct, protein purity, or crystallisation condition ingredients on protein crystallisation, few have examined the effect of the crystallisation plate. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed a statistically rigorous examination of protein crystallisation, and evaluated interactions between crystallisation success and plate row/column, different plates of same make, different plate makes and different proteins. From our analysis of protein crystallisation, we found a significant interaction between plate make and the specific protein being crystallised. Conclusions/Significance Protein crystal structure determination is the principal method for determining protein structure but is limited by the need to produce crystals of the protein under study. Many important proteins are difficult to crystallise, so that identification of factors that assist crystallisation could open up the structure determination of these more challenging targets. Our findings suggest that protein crystallisation success may be improved by matching a protein with its optimal plate make."
