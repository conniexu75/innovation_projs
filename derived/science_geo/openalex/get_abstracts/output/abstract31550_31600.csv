https://openalex.org/W2001105552,"A possible direct effect of guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins on calcium channels was examined in membrane patches excised from guinea pig cardiac myocytes and bovine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. The guanosine triphosphate analog, GTP gamma S, prolonged the survival of excised calcium channels independently of the presence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), adenosine triphosphate, cAMP-activated protein kinase, and the protein kinase C activator tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. A specific G protein, activated Gs, or its alpha subunit, purified from the plasma membranes of human erythrocytes, prolonged the survival of excised channels and stimulated the activity of incorporated channels. Thus, in addition to regulating calcium channels indirectly through activation of cytoplasmic kinases, G proteins can regulate calcium channels directly. Since they also directly regulate a subset of potassium channels, G proteins are now known to directly gate two classes of membrane ion channels."

Three-year-old children who observed an object being hidden in a model knew where to find an analogous object hidden in the corresponding location in a room, but 2.5-year-old children did not. The success of the group of older children reveals an advance in their cognitive flexibility: they think of a model in two ways at the same time--both as the thing itself and as a symbol for something else."

https://openalex.org/W1740533879,"The ryanodine receptor of rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as a single approximately 450,000-Da polypeptide and it was shown to mediate single channel activity identical to that of the ryanodine-treated Ca2+ release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The purified receptor had a [3H]ryanodine binding capacity (Bmax) of 280 pmol/mg and a binding affinity (Kd) of 9.0 nM. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the purified receptor was stimulated by ATP and Ca2+ with a half-maximal stimulation at 1 mM and 8-9 microM, respectively. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the purified receptor was inhibited by ruthenium red and high concentrations of Ca2+ with an IC50 of 2.5 microM and greater than 1 mM, respectively. Reconstitution of the purified receptor in planar lipid bilayers revealed the Ca2+ channel activity of the purified receptor. Like the native sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels treated with ryanodine, the purified receptor channels were characterized by (i) the predominance of long open states insensitive to Mg2+ and ruthenium red, (ii) a main slope conductance of approximately 35 pS and a less frequent 22 pS substate in 54 mM trans-Ca2+ or Ba2+, and (iii) a permeability ratio PBa or PCa/PTris = 8.7. The approximately 450,000-Da ryanodine receptor channel thus represents the long-term open ryanodine-altered state of the Ca2+ release channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum. We propose that the ryanodine receptor constitutes the physical pore that mediates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1558512036,"Sulfonylureas are powerful hypoglycemic drugs that have been used for decades to treat diabetic patients. This paper describes a 86Rb+ flux technique that permits one to study easily the properties of ATP-modulated K+ channels in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Sulfonylureas inhibit this type of K+ channel under conditions of intracellular ATP depletion. The most potent sulfonylureas (glibenclamide, glipizide, and gliquidone) are acting in the nanomolar range of concentration. Inhibition of the single ATP-modulated K+ channels by low concentrations of sulfonylureas was also observed using the patch-clamp technique. The sulfonylurea receptor has been biochemically identified with [3H]glibenclamide. For 10 different sulfonylureas (or sulfonylurea analogs) there was an excellent correlation between efficacy of blockade of ATP-modulated K+ channels and efficacy of binding to the sulfonylurea receptors using the 3H-ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2090803944,"The mechanism that links membrane potential changes to the release of calcium from internal stores to cause contraction of cardiac cells is unclear. By using the calcium indicator fura-2 under voltage-clamp conditions, changes in intracellular calcium could be monitored in single rat ventricular cells while controlling membrane potential. The voltage dependence of the depolarization-induced increase in intracellular calcium was not the same as that of the calcium current (Isi), which suggests that only a small fraction of Isi is required to trigger calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release may be partly regulated by membrane potential, since repolarization could terminate the rise in intracellular calcium. Thus, changes in the action potential will have immediate effects on the time course of the calcium transient beyond those associated with its effects on Isi."

https://openalex.org/W1508596465,"The administration of high levels of estrogen is a well established method for producing prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors in rodents but the mechanism of tumor induction is not clear. In this paper we describe a cDNA clone (pEIC) which has been isolated from an estrogen-induced pituitary tumor cDNA library. The mRNA transcript corresponding to the pEIC clone is 0.9 kilobase in length and is not detectable in normal pituitaries but is expressed as early as 3 h after estrogen stimulation. Nucleotide sequence analysis of two 700-base pair recombinant clones shows that they encode a 124-amino acid protein which is 70% identical to the porcine galanin precursor. The sequence of 29 amino acid residues coded for by the pEIC cDNA clone is 88% identical with porcine galanin with only three amino acid substitutions near the C terminus. This extensive homology suggests that the pEIC cDNA clone codes for rat galanin or a protein belonging to the galanin gene family. These results provide the first evidence of a physiological regulator (estrogen) of the expression of the galanin gene. They also imply that galanin is secreted by prolactin-secreting tumors. Because intracerebroventricular injection of galanin can stimulate prolactin secretion and galanin inhibits hypothalamic dopamine release, it is conceivable that galanin may play a role in the induction of prolactin-secreting tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1544673104,"The mechanism of cellular uptake of cadmium, a highly toxic metal ion, is not known. We have studied cadmium uptake and toxicity in an established secretory cell line, GH4C1, which has well characterized calcium channels. Nimodipine, an antagonist of voltage-sensitive calcium channels, protected cells against cadmium toxicity by increasing the LD50 for CdCl2 from 15 to 45 microM, whereas the calcium channel agonist BAY K8644 decreased the LD50. Organic calcium channel blockers of three classes protected cells from cadmium toxicity at concentrations previously shown to block high K+-induced 45Ca2+ influx and secretion. Half-maximal protective effects were obtained at 20 nM nifedipine, 4 microM verapamil, and 7 microM diltiazem. Increasing the extracellular calcium concentration from 20 microM to 10 mM also protected cells from cadmium by causing a 5-fold increase in the LD50 for CdCl2. Neither the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine nor the agonist BAY K8644 altered intracellular metallothionein concentrations, while cadmium caused a 9-20-fold increase in metallothionein over 18 h. Cadmium was a potent blocker of depolarization-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake (IC50 = 4 microM), and the net uptake of cadmium measured with 109Cd2+ was less than 0.3% that of calcium. Although the rate of cadmium uptake was low relative to that of calcium, entry via voltage-sensitive calcium channels appeared to account for a significant portion of cadmium uptake; 109Cd2+ uptake at 30 min was increased 57% by high K+/BAY K8644, which facilitates entry through channels. Furthermore, calcium channel blockade with 100 nM nimodipine decreased total cell 109Cd2+ accumulation after 24 h by 63%. These data indicate that flux of cadmium through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-sensitive calcium channels is a major mechanism for cadmium uptake by GH4C1 cells, and that pharmacologic blockade of calcium channels can afford dramatic protection against cadmium toxicity."

The last 37 amino acids of membrane DAF, when fused to the carboxyl terminus of a secreted protein, are sufficient to target the fusion protein to the plasma membrane by means of a glycophospholipid anchor. This approach provides a novel means of targeting proteins to the cell-surface membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1629394358,"The structural genes (PEM1 and PEM2) encoding the enzymes involved in the yeast phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation pathway were cloned by means of genetic complementation using yeast mutants. The cloned genes were expressed in a yeast mutant that was completely deficient in the PE methylation pathway. The membrane fraction obtained from the transformants carrying PEM1 only catalyzed the conversion of PE to phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine (PMME), the first step of the methylation pathway. Therefore, the enzyme encoded by PEM1 was designated as PE methyltransferase. In contrast, the membrane fraction from the transformants carrying PEM2 catalyzed the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from PE, indicating that it contains all of the three methylation activities. PMME and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine were found to be utilized more preferentially than PE. Because of its rather broad substrate specificity, the enzyme encoded by PEM2 is designated as phospholipid methyltransferase. The results of phospholipid composition analysis showed that the PEM1 transformant accumulated PMME whereas the PEM2 transformant contained a decreased amount of PC. Both genes were required for maintenance of the PC content of the yeast at a normal level. The results of nucleotide sequence analysis demonstrated that the coding frames of the PEM1 and PEM2 genes were capable of encoding 869- and 206-amino acid residues with calculated molecular weights of 101,202 and 23,150, respectively. The sizes of the PEM1 and PEM2 transcripts detected in the exponentially growing wild-type yeast were consistent with those of the deduced translation products. PE methyltransferase exhibits internal sequence homology as well as homology with phospholipid methyltransferase, suggesting that these two methyltransferase genes evolved through gene duplication. Furthermore, there was significant sequence homology between PE methyltransferase and bovine phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and between phospholipid methyltransferase and Escherichia coli S-adenosylmethionine-6-N',N'-adenosyl (rRNA) dimethyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W2074736235,"Inoculation of newborn mice with the murine polyoma (Py) virus leads to tumor formation in a wide range of tissues. In order to investigate viral oncogenesis, we generated transgenic mice carrying either the Py large T antigen (LT) gene or the Py middle T antigen (MT) gene linked to Py early region regulatory sequences. While Py LT mice exhibit no phenotype, Py MT mice develop multifocal tumors of the vascular endothelium. These hemangiomas are lethal to the animals and can be passaged in vivo. Transgene RNAs and protein are present in both hemangiomas and the testes of these mice, and the Py middle T protein in both tissues is complexed to a cellular tyrosine kinase. The expression of complexed middle T protein in both tumorigenic endothelial cells and unperturbed testes implies that endothelial cells may be particularly susceptible to the action of the middle T oncogene. These observations indicate that Py middle T disrupts the normal strict controls on vascular growth, and suggest that Py MT transgenic mice will provide a model for studying the control of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2072973625,"The N gene transcriptional antitermination protein of bacteriophage lambda is incorporated in vitro into transcriptional elongation complexes containing the E. coli proteins NusA and NusB. The binding of NusA to elongating RNA polymerase is sequence-independent and follows the release of sigma 70. Incorporation of N into the elongation complex requires an N utilization site (nut site) on the DNA template. Incorporation of NusB into the complex requires NusA, ribosomal protein S10, and the boxA component of the nut site. T1 RNAase releases N, but not NusB, from the elongation complex. We therefore propose that an N-modified termination-resistant elongation complex includes an elongation control particle (ECP) containing at least NusA, NusB, S10, N, and an RNA transcript of the nut site."
https://openalex.org/W56723346,"Examination by gel filtration, thin layer and anion exchange chromatography of the O-linked carbohydrate units released from fetuin by alkaline borohydride treatment indicated the presence in this glycoprotein of an acidic glucosamine-containing hexasaccharide in addition to the previously described tetra- and trisaccharides. The structure of the hexasaccharide was determined to be NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3[NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlNAc beta 1----6]GalNAc, on the basis of exoglycosidase digestion, periodate oxidation, and methylation analysis as well as hydrazine-nitrous acid fragmentation. The latter procedure when carried out on the reduced asialohexasaccharide yielded Gal----2-deoxygalactitol and Gal----anhydromannose which were shown to be derived, respectively, from Gal----N-acetylgalactosaminitol and Gal----GlcNAc sequences. Reductive amination of the Gal----anhydromannose disaccharide with [14C] methylamine permitted identification of its linkage as 1----4. While Diplococcus pneumoniae endo-alpha-DN-acetylgalactosaminidase acting on asialofetuin released the sialic acid-free tetra- and trisaccharides (Gal beta 1----3GalNAc), this enzyme did not cleave the peptide attachment of the asialohexasaccharide (Gal beta 1----3 [Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6] GalNAc). The number of O-linked hexa-, tetra-, and trisaccharides per fetuin molecule was determined to be 0.2, 0.7, and 2.1, respectively, on the basis of galactosaminitol analyses. The absence of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine-containing tetra- or pentasaccharides in fetuin suggest that the attachment of this sugar is a rate-limiting step; furthermore, the limited occurrence of the hexasaccharide may indicate that the addition of sialic acid to Gal beta 1----3GalNAc to form the NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal linkage precludes action of the GlcNAc transferase to form the branch point on the GalNAc residue."
https://openalex.org/W1991112573,"A transcript (RNA II) of plasmid ColE1 that hybridizes with the template DNA is cleaved by RNAase H and used as a primer by DNA polymerase I. However, the plasmid can replicate in bacteria lacking both enzymes, apparently using a different mechanism of initiation of replication. Here we report in vivo and in vitro studies on initiation of DNA replication in the presence or absence of either or both enzymes. Hybridization of RNA II with the template DNA is always required for initiation. Hybridized RNA II is cleaved by RNAase H to form a primer or used as a primer without cleavage by RNAase H. Hybridization also creates a single-stranded region on the nontranscribed strand that can serve as a template for synthesis of the lagging strand in a reaction that does not require DNA polymerase I. Lagging strand synthesis terminates 17 nucleotides upstream of the normal replication origin, forcing unidirectional replication."

https://openalex.org/W1596739803,"Regulation of the expression of vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein (Mr 9000 CaBP) gene by 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-(OH)2D3) was studied in the rat duodenum. In vivo stimulation of Mr 9000 CaBP synthesis was analyzed using a complementary DNA probe and by measuring the rate of Mr 9000 CaBP gene transcription in isolated nuclei (run-on assay). A single 1,25-(OH)2D3 injection (650 pmol/100 g of body weight) induced a 2-fold increase in Mr 9000 CaBP gene transcription within 15 min in the duodenum of vitamin D-deficient rats. RNA synthesis was maximal at 1 h, then decreased until 16 h of postinjection. There was an initial transient accumulation of Mr 9000 CaBP mRNA (from 7 to 15 min), which was followed by a second, significant increase, by 3 h which remained elevated until 16 h. The magnitude and time course of the Mr 9000 CaBP increase was similar to that of its mRNA as early as 1 h after 1,25-(OH)2D3 administration. Mr 9000 CaBP gene transcription was not significantly induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 in vitamin D-replete rats and no transient accumulation of Mr 9000 CaBP mRNA was observed. Thus, 1,25-(OH)2D3 modulates Mr 9000 CaBP gene expression in at least two ways, a rapid transcriptional stimulation and a post-transcriptional effect preventing degradation of Mr 9000 CaBP transcripts and accounting for their accumulation several hours after the hormone treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1527773184,"Two newly described surfactant proteolipids (SPL), Phe and pVal, are produced by proteolytic processing of distinct precursors of Mr = 40,000 and 22,000, respectively. These proteins are structurally related and intimately associated with surfactant phospholipids. We now demonstrate the expression of both SPL(Phe) and SPL(pVal) in explants of human fetal lung from 16-24 weeks of gestation. Content, synthesis, and mRNA for the proteolipids were low prior to organ culture of fetal lung. Induction of synthesis of the proteolipids occurred rapidly in explant culture in the absence of exogenous hormones and was enhanced by addition of dexamethasone. Increased synthesis of the proteolipids was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by [35S]methionine incorporation into the glycosylated Mr = 40,000-43,000 SPL (Phe) precursor. The response to dexamethasone occurred rapidly and contrasted with effects of dexamethasone on the expression of surfactant-associated protein- (SAP) 35, a distinct surfactant glycoprotein. 8-Br-cAMP did not significantly increase proteolipid content but markedly increased synthesis of SAP-35 in identical cultures. Increased proteolipid content was associated with increased mRNA for each protein as determined by the Northern blot analysis. Proteolipid RNA was also increased by 8-Br-cAMP, however, not to the extent observed with the glucocorticoid. Immunohistochemical analysis of fetal lung with anti-proteolipid antiserum confirmed that the dexamethasone-enhanced synthesis of the proteins by Type II epithelial cells. The time and hormone dependence of the regulation of expression of both SPL(Phe) and SPL(pVal) precursors were distinct from that of SAP-35. Expression of the surfactant proteolipids increased during explant culture of human fetal lung and was further enhanced by glucocorticoid. Developmental and hormonal regulation of the surfactant proteolipids may be important factors in surfactant function at birth."
https://openalex.org/W1550946273,"Abstract The effects of protein kinase C stimulation on free cytosolic Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i) were studied in Fura 2-loaded UMR-106 cells. Stimulation of the protein kinase C with the tumor-promoting phorbol esters 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and phorbol 12,13-diacetate or 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol was followed by an increase in [Ca2+]i. The protein kinase C-induced increase in [Ca2+]i has a lag period, the duration of which was dependent on the stimulant and medium Ca2+ concentrations. With 2 microM TPA, the rise in [Ca2+]i peaked within 1.5 min, after which [Ca2+]i returned partially toward base line. The increase in [Ca2+]i was absolutely dependent on the presence of medium Ca2+ and was inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blockers nicardipine and verapamil. Cell stimulation also results in Ca2+ release from intracellular pool(s) which appears to be mediated by a Ca2+-dependent Ca2+ release mechanism. The reduction in [Ca2+]i was due to channel inactivation. Pretreatment of the cells with 1 nM TPA, 2 units/ml parathyroid hormone (PTH), or 15 microM forskolin blocked the effect of 2 microM TPA on [Ca2+]i. TPA and PTH were more potent inhibitors than was forskolin. The properties of this channel are compared to the cAMP-independent PTH-stimulated Ca2+ channel present in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W112671606,"The respiratory deficiency of two noncomplementing mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (C41 and N28) has been shown to be due to mutations in HEM2, the structural gene for delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. The mutants are unable to convert delta-aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen and are not complemented by the hem2 mutant GL4 (Gollub, E. G., Liu, K.-P., Dagan, J., Adlersberg, M., and Sprinson, D. B. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2846-2854). A gene capable of complementing the respiratory deficiency of C41 and N28 has been cloned by transformation of a hem2 mutant with a recombinant plasmid library of wild type yeast nuclear DNA. The sequence of the protein encoded by the cloned gene exhibits extensive homology to the recently reported sequence of human delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (Wetmur, J. G., Bishop, D. F., Cantelmo, C., and Desnick, R. J. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 7703-7707). Several approaches were taken to study the effect of heme on transcription of PET genes known to code for subunit components of respiratory enzymes and of mitochondrial ATPase. The first involved measurements of the steady state levels of mRNAs for subunit 5 of cytochrome oxidase and the beta subunit of F1 ATPase in wild type and in a hem2 mutant. Secondly, transcription of the genes coding for the cytochrome oxidase and ATPase subunits as well as of the COR1 gene coding for the 44-kDa core 1 subunit of coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase was quantitated by fusing the 5′-flanking and part of the coding region of each gene to the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli in vectors capable of integrating into yeast chromosomal DNA. The different lacZ fusions were integrated into nuclear DNA of a wild type strain and of hem2 mutants allowing expression of beta-galactosidase to be studied as a function of intracellular heme. These experiments indicate that the promoters of the genes for subunits of the respiratory complexes are regulated by heme. In contrast, the expression of the ATPase subunit appears to be heme-independent. Because neither subunit 5 of cytochrome oxidase nor the core 1 subunit of coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase are hemoproteins, transcriptional regulation by heme may be a general mechanism for controlling the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins involved in respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1537877734,"It is now well established that incubation of mitochondria at pH 8 or higher opens up an electrophoretic anion transport pathway in the inner membrane. It is not known, however, whether this transport process has any physiological relevance. In this communication we demonstrate that anion uniport can take place at physiological pH if the mitochondria are depleted of matrix divalent cations with A23187 and EDTA. Using the light-scattering technique we have quantitated the rates of uniport of a wide variety of anions. Inorganic anions such as Cl-, SO4(2-), and Fe(CN)6(4-) as well as physiologically important anions such as HCO3-, Pi-, citrate, and malate are transported. Some anions, however, such as gluconate and glucuronate do not appear to be transported. On the basis of the finding that the rate of anion uniport assayed in ammonium salts exhibits a dramatic decline associated with loss of matrix K+ via K+/H+ antiport, we suggest that anion uniport is inhibited by matrix protons. Direct inhibition of anion uniport by protons in divalent cation-depleted mitochondria is demonstrated, and the apparent pK of the binding site is shown to be about 7.8. From these properties we tentatively conclude that anion uniport induced by divalent cation depletion and that induced by elevated pH are catalyzed by the same transport pathway, which is regulated by both matrix H+ and Mg2+."

The 20th rG residue is linked to the 5' end of msDNA, consisting of 162 bases, by a 2', 5' phosphodiester linkage. The msdRNA coding region is located on the chromosome in the opposite orientation to the msDNA coding region, with the 3' ends overlapping by eight bases. S1 nuclease mapping experiments indicate that the primary product of msdRNA is much longer at both the 5' and 3' ends (approximately 375 bases). Because of homologous sequences upstream of the msdRNA and msDNA coding regions, the precursor RNA molecule is considered to form an extremely stable stem-and-loop structure (delta G = -210 kcal). We propose a novel mechanism of DNA synthesis in which the stem-and-loop structure serves as a primer as well as a template to form the branched RNA-linked msDNA."

https://openalex.org/W1602405601,"S protein, a major inhibitor of the assembly of the membrane attack complex of complement, has recently been shown to be identical to the serum spreading factor vitronectin. It also neutralizes the anticoagulant activities of heparin. We have studied the structural requirements for the heparin neutralizing properties of S protein/vitronectin using heparin, heparan sulfate, and heparin oligosaccharides with well defined anticoagulant specificities. The abilities of heparin fractions, Mr 7,800-18,800, with high affinity for antithrombin, and of the International Heparin Standard, to accelerate the inactivation of thrombin and Factor Xa by antithrombin were readily neutralized by S protein/vitronectin. Binding and neutralization of heparin by S protein/vitronectin was inhibited by heparin with low affinity for antithrombin, indicating that S protein/vitronectin can interact with a region on the heparin chain that might serve as a proteinase binding site. S protein/vitronectin efficiently neutralized oligosaccharides of Mr 2,400-7,200, unlike the two other physiologically occurring heparin neutralizing proteins histidine-rich glycoprotein and platelet factor 4. Furthermore, S protein/vitronectin neutralized the anti-Factor Xa activity of a synthetic pentasaccharide comprising the antithrombin-binding sequence of heparin. High molar excess of a synthetic tridecapeptide corresponding to part (amino acids 374-359) of the proposed glycosaminoglycan binding domain of S protein/vitronectin neutralized high affinity heparin and some oligosaccharides, but failed to neutralize the synthetic antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide. Like platelet factor 4, but unlike histidine-rich glycoprotein, S protein/vitronectin readily neutralized the anticoagulant activities of heparan sulfate of Mr approximately 20,000. These findings suggest that S protein/vitronectin may interact through its glycosaminoglycan binding domain(s) with various functional domains of the heparin (heparan sulfate) molecule, including the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence. Furthermore, the results suggest that S protein/vitronectin may be a physiologically important modulator of the anticoagulant activity of heparin-like material on or near the vascular endothelium."

https://openalex.org/W1562735619,"To determine the mechanism(s) responsible for glucocorticoid-induced increases in amylase content in pancreatic acinar AR42J cells, we examined the effects of dexamethasone on amylase protein biosynthesis, steady-state mRNA levels, and gene transcription. Dexamethasone treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in amylase synthesis which was one-half maximal at 2 nM and maximal at 100 nM where a 6-fold increase was achieved. This dexamethasone-induced increase in amylase synthesis was detectable after 12 h, one-half maximal after 19 h, and approached maximal after 72 h. Dexamethasone treatment also increased amylase mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in parallel with the changes in amylase synthesis. Nuclear RNA transcript elongation (run-on) assays indicated that amylase gene transcription was also increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Glucocorticoid enhancement of amylase gene transcription occurred relatively slowly, with a 6-fold increase occurring after 48 h of treatment with 100 nM dexamethasone. Thus, the effects of glucocorticoids on pancreatic amylase gene transcription fully accounted for the increased levels of amylase mRNA, synthesis, and content. However, due to the slow time course of dexamethasone induction of amylase gene expression we evaluated the possibility of glucocorticoid induction of a regulatory protein. We found that inclusion of cycloheximide or puromycin during dexamethasone treatment blocked the induction of amylase mRNA. These data suggest that the glucocorticoid-induced increase in amylase gene transcription requires induction of an unidentified regulatory protein(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2021937457,"The primer transcript of plasmid ColE1 extends beyond the replication origin in either of two different modes. It does or does not form a hybrid with the template DNA. When a stretch of 20 deoxyadenosine residues is inserted into the template strand downstream of the origin, more than 90% of hybridized transcripts and about 10% of unhybridized transcripts terminate at the insert. When the number of inserted residues is reduced to ten, the corresponding values are decreased considerably, while the sites of termination are almost unchanged. A palindrome immediately before the stretch increased the efficiency of termination of unhybridized transcripts. Upon termination of hybridized transcripts, RNA polymerase detaches from the template. A structure made by a hybrid or by folded RNA may affect a property of transcription, and a stretch of deoxyadenosine residues including those beyond the actual site of termination may facilitate detachment of RNA polymerase from the template DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030876997,"Recently, Rossman et al.1 have described the three-dimensional structure of a human rhinovirus. A possible host cell surface receptor binding site was identified with a cleft on each icosahedral face. Two highly conserved amino-acid sequences found in rhino-, polio-, and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) viruses are located near the base of this site and could be important in maintaining its topology. We have prepared site-specific antibodies2,3 to two synthetic peptides which include these sequences. The antibodies bind to the predicted capsid proteins of rhinovirus and neutralize ˜60% of 48 rhinovirus serotypes tested. These results could provide a route to a rhinovirus vaccine effective against most of the numerous serotypes of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W1517011751,"In an attempt to localize topographic domains specific to native human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), we studied the discontinuous antigenic regions recognized by a monoclonal anti-hCG antibody designated as C8 which binds only to hCG and does not cross-react with either the free hCG-alpha and hCG-beta subunits or other glycoprotein hormones. Using two-site monoclonal immunoradiometric assays (M-IRMAs), we found that C8 antibody and an anti-peptide antibody (FB12) directed to residues 110-116 of hCG-beta did not bind simultaneously to hCG. This observation suggested that C8 binds to residues of hCG-beta included either in the antibody-binding region of FB12 or in close proximity to amino acids 110-116. To further delineate the regions of hCG-beta recognized by C8, we carried out hapten inhibition experiments with synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of hCG-beta. The peptide corresponding to residues 109-122 and subpeptides (111-122 or 112-122) inhibited the binding of 125I-hCG to C8, whereas weak inhibition was observed with subpeptide 113-122. By studying the binding of C8 to the 1-112 disulfide-bonded part of hCG-beta (hCG-beta core) recombined with hCG-alpha, we were able to confirm that C8 binds to a region including or near to Asp112. M-IRMAs showed that C8 does not bind to the recombinant molecule lacking residues 113-145 of hCG. Taken together, these results indicate that a limited number of residues located on hCG-beta near to Asp112, and most likely the sequence Asp111-Asp112-Pro113, are included in the discontinuous antigenic region recognized by C8. We then attempted to localize residues of hCG-alpha that constitute another part of the determinant which bound to C8. Six synthetic peptides corresponding to various regions of hCG-alpha did not inhibit binding of 125I-hCG to C8. In contrast, M-IRMAs demonstrated that C8 is capable of binding recombinant products composed of the hCG-beta subunit and the alpha subunits from human, equine, and porcine species. These results indicate that C8 recognizes a region of the alpha subunit highly conserved in these three species. Finally, we determined that the discontinuous regions recognized by C8 are partially accessible on the CG/LH-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1822747874,"Cl- efflux from normal human fibroblasts is stimulated by elevation of cAMP and by elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. In both cases the stimulated Cl- transport occurs via electrically conductive pathways. In six lines of normal human fibroblasts, dibutyryl cAMP increased total Cl- efflux by an average of 13%. In six lines of fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis, dibutyryl cAMP was without effect. The electrically conductive component of Cl- transport was increased an average of 30% by dibutyryl cAMP in normal cells and was unaffected by dibutyryl cAMP in cystic fibrosis cells. Stimulation of the Ca2+-sensitive Cl- channel by addition of A23187 increased Cl- efflux by an average of 30% in normal and 30% in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. The data indicate that there is a defect in a cAMP-activated Cl- channel in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W70683762,"A single alpha-tropomyosin gene in the Japanese quail exhibits tightly controlled expression of multiple isoforms by an alternative splicing mechanism. We have isolated two full length cDNA clones, cC401 and cC402, from quail embryonic myofibers which differentiated in culture. cC402 is the major skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, expressed in adult skeletal muscle and in embryonic muscle culture. cC401 exhibits a novel hybrid primary structure; smooth muscle structure at the carboxyl terminus is combined with skeletal muscle primary structure for the amino-terminal 90% of the protein. The cC401-type tropomyosin, unlike other smooth muscle or cytoskeletal tropomyosins, thus retains two muscle-type troponin-binding regions, for troponin I at amino acid residues 41-80 and for troponin T near amino acid residue 190, while switching to a different troponin binding site at residues 258-284. cC401-type mRNA is expressed at high levels in cultured skin fibroblasts and at low levels in cultured embryonic myoblasts and myofibers, but not in adult muscle, liver, or embryonic skin. A single quail genomic clone encodes both sets of alternative exons found in cC401 and cC402; the different transcripts from this gene share the same 5' ends. Two additional alpha-tropomyosin isoforms have been detected in quail tissues by S1 mapping experiments. Comparison of the cC401 protein with 11 other tropomyosin protein sequences shows that the quail alpha-tropomyosin gene has three different pairs of mutually exclusive exons which are alternatively spliced in nonrandom combinations in specific tissues. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1519332825,"A protein of the C group, most likely C3 (Mr approximately 42,000, pI approximately 6, corresponding to IEF 48m,n of the HeLa protein catalogue (Celis, J. E., Bravo, R., Arenstorf, H. P., and LeStourgeon, W. M. (1986) FEBS Lett. 194, 101-109)), a minor hnRNP protein was purified to near homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions from 40 S heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. Type C protein stoichiometrically disrupts the residual secondary structure of natural and synthetic RNAs, e.g. HeLa hnRNA, coliphage MS2 RNA, and poly(rU)-spermine, and decreases the Tm of duplex structures, e.g. poly[r(A + U)], by about 30 degrees C. Binding of the protein to polynucleotides is not highly cooperative and has a stoichiometry of one protein per about 10 nucleotides. Binding experiments with a variety of synthetic and natural poly- and oligonucleotides, including those containing consensus splice site sequences, indicate that the protein has a high affinity for G-rich and U-rich regions, G-rich regions being preferred. Base analogs I and T have affinities for the protein that are similar to G and U. There is little or no affinity for A- and C-rich regions. The presence of A residues in a G- or U-rich sequence does not interfere with binding while C-rich regions decrease or prevent the binding of the protein. The nucleotide specificity of type C protein, e.g. selective binding to an oligonucleotide from the 3' end of an intron, is discussed in relationship to the abundance of G and U and the relative scarcity of C residues in the processing signals in pre-mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1516245939,"Abstract The anticancer drug, bleomycin, causes both single and double strand scission of duplex DNA in vitro, with double strand scission occurring in excess of that expected from the random accumulation of single strand nicks. The mechanism of the preferential double strand scission of DNA by bleomycin has been investigated through the synthesis of a series of double hairpin and linear oligonucleotides designed to contain a single nick-like structure at a defined site to serve as models of bleomycin-damaged duplex DNA. The 3' and/or 5' hydroxyls flanking the nick have been phosphorylated to model the increased negative charge at a bleomycin-generated nick. The ability of bleomycin to cleave the intact strand opposite the nick was then determined by autoradiography. The results demonstrate that phosphorylation at either the 3' or 5' hydroxyl, and especially when both sites are phosphorylated, strongly enhances selective cleavage by bleomycin of the opposite strand. These experiments indicate that bleomycin-mediated double strand scission is a form of self-potentiation in which the high affinity of bleomycin for the initially generated nicked sites leads to a greatly enhanced probability of scission of the strand opposite those sites."
https://openalex.org/W1652867273,"K562 cells express embryonic (epsilon) and fetal (gamma) globins and hemoglobins but not adult (beta) globin. To define the cis acting regulatory elements involved in the discrimination between gamma and beta genes, we have constructed chimeric genes composed of portions of gamma and beta and evaluated their expression in stable K562 transfectants. A gamma beta fusion gene containing gamma 5′ sequences to the EcoRI site in exon 3 and beta sequences 3′ is expressed at 10-40% that of the endogenous gamma level. In 50% of the lines, this fusion gene appropriately increases its expression in response to hemin, an inducer of endogenous globin gene expression in K562 cells. In contrast, a beta gamma fusion gene, containing beta sequences 5′ to the EcoRI site in exon 3 and gamma sequences 3′, is neither expressed nor correctly initiated. A beta gene containing gamma-intervening sequence (IVS) 2 accumulates an mRNA transcript when analyzed with a 3′ beta probe. However, no correctly initiated beta mRNA is observed. A gamma gene with beta-IVS 2 is only inducible in one of six expressing clones. All the results are consistent with the presence of stage-specific trans acting factors in K562 cells that stimulate expression of gamma genes and suggest a significant role for gamma-IVS 2 in gamma gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W342371677,"The regulation of type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase during the differentiation of L6 myoblasts has been investigated in order to assess a possible role for this enzyme in the control of myogenesis. Immunoblot analysis showed that the levels of the type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit (RI) increased 3-fold during differentiation. However, measurement of RI mRNA levels using an RI cDNA probe showed that this increase was not regulated transcriptionally. Determinations of the turnover rate of RI demonstrated that the subunit becomes 3-fold more stable in the differentiated cells. Therefore, it appears that the increase is due to a decrease in the rate of degradation of RI. The increase in both the amount and stability of RI could be reversed by treating myotubes with cAMP analogues or forskolin. Furthermore, during differentiation there was a large decrease in cAMP levels. It was, therefore, concluded that the increase in RI levels seen during differentiation is probably due to an increase in the stability of the subunit as a result of a decrease in intracellular cAMP concentrations."
