https://openalex.org/W1883306593,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a blinding disorder that compromises central vision, is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular deposits, termed drusen, between the retinal pigmented epithelium and the choroid. Recent studies in this laboratory revealed that vitronectin is a major component of drusen. Because vitronectin is also a constituent of abnormal deposits associated with a variety of diseases, drusen from human donor eyes were examined for compositional similarities with other extracellular disease deposits. Thirty-four antibodies to 29 different proteins or protein complexes were tested for immunoreactivity with hard and soft drusen phenotypes. These analyses provide a partial profile of the molecular composition of drusen. Serum amyloid P component, apolipoprotein E, immunoglobulin light chains, Factor X, and complement proteins (C5 and C5b-9 complex) were identified in all drusen phenotypes. Transcripts encoding some of these molecules were also found to be synthesized by the retina, retinal pigmented epithelium, and/or choroid. The compositional similarity between drusen and other disease deposits may be significant in view of the recently established correlation between AMD and atherosclerosis. This study suggests that similar pathways may be involved in the etiologies of AMD and other age-related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2121452261,"The potent vasodilator action of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) involves decreasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction of smooth muscle via stimulation of myosin light chain phosphatase through unknown mechanisms (Wu, X., Somlyo, A. V., and Somlyo, A. P. (1996)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 220, 658–663). Myosin light chain phosphatase activity is controlled by the small GTPase RhoA and its target Rho kinase. Here we demonstrate cGMP effects mediated by cGK that inhibit RhoA-dependent Ca2+ sensitization of contraction of blood vessels and actin cytoskeleton organization in cultured vascular myocytes. Ca2+ sensitization and actin organization were inhibited by both 8-bromo-cGMP and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). SNP also caused translocation of activated RhoA from the membrane to the cytosol. SNP-induced actin disassembly was lost in vascular myocytes in culture after successive passages but was restored by transfection of cells with cGK I. Furthermore, cGK phosphorylated RhoA in vitro, and addition of cGK I inhibited RhoA-induced Ca2+ sensitization in permeabilized smooth muscle. 8-Bromo-cGMP-induced actin disassembly was inhibited in vascular myocytes expressing RhoAAla-188, a mutant that could not be phosphorylated. Collectively, these results indicate that cGK phosphorylates and inhibits RhoA and suggest that the consequent inhibition of RhoA-induced Ca2+ sensitization and actin cytoskeleton organization contributes to the vasodilator action of nitric oxide. The potent vasodilator action of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) involves decreasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction of smooth muscle via stimulation of myosin light chain phosphatase through unknown mechanisms (Wu, X., Somlyo, A.

Nature. 1997; 389: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The major regulatory mechanism of smooth muscle contraction is phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC)1 (2.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). MLC is phosphorylated by the Ca2+-calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and dephosphorylated by the Ca2+-independent myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Thus, a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration produces smooth muscle contraction by activation of MLCK and consequent phosphorylation of MLC. However, it is now well established that MLC phosphorylation and tension can be induced independently of change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (1.Somlyo A.P. Nature. 1997; 389: 908-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2.Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Agonists (noradrenaline, endothelin, thromboxane, etc.) that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors produced contraction by increasing both the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the Ca2+sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. The increased sensitivity of vascular smooth muscle toward Ca2+ results from inhibition of MLCP activity leading to increased MLC phosphorylation and tension at a constant Ca2+ concentration. The Ca2+-sensitizing effect of vasoconstrictors is ascribed to the activation of the small 22–26-kDa GTPase RhoA that activates Rho kinase which, in turn, phosphorylates the regulatory subunit of MLCP and inhibits its activity (3.Gong M.C.

RhoA-dependent Ca2+-sensitization constitutes a major component of the sustained rise in tension induced by vasoconstrictors in various vascular beds including pulmonary artery, mesenteric artery, and portal vein (3.Gong M.C. Iizuka K. Nixon G. Browne J.P. Hall A. Eccleston J.F. Sugai M. Kobayashi S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rho kinase-dependent MLCP inhibition is responsible not only for the RhoA-dependent Ca2+ sensitization in smooth muscle but also for agonist-induced stimulation of actomyosin-based cytoskeleton organization (actin stress fiber formation) in cultured smooth muscle cells (8.Togashi H. Emala C.W. Hall I.P. Hirshman C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L803-L809PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Hirshman C.A. Emala C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 21: L653-L661Google Scholar). Conversely, relaxation of vascular smooth muscle results from a decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and/or reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. Physiologically released endothelial nitric oxide (NO) elevates cGMP, the second messenger responsible for relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent enlargement of the vessel lumen (10.Furchgott R.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 1-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP-induced relaxation involves activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) (11.Lohmann S.M. Vaandrager A.B.

The potent vasodilator action of the cGMP/cGK pathway has been ascribed to a decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ through activation of multiple Ca2+ lowering mechanisms (13.Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7 (238): 328Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and “Ca2+desensitization” by stimulation of MLCP activity through unknown mechanisms (14.Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15.Lee M.R. Li L. Kitazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Also, most recently cGK was shown to bind directly to MLCP by a leucine zipper interaction and phosphorylate in vitro the myosin-binding subunit of MLCP (16.Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of MLCP was reported not to affect the phosphatase activity toward MLC, suggesting that indirect mechanisms are involved in the Ca2+-desensitizing effect of cGMP (17.Nakamura M. Ichikawa K. Ito M. Yamamori B. Okinaka T. Isaka N. Yoshida Y. Fujita S. Nakano T. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such an indirect mechanism involving telokin, a low molecular weight protein expressed in phasic smooth muscle, has been proposed (18.Wu X. Haystead T.A. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11362-11369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Telokin is phosphorylated in smooth muscle cells relaxed by application of 8-Br-cGMP. Telokin accelerates dephosphorylation of MLC and relaxation at constant Ca2+ concentration, and the relaxing effect of telokin and 8-Br-cGMP in permeabilized smooth muscle are synergistic. However, a truncated form of telokin that does not contain the phosphorylation site for cGK is also able to relax permeabilized smooth muscle (18.Wu X. Haystead T.A. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11362-11369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, cGMP/cGK pathway induces Ca2+ desensitization in tonic smooth muscles that do not express telokin, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the cGMP-dependent stimulation of MLCP activity. In the present study, we have analyzed the role of cGMP/cGK pathway on RhoA-dependent Ca2+ sensitization and actin stress fiber organization in vascular smooth muscle since both processes depend on MLCP inhibition (19.Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We show that both RhoA-dependent Ca2+ sensitization of the contractile apparatus and actin cytoskeleton organization in vascular smooth muscle are inhibited by cGMP through cGK phosphorylation of RhoA Ser-188 that causes subsequent translocation of membrane-bound activated RhoA to the cytosol. Inhibition of RhoA-induced Ca2+ sensitization of the contractile apparatus by cGMP/cGK is thus identified as a new signaling pathway that contributes to the vasodilator action of NO. A short report of our work has been recently published in abstract form (20.Loirand G. Le Jeune H. Pernaton S. Pacaud P. Circulation. 1999; 100: I-623Google Scholar). Wistar rats and guinea pigs were stunned and then killed by cervical dislocation. Rabbits were killed with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg intravenously). The aorta, pulmonary artery, and portal vein were collected in physiological saline solution (PSS, in mm; 130 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 11 glucose, 10 Tris, pH 7.4, with HCl) cleaned of fat and adherent connective tissue, and cut in rings or strips. The endothelium was carefully removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface with the tip of small forceps. Smooth muscle strips or rings were then suspended under isometric conditions and connected to a force transducer (Pioden Controls Ltd., Canterbury, UK) in organ baths filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution (in mm: 118.4 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 11 glucose) maintained at 37 °C, and equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The preparations were initially placed under a resting tension of 1500 mg, left to equilibrate for 1 h and washed at 20-min intervals. The absence of endothelium was confirmed in each ring by the inability of carbachol (10 μm) to relax phenylephrine (PE, 1 μm)-induced contraction. Guinea pigs were stunned and then killed by cervical dislocation. The portal vein was collected in PSS, cleaned of fat and adherent connective tissue, and longitudinally opened. The endothelium was carefully removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface with the tip of small forceps. Small muscle strips (approximately 200 μm wide and 4 mm long) were isolated from the media and tied at each end with a single silk thread to the tips of two needles, one of which was connected to a force transducer (AE 801, SensoNor, Horten, Norway). Strips were placed in a well on a bubble plate filled with PSS (21.Horiuti K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 398: 131-148Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and stretched to about 1.3 resting length. The solution was rapidly changed by sliding the plate to an adjacent well. After measuring contraction evoked by high K+ solution, the strips were incubated in the normal relaxing solution (in mm: 85 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 5 creatine phosphate, 2 EGTA, and 20 Tris maleate, brought to pH 7.1 at 25 °C with KOH) for few minutes, followed by treatment with β-escin (50–70 μm) in the relaxing solution for 35 min at 25 °C as described previously (22.Loirand G. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Chardin P. Pacaud P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 825-834Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The skinned muscle strip was then washed several times with fresh relaxing solution containing 10 mm EGTA. Calmodulin (1.5 μm) was added to the bathing solutions throughout the experiments. Tension developed by permeabilized muscle strips were measured in activating solutions, containing 10 mm EGTA and a specified amount of CaCl2 to give a desired concentration of free Ca2+ (22.Loirand G. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Chardin P. Pacaud P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 825-834Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells from young rat (45 g) aorta were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as described previously (23.Guibert C. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Marthan R. Savineau J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L450-L458PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Secondary cultures were obtained by serial passages after the cells were harvested with 0.5 g/liter trypsin and 0.2 g/liter EDTA (trypsin/EDTA) and reseeded in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. For measurements of Rho distribution, strips of endothelium-denuded aortic muscle were washed twice with PSS at 37 °C and changed to PSS with or without PE (10 μm) for 1 h in the absence or in the presence of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10 μm). The tissues were then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in lysis buffer containing (in mm) 20 Hepes-NaOH, 10 KCl, 10 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 dithiothreitol, and Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1 tablet/50 ml). Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 30 min to generate membrane and cytosolic fractions. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. Protein concentration of fractions was measured and adjusted and then Laemmli sample buffer was added, and equal amounts of protein from membrane and cytosolic fractions were loaded in each lane of SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels, which were then electrophoresed and transferred to nitrocellulose. The amounts of proteins were checked by staining with Ponceau Red. Before immunoblotting, the membrane was blocked with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with a mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (2 μg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (16 ng/ml). The signal from immunoreactive bands was detected by ECL. For cGK I expression analysis, lysates were prepared from aortic smooth muscle cells at different passages. Samples were then analyzed by Western blot using rabbit cGK I antiserum diluted 1:1000. The immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL, and quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). After dissociation, aortic myocytes were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS on glass coverslips for 2 days. The cells were then washed and maintained in serum-free DMEM in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm SNP for 1 h or 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP for 40 min. When Rp-8-Br-cGMPS was used, it was added 2 h before other treatment. Cells were then fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline. For polymerized F-actin staining, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated phalloidin (5 μg/ml) for 45 min at room temperature and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Actin staining was also performed with a monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody which gave results similar to those obtained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. When dual labeling was performed, cells were simultaneously stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin and Texas Red-labeled DNase I (10 μg/ml) to localize monomeric G-actin (24.Knowles G.C. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were mounted on a glass slide and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E-600, Nikon, Champigny-sur-Marne, France). The background fluorescence signal was estimated by collecting planes from areas of the slide without cells and was electronically subtracted before analysis. Images were collected with a cool-SNAP camera (Princeton Instruments, Evry, France) and stored and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). For each area examined, images of FITC-phalloidin and Texas Red-DNase I fluorescence were collected. The time of measurements and image capturing and the image intensity gain at both wavelengths were optimally adjusted and kept constant. The ratio of fluorescence of FITC-phalloidin and Texas Red-DNase I (F- to G-actin ratio), used to quantify actin cytoskeleton organization was calculated for at least 20 cells in each experimental condition and expressed as percentage of the ratio obtained under control condition. A decrease in the F- to G-actin ratio was assumed to represent depolymerization of actin filaments. RhoA and RhoAAla-188 were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, then geranylgeranylated in vitro by type 1 geranylgeranyltransferase and loaded with GTPγS as described previously (22.Loirand G. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Chardin P. Pacaud P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 825-834Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25.Nobes K. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of recombinant RhoA and geranylgeranylated (GG) RhoA was determined in a kinase assay system using cGK Iα (10,000 units/reaction; Calbiochem, France; Biochem, Meudon, France) according to protocol provided by the manufacturer. The reaction was carried out in a phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μm cGMP, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and with 500 ng of RhoA substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of cold phosphorylation buffer, and samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by in SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Full-length RhoAWT, RhoAAla-188, RhoAVal-14, and RhoAVal-14,Ala-188 were cloned in pSG5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and full-length cGK Iα was cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Groninger, The Netherlands). RhoA or cGKIα plasmids were transiently transfected, together with the CD8 plasmid, into aortic myocytes grown on coverslips by using using Fugene reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were washed in FCS-free DMEM then maintained in serum-free DMEM in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm SNP for 1 h or 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP for 40 min. Anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads were added just prior to fixation to visualize transfected cells (27.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed and stained as described above. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of sample size n. Significance was tested by means of Student's t test. Probabilities less than 5% (p < 0.05) were considered significant. Texas Red-DNase I was obtained from Molecular Probe (Leiden, The Netherland). Anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads were purchased from Dynal (Compiègne, France), and mouse monoclonal RhoA antibody (26C4) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The RhoA inhibitor C3 exoenzyme was kindly provided by Dr. P. Boquet (Inserm U452, Nice University Medical School, Nice, France). The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was a gift from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd (Saitama, Japan).R p-8-Br-cGMPS was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The relaxing effect of cGMP/cGK pathway on agonist-induced Ca2+sensitization of the contractile apparatus was first examined in intact endothelium-denuded vessels (rat aorta, rabbit pulmonary artery, and guinea pig portal vein) stimulated with PE (1 μm). In all vessels, the PE-induced contraction was strongly inhibited by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (6.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar) attesting to involvement of RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent Ca2+ sensitization in the contraction mechanism. Y-27632 (10 μm) inhibited PE-induced tension by 98 ± 2, 95 ± 3, and 94 ± 4%, in intact rat aorta, rabbit pulmonary artery, and guinea pig portal vein, respectively (n = 6). Fig.1 A shows typical traces illustrating the classical dose-dependent relaxation of PE-induced contraction of rat aorta under control conditions. The concentration of 8-Br-cGMP which gave half-maximal relaxation (IC50) corresponded to 80 μm (Fig.1 B and Table I). Arterial rings were then maintained in the presence of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor methoxyverapamil (D600, 20 μm) and the Ca2+ store-depleting agent thapsigargin (TSG, 2 μm) to inhibit agonist-induced change in cytosolic Ca2+ (28.Pacaud P. Bolton T.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 477-499Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29.Pacaud P. Malam-Souley R. Loirand G. Desgranges C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H30-H36PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the rate of rise of the PE-induced contraction was not modified in all vessels tested. However, measurements of intracellular Ca2+in freshly isolated aortic cells maintained in similar conditions indicated that PE did not produce any rise in [Ca2+]i (not shown). This suggests that the basal Ca2+ concentration in the presence of D600/TSG allowed the development of Ca2+-sensitizing mechanisms responsible for the D600/TSG-resistant component of the PE-induced contraction. The maximal rise in tension induced by PE in the presence of D600 and TSG was reduced to 72 ± 9% (n = 6) of the control responses (Fig. 1 A), and the tension was concentration-dependently inhibited by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 with an IC50 of 1 μm (not shown). The TSG/D600-resistant component of the PE-induced contraction was also concentration-dependently inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 1, A and B). In the presence of D600/TSG, the concentration-response curve to 8-Br-cGMP was shifted to the left and the IC50 was decreased to 18 μm (Fig.1 B and Table I). Similar results were obtained with SNP (Fig. 1 C and Table I) for which the IC50 was 6.2 nm under control conditions and to 3.1 nm in the presence of D600/TSG. Results similar to those obtained with rat aorta were also obtained with rabbit pulmonary artery and guinea pig portal vein (Table I). These results indicate that RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent Ca2+ sensitization strongly contributed to PE-induced contraction and that its inhibition is implicated in the mechanism of cGMP/cGK relaxation of smooth muscle. To analyze further the inhibitory effect of 8-Br-cGMP, we next used β-escin-permeabilized smooth muscle strips.Table IInhibitory action of 8-Br-cGMP and SNP on the sustained rise in tension induced by PE (1 μm)IC50AortaPulmonary arteryPortal veinIC508-Br-cGMP80 μm113 μm141 μmIC50 SNP6.2 nm16.2 nm7.4 nmIC50 8-Br-cGMP after D600-TSG treatment18 μm36 μm44 μmIC50 SNP after D600-TSG treatment3.1 nm3.8 nm3.5 nmConcentrations of 8-Br-cGMP or SNP leading to half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of PE-induced tension were determined from cumulative concentration-response curve obtained from 5 to 6 experiments. Open table in a new tab Concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP or SNP leading to half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of PE-induced tension were determined from cumulative concentration-response curve obtained from 5 to 6 experiments. Ca2+-dependent contractions and Ca2+ sensitization of contractile proteins could be independently evoked in β-escin-permeabilized smooth muscle strips. Ca2+-dependent contractions were induced by an increase in Ca2+ concentration (submaximal pCa (−log [Ca2+]) 6.2 or 6 or maximal pCa 4.5), and Ca2+ sensitization was evoked by addition of GTPγS atpCa 6.3 in guinea pig portal vein (Fig.2 A). Contractions evoked at submaximal Ca2+ concentration (pCa 6.2 or 6) were only slightly inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP and were not sensitive to either C3 exoenzyme or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Fig.2 B). This indicates that Rho/Rho kinase pathway does not participate to the Ca2+-induced contraction in β-escin-permeabilized muscle, in contrast to previous observations in α-toxin-permeabilized muscle (7.Fu X. Gong M.C. Jia T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14.Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The relaxing effect of 8-Br-cGMP on the contraction induced by GTPγS at pCa 6.3 (43.3 ± 4.6%, n = 7) was ∼4 times higher than that obtained at the same tension level reached at pCa 6 (10.9 ± 2.4%, n = 7; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, A and B). The GTPγS-induced Ca2+ sensitization was inhibited by C3 and Y-27632 (Fig.2 B), indicating that it depends on RhoA/Rho kinase activation. Similar results were obtained in β-escin-permeabilized strips from rabbit pulmonary artery in which 8-Br-cGMP relaxed GTPγS-induced contraction 2.5 times more effectively than Ca2+-dependent contraction. These results confirm that RhoA-dependent signaling pathway is a target for the cGMP-induced Ca2+ desensitization. Staining of aortic smooth muscle cell actin cytoskeleton with FITC-phalloidin revealed a dense and organized network of actin stress fibers (Fig.3 A) that is inhibited by the RhoA-inactivating exoenzyme C3 or the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Fig. 3 C). Incubation of cells with 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) or SNP (10 μm) decreased the extent of phalloidin staining of stress fibers (Fig. 3, B andC). This effect was inhibited by the cGK inhibitorR p-8-Br-cGMPS (100 μm). Similar results were obtained using a monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody to image stress fibers (not shown). A gradual decrease of the SNP-induced actin disassembly was observed with successive passages of aortic smooth muscle cells in culture, 75% of the response being lost between passages 1 and 8 (Fig.4 A). Western blot examination of cGK expression indicated that the loss of SNP-induced actin disassembly in cultured cells was associated with a decrease in endogenous cGK I (Fig. 4 B). Such down-regulation of cGK I has previously been reported to occur upon smooth muscle cell passaging (30.Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When normalized to its value at passage 1, endogenous cGK was decreased to 0.6 and 0.1 in cells at passage 4 and 6, respectively. To analyze a causal relationship between down-expression of cGK and loss of the SNP effect, cGK Iα was expressed in aortic smooth muscle cells that have lost endogenous cGK. cGK Iα transfection of passage 8 aortic smooth muscle cells caused full restoration of the inhibitory action of 8-Br-cGMP (not shown) or SNP (Fig. 4, A andC) on actin cytoskeleton organization. cGK Iα was co-expressed with CD8 for identification of transfected cells with anti-CD8 antibody-coated beads. All transfected cells showed a strong disassembly of actin fibers in response to 8-Br-cGMP (not shown) or SNP, whereas actin cytoskeleton of non-transfected cells (not labeled by beads) was almost not affected (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained with transfection of cGK Iβ (not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that inhibition of RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent modulation of MLCP by 8-Br-cGMP or SNP resulted from the activation of cGK. Since potential sites for phosphorylation by cGK were not found in the amino acid sequence of Rho kinase (Rock I and Rock II), we investigated the possibility"

In the present study in primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, constitutively active MKK6, MKK6(Glu), bound to IκB kinase (IKK)-β and stimulated its abilities to phosphorylate IκB and to activate NF-κB. MKK6(Glu) induced NF-κB-dependent interleukin (IL)-6 transcription and IL-6 release in a p38-dependent manner. IL-6 protected myocardial cells against apoptosis. Like IL-6, TNF-α, which activates both NF-κB and p38, also induced p38-dependent IL-6 expression and release and protected myocytes from apoptotis. While TNF-α was relatively ineffective, IL-6 activated myocardial cell STAT3 by about 8-fold, indicating a probable role for this transcription factor in IL-6-mediated protection from apoptosis. TNF-α-mediated IL-6 induction was inhibited by a kinase-inactive form of the MAPKKK, TGF-β activated protein kinase (Tak1), which is known to activate p38 and NF-κB in other cell types. Thus, by stimulating both p38 and NF-κB, Tak1-activating cytokines, like TNF-α, can induce IL-6 expression and release. Moreover, the myocyte-derived IL-6 may then function in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion to augment myocardial cell survival during stresses that activate p38.

Since some injuries, such as myocardial infarction, are frequently life-threatening, a better understanding of the roles of cytokines in tissues such as the heart is critical. Following a myocardial infarction there is an accumulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα),1 interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 at or near the affected region (2Guillen I. Blanes M. Gomez-Lechon M.J.

Previously, production of these cytokines in the heart was attributed to infiltrating macrophages or leukocytes and endothelial cells (e.g. see Ref. 6Kukielka G.L. Smith W. Manning A.M. Youker K.A. Michael L.H. Entman M.L. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1866-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, recent findings have demonstrated the expression of all three of these cytokines in cardiac myocytes following ischemic stress (7Kapadia S. Lee J.R. Torre-Amione G. Birdsall H.H. Ma T.S.

Accordingly, there is renewed interest in studying the possible beneficial effects of cytokines in the heart as well as elucidating the signal transduction pathways and mechanisms responsible for their induction. The induction of most cytokine genes requires activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-κB (12Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 13Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated and cytokine expression is increased in rat hearts submitted to ischemic stress; interestingly, these events appear to require the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p38 (16Maulik N. Sato M. Price B.D. Das D.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Additionally, in cultured cardiac myocytes, NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression is activated following the selective stimulation of p38 by its upstream activator, MKK6 (17Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, this p38-dependent NF-κB activation contributes to protecting cultured myocardial cells from undergoing apoptosis (17Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, while p38 and NF-κB are both important for the maintenance of heart function following stress, neither the mechanism by which p38 activates NF-κB nor the role of p38-activated NF-κB in myocardial cell survival are well understood. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to begin addressing these questions. Many signaling pathways can interact with each other through biochemical cross-talk; however, such interactions between p38 and NF-κB are not well understood. Like the other MAPK family members, p38 is part of a cascade of kinases. One of the best studied activators of p38 is the MAPKK, MKK6, which lies directly upstream of p38; among ERK, JNK, and p38, MKK6 activates only p38 (18Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Although MKK6 itself can be activated by several upstream kinases, a particularly interesting finding is that in some cells, MKK6 can be activated by the MAPKKK, TGF-β-activated protein kinase (Tak1) (18Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). Tak1 was originally named for its ability to be activated by TGF-β. However, Tak1 can also be activated by cytokines, such as interleukin-1 or TNF-α (20Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ioshi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7 for reference). In comparison with the p38 pathway, the NF-κB pathway is activated through a series of events that are also mediated by a cascade of kinases, many of which are believed to be unique to that pathway. NF-κB, which is comprised of two subunits (p65 and p50), is retained in the cytoplasm by virtue of its interaction with the inhibitor of κB (IκB). IκB is phosphorylated in response to NF-κB-activating signals; this phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκB. This then allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds to critical elements in cytokine genes and increases their transcription (23Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 24DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of IκB belong to the IκB kinase family, or the IKKs (25Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X.

A. 1997; 94: 9792-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Although it preferentially activates IKK, NF-κB-inducing kinase, which bears strong sequence homology to, and is now considered a member of, the MAPKKK family, can also activate the JNK MAPK pathway (32Su Y.C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to being activated by NF-κB-inducing kinase, IKK can also be activated by MEKK1 (27Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Wu Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), a MAPKKK that is also known to activate JNK in some cell types (33Lu X. Nemoto S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24751-24754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and by Tak1 (refer to Fig. 5). Thus, at least at the MAPKKK level, there exists the potential for cross-talk between the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. In the present study, we examined the nature of the cross-talk between the NF-κB and p38 pathways. Because of the clear importance of these pathways in promoting the recovery, or maintenance of, heart tissue function following stress or injury, we used cardiac myocytes as the model system. To this end, we explored whether NF-κB and p38 collaboratively activate the IL-6 gene in cardiac myocytes and, further, whether IL-6 itself has roles that are consistent with functional recovery of the tissue following stress. We have found the following: 1) agonists, such as TNF-α, can activate IL-6 transcription in cardiac myocytes in a manner that requires both NF-κB and p38; 2) the coordinate activation of the NF-κB and p38 pathways by TNF-α takes place largely through the MAPKKK, Tak1; 3) the p38 pathway can influence NF-κB activation, at least partly, through the physical association of MKK6 and IKKβ; and 4) IL-6 can protect cardiac myocytes from undergoing apoptosis induced by sphingosine, a signaling lipid known to increase in the heart following ischemic stress. Primary ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1–4 day old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (34Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were dissected in DMEM/air; the apical two-thirds of the ventricles were dissected away from the atria. After mincing and washing the ventricles twice with air-compatible DMEM, cells were isolated by multiple rounds of 10-min-long tissue dissociation with 0.001% trypsin. After each incubation with trypsin, the supernatant was added to an equal volume of DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and all of the supernatants were combined. Plastic wells were treated for at least 1 h with 5 ng of fibronectin/ml of DMEM/F-12 (1:1). Myocytes were plated in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum for approximately 16 h. After washing with DMEM/F-12 (1:1), the cultures were incubated in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) with or without any test agents for the indicated times. Immediately following the final dissociation step, myocardial cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F-12 (1:1). Between 5 and 12 × 106 cells were combined with the combinations of plasmids indicated in the figure legends in a total volume of 300 μl of DMEM/F-12 (1:1). The total amount of plasmids used for each electroporation was equalized using pCMV6. Dose-response experiments were carried out to determine optimal quantities of plasmids for transfection and to verify that the results obtained were consistent over a range of plasmid levels. Generally, the dose-response experiments led to using the following quantities of each plasmid type in each electroporation: 1 μg each of pCMV6 (control) or p38β2; 15 μg of MKK6(Glu), Tak1, or Tab1; 20 μg each of luciferase and β-galactosidase reporters; 45 μg of IKKβ-M, MKK6-M1, MKK6-M2, and Tak1-M. Cells were electroporated at 500 V, 25 microfarads, and 100 ohms in a 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Under these conditions, only cardiac myocytes are transfected (34Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 36LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter assays, 1.5 × 106 cells were plated per 24-mm well, whereas 4.5 × 106 myocytes per 35-mm well were plated to perform kinase assays. pcDNA3 FLAG-MKK6 (Glu) and pcDNA3 FLAG-MKK6(K82A), the latter of which we call MKK6-M1, code for activated and kinase-inactive human MKK6, respectively (19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) and were obtained from R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). In some cases, instead of MKK6-M1 we used MKK6-M2 (FLAG-MKK6(K82A; S207A; T211A)), which is a kinase-inactive form of MKK6 that also has the sites normally phosphorylated by an upstream MAPKKK, Ser207 and Thr211, mutated to Ala. MKK6-M2 produced similar inhibitory effects on the p38 pathway as MKK6-M1. Srα3 HA-p38–2, which codes for wild type human p38–2, was obtained from B. Stein (37Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B.

In the present work, we have adopted the p38β2 nomenclature. pRK5 C-FLAG-IKKβ and pRK5 C-FLAG-IKKβ (K44A), which code for wild type human IKKβ and kinase-dead human IKKβ, were obtained from M. Rothe (26Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) (Tularik, San Francisco, CA). p2X NF-κB, which codes for a luciferase reporter driven by a minimal prolactin promoter with two nearby, upstream NF-κB consensus sites, was obtained from M. Karin (39DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Haegeman (University of Gent, Belgium). NF-κB/IL-6-luc was prepared by ligating three IL-6 NF-κB elements upstream of the noninducible IL-6 minimal promoter, which is composed of 50 nt of IL-6 5′-flanking sequence. This construct was also obtained from G. Haegeman. pFLAG-Tak1 and pFLAG-Tak1-M encode human, full-length wild type Tak1 and human full-length Tak1 K63W, respectively. pHA-Tab1 encodes human, full-length Tab1 (22Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All Tak1 and Tab1 constructs used in this study were obtained from T. Sugita (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The AdEasy system was used for preparing recombinant adenoviral strains using previously described methods (40He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Briefly, human MKK6(Glu) and human p38β2were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the parent templates (see above) such as to create restriction sites that would facilitate cloning into pAdTrack-CMV, an adenoviral shuttle vector that harbors CMV-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP), and a CMV-flanked multiple cloning site for the insertion of the gene of interest. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified p38β2 and MKK6(Glu) were cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which served as a shuttle cloning vector. pGEX-6P-1/p38β2 and pGEX-6P-1/MKK6(Glu) were then digested with BamHI and NotI, and the resulting products of interest were cloned into the BglII and NotI sites of pAdTrack-CMV to create pAdTrack-CMV-p38β2 and pAdTrack-CMV-MKK6(Glu). pAdTrack-CMV-p38β2 or pAdTrack-CMV-MKK6(Glu) was linearized and then co-transformed with the adenoviral vector, pAdEasy-1, into Escherichia coli strain BM5183. This strain of E. coli allows for homologous recombination of pAdEasy-1 and the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector containing the gene of interest. Recombinants were selected on kanamycin and screened by restriction digestion with PacI. Recombinant plasmids were then retransformed into E. coli DH5α for propagation purposes. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were linearized with PacI and then transfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells, using LipofectAMINE® (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection efficiency was determined by observing GFP fluorescence, as described previously (40He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The recombinant viruses were then harvested 7–10 days postinfection. Viral titers were determined by observing GFP fluorescence of primary neonatal cardiac myocytes; the minimum quantity of viral stock that afforded 100% transfection efficiency was selected for the experiments in this study. Following the appropriate time in culture, each well of myocytes was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) containing 1 mmdithiothreitol. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation. To measure β-galactosidase activity, 200 μl of the cell extract was added to 400 μl of β-galactosidase buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After stopping each reaction by adding 100 μl of 1m Na2CO3, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. To measure luciferase activity, 100 μl of buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mmMgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 45 mmKPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mmd-luciferin, 3 mm ATP) was added to 100 μl of cell lysate. Light emission of each sample was measured by a BioOrbit 1251 luminometer for 30 s. The relative luciferase activities were determined by dividing the relative luciferase activity by the relative β-galactosidase activity. To measure IL-6 secretion, IL-6 ELISAs were carried out using a kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (BIOSOURCE International). After the myocardial cells were preplated as described (17Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to eliminate noncardiac myocytes, the myocytes were plated at a density of 1300 cells/mm2 in 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were washed and cultured in media with or without recombinant TNF-α (Genzyme), with or without 5 μm SB203580, or the cells were infected with AdV-MKK6(Glu), AdV-p38β2, or AdV-Control. Following 48 h of incubation, media were collected and assayed using the IL-6 ELISA kit. Myocardial cells were cultured with or without recombinant IL-6 (1 ng/ml) (BIOSOURCEInternational) supplemented DMEM/F-12 with or without 5 μm SB203580 for 48 h prior to the addition of 10 μm sphingosine (Calbiochem) for 6 h. TUNEL analyses of fragmented DNA were performed on cultured cardiac myocytes as described previously (17Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were scored for TUNEL-positive nuclei in a researcher-blinded manner. Assessment of apoptosis was performed by DNA laddering essentially as described previously (17Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Approximately 106 cardiac myocytes were lysed in a digestion buffer containing Proteinase K, scraped, pipetted several times, and incubated at 55 °C for 5–14 h. Samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and then DNA was isopropyl alcohol-precipitated and washed several times with ethanol and allowed to air-dry. After dissolving the DNA and incubating with RNase A, DNA fragments were fractionated on an agarose gel. To study the cellular localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, myocardial cells were co-transfected with test expression constructs (1 μg each of pCMV6, p38β2 or 15 μg of MKK6(Glu)) and 5 μg of a plasmid encoding GFP. Following 48 h of culture in minimal media, cells were fixed as described (35Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and immunocytofluorescence was carried out using a polyclonal antibody raised against p65/NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Transfected cardiac myocytes were identified as GFP-positive cells, and p65 localization was visualized in only the transfected cells. Myocardial cells were treated with or without TNF-α (1 ng/ml) for 10 min and then extracted in 400 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following removal of debris by centrifugation, MAPKAP-K2 was immunoprecipitated using 1.5 μg of anti-MAPKAP-K2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; catalog no. 06-534) and submitted to a kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP and hsp27 as the substrates, as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled hsp27 was then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was submitted to PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) analysis. IKKβ kinase activity was assessed in myocardial cells by co-transfecting C-FLAG-IKKβ with or without test expression constructs with or without SB203580 (5 μm). After the appropriate times, cultures were extracted in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin. After brief centrifugation, extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-IKKβ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precipitation. Immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out using 1 μg of recombinant IκB-α-(1–317) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) per sample and 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT) at 25 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the phosphorylation level of IκB-α was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analyses. The quantity of IKKβ in each sample was determined by Western analysis; the observed levels were used to normalize relative IκB-α phosphorylation levels found in PhosphorImager analyses. Cultures (approximately 2 × 106 myocytes) were lysed in 100 μl of supplemented Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin; boiled for 5 min; and then submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in methanol transfer buffer at 60 V for 5 h or 30 V overnight. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TBS-Tween (0.01%) at room temperature. Western analyses were then performed using 1:1000 dilutions of antisera specific for phospho-p38 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA; catalog no. 9211S), phospho-JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. SC6254), or phospho-ERK (New England Biolabs; catalog no. 9101S). Blots were subsequently stripped with 6.25 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, washed for 1 h in TBS-Tween, and reprobed with 1:1000 dilutions of antisera specific for either p38 (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada; catalog no. KAP-MAOO9E), JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. SC-474), or ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; catalog no. SC-093) for normalization purposes. Myocytes were cultured as described above and then treated with or without various test agents for 15 min. The cells from 3–35-mm culture wells (4.5 × 106myocytes) were collected by scraping into 450 μl of lysis buffer, which consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 μm sodium glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% No"

https://openalex.org/W1968718809,"Analytical work on the fractionation of the glycan strands of Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall has led to the observation that an unusually high proportion of hexosamine units (over 80% of the glucosamine and 10% of the muramic acid residues) was not N-acetylated, explaining the resistance of the peptidoglycan to the hydrolytic action of lysozyme, a muramidase that cleaves in the glycan backbone. A gene, pgdA, was identified as encoding for the peptidoglycanN-acetylglucosamine deacetylaseA with amino acid sequence similarity to fungal chitin deacetylases and rhizobial NodB chitooligosaccharide deacetylases. Pneumococci in which pgdA was inactivated by insertion duplication mutagenesis produced fully N-acetylated glycan and became hypersensitive to exogenous lysozyme in the stationary phase of growth. The pgdA gene may contribute to pneumococcal virulence by providing protection against host lysozyme, which is known to accumulate in high concentrations at infection sites.

S. pneumoniae is capable of producing at least 90 chemically distinct capsular polysaccharides (1.van Dam J.E. Fleer A. Snippe H. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1990; 58: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cell wall of this microorganism contains a teichoic acid of unusually complex chemistry (2.Fischer W. Behr T. Hartmann R. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3.Fischer W. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) the components of which include ribitol phosphate, galactosamine, trideoxydiaminohexose, and covalently linked phosphocholine residues (4.Tomasz A. Science. 1967; 157: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The peptidoglycan of S. pneumoniae is also unusual because its stem peptides are cross-linked in both a direct and an indirect manner (5.Garcia-Bustos J.F. Chait B.T. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2143-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the proportion of distinct linear and branched muropeptides in the peptidoglycan is clonally related (6.Severin A. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pneumococcal cell wall is a potential target for components of the first line host defense such as lysozyme. In addition, the peptidoglycan and teichoic acid may represent bacterial ligands recognized by the innate immune system of the host. The recent introduction of high resolution analytical techniques and genetic approaches began to shed light on the determinants and biological functions of the pneumococcal cell wall. In this study we describe the identification of a genetic determinant, pgdA, of the first bacterial peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase. We show that the innate activity of this enzyme is responsible for the high proportion of non-acetylated hexosamine residues in the peptidoglycan that appears to play a role in the resistance of S. pneumoniae to the activity of exogenous lysozyme, an enzyme that is known to accumulate in high concentrations at infection sites. Cultures ofS. pneumoniae R36A, a non-encapsulated laboratory strain from the Rockefeller University collection, were grown in a casein-based semi-synthetic medium (C + Y) containing 1 mg/ml yeast extract (7.Horne D.S. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in a chemically defined medium (Cden) (8.Tomasz A. Bacteriological Proceedings 1964: Abstract of the 64th Annual Meeting. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1964: 29Google Scholar) at 37 °C without aeration. Plasmid pJDC9 (9.Chen J.D. Morrison D.A. Gene. 1988; 64: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was used for insertion duplication mutagenesis. Escherichia coli DH5α was grown in Luria broth medium at 37 °C with aeration. If necessary, erythromycin (Sigma) was added in the following concentrations: 1 mg/ml (E. coli) and 1 μg/ml (S. pneumoniae). Routine methods were used for the isolation and manipulation of DNA (10.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 11.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Struh K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and were used as recommended by the manufacturer. Preliminary sequence data were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research. Open reading frames were analyzed using DNASTAR software. Sequence comparisons were performed with the BLAST algorithm. CLUSTAL was used for multiple sequence alignments. A DNA fragment (1801 base pairs) including the pgdA gene was amplified by PCR1 from chromosomal DNA isolated from S. pneumoniae R36A with the primers TCTACAGATACGGATGTTGG and CTATCTTTGATTGCTTGACC using the GeneAmp PCR reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer). The following conditions were used for amplification: 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min, and one final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. After purification (PCR purification kit, Promega) the DNA sequence was determined by primer walking at the Rockefeller University Protein/DNA Technology Center with theTaq fluorescent dye terminator sequencing method by using a PE/ABI 377 automated sequencer. The gene encoding the peptidoglycan GlcNAc deacetylase was inactivated by insertion duplication mutagenesis. An internal fragment of the gene was amplified from chromosomal DNA of strain R36A by PCR using the GeneAmp PCR reagent kit (Perkin-Elmer) with the following primers: 5′-GGTGAATTCGGAGTCGTTAATCGTAATGTGACC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGATCCCAACAACATGACCTTCAGATTTTATC-3′. With these primers,EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced. The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 100 μl with 20 ng of template DNA, 40 pmol of primers, and 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase using the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min, and one final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. After purification (Promega PCR purification kit) the PCR product and plasmid pJDC9 were restricted with EcoRI andBamHI. After purification (Promega DNA purification kit) the internal gene fragment and the plasmid were ligated, and the resulting vector pPGDA was transformed into E. coli DH5α with selection for erythromycin resistance. Next, pPGDA was isolated (Promega plasmid miniprep) and used as donor DNA to transform competentS. pneumoniae R36A. Competent bacteria were obtained by a published procedure (12.Lacks S. Genetics. 1966; 53: 207-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with addition of competence-stimulating peptide (13.Morrison D.A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Transformation was performed by 30 min of incubation at 30 °C followed by a phenotypic expression period of 2 h at 37 °C and growth on tryptic soy agar containing 3% sheep blood and 1 μg/ml erythromycin (12.Lacks S. Genetics. 1966; 53: 207-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One transformant was picked, and the correct insertion of the plasmid into the chromosome was verified by PCR analysis (data not shown). The mutant was able to grow in 1 μg/ml erythromycin. However, because the growth rate was reduced, we included erythromycin only in the pre-cultures and not in the cultures used for the experiments in order to have growth conditions similar to that of the parental strain. The labeling of cell walls of strain R36A was as described previously (14.Hakenbeck R. Waks S. Tomasz A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1978; 13: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The bacteria were first grown in Cden synthetic medium and then transferred into Cden medium with a reduced concentration of glucose (0.1 mg/ml) containing 1.2 μCi/ml [3H]GlcNAc (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After three generations of growth the cells were harvested, and cell walls were isolated. The specific radioactivity was 3.4 × 106cpm/mg of cell wall with 70% of the label being present in cell wall teichoic acid and 30% in the peptidoglycan glycan strands (data not shown). Pneumococcal cell walls were prepared from cultures in exponential growth phase as described (15.Garcia-Bustos J.F. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 447-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications described in Ref. 16.Severin A. Horne D. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Wall teichoic acid was removed by treatment with hydrofluoric acid (16.Severin A. Horne D. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to obtain peptidoglycan. Cell walls wereN-acetylated according to the method of Heymann et al. (17.Heymann H. Maniello J.M. Barkulis S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2981-2985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A suspension of 2 mg/ml cell walls in water was cooled with ice water, and subsequently 0.25 volume of saturated NaHCO3 and 0.25 volume of freshly prepared 5% acetic anhydride were added. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C. After a second aliquot of 0.25 volume of 5% acetic anhydride was added, the mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C and for 1 h at 25 °C. The peptidoglycan was recovered by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min, washed three times with water, and resuspended in water. [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptidoglycan (7.5 μg, 14,000 cpm), either non-modified or N-acetylatedin vitro, was incubated with different murein hydrolases in a total volume of 100 μl for 60 min at 37 °C. The enzyme concentrations and buffers were as follows: 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for affinity-purified LytA (10 μg/ml) (18.Sanchez-Puelles J.M. Ronda C. Garcia J.L. Garcia P. Lopez R. Garcia E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 158: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) for chicken egg white lysozyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (20 μg/ml) and for mutanolysin fromStreptomyces globisporus (Sigma) (40 μg/ml). After addition of 100 μl of 1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and an incubation on ice for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the radioactivity in 100 μl of supernatant was determined as described (19.Kusser W. Schwarz U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 103: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Free amino groups in the glycan strands of the peptidoglycan were detected by derivatization with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene according to a modified published method (20.Brenner M. Niederwieser A. Pataki G. Stahl E. Thin-layer Chromatography: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1969: 730-786Crossref Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled peptidoglycan (see above) was incubated with 4 volumes of 10% sodium carbonate and 0.8 volume of 20% fluorodinitrobenzene (in acetone) for 3 h at 37 °C. The yellowish peptidoglycan was recovered by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min, washed three times with water, and resuspended in water. Concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to give a final concentration of 4m, and after flushing with nitrogen, the tube was sealed, and the sample was hydrolyzed at 105 °C for 14 h. The HCl was removed in an air flow, and the samples were dried in vacuo. To prepare a standard of the derivatized products, either [3H]GlcNAc or 3H-labeled peptidoglycan (label in GlcNAc and MurNAc) was first hydrolyzed and then derivatized as described above. The fluorodinitrophenyl derivatives of glucosamine and of muramic acid were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a 3-μm ODS Hypersil column (Keystone Scientific) at 50 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 70 min using a slightly convex gradient beginning with 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 2.0) and ending with a mixture of 40% 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 60% acetonitrile. The tritium-labeled amino sugar derivatives were detected using a flow-through scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.) with Ultima-Flo AP scintillator (Packard Instrument Co.) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Peptidoglycan (2 mg/ml) was digested with 80 μg/ml affinity-purified pneumococcal amidase for 24 h at 37 °C as described (16.Severin A. Horne D. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 1997; 3: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the glycan strands were separated from the peptides by size-exclusion chromatography using a Keystone GFS-150 column. The compounds were eluted with water at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The glycan-containing fraction was concentrated in a SpeedVac and stored at 4 °C. To test for deacetylated amino sugars, the glycan fraction was digested with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.3) for 90 min at 37 °C. The samples were divided, and one part was N-acetylated with acetic anhydride as described above. Both aliquots were reduced with sodium borohydride and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a 3-μm ODS Hypersil column (Keystone) at 50 °C. Elution was at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 70 min by a slightly convex gradient beginning with a mixture of 97.5% 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 2.0) and 2.5% methanol and ending with 82% 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 2.0) and 18% methanol. The eluted compounds were detected by UV absorption at 206 nm. Peptidoglycan (2 mg/ml) was digested with 0.5 mg/ml mutanolysin (Sigma) in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5). The resulting muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydride and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC according to Severin et al. 2A. Severin, Z.-H. Huang, D. A. Gage, and A. Tomasz, unpublished results. using similar conditions as in a published method (21.Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W. Billot-Klein D. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of studies on the characterization of cell wall glycan strands, we made the unexpected observation that the native peptidoglycan of this bacterium was a poor substrate for lysozyme; only 11% of the peptidoglycan was solubilized even after extensive treatment with this enzyme (Fig. 1). Re-testing lysozyme sensitivity with chemically acetylated peptidoglycan resulted in rapid and complete hydrolysis of the glycan chains, suggesting that the pneumococcal glycan strains may not be fully acetylated (Fig. 1). The LytA amidase had higher activity against the non-modified peptidoglycan, and the M1 muramidase showed similar activities toward both substrates. The mechanisms of these effects are not understood. To test whether GlcNAc, MurNAc, or both amino sugars of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan were non-acetylated, the free amino groups of [3H]GlcNAc-labeled peptidoglycan were derivatized with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene. After total hydrolysis the fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and the radioactive amino sugars and their derivatives were detected with a flow-through scintillation counter. As shown in Fig.2, lack of acetylation was mainly the property of glucosamine residues. Assuming both amino sugars were3H-labeled equally, it was estimated that 84% of GlcN and 10% of MurN residues were present in non-acetylated form in the pneumococcal peptidoglycan (Fig. 2). AnN-acetylglucosamine deacetylase activity in E. coli that also deacetylatesN-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate was described previously (22.Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 115-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the E. coli NagA was reported to be anN-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase involved inN-acetylglucosamine metabolism (23.Peri K.G. Goldie H. Waygood E.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 123-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Partly deacetylated hexosamine polymers or oligosaccharides such as the extracellular galactosamine polymer produced by Aspergillus parasiticushave also been described (24.Distler J.J. Roseman S. J.

For the identification of genes encoding putative peptidoglycan deacetylases we searched data bases for proteins with homology to known N-deacetylases of macromolecules with structures similar to peptidoglycan such as poly(β-1,4)GlcNAc (chitin) or oligo(β-1,4)GlcNAc (nodulation factors). In the unfinished nucleotide sequence of S. pneumoniae obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research we found only one open reading frame encoding a putative GlcNAc N-deacetylase. We named the gene pgdA for peptidoglycanN-acetylglucosamine deacetylaseA. Fig. 3 shows the sequence alignment of the C-terminal region of the protein with two chitin deacetylases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and with NodB from Sinorhizobium meliloti. The deduced sequence of PgdA consists of 463 amino acids. The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 52,699.74 Da. Only the C-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 252–422) shows homology to other known deacetylases. This region has 27% identity and 50% similarity to chitin deacetylase 1 of yeast (CDA1). Specific residues conserved in the known deacetylases CDA1 and CDA2 in yeast and NodB proteins in rhizobium species were also identified in the pneumococcal deacetylase (Fig. 3). The N-terminal part of PgdA (amino acids 1–251) does not have significant homology to any known protein in the data bases. Non-acetylated hexosamine residues have been reported to be present in the peptidoglycans of many bacteria, especially inBacillus species, although no genes encoding for such an enzyme were identified (25.Araki Y.

In searching the data bases for hypothetical proteins similar in sequence to the pneumococcal PgdA protein we found other putative peptidoglycan deacetylases in bacterial species having partially deacetylated peptidoglycan: three hypothetical proteins in Bacillus subtilis (GenBankTMaccession numbers AAC46306, BAA23389, and CAA74511) and one NodB homolog protein in both Bacillus stearothermophilus(GenBankTM accession number B47692) and Bacillus cereus (GenBankTM accession number CAB40600). In addition, there are hypothetical proteins with similarities in sequence to PgdA in the data base of the unfinished microbial genomes (provided by the Institute for Genomic Research), including hypothetical proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. It remains to be verified experimentally whether these proteins deacetylate the bacterial peptidoglycan or other macromolecules like chitin. A 601-base pair insert of the gene (from base 370 to 970) was amplified by PCR from chromosomal DNA of the laboratory strain R36A. The fragment was cloned into plasmid pJDC9, which carries an erythromycin resistance marker. Cloning was performed in E. coli. The resulting plasmid, pPGDA, was used to transform competent cells of S. pneumoniae R36A. Because the plasmid could not replicate in S. pneumoniae, resistance to erythromycin could only be acquired by a homologous recombination event yielding two truncated copies of the target gene on the chromosome, flanking the inserted plasmid with the erythromycin resistance marker. One erythromycin-resistant clone with an inactivated pgdAgene was used in all subsequent studies. The cell walls of the mutant strain as well as those of the parental strain R36A were isolated, and the peptidoglycan parts were analyzed in two different ways. First, the peptidoglycan was digested with a muramidase (mutanolysin), yielding disaccharides substituted by the peptide side chains (muropeptides), which were separated by HPLC. As shown in Fig.4, compounds previously shown to represent partly N-deacetylated muropeptides were not present in the peptidoglycan of the pgdA mutant (arrows in Fig. 4). The absence of N-deacetylated muropeptides resulted in an overall simplification of the muropeptide pattern of the mutant cell wall as compared with that of R36A. In the parental strain, the region of higher cross-linked muropeptides (dimers to tetramers) between 35 and 70 min of the elution profile contained a large number of non-resolvable peaks presumably representing variants of N-deacetylated muropeptides carrying the same peptide side chains. In contrast, the muropeptide profile of thepgdA mutant showed fewer peaks, which were better resolved in this region. In a second analytical approach the purified glycan strands free of the stem peptide side chains were analyzed. Stem peptides were released from peptidoglycan by the pneumococcal amidase LytA. Parental and mutant peptidoglycans were digested by the amidase with similar rates, whereas amidase activity was considerably slower with the chemically acetylated peptidoglycan. Glycan strands were purified by size-exclusion chromatography and were treated with lysozyme. The glycan strands of the parental strain were found to be partlyN-deacetylated as indicated by the incompleteness of the lysozyme digestion (Fig. 5): in addition to the expected main products, the reduced form of GlcNAcMurNAc and (GlcNAcMurNAc)2, additional peaks appeared in the elution profile between 30 and 50 min. After chemical N-acetylationin vitro these peaks became better resolved and shifted toward higher retention times, indicating that the peaks represented glycan fragments with different N-deacetylation patterns. In contrast to the glycan strands of the parental strain, the glycan purified from the pgdA-inactivated mutant was quantitatively digested by lysozyme to the disaccharide and the tetrasaccharide, and the lysozyme products showed no change in retention times after a chemical N-acetylation. These findings allowed two conclusions. First, the data identified the mechanism of the resistance of pneumococcal peptidoglycan to lysozyme digestion (demonstrated in Fig. 1) as the poor hydrolytic activity of this enzyme against deacetylated glycan strands. Second, the results also suggest that the gene product of pgdA is the primary, if not the only, enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of the hexosamine residues of the peptidoglycan. R36A::pPGDA and the parental strain R36A were grown in semi-synthetic medium (C + Y) at 37 °C. Either in exponential growth phase or shortly after entering the stationary phase, the cultures were divided, and to one part 80 μg/ml lysozyme was added (Fig.6). Control cultures received no lysozyme. The parental strain R36A was not affected by the addition of lysozyme until about 2 h after the onset of stationary phase, when the cultures with lysozyme showed a slightly increased rate of lysis. In contrast, cultures of the mutant strain began to lyse rapidly upon entering the stationary phase. Neither the parental nor the mutant strain was affected by lysozyme during exponential growth. If lysozyme was added to the mutant culture at the onset of stationary phase, lysis started immediately. During studies on the chemical structure of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan we noted the resistance of this macromolecule to lysozyme, suggesting the absence of N-acetyl substitutions of hexosamine residues. The presence of such non-acetylated hexosamines was already observed earlier (30.Ohno N. Yadomae T. Miyazaki T. Carbohydr. Res. 1982; 107: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recently, mass differences of −42 and −84 Da were detected among different pneumococcal muropeptides that otherwise had the same amino acid and amino sugar composition, indicating the loss of acetyl groups from one or more of the N-acetyl amino sugars2 (21.Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W. Billot-Klein D. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was speculated that this could be the result of an artificial deacetylation reaction during preparation of the peptidoglycan (21.Hakenbeck R. Konig A. Kern I. van der Linden M. Keck W. Billot-Klein D. Legrand R. Schoot B. Gutmann L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1831-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our observations do not confirm this speculation. Rather, our results indicate that the deacetylated hexosamines of the pneumococcal peptidoglycan are the products of an enzymatic reaction by a pneumococcal deacetylase encoded by the gene pgdA, which we describe in this study. Two observations strongly suggest that pgdA is the structural gene for a deacetylase. Inactivation results in a virtually complete disappearance of deacetylated residues (see arrowsin Fig. 4), and the relevant C-terminal domain shows 27% identity and 50% similarity to enzymes with similar catalytic activities. The pgdA gene described here is the first bacterial determinant encoding an enzyme activity responsible for the loss ofN-acetyl groups of the peptidoglycan hexosamine residues. The pgdA gene was identified through its sequence similarity with known deacetylases, the fungal chitin deacetylases and the rhizobial NodB proteins. The substrates of these enzymes are polymers or oligomers of β-1,4-linked GlcNAc residues, structures that resemble peptidoglycan glycan strands. Thus, the presence of conserved blocks in the sequence of the catalytic domains of these proteins is not surprising. The pgdA gene of S. pneumoniae encodes for a putative secreted protein with an N-terminal signal peptide typical for Gram-positive bacteria (31.Simonen M. Palva I. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 109-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural features of PgdA imply that the substrate of this enzyme is the polymerized peptidoglycan at some stage of its assembly. There is no cleavage site for any known leader peptidase. Most likely the protein is translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by components of the general secretory pathway and remains anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane by its N-terminal membrane domain. Thereby it would face to the outside and would be able to reach its substrate, the peptidoglycan. By this location of the enzyme, the deacetylation reaction would be a secondary modification, which is in accordance with the known pathway of peptidoglycan synthesis that leads to a fully acetylated glycan backbone (32.Hoeltje J.-V. Schwarz U. Nanninga N. Molecular Cytology of Escherichia coli. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1985: 77-119Google Scholar). The sequence similarity of PgdA with other deacetylases covers only the C-terminal half of the protein. The function of the N-terminal part showing no homology to known proteins remains to be elucidated. It may be involved in substrate recognition and/or specificity or in interactions with other proteins. The presence of non-acetylated aminosugars in the peptidoglycan is not limited to pneumococci (25.Araki Y. Fukuoka S. Oba S. Ito E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26.Atrih A. Bacher G. Allmaier G. Williamson M.P. Foster S.J. J.

Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the increased activity of lysozyme after N-acetylation of partly deacetylated peptidoglycan was also reported in B. cereus(35.Amano K. Hayashi H. Araki Y. Ito E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36.Westmacott D. Perkins H.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 115: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The data search suggests that, similar to pneumococci in bacilli and other bacterial species, the presence of non-acetylated amino sugars in the peptidoglycan is related to the activity of PgdA-like enzymes. The virtually normal growth rate of the pgdA insertional mutant shows that this gene is not essential for in vitrogrowth of S. pneumoniae. The mutant showed no differences in morphology, and the growth rate in exponential phase and the cell density of stationary cultures were only slightly lower as compared with the parental strain. Apparently, under in vitrolaboratory conditions, the reduced number of positively charged amino groups in the peptidoglycan of the mutant seems to have no drastic effect on cell wall-related processes like binding and uptake of ions and nutrition or non-covalent binding of proteins. It is conceivable that the PgdA protein plays a role in controlling the activity of pneumococcal cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes, which may have different activities toward substrates with different levels of deacetylation. The LytB endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase is involved in daughter cell separation (37.Garcia P. Gonzalez M.P. Garcia E. Lopez R. Garcia J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1275-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), whereas the LytC 1,4-β-N-acetylmuramidase increases the rate of autolysis at 30 °C (38.Garcia P. Paz Gonzalez M. Garcia E. Garcia J.L. Lopez R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The deacetylation of the glycan strand GlcNAc residues could be a way of controlling the activities of these potentially autolytic enzymes. The most striking effect of the inactivation of pgdA was the appearance of hypersensitivity of the mutant bacteria to exogenous lysozyme. Lysozyme is part of the first defense of host organisms against bacterial invasion, including response to pneumococcal infection (39.Nonomura N. Giebink G.S. Juhn S.K. Harada T. Aeppli D. Ann. Otol. Rhinol. Laryngol. 1991; 100: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40.Bercovici B. Michel J. Miller J. Sacks T.G. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 1975; 141: 885-887PubMed Google Scholar). Large amounts of lysozyme accumulate both in the cerebrospinal fluid of the rabbit after inoculation with pneumococci in an animal model for bacterial meningitis (41.Cottagnoud P. Tomasz A. J. Infect. Dis. 1993; 167: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in human meningeal disease (42.Klockars M. Reitamo S. Weber T. Kerttula Y. Acta Med. Scand. 1978; 203: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that the pgdA gene may be part of the virulence mechanism of S. pneumoniae, providing increased resistance of the bacterium against the lysozyme of the human host.

Using peptide sequences obtained from the purified rat brain enzyme, we report here the cloning of the human isoform. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein did not show any similarity with proteins of known function but was homologous to three putative proteins from Arabidospis thaliana, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Dictyostelium discoideum. Several blocks of amino acids were highly conserved in all of these proteins. Analysis of the protein sequence revealed the presence at the N terminus of a signal peptide followed by a putative myristoylation site and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. The predicted molecular mass was 84 kDa, and the isoelectric point was 6.69, in agreement with rat brain purified enzyme. Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues showed the presence of a major band corresponding to a size of 3.5 kilobase. Analysis of this major band on the blot indicated that the enzyme is ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart. The enzyme was then overexpressed in HEK 293 and MCF7 cells using the pcDNA3.1/His-ceramidase construct, and ceramidase activity (at pH 9.5) increased by 50- and 12-fold, respectively. Next, the enzyme was characterized using lysate of overexpressing cells. The results confirmed that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramide in the neutral alkaline range and is independent of cations. Finally, a green fluorescent protein-ceramidase fusion protein was constructed to investigate the localization of this enzyme. The results showed that the green fluorescent protein-ceramidase fusion protein presented a mitochondrial localization pattern and colocalized with mitochondrial specific probes. These results demonstrate that this novel ceramidase is a mitochondrial enzyme, and they suggest the existence of a topologically restricted pathways of sphingolipid metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1481770206,"Many diseases, including cancer, are dependent on the growth of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Differences in an individual's ability to grow new blood vessels may influence the rate of progression of these diseases. Here we show that different strains of inbred mice have an approximately 10-fold range of response to growth factor-stimulated angiogenesis in the corneal micropocket assay. The in vitro migratory activity of endothelial cells from aortic rings of selected strains correlated with the in vivo responsiveness. Further, a differential sensitivity to angiogenesis inhibitors was seen between strains, with one strain demonstrating resistance to both TNP-470 and thalidomide. These results suggest the presence of genetic factors that control individual angiogenic potential."

To examine the mechanism of signaling attenuation, we investigated Erk activation after EGF stimulation in senescent cells. Senescent cells did not phosphorylate Erk-1/2 after EGF stimulation, whereas young cells did. In those senescent cells, we found an increased level of caveolin proteins and strong interactions between caveolin-1 and EGF receptor. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated an increased number of caveolae structures in senescent cells. More interestingly, brain, spleen, and lung from 26-month-old rats showed substantial increases of caveolin proteins. However, in the case of p53-induced senescence, caveolin-1 was not induced, and EGF stimulation phosphorylated Erk-1/2 as much as young control cells. Finally, we overexpressed caveolin-1 in young human diploid fibroblasts in which the activation of Erk-1/2 upon EGF stimulation was significantly suppressed. These results suggest that the unresponsiveness of senescent fibroblasts to EGF stimulation may be due to the overexpression of caveolins, which seems to be independent of growth arrest and other aging phenotypes.

Although senescent cells can maintain their metabolic activity, the loss of proliferation capacity may be due to a diminished response to growth factors (2.Matsuda T. Okamura K. Sato Y. Morimoto A.

In aged human diploid fibroblasts, the decreased response to growth factors is suggested to be associated with a repression of c-fos expression, a reduced AP-1 DNA binding, and diminished DNA synthesis.

Caveolin, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo. The stable expression of the caveolin-1 or -3 gene to the mammalian cells without caveolin induced the formation of caveolae structures (12.Lipardi C. Mora R. Colomer V. Paladino S. Nitsch L.

A short cytosolic N-terminal region of caveolin is involved in the formation of oligomers and mediates the interaction with these signal molecules, which results in the inactivation of signaling (11.Lisanti M.P.

The suppression of these signaling molecules can be circumvented by a tumor, wherein caveolins are generally down-regulated. Targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 is sufficient to drive cell transformation and hyperactivates the Erk kinase cascade (19.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Co-expression with caveolin-1 dramatically inhibits signaling from EGFR, Raf, MEK-1, and Erk-2 to the nucleus in vivo (10.Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In order to find an explanation for the attenuated responsiveness to EGF stimulation in senescent cells, we examined the signaling pathways of Erk activation after EGF stimulation. Interestingly, these differences in signaling behavior were consistent with the expression of caveolins in aged cells. Moreover, p53-mediated senescent cells respond differently to EGF stimulation, although they showed the same senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and delayed doubling time. EJ-p53 cells did not express caveolin-1 proteins and did not show the attenuated EGF response despite the phenotypic cellular senescent changes. To know the direct effect of caveolin in HDFs, we overexpressed caveolin-1 in young HDFs. The phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 upon EGF stimulation was significantly blocked by caveolin-1 expression in young HDFs. Our results suggest that the expression of caveolin and the resulting formation of caveolae might be responsible for the attenuation of EGF signaling in senescent cells.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a normal diet for more than 24 months; tumor-free female rats were used for this experiment. 8–10-week-old female rats were used as young controls. After being grown in a semiconfluent state, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (pH 6.0) activity was examined (22.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with β-galactosidase reagent (1 mg/ml X-gal, 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide/potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Total cell or tissue lysates were extracted using extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4) and sonicated briefly. Lysates were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell) using standard techniques. After immunoblotting the membrane with a primary antibody, the immune complex was incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody and finally visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mmNa3VO4) and sonicated briefly. Lysates were spin down at 9,000 rpm for 5 min, and supernatants were incubated with normal mouse serum, anti-EGFR antibody, and anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophosresis and Western blot. Subconfluent cells at early and late PDLs were pelletized and fixed with 3% glutaraldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4. After washing with 0.2 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, cell pellets were treated with 1% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 1 h. The cells were then dehydrated in graded ethanol steps through propylene oxide and embedded in epoxy resin (Polyscience Co.). Ultrathin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were observed using a transmission electron microscope (H-600, Hitachi). Using total cell extracts, total cholesterol levels were measured using the cholesterol oxidase method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The mean value of the cholesterol level and S.E. values were calculated from three independent experiments. Caveolin-1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from old HDF and verified by sequencing. In pcDNA3.1 plasmid DNA (Invitrogen), we subcloned the mammalian expression vector for caveolin-1. Next, we introduced expression vector into young HDF using the liposome-mediated transfection method as described by the manufacturer (LipofectAMINE plus, Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, transfected cells were stimulated with EGF, and the phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 was checked by Western blot. Senescent cells like old rat hepatocytes or old human diploid fibroblasts have been demonstrated to show an age-dependent decline in DNA synthesis and/or cell division upon growth factor stimulation. To explore the mechanism of the reduced response to EGF stimulation with aging, we first examined the phosphorylation and activation of Erk kinases in old cells. Two kinds of primary human fibroblasts were used: primary HDFs isolated from newborn foreskin (20.Park S.C. Yeo E.-J. Han J.-A. Hwang Y.-C. Choi J.-Y. Park J.S. Park Y.-H. Kim K.-O. Kim I.-G. Seong S.-C. Kwak S.-J. J. Gerontol. 1999; 54: B78-B83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and IMR-90, human lung fibroblast from ATCC. These cells were kept as described previously (23.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and classified as young (PDL less than 30), middle-aged (PDL 35–45), and old (PDL more than 60) cells. Each group of HDFs was stimulated with EGF, and the activation of Erk-1/2 was determined by Western blot. In both the young and middle-aged cells, Erk-1/2 kinases were phosphorylated within 5 min, and the resulting activation was sustained for 15 min after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). However, the phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 from old HDF was not detected until 15 min had lapsed. Although previous reports have shown the expression of EGFR or downstream signaling molecules in old cells (2.Matsuda T. Okamura K. Sato Y. Morimoto A. Ono M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,24.Kitano S. Bohr V.A. Reed T.D. Haggerty C.M. May A. Roth G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a comparison is needed of the age-dependent level of signaling proteins like Erk kinases and EGFR. The expression level of Erk kinases and EGFR was not changed by the increase of population doubling in Western blot (Fig. 1 B), despite the down-regulation of EGF signaling to Erk kinases. Therefore, the reduced responsiveness of old cells may not be due to the altered protein turnover and post-translational modification, since old HDF cells expressed a comparable amount of EGFR and Erk kinases. These results suggested that there would be a specific modulation mechanism for the signal attenuation and reduced proliferation of old cells upon EGF stimulation. Caveolae have been reported to regulate EGF signaling through direct interactions with EGFR. First we examined whether the expression level of caveolin-1 was increased upon aging HDF (Fig.2 A). With aging, a 22–24-kDa caveolin-1 protein was expressed increasingly in both HDF and IMR-90. Next we tried to examine whether the EGFR from old HDF could interact with caveolin-1, which might suppress EGF signaling through direct molecular interaction as described previously (17.Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Lysates from young and old HDF were precipitated with normal mouse sera, anti-caveolin-1 antibody, or anti-EGFR antibody. Then each immune complex was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot using anti-caveolin-1 antibody or anti-EGFR antibody. The immune complex of EGFR from old HDF contained caveolin-1 proteins, while young fibroblasts did not show a comparable amount of caveolin-1 and subsequent interactions with EGFR (Fig. 2 B). Although we did not check the kinase activity of EGFR in old HDF, molecular interaction between caveolin and EGFR may mediate the attenuation of EGF signaling in old HDF. Caveolin-2, a homolog of caveolin-1 (25.Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), is expressed ubiquitously in most cell types, supposedly forming a hetero-oligomer in basolaterally localized caveolae (26.Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although the overexpression of caveolin-2 was not sufficient to form functional caveolae structures (27.Li S. Galbiati F. Volonté D. Sargiacomo M. Engelman J.A. Das K. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it would be important to know whether the up-regulation of caveolin-1 is accompanied by an overexpression of caveolin-2. Fig. 2 Ashows that the expression of caveolin-2 in both HDF and IMR-90 was increased with aging, like caveolin-1. The role of caveolin-2 is not well defined, but we suggest that caveolin-2 might potentiate caveolae formation in aged cells. Although the expression of caveolin-3 is restricted to striated muscle cells (28.Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), heterologous expression of caveolin-3 in old human fibroblasts was detected in both HDF and IMR-90 (Fig. 2 A). Caveolin-1, a key constituent of caveolae structures, forms caveolae structures in old HDF. Electron microscopic experiments of plasmalemmal profiles from old (PDL 55–65) HDF revealed the presence of numerous non-clathrin-coated vesicular structures, 50–100 nm in diameter, that are juxtaposed to the plasma membrane and are morphologically indistinguishable from caveolae (Fig.3 A). In contrast, profiles of young (PDL 20–25) cells contained significantly less caveolae-like structure. Quantitative analysis of multiple plasmalemmal profile revealed that old fibroblasts contained over 10 times more caveolae-like structure than young cells (0.5/μm versus5.2/μm, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). Extrapolation of in vitro changes of old cells to in vivo old rat tissues will confer a biological significance in aging research. Every old tissue consists of heterogeneous cell types, especially in the case of proliferation potential. However, the overall function and responsiveness of each organ was significantly down-regulated with aging. To compare the expression of caveolin proteins in each organ, young 2-month-old and old 27-month-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed, and the solid organs were dissected out for Western blot analysis. In Fig. 4, all of the major organs showed markedly increased level of caveolin-1 proteins. Aged brain, kidney, lung, and spleen in particular expressed significant quantities of caveolin-1 proteins as well as caveolin-2 and caveolin-3. Moreover, some tissues such as brain, thymus, and spleen showed that the expression of caveolins was highly increased in the old tissues, which is in contrast to their undetectable levels of expression of the young tissues. From these results, the up-regulation of caveolin proteins was consistently found in vivo in old tissues, implicating the role of caveolins in various aging-related phenomena. Senescence-like growth arrest by expression of p53 in EJ human bladder carcinoma cells induced cellular senescence (21.Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To find the causal relationship between caveolin and signaling in old cells, we used EJ-p53 cells as an induced aging model. EJ-p53 cells were induced for senescence by removal of tetracycline from the culture media for more than 7 days. p53 and p21 were induced in p53-induced EJ human bladder carcinoma cells (Fig. 5 A). Senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was also increased in p53-induced EJ cells (data not shown). However, the responses to EGF stimulation in p53-induced senescent cells were intact despite their phenotypic changes (Fig. 5 B) and different from those responses in naturally senescent cells. Namely, after treatment of EGF to EJ-p53 cells, Erk-1/2 kinases were well phosphorylated as much as control proliferating cells. The ready responsiveness of EGF signaling in EJ-p53 cells regardless of the senescent phenotypic changes suggests that some different biochemical changes other than overexpression of p53 might be involved for the regulation of EGF signaling, for which we assumed that caveolin would play an important role. Therefore, we examined the expression of caveolin proteins in EJ-p53 cells, but we could not detect the overexpression of caveolin-1 proteins, which was quite different from the behavior of naturally aged cells (Fig.5 A). Moreover, an age-related increase in free cholesterol is associated with a decrease in the phospholipid content (29.Cohen B.M. Zubenko G.S. Life Sci. 1985; 37: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30.Alvarez E. Ruiz-Gutierrez V. Santa Maria C. Machado A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 71: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which might contribute to the increased caveolin expression (31.Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To know whether the aging of HDF correlates with the increasing level of cholesterol, we examined the total cholesterol in old HDF. As shown in Fig.5 C, total cholesterol level of old HDF was 1.8 times higher than young HDF. However, in the case of EJ-p53 cells, the level of cholesterol was not increased despite the induction of phenotypic senescence. The increased level of cholesterol was well matched with the up-regulation of caveolin-1 protein, both of which are the key constituents of caveolae structures. If caveolin acts dominantly in age-related attenuation of EGF signaling, the overexpression of caveolin in young fibroblast might inhibit the activation of Erk-1/2 upon EGF stimulation. To this end, we overexpressed human caveolin-1 cDNA in young HDFs and checked the activation of Erk-1/2 upon EGF stimulation. First, we examined the expression of caveolin-1 in mock- and caveolin-1-transfected cells (Fig. 6 A). After EGF stimulation of those cells, we checked the activation of Erk-1/2 by Western blot using anti-phospho-Erk antibody. As shown in Fig.6 B, the phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 was inhibited by the overexpression of caveolin-1 in young HDFs. The expression level of Erk-1/2 was not affected by transfection. These data suggest that the overexpression of caveolin-1 is sufficient to inhibit the EGF signaling in human diploid fibroblasts. Senescent cells are generally resistant not only to extrinsic noxious stimuli (32.Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 33.Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) but also to growth factor stimulation (2.Matsuda T. Okamura K. Sato Y. Morimoto A. Ono M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3.Seshadri T. Campisi J. Science. 1990; 247: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 4.Riabowol K. Schiff J. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Limited responsiveness to extrinsic and intrinsic stresses might characterize the old cells. Several hypotheses have been suggested for the mechanism involved, such as the repression of genes, modulation of signal cascades, changes in membrane properties, etc. (5.Hensler P.J. Pereira-Smith O.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Ribault D. Habib M. Abdel-Majid K. Barbara A. Mitrovic D. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 100: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7.Peacocke M. Campisi J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the general mechanism or the common denominator for the unresponsiveness of the old cells has not yet been established. In this work, we have demonstrated that mechanistically caveolins or caveolae would play an important role in the regulation of signaling in the old cells. We have found that late passage old cells, either HDF or IMR-90, are enriched with all subtypes of caveolin-1, -2, and -3 and the numerous non-clathrin-coated vesicular structures. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that caveolins were strongly bound to EGFR in the old cells, while binding was negligible in young cells, implicating the functional role in the modulation of EGF signaling in the old cells. Moreover, we showed that the overexpression of caveolin-1 in young HDF suppressed the signaling from EGF to Erk-1/2. These data strongly indicate that senescent cells are enriched with caveolae structures and caveolin proteins, which might be involved in the regulation of cellular signal transduction pathways through the direct interactions with signaling molecules. It is well known that transformed cells, including cancer cells, show a reduced level of caveolins and caveolae organelles (10.Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Targeted down-regulation of caveolin-1 is sufficient to drive cell transformation and to hyperactivate the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, which suggests that caveolins would suppress the transformation (19.Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The expression of caveolin-1 in CHO cells inhibits signaling from EGFR, Raf, MEK-1, and Erk-2 to the nucleus (10.Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The anchorage-independent growth of transformed fibroblasts also disappeared by the overexpression of caveolin-1 (36.Engelman J.A. Wykoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6374-6381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Cellular senescence was presumed to be the opposite phenomenon of the transformation. In contrast with the transformed cells, senescent cells showed reduced responsiveness, which could have been due to the elevated level of caveolins. We could successfully prove that the overexpression of caveolin-1 in young HDF directly down-regulated the phosphorylation of Erk-1/2 in response to EGF. We have compared the expression levels of caveolins in vivoto confirm our in vitro data. As summarized in Fig. 4, the organs from old animals (27 months old) showed the ubiquitous high level of caveolin-1 expression compared with those from young animals (2 months old). Interestingly, several organs, such as brain and spleen, expressed caveolin-1 protein in significantly higher amounts only in the aged state. In the cases of caveolin-2 and -3, their expressions were rather limited in an organ-specific manner, but as was the case with caveolin-1 expression, the prominent high expression in the old organs was evident. The organ-specific up-regulation of caveolins in an age-dependent manner would explain the characteristic aging process of the respective organ. For example, the high level of caveolins in the brain tissues from old animals might provide a clue to the susceptibility of elderly people to Alzheimer's disease. Since caveolin-1 promotes α-secretase processing, while caveolin-3 interacts and colocalizes with amyloid precursor protein both in vivo and in vitro, augmented expression of caveolins may alter amyloid precursor protein processing and lead to an overproduction of toxic amyloid metabolites (37.Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38.Nishiyama K. Trapp B.D. Ikezu T.

In addition, the up-regulation of caveolin with aging is suggested to relate to insulin resistance, resulting in susceptibility to diabetes mellitus (39.Munoz P. Mora S. Sevilla L. Kaliman P. Tomas E. Guma A. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8133-8139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may be worthwhile to study the age-related degenerative disorders in association with the expression of caveolins. Recently, there have been several reports that cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of agents such as H2O2, sodium butyrate, UV irradiation, and induction of p53 or several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (21.Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23.Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), evaluated by irreversible growth arrest, cytomorphometry, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Although the general mechanism for induced senescence is debatable, in the genetic aspect, the forced expression of p53, as one of major senescence-associated genes, has been emphasized. Using EJ-p53 cells (21.Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we could readily induce the cellular senescence-like changes by the control of tetracycline, resembling the morphological and biochemical characteristics of naturally senescent cells. However, when the senescence was induced in EJ-p53 cells, the expressions of caveolins were not significant, while those of p53 and p21 were markedly increased (Fig. 5 A). Moreover, the downstream signal cascade of EGFR was not inhibited in senescence-induced EJ-p53 cells (Fig. 5 B). This finding proves that the down-regulation of EGFR signaling in the aged cells can be directly ascribed to the level of caveolins in one aspect and that the overexpression of p53 is not sufficient to convert the cells into the functionally senescent state in other aspect. Although caveolin-2 was induced in EJ-p53 cells, the sole expression of caveolin-2 cannot form the structurally and functionally compatible caveolae structurein vivo (27.Li S. Galbiati F. Volonté D. Sargiacomo M. Engelman J.A. Das K. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). From these results, we could reach a tentative conclusion that the expression of caveolins is essential to maintain the senescent property. It was suggested that a high level of cholesterol is required to form caveolae structure and that cholesterol plays an important role in the activation of caveolin (40.Li S. Song K.S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 568-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that the general unresponsiveness of old cells either to growth signals or to apoptotic stimuli could be ascribed to the alteration of the cell membrane properties. Membrane lipids constantly undergo peroxidation by repeated toxic insults, and the lipid composition changes; levels of cholesterol are increased, and, inversely, phospholipid is decreased (29.Cohen B.M. Zubenko G.S. Life Sci. 1985; 37: 1403-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30.Alvarez E. Ruiz-Gutierrez V. Santa Maria C. Machado A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 71: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32.Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). When we checked cholesterol levels, it was found that the old HDF cells showed higher levels of cholesterol than young HDF cells (Fig. 5 C), but the senescence-induced EJ-p53 cells did not show these high levels of cholesterol. This result may provide a clue to the low level of caveolins in EJ-p53 cells. Actually, in a study of caveolin-1 gene promoter, it was reported that caveolin-1 gene promoter contains sterol regulatory element-like sequences, which are comparable with those identified in several genes for the regulation of influx and biosynthesis of cholesterol (41.Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This may explain that induction of senescence by overexpression of p53 in EJ-p53 cells is not accompanied by the high expression of caveolins, because the increase in cholesterol level does not occur. The importance of cholesterol in the regulation of caveolin expression or activation might imply the significance of nutritional intervention in the aging process. We are grateful to Dr. Sam W. Lee for helpful discussions, Dr. D Y. Shin for EJ-p53 cells, and C. J. Yoon for EM analysis. We also thank all of the members of the laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W1750381543,"Glycosphingolipids, including gangliosides, are emerging as signaling intermediates of extracellular stimuli. Because mitochondria play a key role in the orchestration of death signals, we assessed the interaction of GD3 ganglioside (GD3) with mitochondria and the subsequent cascade of events that culminate in cell death. In vitro studies with isolated mitochondria from rat liver demonstrate that GD3 elicited a burst of peroxide production within 15-30 min, which preceded the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition, followed by cytochrome c (cyt c) release. These effects were mimicked by lactosylceramide and N-acetyl-sphingosine but not by sphinganine or sphingosine and were prevented by cyclosporin A and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Reconstitution of mitochondria pre-exposed to GD3 with cytosol from rat liver in a cell-free system resulted in the proteolytic processing of procaspase 3 and subsequent caspase 3 activation. Intact hepatocytes or U937 cells selectively depleted of glutathione in mitochondria by 3-hydroxyl-4-pentenoate (HP) with the sparing of cytosol reduced glutathione (GSH) were sensitized to GD3, manifested as an apoptotic death. Inhibition of caspase 3 prevented the apoptotic phenotype of HP-treated cells caused by GD3 without affecting cell survival; in contrast, BHT fully protected HP-treated cells to GD3 treatment. Treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor increased the level of GD3, whereas blockers of mitochondrial respiration at complex I and II protected sensitized cells to GD3 treatment. Thus, the effect of GD3 as a lipid death effector is determined by its interaction with mitochondria leading to oxidant-dependent caspase activation. Mitochondrial glutathione plays a key role in controlling cell survival through modulation of the oxidative stress induced by glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1978663690,"IscS, a cysteine desulfurase implicated in the repair of Fe-S clusters, was recently shown to act as a sulfurtransferase in the biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine (s4U) in tRNA (Kambampati, R., and Lauhon, C. T. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 16561–16568). In frame deletion of the iscS gene in Escherichia coli results in a mutant strain that lacks s4U in its tRNA. Assays of cell-free extracts isolated from the iscS −strain confirm the complete loss of tRNA sulfurtransferase activity. In addition to lacking s4U, the iscS −strain requires thiamin and nicotinic acid for growth in minimal media. The thiamin requirement can be relieved by the addition of the thiamin precursor 5-hydroxyethyl-4-methylthiazole, indicating thatiscS is required specifically for thiazole biosynthesis. The growth rate of the iscS − strain is half that of the parent strain in rich medium. When theiscS− strain is switched from rich to minimal medium containing thiamin and nicotinate, growth is preceded by a considerable lag period relative to the parent strain. Addition of isoleucine results in a significant reduction in the duration of this lag phase. To examine the thiazole requirement, we have reconstituted the in vitro biosynthesis of ThiS thiocarboxylate, the ultimate sulfur donor in thiazole biosynthesis, and we show that IscS mobilizes sulfur for transfer to the C-terminal carboxylate of ThiS. ThiI, a known factor involved in both thiazole and s4U synthesis, stimulates this sulfur transfer step by 7-fold. Extracts from the iscS − strain show significantly reduced activity in the in vitro synthesis of ThiS thiocarboxylate. Transformation of the iscS −strain with an iscS expression plasmid complemented all of the observed phenotypic effects of the deletion mutant. Of the remaining two nifS-like genes in E. coli,neither can complement loss of iscS when each is overexpressed in the iscS − strain. Thus, IscS plays a significant and specific role at the top of a potentially broad sulfur transfer cascade that is required for the biosynthesis of thiamin, NAD, Fe-S clusters, and thionucleosides. IscS, a cysteine desulfurase implicated in the repair of Fe-S clusters, was recently shown to act as a sulfurtransferase in the biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine (s4U) in tRNA (Kambampati, R., and Lauhon, C. T. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 16561–16568). In frame deletion of the iscS gene in Escherichia coli results in a mutant strain that lacks s4U in its tRNA. Assays of cell-free extracts isolated from the iscS −strain confirm the complete loss of tRNA sulfurtransferase activity. In addition to lacking s4U, the iscS −strain requires thiamin and nicotinic acid for growth in minimal media. The thiamin requirement can be relieved by the addition of the thiamin precursor 5-hydroxyethyl-4-methylthiazole, indicating thatiscS is required specifically for thiazole biosynthesis. The growth rate of the iscS − strain is half that of the parent strain in rich medium. When theiscS− strain is switched from rich to minimal medium containing thiamin and nicotinate, growth is preceded by a considerable lag period relative to the parent strain. Addition of isoleucine results in a significant reduction in the duration of this lag phase. To examine the thiazole requirement, we have reconstituted the in vitro biosynthesis of ThiS thiocarboxylate, the ultimate sulfur donor in thiazole biosynthesis, and we show that IscS mobilizes sulfur for transfer to the C-terminal carboxylate of ThiS. ThiI, a known factor involved in both thiazole and s4U synthesis, stimulates this sulfur transfer step by 7-fold. Extracts from the iscS − strain show significantly reduced activity in the in vitro synthesis of ThiS thiocarboxylate. Transformation of the iscS −strain with an iscS expression plasmid complemented all of the observed phenotypic effects of the deletion mutant. Of the remaining two nifS-like genes in E. coli,neither can complement loss of iscS when each is overexpressed in the iscS − strain. Thus, IscS plays a significant and specific role at the top of a potentially broad sulfur transfer cascade that is required for the biosynthesis of thiamin, NAD, Fe-S clusters, and thionucleosides. 4-thiouridine ThiS thiocarboxylate sulfane sulfur polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride high pressure liquid chromatography base pair isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside Cysteine has been shown to be the source of sulfur for the biosynthesis of a variety of cofactors such as biotin, lipoic acid, and thiamin (1.Begley T.P. Xi J. Kinsland C. Taylor S. McLafferty F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as metallosulfur clusters in proteins (2.Sticht H. Rosch P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 95-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and thionucleotides in tRNA (3.Ajitkumar P. Cherayil J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 103-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite identification of the source, the biochemical pathways for sulfur incorporation into these molecules remain elusive. A major advance in this area was the report by Dean and co-workers (4.Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) that the NifS protein from Azotobacter vinelandii is a cysteine desulfurase that is required for the maintenance of the metallosulfur clusters in nitrogenase. A similar enzyme in Escherichia coli, termed IscS, has been shown to mobilize sulfur from cysteine for the repair of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in apo-dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (5.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Zheng et al. (6.Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) have reported that many organisms contain iscShomologs in a gene cluster thought to be involved in the maintenance of [Fe-S] proteins. Unsuccessful attempts to delete iscS inA. vinelandii suggest that it is required for viability in that organism (6.Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). We recently reported that in E. coli, IscS also functions as a sulfurtransferase for the in vitro biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine in tRNA (8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Lipsett and co-workers (9.Lipsett M.N. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1978; 135: 993-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that s4U1 was synthesized by two factors, A and C, that were the products of thenuvA and nuvC genes, respectively. Interestingly, the nuvC mutant, which lacked s4U in its tRNA, also required thiamin for growth in minimal media (12.Ryals J. Hsu R.-Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThethiI gene was recently identified as a requirement for both s4U (13.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and thiamin synthesis (16.Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.-J. Costello C.A. Backstrom A.D.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have elegantly shown that in E. coli the ultimate sulfur donor in thiamin biosynthesis is a C-terminal thiocarboxylate of the ThiS protein. Studies with athiI − strain revealed that thiI is required for ThiS-COSH synthesis in vivo (16.Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.-J. Costello C.A. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The shared pathway for s4U and thiamin biosynthesis suggested that ThiI was a sulfurtransferase. However, the factor that initiates the mobilization of sulfur from cysteine for ThiS-COSH synthesis remained unknown (7.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Our finding that IscS was able to complete s4U biosynthesis in vitro (outlined in Fig.1) suggested that it might also function to initiate sulfur transfer in the synthesis of ThiS-COSH. In the present study we have reconstituted ThiS thiocarboxylate formation, and we demonstrate that IscS can indeed provide sulfur in vitrofor the synthesis of ThiS-COSH. E. coli contains three genes, including iscS, with sequence homology to nifS. Thus, it is possible that the in vitro activities observed for IscS are not indicative of its role in vivo. In order to find evidence for thein vivo relevance of iscS in s4U, thiamin, and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, we deleted the iscSgene in E. coli. E. coli strain MC1061 was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. Electrocompetent E. coli MC1061 was obtained from Bio-Rad. Plasmid CL010 contains the E. coli iscS gene ligated into pET21c as described previously (8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Rich media was LB. LB/suc refers to LB supplemented with 5% (w/v) sucrose. Minimal media were generally M63 supplemented with glycerol (0.2% v/v) and l-leucine (40 μg/ml), in addition to the following nutrients as required. Thiamin, nicotinic acid, THZ, and isoleucine were used at a concentration of 2, 50, 50, 40 μg/ml, respectively. Plasmid pKO3 and its derivatives were propagated in LB containing chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method (17.Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9886) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated using a Qiagen Genomic Tip. Electroporation was performed with a BTX electroporator using a protocol provided by the manufacturer specific for E. coliMC1061. DE3 lysogens were prepared using a DE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen). Competent cells of the DE3 lysogens were prepared by the CaCl2 method (18.Petes T.D. Broach J.R. Wensink P.C. Hereford L.M. Fink G.R. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1978; 4: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ThiI was purified from an overproducing strain as described previously (8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unmodified E. colitRNAPhe was prepared by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmid pCF23 (8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and purified by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel using 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA as running buffer. Plasmid pID001 contains 1 kb of E. coli genomic DNA (500 bp each of the 5′- and 3′-flanking region) surrounding the iscS gene. In place of the iscS coding sequence, the plasmid contains a 33-bp tag sequence developed by the laboratory of G. M. Church for the generation of deletion strains in E. coli (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The deletion insert was constructed essentially according to the previously reported PCR method (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Primers (see Table I) were chosen as suggested by computer analysis of the E. coli genome, with the exception of the N-terminal inside primer, Ni, which was changed to correspond to the correct start codon, which we and others (5.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T.

Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) have identified by N-terminal sequencing of IscS. Two asymmetric PCRs using E. coli genomic DNA as a template were performed, one using the No and Ni primers and the other using the Co and Ci primers. The concentration of the outside primers was 0.6 μm, whereas the inside primers were 10-fold lower in order to generate complementary overhangs for the next reaction. After 30 cycles, 1 μl of each reaction was combined in a single new 100-μl PCR containing only the No and Co primers (0.6 μm each) and no additional template DNA. After 15 additional cycles, the desired band at 1.1 kb was purified on a 1% agarose gel followed by extraction with a Qiaquick column (Qiagen). The resulting fragment was digested withNotI and SalI and, after gel purification, was ligated into the NotI-SalI site of pKO3 and transformed by electroporation into electrocompetent E. coliMC1061.Table IStrains, plasmids, and primers used in this workStrains MC1061F−araD139 Δ(ara leu)7696 Δ(lacY74) galU galK hsdr hsdM+ strA CL100 (iscS−)F−araD139 Δ(ara leu)7696 Δ(lacY74) galU galK hsdr hsdM+ ΔiscS strAPlasmids pKO3Deletion plasmid, from Link et al.

Open table in a new tab For primers, restriction sites are underlined, and the 33-bp tag sequence is shown in bold (see “Materials and Methods”). A combination of the methods described by Kushner and co-workers (22.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Church and co-workers (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) was used to facilitate isolation of mutant strains that grow very poorly in rich media. After electroporation of plasmid pID001 (Table I) into E. coli MC1061, the cells (60 μl) were diluted with 1 ml of SOC medium and allowed to recover with shaking at 30 °C for 1 h. A total of 900 μl of the cells were plated onto 5 LB/cam plates prewarmed to 43 °C, and 10 and 50 μl, respectively, were plated onto two LB/cam plates at 30 °C. Two cointegrate colonies were observed on the 43 °C plates, whereas many colonies appeared on the 30 °C plates. The integration frequency was estimated to be 10−5. The two cointegrate colonies were propagated separately in LB/cam for 3 days, by diluting daily into fresh media. The final saturated cultures were serially diluted (10−6) and plated onto LB/cam plates at 30 °C to isolate resolved cointegrates. Plasmid DNA was isolated from overnight cultures of a master plate of 20 clones, and 4 were found to have the wild type gene on the plasmid, indicating a possible gene replacement event. Two of these colonies were then picked separately into 3 ml of LB, serially diluted (10−4) and plated onto LB/suc plates for plasmid release. A master plate of the LB/suc colonies was replica-plated onto an LB/cam plate to identify colonies that had lost plasmid and were chloramphenicol-sensitive (CmS). Several CmS colonies were then grown overnight in 3 ml of LB for isolation of genomic DNA. PCR analysis of the genomic DNA was performed using primers that flanked the iscS gene. Growth rates of wild type andiscS − strains were measured as follows. A single colony of either the wild type or iscS −strains was grown in 3 ml of LB to saturation. A 200-fold dilution was then made into 100 ml of LB, and cell density was monitored by absorbance at 595 nm. Growth in minimal media was measured in the same manner as above. Growth measurements when switching from rich to minimal media were made by diluting saturated cultures of either the parent or iscS− strains grown in LB medium into minimal medium containing additives as indicated. tRNA sulfurtransferase activity for s4U formation was measured as described previously (8.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 μg ofin vitro transcribed E. coli tRNAPhe, 5 μg of ThiI, and 63 μg of cell-free extract from either parent oriscS − strain. tRNA was analyzed for s4U by digestion with nuclease P1 and bacterial alkaline phosphatase essentially according to Gherke et al.(23.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 230: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing 0.1–0.5 mg/ml tRNA, 30 mm NaOAc, pH 5.3, 0.2 mm ZnSO4, and 3 units of nuclease P1 were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. To this mixture 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (4 μl for a 50-μl reaction), was added followed by 3 units of bacterial alkaline phosphatase and incubated for ≥1 h. Approximately 10 μg of digested tRNA was loaded on a reverse phase HPLC column (Supelco LC-18S) and eluted with a linear gradient (60 min) of 0.5–20% methanol in 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 5.3. Peaks were detected at 330 nm, which is specific for the absorbance of s4U. Begley and co-workers (16.Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.-J. Costello C.A. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have reported the overexpression of ThiFS on a single expression plasmid and purification of these proteins as a complex. We cloned ThiF and ThiS separately by PCR amplification from E. coli K12 genomic DNA. Primers for ThiF and ThiS are indicated in Table I. Each amplification reaction (100 μl) contained 2.5 units of Pfupolymerase (Stratagene), 0.2 mm each of dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, and 1 μg of genomic DNA. After 30 cycles of amplification, the desired fragment was purified on a 1% agarose gel and extracted using a Qiaquick column (Qiagen). The purified DNA was then digested, gel-purified, and ligated into similarly digested and dephosphorylated pET 21c (Novagen). Ligation mixtures were transformed into NovaBlue cells for the production of supercoiled plasmid for screening by PCR and/or sequencing. Plasmids having the correct insert were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. Cells were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.6, and IPTG was added to 0.3 mm. After 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with lysozyme (0.3 mg/ml) in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF) at 0 °C for 1 h, followed by treatment with DNase I (1 μg/g cells) for 30 min. Centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min gave the S-30 supernatant. ThiF S-30 supernatant (27 mg) was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (15-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol. The column was washed with 30 ml of equilibration buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50–500 mm KCl in 100 ml of equilibration buffer. Aliquots of the fractions were electrophoresed to determine ThiF peak. DEAE eluate (12.9 mg) was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (225 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF. Pure ThiF fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C until use. ThiS S-30 supernatant (23.4 mg) was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column and eluted as described above. The DEAE eluate (20.8 mg) was purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 as described above. Pure ThiS fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon (YM-3) centrifugal concentrator (Millipore) and stored at −80 °C. ThiS (176 pmol), ThiI (36 pmol), IscS (22 pmol), and ThiF (24 pmol) were incubated together as indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were carried in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 20 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 10 μm[35S]cysteine (4000 cpm/pmol) either in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. Incubations were for 10 min at 37 °C. 0.25 volume of 5× SDS sample buffer minus 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the assay mixtures, heated at 70 °C for 2–5 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining followed by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The in vitro ThiS thiocarboxylation assay mixtures were prepared exactly as above except unlabeled cysteine was used. After incubation, samples were loaded onto a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry system. HPLC was performed on Vydac C18 column. The eluents were solvent A, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B, 95% CH3CN in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. A linear gradient from 1 to 99% solvent B (flow rate 20 μl/min) was used for elution. The mass spectrometer (PE Sciex API 365) equipped with an ion spray source was used for mass detection. Protein masses were deconvoluted using the Biospec reconstruct program. The error in the determined mass is ±1 per 5000 atomic mass units. We used a method for the precise in frame deletion of E. coli genes that was originally developed by Kushner and co-workers (22.Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recently modified by Church and co-workers (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The deletion insert was constructed using a two-step PCR method, which replaces the coding sequence of iscS with a 33-bp sequence (TableI) that codes for an innocuous peptide (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). This in frame insert is designed to prevent polar effects on downstream genes within the same operon. This concern is applicable toiscS since it is known to be located in a multicistronic operon (6.Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The iscS deletion construct was ligated into plasmid pKO3 (19.Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), which contains a temperature-sensitive origin of replication that allows the selection of cells with plasmid integrated into the genome (cointegrates) at the nonpermissible temperature (43 °C) in the presence of chloramphenicol. Growth of isolated cointegrates at the permissible temperature (30 °C) in the presence of antibiotic gives resolved cointegrates, in which the plasmid has been excised from the genome. Plasmid pKO3 also contains theBacillus subtilis sacB gene for levansucrase. This gene is deleterious for growth in E. coli in the presence of high sucrose concentrations. Thus, it is possible to select for cells that have both resolved and released the plasmid from their genomic DNA by plating cointegrates on LB/suc plates at 30 °C. Replica plating from the LB/suc plate onto LB/cam plates will identify those colonies that grow in the presence of sucrose, but are chloramphenicol-sensitive, and have thus released the plasmid. Screening potential deletion mutants by colony PCR can identify those cells that contain the desired deletion in the genomic DNA. However, we have found that deletion strains that grow poorly in LB/suc relative to the parent strain will be selected against at this stage and require the screening of many colonies before the desired mutant is found. This was true for the iscS − strain, which grows relatively slowly in rich medium. We found it more convenient to resolve the cointegrates using Kushner's original procedure by propagation at 30 °C for several days in LB/cam and then plating and screening the plasmid DNA of individual colonies for the presence of the wild type gene. Such cells should have the desired deletion in their genomic DNA because of the double crossover event. Dilution and plating these candidates onto LB/suc then gives a large proportion (>50%) of the desired deletion mutants free of plasmid DNA. ForiscS− strains, such colonies required an additional 12–16 h to appear on the LB/suc plates. As shown in Fig.2, we verified the gene deletion by PCR analysis of genomic DNA with primers flanking the iscS gene.Lane 2 shows the expected 2.2-kb PCR product of the parent strain MC1061 genomic DNA, and lane 3 shows the expected smaller 1.1-kb product for the iscS deletion strain (CL100). In addition, complementation with wild type iscS (see below) gave a phenotype that was indistinguishable from the parent strain. Fig.3 A shows the growth of theiscS − and E. coli parent strains in LB medium at 37 °C. The iscS − strain was significantly growth-impaired in rich medium. The doubling time of the iscS− strain is 55 min, which is 2-fold greater than that of the parent strain (27 min). TheiscS− strain did not grow in M9/glucose or M63/glycerol minimal media supplemented with leucine (parent strain MC1061 is a leucine auxotroph). Because of earlier reports (12.Ryals J. Hsu R.-Y. Lipsett M.N. Bremer H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14.Webb E. Class K. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4399-4402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the relationship between s4U and thiamin biosynthesis and our recent work, we suspected that thiamin was also necessary for growth. However, addition of thiamin to the minimal medium was insufficient for growth. Only after combined addition of nicotinic acid and thiamin was growth observed. A significant lag phase relative to the parent strain was observed when the iscS − strain was switched from rich to minimal medium containing thiamin and nicotinate. Flint (5.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) has reported that IscS can repair the Fe-S clusters of apo-dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, an enzyme required for the biosynthesis of isoleucine and valine. Therefore, we measured the duration of the lag phase in the presence of these amino acids. Fig. 3 B shows that the lag time relative to the parent strain is substantially reduced in the presence of isoleucine and is reduced further in the presence of both isoleucine and valine. This effect suggests that an enzyme involved in isoleucine/valine biosynthesis, possibly dihydroxy-acid dehydratase, is defective in the iscS − strain. No other amino acid had any observable effect. Interestingly, the exponential rates of growth are the same for both parent and mutant strains under all minimal medium conditions tested; however, it should be noted that this is a much slower rate of growth than in rich medium. Transformation of the iscS − DE3 lysogen CL100(D3) with a pET-derived IscS expression plasmid, pCL010 (see Table I), resulted in complementation of all of the observed phenotypic effects ofiscS deletion. The growth rate of CL100(DE3)/pCL010 was equal to the parent MC1061 in rich medium in the presence or absence of IPTG, indicating that the uninduced expression of iscS in the lysogen is significant. SDS gel analysis of cell extracts from theiscS − strain grown in the presence of IPTG shows a large band at the correct relative mass of IscS (data not shown). CL100 was also fully complemented by a derivative of pKO3 that contains the E. coli iscS gene with the same flanking 500-bp regions as in the deletion construct. Extracts from the parent and iscS −strains were assayed for tRNA sulfurtransferase activity. TheiscS − extract contained significantly reduced activity (2.6% of parent strain extract). tRNA isolated from theiscS− strain grown in LB was analyzed for the presence of s4U. The UV-visible spectra of tRNA fromE. coli MC1061 (parent strain) shows a characteristic peak due to absorbance of s4U at 330–340 nm, whereas for the CL100 tRNA there is no evidence of a peak in this region. Complementation with pCL010, which contains wild type iscS, restores the absorbance in this region of the tRNA spectrum (data not shown). To confirm further the presence or absence of s4U, unfractionated tRNA isolated from each strain was digested to nucleosides as described (23.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 230: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of the tRNA digests (Fig.4) shows clearly that theiscS − strain is completely devoid of s4U (Fig. 4 B). As predicted, tRNA from the complemented strain CL100(DE3)/pCL010 shows a peak for s4U in the chromatogram that is similar in magnitude to that of the parent strain (Fig. 4 C). These resul"

The open reading frame of the TOPK gene encodes a protein of 322 amino acids, possessing a protein kinase domain profile. The cap site analysis of the 5′-end of TOPK mRNA revealed two forms, a major full-length form and a minor spliced form at the 5′-site, both encoding the same protein. A BLAST homology search and phylogenetic analysis indicated that TOPK is related to dual specific mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK). The transfection of the TOPK gene to COS-7 cells up-regulated a phosphorylation of p38 MAPK but not ERK1/2 or SAPK/JNK. Gel precipitation study indicated that TOPK protein can be associated with p38 in vitro. Tissue distribution of TOPK mRNA expression was specific for the testis, T-LAK cells, activated lymphoid cells, and lymphoid tumors. On the other hand, deactivated T-LAK cells did not show TOPK mRNA expression.

While tyrosine-specific kinases are taking part in the membrane receptor-associated signals in many instances, the counterpart of kinases, serine/threonine-specific kinases with or without tyrosine or dual specificity, also play important roles in the nonreceptor-type intracellular signaling, as in the case, for example, of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 and cyclin-dependent kinases (3.Kentrup H.

Making abundant subfamilies and threads, both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases are functionally active in maintaining cellular functions and homeostasis. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade conducts many biological actions in cells (2.Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Trends Endocrinol.

Three subfamilies of MAPK have been identified: p38 kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). In immune cells, p38 MAPK has an important role in mediating activation- and proliferation-related functions in vitro. Signaling through the T-cell receptor complex and CD28 are mediated by the phosphorylation of p38 (6.Zhang J. Salojin K.V. Gao J.X. Cameron M.J. Bergerot I. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3819-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Koprak S. Staruch M.J. Dumont F.J. Cell Immunol. 1999; 192: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8.Schafer P.H. Wang L.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 659-668PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates a series of kinases and nuclear transcription factors such as MAPK activated protein and C-EBP homologous protein. The cytokine production of lymphocytes and macrophages is stimulated by the phosphorylation of p38 but not JNK or ERK (7.Koprak S. Staruch M.J. Dumont F.J.

Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphokine-activated killer T (T-LAK) cells possess cytotoxic functions against cancer cells (12.Abe Y. Horiuchi A. Osuka Y. Kimura S. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Abe Y. Van Eden M. Gatanaga M. Wang F.I. Brightbill H.D. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). They are mainly composed of activated T-lymphocytes. T-LAK cells express the membrane-associated lymphotoxin, a complex of soluble lymphotoxin-α and membrane protein lymphotoxin-β (14.Browning J.L. Ngam-ek A. Lawton P. DeMarinis J. Tizard R. Chow E.P.

Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), whereas a deactivated form of T-LAK cells is totally devoid of expression (16.Horiuchi A. Abe Y. Miyake M. Kimura K. Hitsumoto Y. Takeuchi N. Kimura S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17.Miyake M. Horiuchi A. Kimura K. Abe Y. Kimura S. Hitsumoto Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although similar in their continuing cytotoxic activities, i.e. short term killing of cancer cells and maintenance of major phenotypic expressions such as CD3, CD4, and CD8 on the cell membrane, these two types of T-LAK cells are strikingly different in their cytolytic activity, i.e.long term cancer cell killing based on cytokine production (16.Horiuchi A. Abe Y. Miyake M. Kimura K. Hitsumoto Y. Takeuchi N. Kimura S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17.Miyake M. Horiuchi A. Kimura K. Abe Y. Kimura S. Hitsumoto Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We applied a cDNA subtractive strategy based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (18.Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) to these unique counterparts of T-LAK cells and established a subtraction cDNA fragment library. Many unique cDNA fragments were found by a random sequencing of this library. Among them, a consensus fragment possessing a protein kinase motif was identified and a molecular cloning was carried out. This novel protein kinase, named TOPK (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase) was revealed to be expressed in the activated T-LAK cells, lymphoid tumor cells, and normal testicular tissue. TOPK is a newly identified member of the MAPK kinase (MKK)3/6-related MAPKK family that phosphorylates p38 MAPK, which is believed to be involved in the activation of lymphoid cells and the maintenance of testicular cell functions. T-LAK cell cDNA subtraction fragment library was prepared using a PCR-based method (18.Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated from a healthy donor using heparinization by a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Conray (specific gravity, 1.077). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultivated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% RPMI), 400 IU/ml interleukin-2 (LAK media), and 0.4 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On the 4th day of culturing, cells were passaged with LAK media at a cell concentration of 0.5 × 106/ml and then passaged every 2 days using LAK media. After 7 days of culturing, cells were used for experiments as T-LAK cells (that is, as membrane lymphotoxin (mLT)-positive T-LAK cells because of the expression of mLT on the cell surface). The phenotypic expression of CD3 antigen on T-LAK cells was >95%. For the establishment of a deactivated form of T-LAK cells (mLT-negative T-LAK cells), cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured with 10% RPMI without interleukin-2 for 18–24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The differences in the activities and phenotypic expressions between activated and deactivated T-LAK cells were reported previously. To summarize those differences, the phenotypic expression such as CD3, CD4, and CD8 and the cytotoxic activity of these two cells are not significantly different, whereas the cytolytic activity, i.e. the cytotoxic activity based on cytokine production, of the deactivated form is considerably lower than that of the activated form (16.Horiuchi A. Abe Y. Miyake M. Kimura K. Hitsumoto Y. Takeuchi N. Kimura S. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17.Miyake M. Horiuchi A. Kimura K. Abe Y. Kimura S. Hitsumoto Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mRNA were separated from both types of T-LAK cells, and the double stranded cDNA was prepared using kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After digestion of double stranded cDNA by Sau3AI (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C for 3 h, cDNA fragments of both activated (sense) and deactivated (subtractor) T-LAK cells were ligated with an R-primer set (R-Bgl 24: 5′-AGCACTCTCCAGCCTCTCACGGCA-3′; R-BglI2:5′-GATCTGCGGTGA-3′) at both ends using T4 DNA ligase (Toyobo) after annealing these two primers. The primers were amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq (Applied Biosystems, Urayasu, Japan) and R-Bgl 24 primer. The PCR products were digested by Sau3AI, and the sense fragments were then ligated with a J-primer set (J-Bgl 24: 5′-ACCGACGTCGACTATCCATGAACA-3′; J-BglI2: 5′-GATCTGTTCATG-3′) using T4 DNA ligase after primer annealing. The sense fragment ligated with J-primer sets was mixed with an excess amount of subtractor fragments, and the mixture was heated to 94 °C for 90 s followed by annealing at 67 °C for 20 h. The mixture was amplified by PCR using J-Bgl 24 primer (PCR subtraction), and the product was then digested by Sau3AI again. After the removal of digested small fragments, sense fragments were ligated with an N-primer set (N-Bgl 24: 5′-AGGCAACTGTGCTATCCGAGGGAA-3′; N-BglI2: 5′-GATCTTCCCTCG-3′) using T4 ligase at both ends, and a PCR-based subtraction was carried out using N-Bgl 24 primer and the excess amount of subtractor fragments. The final PCR product was cloned using a pGEM-T cloning system (Promega, Tokyo, Japan), and it was submitted as a T-LAK subtraction library after the transformation of JM109 Escherichia coli cells. Random sequencing of the library was carried out, and data were analyzed by the BLAST homology search on the Baylor College of Medicine search launcher page or on the Genome Net search launcher page. Consensus cDNA fragments encoding a serine/threonine kinase were identified. Cloning of TOPK was carried out using the Rapid Screen cDNA library panel kit of the human spleen (Origene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD). In brief, a master plate of the human spleen origin was screened by a PCR method using a specific primer set (N2H1F1: 5′-GCCAGCCAAGATCCTTTTCC-3′ and N2H1B1: 5′-AGTTCCCAACGCTGCATAGTATG-3“) designed from the above-mentioned cDNA fragment. Positive wells were selected, and the subplates responsible for each positive well were screened by PCR using the same primers. The colonies in the positive wells in subplates were then screened by PCR again, and positive clones were selected and recloning was carried out. The plasmid vector employed in this library system was pCMV6-XL3. Two clones were obtained (N2H1#1 and N2H1#2). Sequencing analysis was carried out using a genetic analyzer (model 310; Applied Biosystems) with a Big Dye terminator system (Applied Biosystems) and specific sequencing primers. Transcriptional initiating point analysis based on the capping structure of mRNA was carried out using a cap site cDNA human spleen kit (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) (19.Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Yamazaki H. Shimada T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13681-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two reverse primers of human TOPK in the cloned 5′-cDNA region were designed (N2H1Cap1: 5′-CTTCAAAATTGGTCCCGAG-3′; N2H1Cap2: 5′-TAGCACCAACACATACGCCC-3′). The first PCR was carried out using N2H1Cap1 and CR1 kit primers with the kit template. The second PCR was then carried out using N2H1Cap2 and CR2 kit primers with the first PCR product as the template. The second PCR product was analyzed by an agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using the NucleoSpin Extract kit (Sawady, Tokyo, Japan) and cloned using a T-vector system (Promega, Madison, WI). The clones obtained by this method were subjected to the sequencing analysis using the 310 genetic analyzer. A PCR-based cloning for the recombinant TOPK protein was carried out using pGEX-2TK and specific primers. PCR was carried out using specific primers (N2H1recF1-BamHI: 5′-TACGGGATCCGCTTTCACAATGGAAGGGATCAG-3′; N2H1recB1-EcoRI: 5′-TCCGGAATTCTTACGCAAGCCACACTTCAGC-3′), AmpliTaq polymerase, and a purified plasmid of N2H1#1 as a template. The PCR product and pGEX-2TK were digested by BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and EcoRI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated using T4 ligase. Transformation was carried out using DH10B E. coli cells and an electroporator (Electro Cell Manipulator 600; BTX, Tokyo, Japan). Several colonies were picked up, and sequencing analyses were carried out. One clone (pGEX-TOPK) was finally selected, and a transformation of BL21(DE3) was carried out using chemically competent cells. The GST-TOPK fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h after preculturing. E. coli cells were centrifuged to form a precipitate and were dissolved by a freeze-thaw method followed by a sharing of genomic DNA using a 20-gauge needle, a syringe, and sonication in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml lysozyme). The supernatant of cell lysate was applied to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and washed with the lysis buffer without lysozyme. Recombinant fusion protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose gel using an elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.6, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione). Protein concentrations were estimated using a D/C protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). The TOPK vector for the transfection analysis of cultured cells was elaborated using pcDNA3-MRGS-His6-Tag vector and the digested insert of pGEX-TOPK by BamHI and EcoRI. The ligated product was used for the transformation of DH10B E. coli cells by an electroporation method, and a clone was finally selected (pcDNA3RGS-TOPK). The p38 expression vector was prepared by a ligation of PCR product using specific primers (Rec-p38F-BamHI: GCCGGATCCATGTCTCAGGAGAGGCCCAC and Rec-p38B-BamHI: GCCGGATCCTCAGGACTCCATCTCTTCTT) and mLT2+ LAK cDNA as a template. After digestion of the PCR product and pcDNA3 vector by BamHI, fragments were ligated and the transformation of E. coli was carried out as described above. The sequence of the selected clone was confirmed using the 310 genetic analyzer. Plasmid was purified using a Maxi prep kit (Quiagen, Tokyo, Japan). Transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out using Lipofect AMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, cells were grown in a φ = 60-mm culture dish for 20 h before the experiment. After the cells were washed with OptiMEM I media (Life Technologies, Inc.), a mixed solution of 5.0 μg of plasmid and 20 μl of Lipofect AMINE was added to the cells and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was changed to 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics and cultured overnight, and cells were then harvested for analysis. Northern blotting was carried out using 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from different human normal tissues, fractionated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred onto charged nylon membranes (Origene Technologies). The blots were hybridized to a TOPK probe of 1030-base pair PCR product by N2H1recF1-BamHI and N2H1recB1-EcoRI primers, as described previously; the product was labeled using a Megaprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization to the actin probe (Origene Technologies) was performed as the control. For the analysis of mRNA expression in cells and tissues, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis was also carried out using a specific primer set of N2H1F1 and N2H1B1. The RNA of normal tissues was purchased from Sawady Tech. The cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 1 μg of each RNA. As a reference for mRNA contents, PCR using actin primers was carried out. 25 cycles of PCR were performed, and the products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoretic analysis. Protein kinase activity was estimated using activated recombinant GST-TOPK fusion protein and [γ-32P]ATP (0.11 terabecquerels/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-7 cells (5 × 106 cells) were incubated with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in 10% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and cells were lysed with the lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, 25 mmglycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then incubated for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation, COS-7 cell lysate (50% of the final reaction volume) was incubated with recombinant GST-TOPK bound with glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 30 °C for 30 min with the addition of 20 μm ATP and washed three times with lysis buffer. The protein concentration of the COS-7 lysate was 1.1 mg/ml estimated by a D/C protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For assaying, activated GST-TOPK gel was washed twice with kinase buffer consisting of 25 mmHEPES, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4. Activated GST-TOPK with or without the addition of dephosphorylated casein (100 μg/ml; Sigma, Tokyo, Japan), myelin basic protein (MBP, 20 μg/ml; Sigma), or recombinant p38 MAPK-GST fusion protein, at 5 μg/ml (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in the kinase buffer was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried up or electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and an x-ray film (BioMax; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposure was made. An in vitro phosphorylation assay of TOPK protein was also carried out using gel-bound GST-TOPK and COS-7 lysate with our without PMA stimulation as described above. [γ-32P]ATP was employed in the assay. After the incubation, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography was carried out. Western blotting was carried out using a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and an ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and transferred to the membrane using a semidry blotter (BioCraft, Tokyo, Japan) for 60 min at 1 mA/cm2. The membrane was then submerged in blocking solution consisting of 5% skim milk, PBS, and 0.1% Tween 20 (milk-PBST) for 2–5 h at room temperature. Next, the membrane was incubated with the first antibody solution diluted in the PBS, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 (BSA-PBST) for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and washed three times with washing buffer consisting of 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.15 mNaCl. The antibodies used in this study were anti-RGS His-Tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Quiagen); anti-phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK rabbit polyclonal antibodies (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA); and anti-total p38 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat antibody solution (Santa Cruz) in BSA-PBST for 60 min at room temperature and washed four times with washing buffer. The membrane was developed using the ECL solution and an x-ray film (Hyper film; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposure was made. The activated form of TOPK-GST fusion protein bound with glutathione-Sepharose 4B was mixed with COS-7 lysate with or without transfection of pcDNA-p38, using the “activated” glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel as the control. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, gels were washed four times with a lysis buffer of 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA, and the SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked by 5% milk-PBST overnight at 4 °C and stained by anti-phospho- and anti-total p38 antibody and developed by the ECL system described above. Data analysis was carried out by MacVector software using a Super Mac S900 computer (UMAX, Tokyo, Japan) and by use of the Internet home page at Genome Net. Alignment analysis was carried out using an ExPaSy home page. The cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence of TOPK are shown in Fig.1. The translational initiating point should be the second methionine site. The deduced TOPK protein consists of 322 amino acids. The capping site analysis of mRNA revealed that two forms of TOPK mRNA exist (Fig.2), one major form seen in 70% of the human normal spleen library and the second minor form seen in 30% of the library. The difference between the two forms is the very beginning point at the 5′-site, but both mRNAs will encode the same protein.Figure 2Cap site analysis of TOPK mRNA.5′-Site of two sequences (Cap1 and Cap2) are shown. Clone#1, TOPK clone 1 (N2H1#1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BLAST homology analysis of TOPK showed modest similarity with MAPKK (data not shown). The phylogenetic analysis with human MAPKKs indicated that it lies between the branches for MEK1/2 and MKK7 (Fig.3). A serine/threonine protein kinase motif was found in TOPK. However, there are some exceptions (Fig. 4); the GXGXXG pattern seen in the first domain of typical protein kinases is replaced by GXGXXV in TOPK; the RDLXXXN pattern in the sixth domain is changed to GDLXXXN; DFG in the seventh domain is changed to DVG; APE in the eighth domain is changed to AVE; DXWXXG in the ninth domain is changed to DXFXXG. In addition, the first serine/threonine site seen between the seventh and eighth domains of a MAPKK family member is changed to asparagine in TOPK, whereas the following serine/threonine site is conserved (Fig.4). TOPK mRNA expression was analyzed by a Northern blot analysis using normal human tissues (Fig.5). The expression of TOPK mRNA was specific for the testis. There are two bands at 1.9 and 2 kilobase pairs. Two forms in the cap site analysis may be responsible for these two bands. RT-PCR analysis of normal tissues showed the same result as Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6). A smaller PCR product seen in the placental tissue may be nonspecific; there was no band in the Northern blot. RT-PCR analysis indicated that mLT+ and mLT2+ LAK cells express a significant amount of TOPK mRNA, whereas the deactivated form of LAK cells,i.e. mLT− LAK cells, does not (Fig. 6).

The molecular mass of TOPK with MRGS-His6-Tag was 40 kDa, which is slightly higher than expected from its deduced amino acid sequence of 37,337 (Fig.7). Recombinant GST fusion protein was established by a cloning of the TOPK gene into the pGEX-2TK vector and a transformation of BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. After induction by 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2.5 h, a TOPK band was evident. GST-TOPK protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B gel (Fig. 8). GST-TOPK was then activated by PMA-stimulated COS-7 cell lysates, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the activated gel-bound form of TOPK protein was employed in the in vitrosubstrate kinase assay (Fig. 9). Both casein and MBP were phosphorylated. The autophosphorylation of TOPK protein was not evident in this study. In the control “activated” gel, no substrate phosphorylation band was seen (data not shown).In vitro substrate phosphorylation was not seen with the use of either the nonactivated gel-bound form or the nonactivated soluble form of TOPK (data not shown).Figure 9In vitro kinase assay using recombinant TOPK.

TOPK induced phospho-p38 but not phospho-JNK or phospho-ERK. The total p38 expression in the TOPK and mock-transfected COS-7 cells were comparable (Fig. 10). To confirm the p38 phosphorylation, an in vitro kinase assay was carried out using the activated gel-bound form of TOPK. Activated TOPK phosphorylated recombinant GST-p38 MAPK prominently (Fig.11).Figure 11In vitro kinase activity of recombinant TOPK against casein (a) and recombinant p38 (b).

As shown in this study, this novel kinase, TOPK, appears to be a new member of the MAPKK family that may play an important role in the activation of T-LAK cells. T-LAK cells are mainly composed of activated T-cells, possessing no evident target specificity via T-cell receptor (12.Abe Y. Horiuchi A. Osuka Y. Kimura S. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 115-121PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Abe Y. Van Eden M. Gatanaga M. Wang F.I. Brightbill H.D. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar). However, T-LAK cells share basic cytotoxic mechanisms against target cells such as the perforin-granzyme system and tumor necrosis factor/Fas-related cytotoxic functions with specifically activated T-cells or T-cell clones (13.Abe Y. Van Eden M. Gatanaga M. Wang F.I. Brightbill H.D. Granger G.A. Gatanaga T. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 279-284PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Spitzer J.H. Meadows G.G. Cell Immunol. 1999; 194: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, the new MAPKK family member TOPK is presumed to play some important roles in signaling for the mediation of the cytotoxic functions of T-cells as well as T-LAK cells. A BLAST homology search and phylogenetic analysis indicated that TOPK resembles the dual specific MAPKK. It lies between MEK1/2 and MKK7 in the tree, closer to MEK1/2 than to MKK7. TOPK phosphorylates p38 but not JNK or ERK in vivo. Accordingly, TOPK is functionally related with MKK3/6 but not with MKK7 or MEK1/2. MKK7 activates JNK but not p38 or ERK (5.Foltz I.N. Gerl R.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4230-4235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TOPK is missing some of the typical amino acid sequence of the MAPKK family, i.e. (S/T)XXX(S/T) between the seventh and eighth domain, which is important for the catalytic function (5.Foltz I.N.

It is not known whether the phosphorylation of the second threonine in TOPK is enough for the catalytic activity of this kinase. Phosphorylation of other amino acid residues might be necessary. Mutational analysis is under investigation. TOPK does not have any kinase activity, unless it is activated by some unidentified kinases (data not shown). We used a “bulk activation method” to activate the gel-bound recombinant TOPK using PMA-stimulated COS-7 lysate as the activator source. As shown in this study, the phosphorylation of TOPK protein was confirmed by this method. When activated by the cell lysate, TOPK exhibited kinase activity, which is prominent in p38 phosphorylation. This evidence supports the idea that TOPK is an MAPKK member that needs a phosphorylation of the specific amino acid residues for its catalytic activity. At this moment, the specific activator of TOPK is unknown. PMA-stimulated COS-7 lysate should contain the activator. Molecular association analysis using recombinant protein or a yeast two-hybrid method will be helpful for the identification of the activator, which must be identified so that the TOPK signaling cascade can be understood. We have identified a novel mixed lineage kinase-like kinase from the T-LAK subtraction library (data not shown), which is under investigation now. TOPK was shown to accept p38 as a specific substrate in this study. The transfection study using the pcDNA3-TOPK construct to COS-7 cells indicated this. A specific antibody exhibited a phospho-p38 MAPK band in the TOPK-transfected cell lysate. The target specificity was confirmed by a precipitation analysis using activated GST-TOPK bound with Sepharose gel in vitro, where anti-phospho-p38 antibody demonstrated that the p38 bound with TOPK is phosphorylated. Identification of a scaffolding protein for these two kinases will be the next step (25.Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26.Ito M. Yoshioka K.

The tissue distribution of TOPK mRNA expression is unique. In normal tissues, only the testis expresses TOPK mRNA. Testis-specific protein kinases have been reported (27.Tseng T.C. Chen S.H. Hsu Y.P.

Acta. 1996; 1312: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and some spermatogenetic roles of these kinases have been debated; however, the precise mechanisms of these kinases, such as target specificity and signaling cascades, remain to be elucidated. On the other hand, TOPK phosphorylates p38 MAPK, and its signaling can be examined from the viewpoint of a MAPK cascade in the testis. TOPK is expressed in the mLT+ and mLT2+ T-LAK cells. This was confirmed in the mRNA expression and also in the protein levels of our study (data not shown). TOPK may exclusively phosphorylate p38 MAPK, which plays important roles in the cell signaling via surface receptors such as T-cell receptor on T-cells and CD20 on B-cells (6.Zhang J. Salojin K.V. Gao J.X. Cameron M.J. Bergerot I. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3819-3829PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Craxton A. Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J.

This indicates that TOPK may play some critical roles in T-LAK cells. The elucidation of TOPK signaling in T-LAK cells and T-cells appears imperative. This is a beginning study on the novel kinase TOPK, which may be an important regulator in immune cells. Further molecular and biological analyses are in progress. We thank Dr. H. Ito (Tokyo Institute of Technology) and M. Miyake for their support."
https://openalex.org/W1806127905,"Alterations in the cell division:cell death ratio induce multiple autoimmune and transformation processes. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) controls cell division and cell death in vitro, but its effect on the function of the cellular immune system and on tumor formation in mammals is poorly characterized. Here we show that transgenic mice expressing in T lymphocytes an active form of PI3K derived from a thymic lymphoma, p65(PI3K), developed an infiltrating lymphoproliferative disorder and autoimmune renal disease with an increased number of T lymphocytes exhibiting a memory phenotype and reduced apoptosis. This pathology was strikingly similar to that described in mice exhibiting heterozygous loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a lipid and protein phosphatase. We show that overexpression of PTEN selectively blocks p65(PI3K)-induced 3T3 fibroblast transformation. Moreover, the early development of T cell lymphomas in p65(PI3K) Tg p53(-/-) mice indicated that PI3K contributes to tumor development. These observations demonstrate that constitutive activation of PI3K extends T cell survival in vivo, affects T cell homeostasis, and contributes to tumor generation, supporting a model in which selective increases in one type of PTEN substrate, the PI3K-derived lipid products, induce tumorigenesis. PI3K thus emerges as a potential target in autoimmune disease and cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1874453010,"Several lines of biochemical evidence correlate the presence of energy metabolic defects with the functional alterations associated with brain aging and with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Within this context we tested the ability of insulin to regulate the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our findings show that insulin promotes APP metabolism by a glucose-independent mechanism. We demonstrate a novel intracellular pathway that increases the rate of secretion of soluble APP through the activity of phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3-K). This pathway, downstream of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, does not involve either the activation of protein kinase C or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K) pathway. Because of the physiological role of PI3-K in the translocation of glucose transporter-containing vesicles, we speculate that PI3-K involvement in APP metabolism may act at the level of vesicular trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1899774277,"Experimental stroke using a focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (FCIR) model was induced in male Long-Evans rats by a bilateral occlusion of both common carotid arteries and the right middle cerebral artery for 30-90 min, followed by various periods of reperfusion. Oxidative DNA lesions in the ipsilateral cortex were demonstrated using Escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine DNA N-glycosylase (Fpg protein)-sensitive sites (FPGSS), as labeled in situ using digoxigenin-dUTP and detected using antibodies against digoxigenin. Because Fpg protein removes 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine (oh8dG) and other lesions in DNA, FPGSS measure oxidative DNA damage. The number of FPGSS-positive cells in the cortex from the sham-operated control group was 3 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD per mm(2)). In animals that received 90 min occlusion and 15 min of reperfusion (FCIR 90/15), FPGSS-positive cells were significantly increased by 200-fold. Oxidative DNA damage was confirmed by using monoclonal antibodies against 8-hydroxy-guanosine (oh8G) and oh8dG. A pretreatment of RNase A (100 microg/ml) to the tissue reduced, but did not abolish, the oh8dG signal. The number of animals with positive FPGSS or oh8dG was significantly (P<0.01) higher in the FCIR group than in the sham-operated control group. We detected few FPGSS of oh8dG-positive cells in the animals treated with FCIR of 90/60. No terminal UTP nicked-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, as a detection of cell death, were detected at this early reperfusion time. Our data suggest that early oxidative DNA lesions elicited by experimental stroke could be repaired. Therefore, the oxidative DNA lesions observed in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of the brain are different from the DNA fragmentation detected using TUNEL."

Ligation of CD38 with specific monoclonal antibodies triggers a myriad of responses in lymphocytes from proliferation to apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 2.Mehta K. Shahid U. Malavasi F.

Also, increased expression of CD38 on T cells is associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and the expression index is shown to be the best predictor of shorter survival of the patients (6.Liu Z.Y.

The biological relevance of CD38, however, is not restricted to lymphocytes. Its expression has since been found to be widespread among non-hematopoietic tissues, including the brain (8.Koguma T. Takasawa S. Tohgo A. Karasawa T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 9.Yamada M. Mizuguchi M. Otsuka N. Ikeda K. Takahashi H. Brain Res. 1997; 756: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition to the antigenic functions, CD38 also possesses a multitude of enzymatic activities. It is homologous to Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, sharing about 30% sequence identity and a perfect alignment of the cysteine residues (10.States D.J. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Similar to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase, CD38 catalyzes both the cyclization of NAD to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)1 and a base-exchange reaction using NADP as substrate, producing nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) (reviewed in Refs. 11.Lee H.C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar and 12.Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 89-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CD38 also catalyzes the hydrolysis of cADPR and NAD. CD38 is thus catalytically novel. Biologically more relevant, however, are its two enzymatic products, NAADP and cADPR. Both are Ca2+messengers mediating the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+stores in a wide variety of cells from protozoan and plant to human (reviewed in Refs. 13.Lee H.C. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 173: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 14.Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). That a single enzyme is capable of catalyzing the synthesis and metabolism of two structurally and mechanistically distinct Ca2+ messengers suggests CD38 may be central to Ca2+ signaling in cells. In this study, we identify the enzymatic active site of CD38 by site-directed mutagenesis. We have recently co-crystallized theAplysia cyclase with nicotinamide, a substrate of the base-exchange reaction, and we have characterized its active site by x-ray crystallography (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the structural homology between CD38 and the cyclase and have selected four acidic residues and two tryptophans of CD38 for mutagenesis. These six residues correspond to those critical residues at the active site ofAplysia cyclase. The results identified Glu-226 as the most likely candidate for the catalytic residue. The Pichiaexpression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used, and the construct consisted of cloning the catalytic domain of either the wild type or mutant human CD38 in frame with the yeast mating α-factor signal sequence. The first 44 residues of CD38, containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (16.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar), were deleted, and the catalytic domain was started at Arg-45. This soluble fragment of the CD38 has enzymatic activities indistinguishable from the full-length protein (17.Fryxell K.B. O'Donoghue K. Graeff R.M. Lee H.C. Branton W.D.

The X-33 strain of yeast was transfected with the construct and the expression induced by methanol. The expressed CD38 was secreted as a soluble protein in the medium (19.Munshi C.B. Fryxell K.B.

Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Endogenous proteolytic enzymes that normally are responsible for processing the prepro-α-mating factor also removed the α-factor signal sequence from the expressed CD38. The advantages of the X-33 yeast strain have been described previously (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, the strain contains the native alcohol oxidase geneAOX1, which allows the yeast to metabolize methanol and grow to higher densities. It also contains the native HIS4 gene, enabling them to grow without histidine supplementation. TheHIS4 phenotype also allows for use of positive selection vectors like pPICZαA. With this vector the transformation efficiency was nearly 100%, and no revertants were detected. After a 5-day induction with methanol in a standard culture tube, the yeast produced and secreted up to 40 μg/ml of the soluble catalytic fragment of CD38 in the culture medium. After dialyzing the culture media to remove salts, the soluble CD38 proteins were purified in a single step using a cation exchange column (SP5 PW, Waters, Milford, MA). A linear gradient of NaCl was used for elution as described previously (19.Munshi C.B. Fryxell K.B. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At least two separate cultures were made from each mutant, and each culture was purified separately. The wild type or mutant CD38 (0.2–40 μg/ml) was incubated (2 min to 18 h) at room temperature with various concentrations of specific substrates, 9 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 25–800 μl, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.2% final concentration). After diluting to a final volume of 1 ml, 0.8 ml of the mixture was injected into an AG MP-1 column (10 × 120 mm), and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC (Bio-Rad). AG MP-1 was obtained from Bio-Rad. The elution was performed using a gradient of trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 5 ml/min as described previously (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) and the cADPR hydrolase activities were assayed with various concentrations of NAD (7–125 μm) or cADPR (0.16–1.6 mm), respectively. The base-exchange reaction was similarly assayed at pH 4.5 in the presence of 50 mmnicotinic acid and various concentrations of NADP (10–160 μm). The GDP-ribosyl cyclase (GDPR cyclase) activity was measured with 25 μm nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD), and the production of cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) was recorded continuously at the emission wavelength of 410 nm (excitation at 300 nm). The rate of cGDPR production was calculated by differentiating the time course of the fluorescence change as described previously (20.Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, GDPR cyclase was also assayed using various [NGD] (20–1200 μm), and the product, cGDPR, was measured using HPLC. Enzyme activities of the wild type and mutant CD38 were measured using at least two different protein preparations. The results shown were mean ± S.E. of at least four determinations. TheV max and K m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots, and the results shown were mean ± S.E. of at least four determinations. The mutations were carried out using the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit obtained from Stratagene. The kit employs the high fidelity PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and mutant oligonucleotide primers to replicate both strands of the supercoiled plasmid containing the insert. A mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks is generated. Following the thermal cycling, the reaction mixture is treated with DpnI endonuclease that digests hemimethylated parent DNA leaving behind the nicked DNA containing the mutation of interest. Plasmid DNA from mostEscherichia coli strains is dam-methylated and can be digested away with the DpnI enzyme. The procedure takes 7 days starting from the mutation reaction to transformingE. coli with the mutated DNA and purifying the resultingSacI-digested DNA for use in yeast transformation. All mutations were verified and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The details of the synthesis of both the radioactive and non-radioactive 8-azido-NAD were as we have described previously (15.Munshi C.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Droplets (50 μl) of the wild type or mutant CD38 (0.2 μg) containing 1 μm [32P]8-azido-NAD (∼540,000 cpm), 0–5 mm β-NAD, and 0.5 mmα-NAD were placed on a piece of parafilm and incubated on ice for about 0.5–2 min. The droplets were exposed to 100 mJ of ultraviolet light energy (∼70 s) in a Stratalinker chamber (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Pilot experiments showed that this amount of UV energy produced optimal labeling without detectable protein-protein cross-linking. α-NAD is not a substrate for CD38 and was included in all samples to reduce potential nonspecific labeling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the radioactivity associated with the proteins was measured using a PhosphorImager (Packard, Meriden, CT). The phosphorimages were collected at 16-bit resolution for quantitative analyses but reduced to 8-bit for printout. The sequence of human CD38 (16.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar) starting at Pro-53 was first aligned with the sequence of theAplysia cyclase (25.Glick D.L. Hellmich M.R. Beushausen S. Tempst P. Bayley H. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The homology feature in Insight II (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used, together with the crystal coordinates of the cyclase dimer that we have previously determined (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J.

Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), to generate the homologous structure of the truncated CD38 dimer. This structure was then refined using the using the Powell relaxation routine in X-PLOR (27.Brunger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, X-PLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). All the cysteines were positioned close enough that the disulfide bond constraint could be imposed during the X-PLOR refinement. In the initial homology model, there were 96 bad contacts and the X-PLOR energy terms for the bonds, angles, dihedrals, and Van der Waals were 140,000, 27,512, 16,484, and 7.8 × 107, respectively. After refinement, there were no bad contacts, and the energies were reduced to 243, 1,958, 2,381, and −365, respectively. CD38 and its mutants were purified by cation exchange chromatography as described above. The purified fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7. The dialyzed proteins were concentrated using Centricon-10 (Millipore) concentrators. All circular dichroism measurements were done at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and a temperature of 25 °C. The samples (125 μl) were added to a 0.05-cm cuvette, and a Jasco 710 Spectropolarimeter was used to record 6 scans at 50 nm/min at 0.1-nm intervals from 195 to 250 nm. The 10 mm phosphate buffer used as a blank was subtracted from each recording. The data were converted to molar ellipticity units and finally to molar circular dichroism units. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Scopes (28.Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The data were calculated by using the Contin program (29.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2610) Google Scholar) and are shown as percent α-helix, β -structure, and unordered structure. We have recently characterized the active site of theAplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography shows that nicotinamide, the substrate of the base-exchange reaction, is coordinated by three residues, Glu-98, Asn-107, and Trp-140. Site-directed mutagenesis identifies two additional residues, Trp-77 and Glu-179, at the binding pocket as critical for catalysis. Among these residues, Glu-179 is most likely to be catalytic. The corresponding residues in CD38 are Trp-125, Glu-146, Asp-155, Trp-189, and Glu-226, and they were selected for site-directed mutagenesis. Additionally, Asp-147 was also targeted. The effects of the mutations on four enzymatic activities of CD38 were determined. The cyclization reaction was assayed using NGD as substrate, and the production of cGDPR was monitored fluorimetrically (20.Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid was measured as NAADP production using HPLC (18.Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The two hydrolytic reactions, NADase and cADPR hydrolase, were assayed as production of ADP-ribose from NAD and cADPR, respectively. The effects of mutagenizing Glu-226, which corresponds to the catalytic Glu-179 of the cyclase, are shown in TableI. Substitution of Glu-226 with Leu or even with conservative residues, such as Asp, Asn, and Gln, totally eliminated all enzymatic activities. Only residual activities were detected when substituting with a glycine. This exquisitely specific requirement of a glutamate residue is consistent with it being the catalytic residue. We have previously found a similarly high degree of specificity for a glutamate at the active site of theAplysia cyclase (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Table IInhibition of enzymatic activities of CD38 by site-directed mutagenesis of Glu-226NADaseBase exchangeGDPR cyclasecADPR hydrolasenmol/mg/minWT124,200 ± 8,80076,500 ± 2,90015,700 ± 4005,800 ± 500E226D0000E226N0000E226L0000E226Q0000E226G147 ± 722 ± 189 ± 17Data shown are the V max values for the wild type (WT) CD38, whereas the enzymatic activities for the mutants were determined at a saturating substrate concentration of either 0.2 mm for NAD, NADP, and NGD or 1 mm for cADPR. Two different protein preparations were used for the wild type and each of the mutants. The values shown are mean ± S.E. for 4–6 determinations. For determining the wild type Vmax of the NADase, [NAD] was varied from 7.5 to 125 μm; for the base exchange, [NADP] was varied from 10 to 160 μm; and for the cADPR hydrolase activity, [cADPR] was varied from 0.16 to 1.6 mm.

The V max values for GDPR cyclase activity were determined by a continuous fluorimetric assay using an initial concentration of 25 μm NGD as described under “Materials and Methods.” That these substitutions did not induce a gross distortion of the structure of the active site is shown by the retention of substantial NAD binding activity of the mutant E226G. The NAD binding activity was assessed by photoaffinity with [32P]8-azido-NAD in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of NAD. Fig.1 shows that the labeling was specific for both the mutant, E226G, and the wild type since it was competitively reduced by NAD. In the case of E226G, the half-maximal effect was between 0.1 and 0.5 mm of NAD. The intensity of labeling of the mutant in the absence of NAD was 44% that of the wild type (inset, Fig. 1). The secondary structures of three of the E226 mutants were evaluated using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results are listed in TableII. The percentages of the α-helixes, β-sheets, and random coils of the inactive mutants were essentially the same as those of the wild type, giving further support that the point mutation at Glu-226 did not induce a gross perturbation on protein folding.Table IIThe secondary structures of CD38 and its mutants analyzed by circular dichroismα-Helixβ-SheetRandom%%%WT41 ± 232 ± 127 ± 2E226G39 ± 632 ± 129 ± 6E226D40 ± 128 ± 233 ± 2E226N39 ± 831 ± 433 ± 1Values shown are mean ± S.D. of 3–7 determinations.

The catalytic role of the conserved sequence near the middle of the CD38 molecule was next investigated. This sequence (Thr-144-LEDTL) is conserved among three species of CD38 and two species of ADP-ribosyl cyclase (reviewed in Refs. 11.Lee H.C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12.Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 193: 89-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 14.Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In the Aplysiacyclase, this sequence constitutes the bottom of the active site pocket (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Glu-146 and Asp-147 are conserved between CD38 and theAplysia cyclase. Substituting Asp-147 with valine reduced the NADase activity to 17,100 ± 1,500 nmol/mg/min (n = 4, ±S.E.), more than 7-fold reduction as compared with the wild type (cf. Table I). Substituting Glu-146 with leucine depressed the NADase activity even further to 6,600 ± 1,300 (n = 4, ±S.E.), a 19-fold reduction. That these two conserved residues are indeed important for catalysis is further indicated by the total elimination of all enzymatic activities when both residues were substituted (E146L/D147V). When using NAD as substrate, CD38 mainly hydrolyzes it to ADP-ribose, and very little cADPR is produced (29.Provencher S.W. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 213-227Crossref Scopus (2610) Google Scholar, 30.Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C.

Commun. 1993; 191: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cyclization reaction catalyzed by CD38 is more easily shown by using NGD, instead of NAD, as substrate. The main product in this case is cGDPR (20.Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although substitutions of either Asp-147 or Glu-146 decreased the NADase activity by 7–19-fold, the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity of the mutants remained essentially the same as the wild type. The cADPR hydrolase activity, however, appears to correlate with the NADase activity since both were correspondingly depressed by the substitutions. This correlation is further shown in Fig. 2, where the cADPR hydrolase activity of each mutant was plotted against its NADase activity. A roughly linear relationship with anr 2 value of 0.93 was apparent. The slope of the least square line was 2.22, suggesting that the substitutions more readily affected the cADPR hydrolase than the NADase activity. X-ray crystallography of nicotinamide bound to the active site of theAplysia cyclase shows that Asn-107 is one of the three closest residues (15.Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This residue is not conserved in CD38 but corresponds to Asp-155. Table III shows that the most dramatic effect of substituting Asp-155 with a conservative residue, such as Glu, Asn, or Gln, was the large stimulation of the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity, by as much as 15-fold in the case of D155E. Since all other enzymatic activities of the mutants were only minimally affected, this suggests that Asp-155 is uniquely important for determining the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38.Table IIIInactivation of enzymatic activities by mutagenizing Asp-155 of CD38NADasecADPR hydrolaseGDPR cyclaseBase exchangenmol/mg/minWT101,600 ± 8,0004,200 ± 15013,100 ± 80074,500 ± 1,500D155N67,200 ± 1,8007,400 ± 30040,700 ± 1,100120,000 ± 7,500D155E66,800 ± 1,8006,800 ± 350190,800 ± 21,000147,000 ± 7,500D155Q19,300 ± 1,0002,700 ± 10087,400 ± 5,40075,000 ± 1,000The NADase, cADPR hydrolase, and the base exchange activities shown were measured, respectively, at 125 μm NAD, 1.2 mm cADPR, or 160 μm NADP.

In normal adult tissues, PTTG mRNA expression is restricted to a small number of tissues, including testis, thymus, and placenta (1.Pei L. Melmed S. Mol.

To elucidate the biological function of PTTG, we have used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that associate with PTTG (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This report shows that the ribosomal protein S10 and a novel human homologue of the bacterial heat-shock protein, DnaJ (HSJ2), interact specifically with PTTG under both in vitro and in vivo conditions (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Association of PTTG with these proteins indicates that PTTG may link to the ribosome and is involved in the regulation of translation (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, during the rat spermatogenic cycle, PTTG mRNA is expressed stage specifically in only spermatocytes and spermatids, suggesting that PTTG may play a role in rat spermatogenesis (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of human PTTG was shown to function as a transcriptional activator when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (2.Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Rios R.M. Dreyfus F. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells that overexpress PTTG, increased expression of bFGF mRNA and protein was observed (3.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentinin A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates that PTTG is a sister chromatid separation inhibitor, and degradation of PTTG is required for proper sister chromatid separation during the cell cycle (9.Zou H. McGarry T.J. Bernal T. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1999; 285: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PTTG is a multifunctional protein that can exert its effect both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We now report the cloning and the characterization of a novel protein encoding a PTTG-binding factor, PBF. We have used both in vitro binding and immunoprecipitation assays to demonstrate that PBF interacts specifically with PTTG. With deletion analyses, we have located the regions that are required for PBF and PTTG binding to the C terminus of both proteins. We have determined the subcellular localization of PTTG and PBF and showed that co-expression of PBF increased PTTG nuclear staining. Furthermore, we have shown that PBF is required for activation of bFGF transcription by PTTG. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (10.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Human RNA master blot and multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased fromCLONTECH, and the blots were probed with human β-actin or PBF cDNA probe according to manufacturer's instructions. The full-length cDNA encoding PBF with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope from pACT2 was cloned into theBamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene) to obtain HA-tagged PBF (HA·PBF). The ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to construct the PBF nuclear localization signal (NLS) deletion mutant (HA·PBFΔNLS) in which the putative NLS sequence (amino acids 149–166) was deleted. The primers used were primer 1, 5′-TGTTTTAAAGAAGAAAACCCGTATGCTA-3′ and primer 2, 5′-CCTCCTGCCGTATCCGCCTCTCCT-3′. The PBF N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants (N45, N90, N148, and C30) were generated from pACT2-PBF-wt using the ExSite polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). PTTG deletion mutants (mut(1–5)) were described previously (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PTTG-green fluorescent fusion protein was obtained by subcloning the coding region of PTTG into the BglII andHindIII sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to obtain GFP·PTTG. The plasmid pLuc-bFGF containing the bFGFpromoter (−1,058/+54 bp) was fused upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (11.Pasumarthi K.B.S. Jin Y. Cattini P.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 898-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PBF cDNA was subcloned into the pBK-CMV vector (Stratagene) and used as the DNA template for the production of PBF protein. The in vitrotranscription/translation reactions were performed using the TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system with T3 RNA polymerase and biotinylated lysine-tRNA (Promega). The reactions were carried out according to manufacturer's protocols. The PTTG·GST fusion protein construct was described previously (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion protein was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in sonication buffer (150 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysed by sonication. The bacterial cell lysate containing GST fusion proteins was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed three times with the sonication buffer and incubated with 20 μl of in vitro translated PBF at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed extensively, boiled in 2× SDS-loading buffer, and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electroblotting, the blot was incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, washed, and detected by chemiluminescence. Transfected cells were lysed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of the protease inhibitors, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The cell lysate was incubated with anti-X-press antibody (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated complexes were bound to protein A/G-Sepharose at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and then proteins were eluted in sample buffer and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting, the membranes were incubated with anti-HA antibody and visualized by ECL. These assays were performed as described previously (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with GFP·PTTG only were fixed 24–48 h post-transfection with 2% neutral buffered formaldehyde (2% formaldehyde, 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 15 min at 37 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times, and examined under a fluorescent microscope. Cells transfected with HA·PBF or HA·PBFΔNLS, or cotransfected with GFP·PTTG and HA·PBF or GFP·PTTG and HA·PBFΔNLS were fixed and blocked with 1% fetal calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 1:100 anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h and with 1:10 anti-mouse IG-rhodamine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C, with three phosphate-buffered saline washes after each incubation. Slides were examined with fluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence data are based on multiple transfection experiments. The nuclear and cytosol fractions were prepared using the method described by Dignam et al.(12.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) from COS-7 cells transfected with PTTG, PBF, or both expression plasmids. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting, the membranes were incubated with various antibodies and analyzed by ECL. The antibodies include a monoclonal antibody against hnRNP (diluted 1:1000) and a polyclonal antibody against Raf1 at a dilution of 1:200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (6.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5219-5225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid screen with rat PTTG as bait, several positive clones were isolated from a human testis cDNA library (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). One cDNA of 2790 bp has a canonical initiation codon at nucleotide 229 and a 3′-untranslated region of 2025 bp (Fig. 1 A). This cDNA, designated as PBF, contains an open reading frame of 179 amino acids (Fig. 1 A) with a predicted molecular mass of 22 kDa and a pI of 10.57. Homology searches against the EBI and GenBank™ data bases reveal that the PBF amino acid sequence has 92% identity to a previously characterized cDNA termed C21orf3 (13.Yaspo M.L. Aaltonen J. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Peltonen L. Lehrach H. Genomics. 1998; 49: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). TheC21orf3 gene was mapped to chromosome 21q22.3 where several hereditary disorders have been linked (14.Aita U.M. Liu J. Knowles J.A. Terwilliger J.D. Baltazar R. Grunna A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15.Sinet P.M. Theophile D. Rahmani Z. Chettouh Z. Blouin J.L. Prieur M. Noel B. Delebar J.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence comparisons against the expressed sequence tag (EST) database identified more than 100 human ESTs derived from lung, uterus, heart, testis, bone marrow, pancreas, spleen, melanocytes, and neurons. Identity matches were also found with human ESTs corresponding to cDNAs overexpressed in colon carcinomas, Wilms' tumor, and parathyroid tumors. Several mouse ESTs showed more than 80% identity to PBF and probably represent the murine homologue of PBF. Analysis of protein sequence using the PROSITE data base of protein sites and patterns revealed putative phosphorylation sites for cyclic AMP- and GMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and casein kinase II (Fig. 1 A). Five potential glycosylation sites for N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides were found. Prediction of sorting signals and cellular localization for PBF was performed using the PSORT program. A cleavable N-terminal signal was identified between amino acids 31 and 32. A potential nuclear localization signal sequence was identified at the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). The tissue distribution of PBF mRNA was determined using a human RNA master blot. The results show that PBF mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all the tissues analyzed, with the highest level of expression detected in placenta (data not shown). To determine the transcript size of the PBF mRNA, Northern blot analysis was performed on selected tissues. As shown in Fig. 2, a unique transcript of 2.8 kilobases was observed (Fig. 2, upper panel). The transcript size on the Northern blot suggests that the PBF cDNA clone (2790 bp) is likely to be full length. The membrane was also probed with the actin control to confirm mRNA integrity as well as loading efficiency (Fig. 2, lower panel). To test the binding specificity of PBF to PTTG, the ability of in vitrotranscribed and translated PBF to bind bacteria-expressed PTTG was examined. PBF was retained on Sepharose beads only in the presence of GST·PTTG (Fig. 3, lane 2), whereas no protein was retained when GST alone was added (Fig. 3,lane 1). These results demonstrate that PBF specifically binds PTTG in vitro. To determine the regions of PBF involved in interaction with PTTG, PBF deletion mutants fused to the yeast Gal4 activation domain vector were constructed (Fig.4 A). These fusion plasmids were used to cotransform yeast with the hybrid plasmid containing PTTG and the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The interaction between PBF deletion mutants and PTTG was monitored by the expression of HIS3 andlacZ reporter genes, which were monitored by growth on histidine-deficient medium and production of β-galactosidase, respectively. Deletion of 148 amino acids from the N terminus (N45, N90, and N148) had no effect on PBF/PTTG interaction (Fig.4 B). However, deletion of the 30 amino acids from the C terminus (C30) abolished interaction between PBF and PTTG (Fig.4 B). These results suggest that the 30 amino acids that include the nuclear localization signal in the C terminus of PBF are necessary and sufficient for PBF binding to PTTG. To determine the region of PTTG involved in interaction with PBF, PTTG N-terminal deletion mutants constructed in the Gal4 DNA binding domain vector (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and PBF constructed in the Gal4 activation domain vector were used in the similar yeast two-hybrid assays. No change in the interaction between PBF and PTTG was detected when the N-terminal 123-amino acid deletion mutant (PTTG mut4) was used (Fig.4 B). The PBF/PTTG interaction was completely abrogated only when the N-terminal 154 amino acids were deleted (PTTG mut5). These results suggest that the region between amino acids 123 and 154 of PTTG is essential for interaction with PBF. To determine whether PBF and PTTG associate with each other in mammalian cells, we transiently cotransfected COS-7 cells with HA-tagged PBF (wild type and C-terminal 30-amino acid deletion mutant) and His-tagged PTTG expression plasmids. Total lysates were subjected to Western blot analyses to confirm the expression of individual protein in the transfected cells (Fig.5, A and B). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody, and the bound protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, anti-HA antibody detected a band in lysates from cells cotransfected with the wild type PBF and PTTG expression plasmids, whereas no band was detected in lysates from cells cotransfected with PTTG and the C-terminal deletion mutant of PBF (Fig.5, C). This is consistent with the results from the yeast two-hybrid assays above in which the C-terminal 30-amino acid domain was shown to be required for PBF binding to PTTG. The results suggest that PBF interacts specifically with PTTG in mammalian cells via the 30 amino acids at the C terminus. PBF contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal between amino acids 149 and 166 at the C terminus. To test whether this potential NLS has any effect on PBF subcellular localization, the HA-tagged PBF constructs containing either a full-length PBF (HA·PBF) or a deletion mutant lacking the NLS sequence (HA·PBFΔNLS) were transfected into COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 6 A, HA·PBF was mainly expressed in the nucleus, but there was also significant expression in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the NLS deletion mutant, HA·PBFΔNLS, yielded a predominantly perinuclear and cytoplasmic staining pattern (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that NLS is required for PBF localization to the nucleus. To characterize the biological significance of the interaction between PBF and PTTG, both proteins were transfected into COS-7 cells, and the subcellular localization was examined. Initially COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with GFP·PTTG only. Expression of GFP·PTTG was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm (Fig.7 A) with partial nuclear localization. When COS-7 cells were cotransfected with both GFP·PTTG and HA·PBF, most of the GFP·PTTG expression was now localized to the nucleus (Fig. 7 B). Our deletion studies using yeast two-hybrid assays showed that the C-terminal 30-amino acid domain including the nuclear localization signal is required for PBF binding to PTTG. We then tested whether the NLS deletion construct of PBF was still able to promote PTTG nuclear accumulation. As shown in Fig.7 C, in cells cotransfected with GFP·PTTG and HA·PBFΔNLS, the expression of GFP·PTTG remained mainly in the cytoplasm, indicating that PBF lacking the NLS can no longer bring PTTG into the nucleus. The relative nuclear versus cytoplasmic distribution of PBF and PTTG was also examined by subcellular fractionation. Nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from transfected cells. The purity of the fractions was verified by probing the membrane with the nuclear (anti-hnRNP) or cytoplasmic (anti-Raf1) protein specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 8, in cells transfected with PTTG alone the majority of the PTTG was detected in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in cells cotransfected with PBF and PTTG expression plasmids, there was a dramatic increase in the immune activity of PTTG in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 8). Quantitation of the immunoblot showed that the amount of PTTG present in the nucleus increased from less than 15% to more than 70% after coexpression with PBF (not shown). These results indicate that the interaction between PBF and PTTG facilitates PTTG translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and the nuclear localization signal of PBF is required for PTTG nuclear translocation. To further explore the functional implication of PBF/PTTG interaction, we tested whether PBF affects the function of PTTG as a transcriptional activator. Previously it had been demonstrated that bFGF expression was induced in NIH3T3 cells that overexpress PTTG (3.Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentinin A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To test whether PTTG was capable of activating bFGF transcription, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with bFGF promoter linked to luciferase together with the PTTG expression plasmid. As shown in Fig.9, transfection of PTTG expression vector alone had little effect on luciferase activity of the bFGFreporter gene. Similarly, transfection of PBF expression vector alone did not change the reporter gene activity (Fig. 9). However, when PTTG and PBF were coexpressed, the luciferase activity of the reporter gene was induced more than 3-fold. These results suggest that PBF is required for PTTG activation of bFGF transcription. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel PTTG-binding factor. PBF shares its highest sequence homology with a previously isolated cDNA, C21orf3 (13.Yaspo M.L. Aaltonen J. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Peltonen L. Lehrach H. Genomics. 1998; 49: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although theC21orf3 gene has been mapped to chromosome 21q22.3, where several hereditary disorders have been linked (14.Aita U.M. Liu J. Knowles J.A. Terwilliger J.D. Baltazar R. Grunna A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15.Sinet P.M. Theophile D. Rahmani Z. Chettouh Z. Blouin J.L. Prieur M. Noel B. Delebar J.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the functions of the C21orf3 gene product have not been characterized. The PBF mRNA tissue distribution pattern is similar to that of C21orf3, which is also ubiquitously expressed. We have used biochemical and immunological methods to show that PBF can form a complex with PTTG under both in vitro and in vivo conditions and that this interaction requires the C-terminal portion of both proteins. The sequence required for PTTG to interact with PBF was located within the C-terminal 75-amino acid domain. This result agrees with the previous study in which the interactive domain of PTTG with S10 and HSJ2 proteins was mapped to the same region (8.Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3151-3158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several motifs that are known to mediate protein-protein interactions are present in this region, including a leucine-zipper motif (16.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar) between amino acids 169 and 190, as well as two putative SH3 (17.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar) domains at amino acids 169 and 176. The functional significance of these motifs in mediating interaction of PTTG with other proteins is currently being investigated. Our results also showed that the C-terminal 30 amino acids of PBF are both necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with PTTG. PBF contains a bipartite NLS between amino acids 149 and 166. Proteins entering the nucleus are directed by NLS sequences that are present in nuclear proteins (18.Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). The NLS sequences are recognized by specific cytosolic proteins that help to direct the nuclear protein to the nuclear pore complex and its translocation through the nuclear envelope (19.Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20.Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21.Adams S.A. Gerace L. Cell. 1991; 66: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The NLS is generally either a short basic region of 4–8 amino acids or a bipartite basic sequence separated by 4–15 amino acids (22.Kalderon D. Robers B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar, 23.Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 24.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Our results show that PBF is predominantly localized to the nucleus and that deletion of the NLS sequence abolished PBF nuclear localization. This indicates that the NLS sequence is required for PBF nuclear localization as well as interaction with PTTG. PTTG does not contain a consensus NLS sequence, and our indirect immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies show that PTTG exhibits a predominantly cytoplasmic localization. This result is in agreement with results from a previous study indicating that human PTTG is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm (2.Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Rios R.M. Dreyfus F. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, coexpression of both PBF and PTTG in the same cells resulted in translocation of PTTG from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Our studies indicate that nuclear translocation of PTTG requires the presence of the NLS of PBF because coexpression of a PBF mutant that lacks its NLS was unable to bind PTTG and failed to promote PTTG nuclear accumulation. These results suggest that one of the functions of PBF is to bind PTTG and direct it into the nucleus. This function of PBF is reminiscent of the function of HCF, a cellular factor involved in herpes simplex virus immediate-early gene induction (25.O'Hare P. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 145-155Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26.Wilson A.C. Cleary M.A. Lai J.S. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HCF is part of a multicomponent protein complex containing VP16 and Oct-1 (25.O'Hare P. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 145-155Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26.Wilson A.C. Cleary M.A. Lai J.S. LaMarco K. Peterson M.G. Herr W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that nuclear trafficking of VP16 is HCF-dependent (27.Boissiere S.L. Hughes T. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like PTTG, VP16 itself does not contain a consensus NLS and is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. It was shown that coexpression with HCF resulted in VP16 nuclear translocation and that the NLS within the C terminus of HCF was required for this function (27.Boissiere S.L. Hughes T. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the C-terminal portion of human PTTG has transcriptional activation activity when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (2.Dominguez A. Ramos-Morales F. Romero F. Rios R.M. Dreyfus F. Tortolero M. Pintor-Toro J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For PTTG to function as a transcriptional activator, the presence of PTTG in the nucleus is required. Our results show that transcriptional activation of the bFGF gene requires the presence of both PTTG and PBF. These results suggest that PBF potentiates the PTTG transactivation function by facilitating its nuclear translocation. Another common mechanism that affects the subcellular distribution and functions of a protein is phosphorylation. One such example is the family of transcription factors called STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription). STAT proteins are involved in the initiation of gene expression by many cytokines and cell growth factors. Upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation through the cytoplasmic domain of stimulated receptors, the phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and are translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional activation by binding to specific recognition sites (28.Koster M. Hauser H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There are several potential phosphorylation sites for different kinases on both PBF and PTTG, and the effects of phosphorylation on the subcellular distribution and functions of these proteins are currently being investigated. In summary, this work provides biochemical and functional evidence that PBF binds PTTG directly and is able to promote PTTG nuclear translocation and its transcriptional activation activity. Interaction between PBF and PTTG and the subsequent nuclear translocation of PTTG suggest a potential mechanism by which PTTG might function as a transcriptional activator. We thank Dr. Peter A. Cattini and Dr. G. Dreyfuss for providing the bFGF-luc plasmid and anti-hnRNP antibody, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1537164121,"Growing evidence suggests that a pressure-induced increase in the synthesis of endothelin (ET-1) is involved in arterial remodeling and, as a consequence, in the manifestation of chronic hypertension. To study potential stretch-induced changes in gene expression and their functional consequences, we have cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (raSMC) and porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) on flexible elastomer membranes. The cells were periodically stretched (up to 20% elongation, 0.5 Hz, 6 h) and the expression of prepro-ET-1 and that of the endothelin A and B receptors (ETA-R and ETB-R) were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis and ELISA (ET-1). In contrast to PAEC where ET-1 synthesis was up-regulated up to eightfold on exposure to cyclic stretch, ET-1 synthesis in raSMC was decreased by more than 80% under these conditions. ETA R-mRNA expression in stretched raSMC declined to 50% whereas ETB R-mRNA levels were increased up to 10-fold. One functional consequence of this apparent shift in receptor abundance was an apoptosis-promoting action of exogenous ET-1 (10 nM), as judged by the appearance of subdiploid peaks during FACS analysis, caspase-3 activation and chromatin condensation. This ET-1-induced apoptosis appeared to be ETB-R mediated, as it was completely suppressed by the ETB-R antagonist BQ 788 but not by the ETA-R antagonist BQ 123. Moreover, raSMC derived from homozygous spotting lethal rats, which lack a functional ETB-R, showed no signs of apoptosis after exposure to cyclic strain and exogenous ET-1. These findings suggest a central role for the endothelin system in the onset of hypertension-induced remodeling in conduit arteries, which may proceed via an initial stretch-induced apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells.—Cattaruzza, M., Dimigen, C., Ehrenreich, H., Hecker, M. Stretch-induced endothelin B receptor-mediated apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. FASEB J. 14, 991–998 (2000)"
https://openalex.org/W1507872058,"Creatine kinase (CK) is a key enzyme for maintaining a constant ATP/ADP ratio during rapid energy turnover. To investigate the role of CK in skeletal muscle fatigue, we used isolated whole muscles and intact single fibers from CK-deficient mice (CK(-/-)). With high-intensity electrical stimulation, single fibers from CK(-/-) mice displayed a transient decrease in both tetanic free myoplasmic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](i), measured with the fluorescent dye indo-1) and force that was not observed in wild-type fibers. With less intense, repeated tetanic stimulation single fibers and EDL muscles, both of which are fast-twitch, fatigued more slowly in CK(-/-) than in wild-type mice; on the other hand, the slow-twitch soleus muscle fatigued more rapidly in CK(-/-) mice. In single wild-type fibers, tetanic force decreased and [Ca(2+)](i) increased during the first 10 fatiguing tetani, but this was not observed in CK(-/-) fibers. Fatigue was not accompanied by phosphocreatine breakdown and accumulation of inorganic phosphate in CK(-/-) muscles. In conclusion, CK is important for avoiding fatigue at the onset of high-intensity stimulation. However, during more prolonged stimulation, CK may contribute to the fatigue process by increasing the myoplasmic concentration of inorganic phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1735187387,"hRPB11 is a core subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) specifically down-regulated on doxorubicin (dox) treatment. Levels of this protein profoundly affect cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Here we describe Che-1, a novel human protein that interacts with hRPB11. Che-1 possesses a domain of high homology with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase final sigma-factor 70 and SV40 large T antigen. In addition, we report that Che-1 interacts with the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) by two distinct domains. Functionally, we demonstrate that Che-1 represses the growth suppression function of Rb, counteracting the inhibitory action of Rb on the trans-activation function of E2F1. These results identify a novel protein that binds Rb and the core of pol II, and suggest that Che-1 may be part of transcription regulatory complex."
https://openalex.org/W1622978237,"Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), a protein containing a leucine zipper domain within a death domain, is up-regulated in prostate cancer cells and hippocampal neurons induced to undergo apoptosis. Here, we report higher Par-4 levels in lumbar spinal cord samples from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) than in lumbar spinal cord samples from neurologically normal patients. We also compared the levels of Par-4 in lumbar spinal cord samples from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing the human Cu/Zn-superoxide dis-mutase gene with a familial ALS mutation. Relative to control samples, higher Par-4 levels were observed in lumbar spinal cord samples prepared from the transgenic mice at a time when they had hind-limb paralysis. Immunohistochemical analyses of human and mouse lumbar spinal cord sections revealed that Par-4 is localized to motor neurons in the ventral horn region. In culture studies, exposure of primary mouse spinal cord motor neurons or NSC-19 motor neuron cells to oxidative insults resulted in a rapid and large increase in Par-4 levels that preceded apoptosis. Pretreatment of the motor neuron cells with a Par-4 antisense oligonucleotide prevented oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and reversed oxi-dative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction that preceded apoptosis. Collectively, these data suggest a role for Par-4 in models of motor neuron injury relevant to ALS.—Pedersen W. W., Luo H., Kruman, I., Kasarskis, E., Mattson, M. P.

We have identified and determined the function of the adapter protein linker of activation of T cell (LAT) in FcγR-mediated signaling and function. Clustering of FcγRs on the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, induces phosphorylation of a major 36-kDa protein which immunoreacts with anti-LAT antisera. Our data indicate that although both the 36-kDa and 38-kDa isoforms of LAT are expressed in THP-1 and U937 human monocytic cells, FcγR clustering induces phosphorylation of the 36-kDa isoform only. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed a constitutive association of p36 LAT with both FcγRI and FcγRIIa immunoprecipitates, and an activation-induced association of LAT with PLCγ1, Grb2, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells indicated that overexpression of a wild type but not a dominant-negative LAT, that is incapable of binding to p85, enhances phagocytosis by FcγRI. Furthermore, bone marrow-derived macrophages from LAT-deficient mice displayed reduced phagocytic efficiency in comparison to the macrophages from wild-type mice. Thus, we conclude that p36 LAT serves to enhance FcγR-induced signal transduction in myeloid cells.

Receptor clustering is the result of FcγR engagement of IgG-coated soluble or particulate antigens and is distinct from FcγR occupancy, which does not promote signaling biochemistry or biology (reviewed in Ref. 1.Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). Phagocytosis of IgG-coated particulate antigens is elicited by all IgG receptors, with the notable exception of FcγRIIb (reviewed in Ref. 2.Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), and is an essential function of the innate immune system. The biochemical pathways initiated by FcγRs leading to phagocytosis is highly analogous to that of other immunoreceptors. Thus, FcγR aggregation by IgG-coated particulate antigen induces the activity of Src kinases, which phosphorylate a conserved receptor-associated amino acid motif known as the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (2.Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 3.Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3281-3285PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Sanchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 163: 521-533Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). ITAMs of the FcγRs are found in the receptor-associated γ-subunit except in the case of FcγRIIa (4.Sanchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 163: 521-533Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5.Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), which uniquely expresses the ITAM within its cytoplasmic tail (5.Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 6.Kimberly R.P. Salmon J.E. Edberg J.C. Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 38: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ITAM phosphorylation initiates ITAM recruitment of a variety of enzymes that propagate the antigenic signal, and lead to and are essential for phagocytosis (reviewed in Refs. 4.Sanchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 163: 521-533Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar and 7.Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, while reports over the past several years have elucidated some of the FcγR-triggered signaling pathways leading to phagocytosis, the proximal events induced by FcγR clustering are not fully understood. Studies from our laboratory (8.Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (9.Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the tyrosine kinase Syk is directly recruited to the phosphorylated ITAM of the receptor. Syk recruitment is followed by the recruitment of other SH2 domain-containing enzymes such as PLCγ1, the Grb2-Sos complex and the p85-p110 complex of PI 3-kinase (11.Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T.

Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Translocation of PLCγ1 to the membrane brings it in contact with its lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, thus generating second messengers involved in the activation of protein kinase C and release of intracellular stored calcium (13.Liao F.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 3017-3023PubMed Google Scholar). Association of the Grb2-Sos complex with the membrane facilitates the activation of the Ras/ERK pathway leading to the activation of transcription factors and gene expression (15.Durden D.L. Kim H.M. Calore B. Liu Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4039-4047PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Trotta R. Kanakaraj P. Perussia B. J. Exp.

Med. 1993; 178: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Membrane localization of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase is essential for the generation of lipid second messengers that are involved in the activation of a number of enzymes including those that potentiate actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangements (11.Chacko G.W.

Med. 1994; 180: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed our recent experiments in fibroblasts expressing a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of FcγRI and p85 reveals that membrane recruitment of PI 3-kinase is necessary and sufficient to induce actin polymerization and phagocytosis (21.Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24513-24520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, recruitment of these enzymes to the membrane is critical for their functioning. Although membrane recruitment is essential for stimulation of these enzymes in phagocytosis, it is unclear how membrane recruitment is elicited by FcγRs. Experiments using synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRI and FcγRIIa indicated that some but not all of the above enzymes directly bind via their SH2 domains with the ITAM (8.Chacko G.W. Duchemin A.-M. Coggeshall K.M. Osborne J.M. Brandt J.T. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32435-32440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M.

Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Other signaling enzymes do not directly bind the phosphorylated ITAM, but might be recruited through a receptor-associated adapter protein. While immunoreceptors expressed on lymphocytes and mast cells utilize multiple ITAM-bearing subunits to efficiently transduce signals, the γ-subunit is the only ITAM-bearing molecule identified to date that associates with Fcγ receptors in monocytes (23.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Other FcγR-associated molecules may be present and function as an adapter protein, but are unidentified. Earlier studies from our laboratory (24.Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar) revealed an undefined 36-kDa phosphoprotein associated with the FcγRI α-chain. Experiments presented here seeking to identify proteins phosphorylated very early upon receptor clustering also revealed a 36-kDa phosphoprotein. Hence we set out to determine the identity and function of pp36. Here we show that this protein is the recently cloned adapter molecule LAT (linker for activation of T cells). LAT, a membrane-associated adapter molecule that exists as 36- and 38-kDa isoforms, was originally cloned from T cells (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). This protein lacks any intrinsic enzymatic activity but facilitates enzyme function by serving as an adapter that recruits SH2 domain-containing enzymes and enzyme-adapter complexes (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation of LAT targets it to glycolipid-enriched domains in the membrane (26.Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses indicated that localization of LAT to the lipid rafts is crucial for its function (27.Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). T cell receptor cross-linking leads to phosphorylation of LAT and its association with a number of signaling proteins. The importance of LAT in T cell signaling by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is demonstrated by the inability of LAT-deficient cell lines to respond to TCR cross-linking (28.Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 29.Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of LAT, that is incapable of associating with some key SH2 domain proteins, severely impairs TCR-induced calcium flux, ERK activation, and production of interleukin-2 in Jurkat cells (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The expression of LAT also appears to be critical for T cell development, as LAT knockout mice display a lack of mature T cells in the periphery (30.Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Here, we report that LAT is expressed in myeloid cells, co-immunoprecipitates with FcγRs, and is phosphorylated in response to FcγR clustering. Additional studies indicate that LAT associates with p85, Grb2, and PLCγ1 upon monocyte activation and LAT phosphorylation. COS-7 transfectants overexpressing a wild-type LAT displayed enhanced phagocytic efficiency, while in contrast, COS-7 transfectants overexpressing LAT Y171F/Y191F showed decreased phagocytic efficiency. Consistent with these findings indicating a supporting role for LAT in phagocytosis, bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type mice were approximately twice as efficient at ingesting IgG-coated SRBCs as those derived from LAT-deficient animals. Thus, we conclude that LAT is a functional component of FcγR signaling in myeloid cells, serving to recruit SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins to the membrane. THP-1, U937, Raji, Jurkat, and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All other cells were maintained in RPMI, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-FcγRI antibodies 197 and 32.2, and anti-FcγRIIa antibody IV.3 were obtained from Medarex. Rabbit polyclonal anti-LAT antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 were purchased from UBI. Anti-p85 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. K. Mark Coggeshall (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were first isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Histopaque (Sigma). Monocytes were then purified from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by negative selection using the MACs Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were first treated with FcR blocking Reagent (hIgG), followed by a Hapten-Antibody Mixture (mixture of monoclonal hapten-conjugated CD3, CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and anti-IgE antibodies). The labeled cells were further treated with MACS anti-hapten magnetic microbeads that were conjugated to a monoclonal anti-hapten antibody. The cells were then passed over a MACS column, and the effluent was collected as the negative fraction representing enriched monocytes. The monocytes thus purified were subsequently analyzed for purity by double labeling with CD14-PE and CD45-FITC antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Data from 10,000 cells indicated that the isolated monocytes were 100% CD14 positive. Strain-matched wild type and LAT-deficient mice were a kind gift from Dr. Paul E. Love (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Bone marrow macrophages (BMM) were derived as described previously (31.Stacey K.J. Fowles L.F. Coleman M.S. Ostrowsky M.C. Hume D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were cultured in RPMI containing 5% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 50 ng/ml CSF-1 for 5 days. The BMMs were dissociated from the plates with Cell Dissociation Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and analyzed for Fc receptor expression by flow cytometry, expression of LAT by Western blotting, and for their ability to bind and ingest IgG-coated sheep RBCs. THP-1 cells and transfected COS-7 cells were activated by clustering FcγRI and or FcγRIIa with mAb 197 and IV.3 and goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Resting and activated cells were lysed in TN1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin)), and postnuclear lysates were incubated overnight with the antibody of interest and protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) or goat anti-mouse Ig covalently linked to Sepharose, depending on the antibody. Immune complexes bound to beads were washed in TN1 and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8. 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the antibody of interest and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. COS-7 cells were transfected as described previously (32.Lowry M.B. Duchemin A.-M. Robinson J.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on culture dishes until they were 60–70% confluent. 2 μg of cDNA for FcγRI α chain in pCEXV3, kindly provided by Dr. J. Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York), 2 μg of γ-subunit cDNA in pSVL, a gift from Dr. J.-P. Kinet (Harvard University, Boston, MA), and 4 μg of Myc-tagged, wild type LAT or LAT Y171F/Y191F in pEF/Bos, a generous gift from D. L. E. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were mixed in various combinations with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA mixture was added to cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The media was then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested 48 h later and analyzed for expression of the transfected cDNAs by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Having ensured that the various transfectants expressed comparable levels of protein, we then examined their ability to bind and ingest Ig-coated sheep RBCs. Sheep RBCs (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and labeled overnight with 0.1 mg/ml FITC in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. FITC-labeled cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a subagglutinating dose of rabbit anti-sheep RBC IgG (Diamedix, Miami, FL) at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound IgG was removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. IgG-coated SRBCs described above were added to COS-7 transfectants in suspension, and the cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation to increase contact between SRBCs and phagocytes. The samples were prepared in duplicate and incubated for 1 h at either 4 °C to study binding, or 37 °C to study phagocytosis. All cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides to be viewed under a fluorescence microscope. For the phagocytosis assay, cells were subjected to brief hypotonic lysis with water to remove externally bound RBCs prior to fixation in paraformaldehyde. The ability of the transfected COS-7 cells to bind IgG-coated targets was expressed as the percentage of cells that each bound three or more SRBCs (“Rosetting Activity,” Table I). That the binding was via the transfected Fc receptors was confirmed by the lack of binding observed in untransfected COS-7 cells. As an additional control, all cells were also incubated with fluoresceinated RBCs that were not opsonized with IgG. No binding or phagocytosis was seen in any of the samples treated with non-opsonized RBCs. Phagocytosis was measured by counting the total number of RBCs ingested by 200 transfected COS-7 cells (“Phagocytic Index,” Table I). The experiment was repeated three times.Table IInfluence of LAT on FcγRI-mediated phagocytosis in COS-7 transfectantsTransfectionFcγRI expressionRosetting activityPhagocytic index%% ΔExperiment 1 FcγRI + γ5033388 (0) FcγRI + γ + LATwt3933468 (+20) FcγRI + γ + LATmut3829302 (−22)Experiment 2 FcγRI + γ4727262 (0) FcγRI + γ + LATwt3923350 (+33) FcγRI + γ + LATmut4226174 (−34)Experiment 3 FcγRI + γ24284 (0) FcγRI + γ + LATwt21354 (+25) FcγRI + γ + LATmut25238 (−16)COS-7 cells were transiently transfected to express FcγRI α chain, γ-subunit ± LATwt or LATmut.

The results of three separate experiments are shown. Murine bone-marrow macrophages from wild type and LAT deficient mice were dissociated from culture dishes and treated with IgG-coated SRBCs by methods described above. The total number of SRBCs bound by 500 macrophages was counted and expressed as the “Binding Index” (Fig.6 A). The number of SRBCs ingested by 500 macrophages is expressed as the “Phagocytic Index” (Fig. 6 A). The experiment was repeated twice with macrophages derived from two sets of mice. Murine BMMs were tested for expression of FcγRs by incubating with anti-FcγRII/III mAb 2.4G2 (Pharmingen), at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-rat Ig secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry on an Elite EPICS fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Data from 10,000 cells per condition were recorded to yield the percentage of cells expressing receptors (Fig. 6 B). Transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed for FcγRI expression by incubating them with anti-FcRI mAb 197, followed by FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig secondary and subsequent flow cytometry as described above (Table I). To identify the initial events that ensue upon FcγR clustering in monocytes, we assessed tyrosine kinase activity in resting and FcγR-stimulated THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were incubated with either anti-FcγRI mAb 197 or with anti-FcγRIIa mAb IV.3 and the mAb-bound receptors were subsequently clustered with goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.1, A and B, upper panels). The results indicated a number of proteins phosphorylated upon FcγR clustering, notable among them was a 36-kDa protein that appeared as early as 1 min after receptor clustering. To identify the 36-kDa protein, the blots were stripped and reprobed sequentially with several antibodies against known 36-kDa proteins such as Lnk, the Fcε receptor-associated β-chain and LAT. Of the antibodies used only anti-LAT immunoreacted with the 36-kDa phosphoprotein in the lysates of THP-1 cells activated by FcγR clustering (Fig. 1, A andB, lower panels). Previous studies of tissue distribution of LAT indicated that myeloid cells did not express LAT mRNA (25.Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In order to ensure that the immunoreactivity of anti-LAT antibody observed in Fig. 1 was not an observation limited to the THP-1 cell line, lysates of several different cell lines and primary macrophages were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-LAT antibody. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, the two isoforms of LAT, p36 and p38, were detected in THP-1 and U937 human monocytoid cell lines, and 30 μg of Jurkat T cell lysate positive control (UBI), whereas Raji B cells were negative. In parallel experiments, lysates from murine BMM (Fig. 2 B) and PBM (Fig.2 C) were probed with anti-LAT antibody. The results indicate the presence of LAT in both murine BMMs, and in human PBMs. However, to our surprise we found that the amount of LAT present in monocytes is lower than that in a comparable number of Jurkat T cells. In order to obtain an estimate of the amount of LAT expressed in monocytesversus T cells, we used lysates from decreasing numbers of Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2 D). Results indicated that LAT expression in monocytes is approximately 5–10% of that in Jurkat T cells. Thus, the LAT adapter protein is expressed in T cells and monocytes but not in B cells. To further characterize the kinetics of phosphorylation of the two isoforms of LAT upon FcγR stimulation in monocytes, we immunoprecipitated LAT from monocytes stimulated with anti-FcγR mAb as above, or with IgG-opsonized SRBCs, the natural ligand for monocyte FcγRs. Tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT was seen as early as 30 s in both cases, peaked at 1 min and lasted until 5 min (Fig. 2,E–G, upper panels). Furthermore, while the 36-kDa isoform of LAT displayed robust phosphorylation, there was no detectable phosphorylation of the 38-kDa isoform. The blots were subsequently probed with anti-LAT antibody to ensure equal loading of protein in all lanes (Fig. 2, E–G, lower panels). Our earlier studies on the FcγRI receptor complex had revealed a 36-kDa phosphoprotein associated with the FcγRI α chain (24.Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 865-871PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether this 36-kDa protein was LAT, lysates from resting and activated THP-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-FcγRI mAb 32.2 or anti-FcγRIIa mAb IV.3. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-LAT antibody (Figs.3, A and B, upper panels). The 36-kDa isoform of LAT was detected in both FcγRI and FcγRIIa immunoprecipitates. Interestingly, the presence of LAT in FcγR immunoprecipitates was detectable in resting cells and did not increase upon receptor clustering. No anti-LAT reactivity was seen in additional control samples of lanes loaded with the monoclonal antibodies without cell lysate; thus, the LAT immunoreactivity is not an artifact of the antibodies. These data suggest that LAT may be a component of resting, unphosphorylated FcγRI and FcγRIIa complexes, as is the ITAM-containing γ-subunit of FcγRI (23.Ernst L.K. Duchemin A.-M. Anderson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6023-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, it is conceivable that under the lysis conditions used in these experiments the lipid rafts are insufficiently solubilized, and that the co-immunoprecipitation simply indicates that the two molecules reside in the same rafts but are not physically associated. Studies to determine the exact nature of the interaction of LAT with the FcγRs are underway. Having established that LAT is expressed in myeloid cells and is phosphorylated in response to FcγR activation, we next examined its part in FcγR-mediated function in myeloid cells. LAT contains several tyrosines that are potential phosphorylation sites and fit a YXXX consensus motif for SH2-domain binding (33.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhari M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G.

https://openalex.org/W1503171444,"Hyperpolarizing large-conductance, Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK) are important modulators of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cell function. In vascular smooth muscle cells, BK are composed of pore-forming alpha subunits and modulatory beta subunits. However, expression, composition, and function of BK subunits in endothelium have not been studied so far. In patch-clamp experiments we identified BK (283 pS) in intact endothelium of porcine aortic tissue slices. The BK opener DHS-I (0.05-0.3 micromol/l), stimulating BK activity only in the presence of beta subunits, had no effect on BK in endothelium whereas the alpha subunit selective BK opener NS1619 (20 micromol/l) markedly increased channel activity. Correspondingly, mRNA expression of the beta subunit was undetectable in endothelium, whereas alpha subunit expression was demonstrated. To investigate the functional role of beta subunits, we transfected the beta subunit into a human endothelial cell line (EA.hy 926). beta subunit expression resulted in an increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of BK activity: the potential of half-maximal activation (V(1/2)) shifted from 73.4 mV to 49.6 mV at 1 micromol/l [Ca(2+)](i) and an decrease of the EC(50) value for [Ca(2+)](i) by 1 microM at +60 mV was observed. This study demonstrates that BK channels in endothelium are composed of alpha subunits without association to beta subunits. The lack of the beta subunit indicates a substantially different channel regulation in endothelial cells compared to vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1938224903,"SSCrFCES is a biologically active, recombinant fragment of factor C, which is the endo-toxin-sensitive serine protease of the LAL coagulation cascade. The ~38 kDa protein represents the LPS binding domain of factor C. A novel secretory signal directs the secretion of SSCrFCES into the culture supernatant of Drosophila cells, and hence it is readily purified. By differential ultrafiltration followed by preparative isoelectric membrane electro-phoresis, SSCrFCES was purified as an isoelectrically homogeneous and stable monomeric protein. The ability of SSCrFCES to bind lipid A was analyzed using an ELISA-based assay as well as surface plas-mon resonance. SSCrFCES exhibits high positive cooperativity of binding to two or three lipid A molecules, with a Hill's coefficient of 2.2. The 50% endotoxin-neutralizing concentration of SSCrFCES against 200 EU of endotoxin is ~0.069 μΜ, suggesting that SSCrFCES is an effective inhibitor of LAL coagulation cascade. Although partially attenuated by human serum, as little as 1 μΜ of SSCrFCES inhibits the LPS-induced secretion of hTNF-α and hIL-8 by THP-1 and human peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells with greater potency than polymyxin B. SSCrFCES is noncytotoxic, with a clearance rate of 4.7 ml/min. The L.D.90 of SSCrFCES for LPS lethality is achieved at 2 μΜ. These results demonstrate the endotoxin-neutralizing capability of SSCrFCES in vitro and in vivo and its potential use for the treatment of endotoxin-induced septic shock.—Tan, N.

https://openalex.org/W1581741622,"The hemodynamic force generated by blood flow is considered to be the physiologically most important stimulus for the release of nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI(2)) from vascular endothelial cells (1). NO and PGI(2) then act on the underlying smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation and thus lowering blood pressure (2, 3). One critical early event occurring in this flow-induced regulation of vascular tone is that blood flow induces Ca(2+) entry into vascular endothelial cells, which in turn leads to the formation of NO (4, 5). Here we report a mechanosensitive Ca(2+)-permeable channel in vascular endothelial cells. The activity of the channel was inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP, a membrane-permeant activator of protein kinase G (PKG), in cell-attached membrane patches. The inhibition could be reversed by PKG inhibitor KT5823 or H-8. A direct application of active PKG in inside-out patches blocked the channel activity. Gd(3+), Ni(2+), or SK&F-96365 also inhibited the channel activity. A study of fluorescent Ca(2+) entry revealed a striking pharmacological similarity between the Ca(2+) entry elicited by flow and the mechanosensitive Ca(2+)-permeable channel we identified, suggesting that this channel is the primary pathway mediating flow-induced Ca(2+) entry into vascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066507549,"The kinetics of the interaction of GTP and GDP with SelB, the specific translation factor for the incorporation of selenocysteine into proteins, have been investigated using the stopped-flow method. Useful signals were obtained using intrinsic (i.e. tryptophan) fluorescence, the fluorescence of methylanthraniloyl derivatives of nucleotides, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer from tryptophan to the methylanthraniloyl group. The affinities of SelB for GTP (K d = 0.74 μm) and GDP (K d = 13.4 μm) were considerably lower than those of other translation factors. Of functional significance is the fact that the rate constant for GDP release from its complex with SelB (15 s−1) is many orders of magnitude larger than for elongation factor Tu, explaining why a GDP/GTP exchange factor is not required for the action of SelB. In contrast, the rate of release of GTP is 2 orders of magnitude slower and not significantly faster than for elongation factor Tu. Using a fluorescently labeled 17-nucleotide RNA minihelix that represents a binding site for the protein and that is part of the fdhF selenocysteine insertion sequence element positioned immediately downstream of the UGA triplet coding for selenocysteine incorporation, the kinetics of the interaction were studied. The high affinity of the interaction (K d ∼ 1 nm) appeared to be increased even further when selenocysteyl-tRNASec was bound to SelB, but to be independent of the presence or nature of the guanosine nucleotide at the active site. These results suggest that the affinity of SelB for its RNA binding site is maximized when charged tRNA is bound and decreases to allow dissociation and reading of codons downstream of the selenocysteine codon after selenocysteine peptide bond formation.

SelB binds guanine nucleotides; selenocysteyl-tRNASec 1; and a secondary structure of the mRNA, the SECIS element. In bacterial selenoprotein mRNAs, this SECIS element is located immediately downstream of the UGA codon directing selenocysteine insertion, whereas in Archaea and Eukarya, it is situated in the 3′-nontranslated region (for a review, see Ref. 1.Hüttenhofer A. Böck A. Grunberg-Manago M. Simons R.W. RNA Structure and Function. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 603-639Google Scholar). Binding of SelB to the SECIS structure is mediated by an ∼17-kDa C-terminal domain of the protein (domain IVb) that maintains its binding capacity when separated from the rest of the molecule. Minimization of the SECIS element showed that a 17-nucleotide long minihelix (see Fig. 1) was still able to bind to SelB or its C-terminal domain and to promote selenocysteine incorporation in vivo. On the other hand, the N-terminal two-thirds of SelB, which display sequence similarity to elongation factor Tu, are still capable of binding selenocysteyl-tRNASec when separated from the mRNA binding domain (2.Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3.Liu Z. Reches M. Groisman I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The formation of the quaternary complex is essential for the decoding of the UGA codon with selenocysteine at the ribosome. It is assumed that within this complex, SelB attains a conformation rendering it compatible for interaction with the ribosome, which is required for triggering GTPase activity. It is further assumed that GTP hydrolysis changes the conformation such that the charged tRNA is released. Therefore, in this model, SelB has two functions: the first one is to discriminate between an UGA codon programmed for selenocysteine insertion by the SECIS element and an ordinary UGA stop codon that lacks the SECIS element (4.Hüttenhofer A. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in bacterial mRNAs coding for selenocysteine, SelB also tethers the tRNA to the ribosomal A site (4.Hüttenhofer A. Böck A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 5.Heider J. Baron C. Böck A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Characterization of the kinetics of the SelB interaction with its substrates and the conformational changes involved is therefore of paramount importance for understanding the decoding process. Equilibrium dialysis measurements of the interaction of the protein with guanine nucleotides had indicated that GDP binding is approximately an order of magnitude weaker that GTP binding (6.Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This could obviate the necessity for a guanine nucleotide release factor. It has also been observed that SelB forms a tighter complex with the SECIS element in the presence of selenocysteyl-tRNASec than in its absence (7.Baron C. Heider J. Böck A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4181-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This study deals with a detailed analysis of the association and dissociation kinetics of guanine nucleotides with SelB alone and in the presence of the mRNA. Additionally, the kinetics of the interaction of SelB with SECIS elements and the influence of guanine nucleotides and selenocysteyl-tRNASec thereon were investigated. l-[14C]Serine was obtained from NEN Life Science Products and had a specific activity of 160 mCi/mmol. Sodium [75Se]selenite with a specific activity of 296 mCi/mmol and RNase P1 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany). Yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase was from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany). Bovine serum albumin and bakers' yeast tRNA were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The 17-nucleotide long minihelix representing the binding part of the SECIS element of the fdhF mRNA fromEscherichia coli (see Fig. 1) was prepared as described previously (2.Kromayer M. Wilting R.

The labeledfdhF minihelix carrying a (3′,6′-dipivaloylfluoresceinyl)-6-carboxamidohexyl group at the 5′-end (5′-fluorescein-GGUUGCAGGUCUGCACC-3′) was synthesized by Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). Selenocysteine synthase (SelA) purified as described (8.Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Boesmiller K. Veprek B. Böck A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) harboring selB under control of the T7 Φ10-promoter. Transformants were grown in a 10- or 50-liter Biostat fermentor (B. Braun, Dassel, Germany) at 37 °C in a medium containing 3% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.4% glucose, 0.2% glycerol, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 60 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.1), and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. At an A 600 of 3.0, expression ofselB was induced by addition of 100 μmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Subsequently, the temperature was lowered to 30 °C. After 75–150 min, the suspension was chilled to 0 °C, and the cells were harvested in a continuous flow centrifuge. Breakage of the cells, removal of cell debris, enrichment of SelB by sedimentation with the ribosomes and subsequent extraction from the pellet with high salt buffer, and fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation were performed as described (11.Forchhammer K. Rücknagel K.P. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final precipitate was dissolved in 50 ml of buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA). After dialysis for 6 h against two changes (2 liters each) of the same buffer, the solution was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.6 × 12.5 cm; Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad). The column was developed with 500 ml of a linear gradient of 100–200 mm potassium phosphate in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. SelB was eluted at a potassium phosphate concentration of ∼165 mm. Fractions containing SelB, as monitored by SDS gel electrophoresis, were pooled and dialyzed against two changes (2 liters each) of buffer B (100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 6 and 12 h, respectively. The pool was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (1.2 × 8 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was developed with 90 ml of a linear gradient of 0–267 mm KCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. SelB was eluted at ∼125 mm KCl. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and dialyzed for 12 h against 2 liters of buffer B. The solution was then applied to an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow cation-exchange column (1 × 5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with 80 ml of a linear gradient of 0–400 mm KCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. SelB was eluted at ∼230 mm KCl. Fractions that contained SelB were pooled and dialyzed for 12 h against 2 liters of buffer B. Finally, the solution was concentrated by dialysis for 12 h against 500 ml of buffer B containing 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. His-tagged SelB-(472–614) was purified essentially as described by Kromayer et al. (2.Kromayer M. Wilting R. Tormay P. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically at 280 nm (εSelB = 81,080m−1 cm−1, εSelB-(472–614) = 26,600m−1 cm−1) according to Gill and von Hippel (12.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). Purification of selenophosphate synthetase (SelD) was performed according to the method of Ehrenreich et al. (13.Ehrenreich A. Forchhammer K. Tormay P. Veprek B. Böck A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).

BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 764-769PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 40 mmMgCl2, 1 mm spermidine, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, 8% polyethylene glycol 8000, 8 mmGMP, 2.4 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 20 μg/ml T7 RNA polymerase, and a 0.2 μm concentration of the partially double-stranded DNA template. After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the solution was extracted with phenol (equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6)). The transcripts were subsequently precipitated with ethanol and separated on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel (38:2 cross-link) under denaturing conditions. After visualization by UV shadowing, the transcript with the correct length was cut out and electroeluted from the gel using a Biotrap® chamber (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel) To remove salt, which strongly favors the formation of biologically inactive dimers, both the unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled RNA oligonucleotides were precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol before further use. After incubation at −20 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 45 min, washed with 80% ethanol, dried, and resolubilized in 0.1 mm EDTA. Folding of the stem-loops was performed at a maximal concentration of 200 μm in a volume of 100 μl. The solution was incubated for 90 s at 80 °C and then rapidly cooled on ice. Under these conditions, all RNA oligonucleotides exclusively adopted the stem-loop conformation. To determine their exact concentration, RNA stem-loops were hydrolyzed by RNase P1 in a reaction mixture containing 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 1.6 mm ZnCl2, and 8 units/ml RNase P1 in a volume of 100 μl. After incubation for 2 h at 60 °C, the solution was diluted with distilled H2O, and potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. Subsequently, the absorption of the released nucleotide monophosphates was measured at 260 nm. From the value obtained, the oligonucleotide concentration was calculated using the specific absorption coefficients ε260 = 177.2 mm−1 cm−1for the fdhF minihelix and ε260 = 424.8 mm−1 cm−1for the fdnG stem-loop. The underlying specific absorption coefficients (ε260) of the nucleotide monophosphates were 15.31 m−1cm−1 for AMP, 11.67 mm−1 cm−1for GMP, 9.82 mm−1cm−1 for UMP, and 7.45 mm−1 cm−1for CMP. tRNASec was purified from E. coli MC4100 (18.Casadaban M.J. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4530-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) carrying plasmid pCB2013 according to the procedure described by Baron and Böck (19.Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined by aminoacylation withl-[14C]serine under saturating seryl-tRNA synthetase concentrations. The aminoacylation mixture was pipetted into 250 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1%l-serine. After addition of 100 μg of bakers' yeast tRNA, the precipitate was transferred onto glass-fiber filters and washed four times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1% l-serine, five times with 1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.05% l-serine, and three times with 1 ml of 80% ethanol. The filters were dried at 65 °C, and their radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Aminoacylation of tRNASec was performed in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 10 mm KCl, 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm ATP, 200 μml-serine, 83 μmtRNASec, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 units/ml pyrophosphatase, and 0.84 mg/ml seryl-tRNA synthetase. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.033 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and subsequent treatment with phenol equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Seryl-tRNASec was precipitated from the aqueous phase at −20 °C by addition of 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed with 80% ethanol, dried in vacuo, and resolubilized in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6). Ser-tRNASec was converted to selenocysteyl-tRNASec in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Pipes (pH 6.7), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, 250 μm sodium selenite, 17 μm seryl-tRNASec, 0.1 mg/ml SelA, and 5.9 mg/ml SelD. After incubation at 37 °C for 35 min, 0.05 volume of 3m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 0.05 volume of 200 mm DTT were added. The solution was thoroughly shaken with 1 volume of phenol equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was then mixed with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.6) and 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol and incubated for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, washed with 80% ethanol containing 5 mm DTT, dried in vacuo, and resolubilized in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.6) containing 5 mm DTT. All steps were performed in a glove box under anaerobic conditions. The concentration of selenocysteyl-tRNASec was determined by performing parallel reactions using sodium [75Se]selenite instead of the nonradioactive compound and determining the radioactivity as described above. Stopped-flow experiments were performed in a High Tech Scientific instrument using an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and an emission cutoff filter with an edge at 389 nm for monitoring the fluorescence from the methylanthraniloyl group. For tryptophan fluorescence, an excitation wavelength of 289 nm and a 320-nm cutoff filter were used. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, a combination of the 289-nm excitation wavelength with the 389-nm filter were used. To monitor the fluorescence of the fluorescein group, an excitation wavelength of 494 nm and a 530-nm cutoff filter were used. Since the protein stock solutions were in 50% glycerol and relatively dilute, all solutions of reactants were adjusted to 10% glycerol content. Experiments in which the only source of glycerol was the protein stock solution, which resulted in a final glycerol concentration in the observation chamber that was ≤5%, led to very similar results for nucleotide association kinetics, but with the disadvantage that there was a significant disturbance of the optical signal at the beginning of the transient. The buffer used contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Primary data fitting was performed with the software of the stopped-flow apparatus, and secondary analysis was with GraFit Version 3.0 (Erithacus Software, Staines, United Kingdom) and Scientist Version 2.01 (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). Binding of GTP and GDP derivatives with a methylanthraniloyl group in the ribose moiety to SelB resulted in a significant increase (∼130%) in the fluorescence of the attached group. It was difficult to use this signal in equilibrium titration experiments since titrating a fixed concentration of the enzyme with increasing concentrations of fluorescent nucleotide resulted in a strongly increasing background signal from excess unbound nucleotide. The standard solution to this problem would be to titrate an increasing concentration of protein to a fixed concentration of fluorescent nucleotide. This was precluded by the low solubility of the protein, which prevented preparation of a highly concentrated stock solution. These problems did not prevent transient kinetic experiments using the stopped-flow method, and an example of the fluorescence transient seen on rapid mixing of SelB and mantdGTP is shown in Fig.2 A. mantdGTP was used for most of the studies reported here since it was noticed that with mantGTP (i.e. the ribose rather than the deoxyribose derivative), biphasic association curves were obtained, and it was suspected that this was due to the fact that mantGTP is a mixture of the 2′- and 3′-isomers (20.Rensland H. Lautwein A. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11181-11185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The monophasic transients observed with mantdGTP were consistent with this interpretation. Increasing the mantdGTP concentration while keeping the SelB concentration constant led to a linear increase in the observed pseudo first-order rate constant of association, as shown in Fig.2 B. In this type of experiment, the observed rate constant is given by the following relationship (Equation 1), kobs=k+1(mantdGTP)+k−1Equation 1 where k +1 andk −1 are the association and dissociation rate constants, respectively in the interaction between the protein and the nucleotide. The slope of the fitted straight line in Fig. 2 B defines the value of k +1as 1.67 × 105m−1 s−1, whereas the intercept on the y axis is small, but appears to be of the order of ∼0.1 s−1, giving an approximate value for k −1. The value of k −1 was determined more exactly in a displacement experiment in which an excess of unlabeled GTP was used to displace mantGTP. As shown in Fig.3, the rate of mantdGTP release is indeed relatively slow and has the value of 0.092 s−1. Taking the two kinetic constants together allows us to calculate a value of 0.55 μm for theK d value of mantdGTP. This is in reasonable agreement with the value of 1.7 μm determined by equilibrium dialysis using radioactively labeled GTP (6.Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Since it was of importance to determine the corresponding parameters for the natural substrate GTP, intrinsic protein fluorescence was also examined as a potential signal of nucleotide binding. A small (∼2.5%) increase in fluorescence occurred on GTP binding, and although this was too small to be used conveniently for accurate equilibrium titrations, it could be used to monitor the association kinetics with SelB using the stopped-flow method. As can be seen from the data of Fig. 4 A, the signal is noisy, but increasing the GTP concentration led to an obvious increase in the rate of the transient seen. In Fig. 4 B, it is apparent that there is a linear dependence of the observed rate constant on the GTP concentration, and the slope of the plot of the rate constant against GTP concentration leads to a value of 2.16 × 105m−1s−1, which is similar to that of mantdGTP from Fig. 2 B. The rate constant for the association of unmodified GTP could also be determined by using it as a competitor for mantdGTP in experiments of the type described for Fig.5. Here, the GTP concentration was varied, and the mantdGTP concentration was held constant. The slope of the straight line fit to the data points defines the rate constant for GTP association with SelB, which, in approximate agreement with the results of Fig. 4 B, has a value of 1.93 × 105m−1s−1.Figure 5Competitive binding kinetics of SelB with mantdGTP in presence of varying concentrations of GTP. The concentrations of SelB and mantdGTP were 0.6 and 6 μm, respectively. Fluorescence was detected as described in the legend Fig.2. The fitted line corresponds to a value of 1.93 × 105m−1s−1 for k +1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rate constant for GTP release was determined by displacement with excess mantdGTP. Since this experiment could not be performed with a very large excess of mantdGTP (because of the high background from unbound mantdGTP), it was performed at two different concentrations of mantdGTP, both in moderate excess over GTP, which was preincubated with SelB. Since the measured rate constant in both cases was identical within experimental error, we conclude that this represents the valuek −1 for GTP (0.16 s−1). Again, the calculatedK d value (0.74 μm) is in good agreement with that determined previously by equilibrium dialysis (6.Forchhammer K. Leinfelder W. Böck A. Nature. 1989; 342: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). GDP and mantGDP displayed quantitatively different kinetics of the interaction with SelB when compared with GTP or mantGTP. Initial stopped-flow experiments showed that the association reaction was faster than for GTP or mantdGTP. Since the signal quality at the high concentrations of mantGDP needed for these studies was not sufficient to detect the deviation from monophasic behavior seen with mantGTP, the more readily available mantGDP (and not mantdGDP) was used for these experiments. Fig. 6 A shows the dependence of the observed rate constant for association of mantGDP on the concentration. From the approximately linear dependence, values of 1.79 × 106m−1s−1 for the association rate constant and 14.25 s−1 for the dissociation rate constant were obtained. The rate constant for association of unmodified GDP was obtained by examining the competing influence of GDP on the mantGDP association, as described above for GTP, and the results are shown in Fig. 6 B. The value obtained from the slope of the fitted straight line (1.12 × 106m−1 s−1) is similar to that for mantGDP and confirms that the association rate constant is considerably greater than for GTP. A further indication of the more rapid equilibration of GDP compared with GTP was obtained from experiments in which GDP was used as a competitor of mantdGTP binding in association reactions. In contrast to the behavior shown in Fig. 5, where GTP competed with mantdGTP binding, the first-order rate constant for mantdGTP binding decreased as the GDP concentration was increased (data not shown). As discussed previously (21.John J. Sohmen R. Feuerstein J. Linke R. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), this type of behavior arises when the competing ligand is in rapid equilibrium with its bound form on the time scale of the observed transient. More accurate estimates of the dissociation rate constants for mantGDP and GDP were obtained from displacement experiments, as shown in Fig.7. Displacement of mantGDP by GDP could be measured easily since a large excess of the nonfluorescent unmodified nucleotide could be used. The value of the dissociation rate constant obtained (13.9 s−1) is consistent with the magnitude of the intercept on the y axis in Fig.6 A (14.25 s−1). GDP dissociation was more difficult to measure due to the large background fluorescence of a high concentration of mantGDP as displacing agent. The experiment was repeated at two different concentrations of displacing agent, with little effect on the measured rate constant, which was ∼15 s−1. The calculated K d values for GDP and mantGDP are 13.4 and 7.8 μm, respectively. The results of the kinetic experiments with GTP, GDP, and their fluorescent derivatives are summarized in Table I.Table IRate constants for the interaction of SelB with guanosine nucleotides and their mant derivativesNucleotidek ak dK dm −1 s −1s −1μmmantdGTP1.67 × 1050.0920.55GTP2.16 × 105 aDetermined directly by intrinsic fluorescence.0.160.74GTP1.93 × 105 bDetermined by competition with mantdGTP.mantGDP1.79 × 10613.97.8GDP1.12 × 106 cDetermined by competition with mantGDP.15.013.4a Determined directly by intrinsic fluorescence.b Determined by competition with mantdGTP.c Determined by competition with mantGDP. Open table in a new tab On interaction of SelB with the 17-mer fdhF minihelix, there was a small quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence. However, the size of the signal change was too small to allow reliable kinetic or titration experiments to be performed. Detailed investigations of the interactions of the two RNA stem-loop structures directing selenocysteine insertion in E. coli(Fig. 1) with SelB were possible using a fluorescently labeled construct. The fdhF minihelix bearing a fluorescein group at the 5′-end displayed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity on interaction with the protein. The signal was stable enough to allow a titration of SelB to a constant concentration of labeledfdhF minihelix RNA. This resulted in a maximal increase of ∼7% in fluorescein fluorescence. The shape of the curve obtained (Fig. 8 A) already indicates a high affinity for the interaction since at the concentration used (181 nm fluorescent fdhF minihelix), the almost linear approach to the plateau reached at saturation suggests that theK d value must be much less than 181 nm. Fitting the data to a quadratic equation leads to aK d value of 0.7 nm. However, t"

However, in blood serum the major proportion of FFA is tightly bound to albumin, whereas unbound FFA are hardly detectable. Since serum FFA elevation occurs under pathological conditions like insulin resistance or cancer, which are often associated with a disturbed immune response, we addressed the question of whether increased serum FFA concentrations could affect T lymphocyte activation under in vivo conditions. Our studies revealed that 1) addition of pure long-chain cis-unsaturated FFA in the absence of albumin inhibited calcium response in cultured Jurkat T cells. 2) In healthy volunteers, serum FFA elevation by a lipid/heparin infusion, including predominantly unsaturated fatty acids, decreased calcium response of cultured T cells in contrast to studies without heparin. 3) Most notably, stepwise increasing serum FFA by lipid/heparin infusion also inhibited calcium response of simultaneously isolated autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes as well as their CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets. In conclusion, our data emphasize that serum FFA elevation is able to exert immunosuppressive effects in vivo."

The genetic analysis of mammary gland tumorigenesis requires the development of mammary gland-specific transgenics, which are tightly regulated throughout the adult mammary epithelium. Analysis of genes implicated in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been hampered by mosaic transgene expression and the findings that homozygous deletion of several candidate genes (cyclin D1, Stat5A, prolactin receptor) abrogates normal mammary gland development. We describe the development of transgenic mouse lines in which sustained transgene expression was inducibly regulated, both specifically and homogeneously, in the adult mammary gland epithelium. Transgenes encoding RXRα and a chimeric ecdysone receptor under control of a modified MMTV-LTR, which targets mammary gland expression, were used. These trans-genic ‘receptor’ lines were crossed with transgenic ‘enhancer’ lines in which the ecdysone/RXR binding site induced ligand-dependent expression of trans-genic β-galactosidase. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a highly bioactive ligand (ponasterone A), identified through screening ecdysteroids from local plants, demonstrated sustained release and transgene expression in vivo. This transgenic model with both tightly regulated and homogeneous transgene expression, which was sustained in vivo using ligands readily extracted from local flora, has broad practical applicability for genetic analysis of mammary gland disease.—Albanese, C., Reutens, A.

Transformed yeast cells expressing GFA1 demonstrated resistance to methylmercury but no resistance to p-chloromercuribenzoate, a GFAT inhibitor. The cytotoxicity of methylmercury was inhibited by loading excess glucosamine 6-phosphate into yeast.

https://openalex.org/W1981692425,"DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis, is regulated by a specific nuclease called caspase-activated DNase (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD). When cell lysates from Drosophila S2 cells were chemically denatured and the denatured proteins were removed after dialysis, the supernatant inhibited Drosophila CAD (dCAD). To identify the inhibitor, we tested recombinant DREP-1, which was previously identified using the Drosophila EST data base and found it also inhibited dCAD DNase. An antibody against DREP-1 inhibited the ICAD activity in the S2 cell extracts, confirming the identification of DREP-1 as a Drosophila homolog of ICAD (dICAD). The recombinant DREP-1/dICAD was cleaved at a specific site by human caspase 3 as well as by extracts prepared from S2 cells undergoing apoptosis. Biochemical fractionation and immunoprecipitation of dICAD from S2 cell extracts indicated that dICAD is complexed with dCAD in proliferating cells. The expression of the caspase-resistant form of dICAD/DREP-1 in a Drosophila neuronal cell line prevented the apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Northern hybridization and the immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the expression of thedICAD gene is developmentally regulated."
https://openalex.org/W1828295006,"The discoidin domain receptor (DDR1) is characterized by a discoidin I motif in the extracellular domain, an unusually long cytoplasmic juxtamembrane (JM) region, and a kinase domain that is 45% identical to that of the NGF receptor, TrkA. DDR1 also has a major splice form, which has a 37 amino acid insert in the JM region with a consensus Shc PTB site that is lacking in the shorter receptor. One class of ligands for the DDR receptors has recently been identified as being derived from the collagen family, but neither native PC12 cells, which express modest amounts of DDR1, nor transfected PC12 cells, which express much larger amounts of DDR1, respond to this ligand. A chimeric receptor, containing the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta fused to the transmembrane and intracellular regions of DDR1, also fails to mediate neuronal-like differentiation in stably transfected PC12 cells and is only weakly autophosphorylated. However, chimeric receptors, which are composed of combinations of intracellular regions from DDR1 and TrkA (with the extracellular domain of hPDGFRbeta), in some cases provided ligand (PDGF) -inducible receptor responses. Those with the TrkA kinase domain and the DDR1 JM regions were able to produce differentiation to varying degrees, whereas the opposite combination did not. Analysis of the signaling responses of the two chimeras with DDR1 JM sequences (with and without the insert) indicated that the shorter sequence bound and activated FRS2 whereas the insert-containing form activated Shc instead. Both activated PLCgamma through the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of the TrkA domain (Y785 in TrkA residue numbering). Mutation of this site (Y-->F) eliminated PLCgamma activation (indicating there are no other cryptic binding sites for PLCgamma in the DDR1 sequences) and markedly reduced the differentiative activity of the receptor. This is in contrast to TrkA (or PDGFRbeta/TrkA chimeras), where ablation of this pathway has no notable effect on PC12 cell morphogenic responses. Thus, the activation of FRS2 and Shc (leading to MAPK activation) is weaker in the DDR1/TrkA chimeras than in TrkA alone, and the PLCgamma contribution becomes essential for full response. Nonetheless, both DDR1 JM regions contain potentially usable signaling sites, albeit they apparently are not activated directly in DDR1 (or DDR1 chimeras) in a ligand-dependent fashion. These findings suggest that the DDR1 receptors do have signaling capacity but may require additional components or altered conditions to fully activate their kinase domains and/or sustain the activation of the JM sites."

Carnitine is essential for the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to mitochondria for subsequent β-oxidation, and the lack of carnitine impairs the ability to use fat as fuel during periods of fasting or stress. This can result in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, Reye's syndrome, and sudden infant death in younger children or in skeletal or heart myopathy with insidious onset later in life.

It belongs to a family of transporters believed important in drug absorption and detoxification, although the physiological substrate has been identified only for OCTN2. Human fibroblasts express the carnitine transporter defective in primary carnitine deficiency (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This transporter is not inhibited by amino acids, but is competitively inhibited by acetylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine, butyrobetaine, and betaine. Noncompetitive inhibition is observed with verapamil and quinidine (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Preliminary experiments indicated that this mutation reduced carnitine transport without affecting the K m for carnitine recognition (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since the majority of mutations reported in the sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 impair membrane trafficking (13.Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Eskandari S. Lam J.T. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar), it was proposed that the E452K substitution could impair insertion of OCTN2 carnitine transporters to the plasma membrane, with the transporters reaching the plasma membrane having normal affinity for carnitine (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we report that the E452K mutation does not affect membrane insertion of carnitine transporters, but impairs activation of carnitine transport by the cotransported sodium. This is the first natural mutation in a sodium cotransporter affecting energization of substrate transport and identifies a novel domain involved in sodium recognition or transfer. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum. Carnitine transport was measured at 37 °C with the cluster-tray method as described previously (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8.Wang Y. Ye J. Ganapathy V. Longo N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (Costar Corp.) and depleted of intracellular amino acids by incubation for 90 min in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 5.5 mmd-glucose and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Carnitine (0.5 μm, 0.5 μCi/ml) was then added to the cells for 10 min. Nonsaturable carnitine transport was measured in the presence of 2 mm unlabeled carnitine. The transport reaction was stopped by rapidly washing the cells four times with ice-cold 0.1 m MgCl2. Intracellular carnitine was then corrected for intracellular water content and expressed as nmol/ml of cell water (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Saturable carnitine transport was calculated by subtracting sodium-independent carnitine transport from total transport, and values are reported as means ± S.E. of three to six independent determinations. Carnitine transport in the absence of sodium was measured substituting methylglucamine for sodium so that the sum of methylglucamine and sodium remained constant at 150 mm (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Initial experiments on transfected cells indicated that carnitine accumulation at 0.5 μm was linear for up to 30 min in cells expressing the normal OCTN2 transporter and for up to 4 h in cells expressing mutant transporters, with a roughly inverse correlation between transport activity and time during which transport remained linear (data not shown). Kinetic constants for carnitine transport were determined by nonlinear regression analysis according to a Michaelis-Menten equation (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Na+-independent carnitine transport was determined in parallel trays and subtracted from total transport to obtain Na+-dependent carnitine transport. Nonlinear parameters are expressed as means ± 95% confidence intervals. The K m for sodium (K Na) was calculated from the intersection (−1/K Na) of linear regressions of 1/v versus 1/[sodium] at three different carnitine concentrations (14.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics.

The 3′-primer removed the physiological stop codon of OCTN2 (TAA). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated in the corresponding restriction sites of pEGFP-N2 (CLONTECH). The resulting plasmid had the OCTN2 cDNA fused in frame with the green fluorescent protein under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The final vector was sequenced, confirming the absence of polymerase chain reaction artifacts and the correct fusion with the green fluorescent protein. This plasmid was transfected into CHO cells by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks, and several independent clones of transfected cells were isolated. The E452K, E452A, E452Q, and E452D mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The final plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations and the absence of polymerase chain reaction artifacts. The plasmids obtained were then transfected into CHO cells as described above. Cellular RNA was extracted with guanidinium thiocyanate, separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nylon, and hybridized under high-stringency conditions with the OCTN2 and actin cDNAs. cpm in each band were determined using a micro-array radioactivity detector (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.). Lane-specific background was subtracted from each lane. OCTN2 cpm were normalized for actin cpm to correct for variations in RNA loading. Linearity of the assay was determined using increasing amounts of control RNA (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gel was then exposed to film. Subcellular distribution of normal and mutant OCTN2 carnitine transporters conjugated with the green fluorescent protein was analyzed by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope). Cells were seeded on glass slides and covered with medium and a coverslip whose borders were chemically sealed. Images of the cells were obtained at 1-μm sections. Multiple cells were scanned, and the ones shown are representative of the fields observed. The initial kinetic experiments indicated that the E452K mutation decreased the V max for carnitine transport, without affecting the K m (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This was consistent with the fact that the mutation could impair maturation of the transporter to the plasma membrane, as described for mutations in the sodium/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (13.Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Eskandari S. Lam J.T. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). To test this possibility, the OCTN2 transporter was tagged with the green fluorescent protein to assess its subcellular distribution. Conjugation with the green fluorescent protein did not affect carnitine transport activity, which remained similar in CHO cells expressing the native OCTN2 cDNA and the normal cDNA with a C-terminal addition of the green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1 A). TheK m for sodium-dependent carnitine transport was 2.9 ± 1.3 μm in CHO cells transfected with GFP-tagged OCTN2, a value similar to that seen in CHO cells expressing the native OCTN2 cDNA (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in human fibroblasts (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, the V max for sodium-dependent carnitine transport was in the range measured in cells expressing the native OCTN2 cDNA (12.Wang Y. Kelly M.A. Cowan T.M. Longo N. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (TableI). Two different clones of CHO cells expressing the E452K mutant carnitine transporter (E452K2 and E452K) also retained normal K m values for carnitine (3.3 ± 1.6 and 6.2 ± 1.8 μm) (Fig. 1,B and C), although theirV max values for sodium-dependent carnitine transport were still markedly reduced compared with that of normal OCTN2 (Table I). These results indicate that modification of the C terminus of the carnitine transporter does not significantly affect carnitine recognition and transfer.Table IKinetic constants for Na + -dependent carnitine transport in CHO cells expressing normal and mutant carnitine transportersV maxK mnmol/ml/hμmOCTN2462.6 ± 34.13.9 ± 1.3E452K15.9 ± 1.16.2 ± 1.8E452K235.0 ± 3.13.1 ± 1.3E452A65.0 ± 2.62.6 ± 0.5E452D108.9 ± 4.83.0 ± 0.6E452Q114.9 ± 1.53.9 ± 0.2Kinetic constants for carnitine (0.5–100 μm) transport were determined in the absence or presence of sodium (150 mm).

Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants for carnitine (0.5–100 μm) transport were determined in the absence or presence of sodium (150 mm). Na+-independent carnitine transport was subtracted from total transport to obtain Na+-dependent carnitine transport. Parameters are shown as means ± 95% confidence intervals. Analysis of the cells with a confocal microscope indicated that CHO cells transfected with the pEGFP vector alone had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of green fluorescence (Fig.2 A). By contrast, the fluorescence was concentrated at the periphery of the cell on the plasma membrane in cells in which GFP was conjugated with normal OCTN2 (Fig. 2 B). To our surprise, cells expressing the E452K mutant OCTN2 transporter had a distribution of fluorescence identical to that of cells expressing normal OCTN2 (Fig. 2 C), indicating that this mutation does not impair insertion of the transporter to the plasma membrane. The carnitine transporter defective in primary carnitine deficiency is energized by the sodium electrochemical potential (6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We determined the kinetic constants of normal and mutant OCTN2 for sodium to test whether the E452K mutation affected energization of the carnitine transporter by the sodium electrochemical gradient. Sodium was substituted by methylglucamine in the uptake medium (Fig.3). The dependence of carnitine transport on the extracellular sodium concentration was measured at different carnitine concentrations to estimate the K Nafrom the intersection of the reciprocal plots (14.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 274-345Google Scholar). Na+-independent transport was subtracted from all transport data prior to analysis. CHO cells expressing the normal human OCTN2 cDNA had a K Na of 11.6 mm (Fig.3 A). This value approaches that measured in cultured fibroblasts (14.9 mm) using the same mathematical procedure (from Fig. 2 of Ref. 6.Scaglia F. Wang Y. Longo N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the E452K mutant transporter had a K Na of 187 mm, which was 16 times higher than that of cells expressing the normal OCTN2 transporter (Fig. 3 B). Similar K Na values were obtained in CHO cells transfected with the E452K mutant OCTN2 cDNA not conjugated to the green fluorescent protein (data not shown), indicating that the abnormal K Na is not an artifact due to the interaction of the mutant protein with the green fluorescent protein. These results suggest that the E452K mutation impairs sodium stimulation of carnitine transport by the OCTN2 transporter. In a random bireactant system, binding of one substrate may affect the affinity of the transporter for the other substrate (14.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 274-345Google Scholar). Since the E452K mutation significantly increased the K Na, we evaluated the apparent K m for carnitine at different extracellular sodium concentrations (2–150 mm). If the E452K mutation were located close to the carnitine-binding site, at low concentrations of sodium, the recognition of carnitine could have been affected, and the K m could have been significantly increased. As shown in Fig.4 A, theV max for carnitine transport remained relatively constant at all extracellular sodium concentrations in two independent clones of CHO cells expressing the normal OCTN2 transporter (inverted triangles) and in E452K2 cells (circles). By contrast, the apparent K mfor carnitine decreased as the sodium concentration increased in cells expressing both the normal and E452K mutant carnitine transporters. However, most of the decrease occurred at relatively low concentrations of sodium and was complete at 50 mm sodium (Fig.4 B). This indicates that only minimal amounts of sodium are required to improve recognition of carnitine by this transporter. Importantly, the decrease in the apparent K m for carnitine was identical in cells expressing the normal and E452K mutant transporters, indicating that the E452K mutation does not affect initial binding of sodium to the transporter and carnitine recognition. The structure of the carnitine transporter is unknown. Hydropathy analysis of the amino acid sequence of OCTN2 by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (26.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol.

When OCTN2 is modeled according to other similar membrane transporters, both the amino and carboxyl termini face the cytoplasm (3.Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

This model places on the correct side of the membrane potential glycosylation and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites as well as the sugar transporter protein signature sequence motif and the ATP/GTP-binding motif (3.Wu X.

According to this model, the E452K mutation affects an intracellular loop located between predicted transmembrane domains 10 and 11. In view of the marked increased K Na of the E452K mutant transporter (Fig. 3) and the normal decrease in theK m for carnitine with increased sodium concentration (Fig. 4), we formulated the hypothesis that Glu452 was needed for the correct transfer of the carnitine-sodium complex inside the cell. To test whether the negative charge of Glu452 was required for this function, alanine (E452A), glutamine (E452Q), or aspartate (E452D) was inserted in position 452 by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting plasmids were expressed in CHO cells. Fig. 1 shows that all mutant transporters conserved a normalK m for carnitine, but theV max for sodium-dependent carnitine transport decreased progressively as follows: wild-type OCTN2 > E452D and E452Q > E452A > E452K (Table I). The lack of changes in the K m for carnitine confirmed that Glu452 is probably not involved in carnitine recognition. By contrast, the K Na decreased progressively as follows: E452K (187 mm; Fig. 3 B) > E452A (80 mm; Fig.5 A) > E452D (40.8 mm; Fig. 5 B) > E452Q (38.9 mm; Fig. 5 C) > normal Glu452 (11.6 mm; Fig. 3 A). The K Navalues of normal and mutant carnitine transporters were then plotted against the V max for carnitine transport normalized for OCTN2 mRNA levels (Fig.6). There was a significant (p < 0.01) exponential decrease in theV max for carnitine transport with the increase in K Na (r 2 = 0.98). The inverse correlation between carnitine transport and theK Na supports the hypothesis that decreased carnitine transport by the E452K mutation is due to altered sodium stimulation of carnitine transfer by OCTN2. It also indicates that glutamate in this position is more effective than aspartate for sodium handling and that the length of the side chain is more important than the net charge of this residue since glutamine was similar to aspartate in approaching normal function.Figure 6Correlation between carnitine transport andK Na in CHO cells expressing normal and mutant carnitine transporters. A, RNA was extracted from CHO cells and analyzed by Northern blot analysis with hybridization to the full-length OCTN2 cDNA and to a human actin cDNA fragment. cpm in each band were counted on an Instant Imager and normalized for actin cpm. B, theV max for carnitine transport (Table I) was normalized for OCTN2 mRNA levels (using expression of normal OCTN2 as a standard) and plotted against K Na. Theline represents the best fit of the data to an exponential decay equation (p < 0.01 with analysis of variance;r 2 = 0.976).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Most of our knowledge of sodium/solute cotransporters derives from the study of bacterial proteins and the Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (13.Wright E.M.

In this latter protein, the N terminus seems devoted to sodium recognition and transfer, whereas the C terminus forms a pore for glucose (13.Wright E.M. Loo D.D. Panayotova-Heiermann M. Hirayama B.A. Turk E. Eskandari S. Lam J.T. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar). Most natural mutations of SGLT1 identified in patients with glucose/galactose malabsorption impair membrane insertion of the carrier protein (16.Martin M.G. Turk E. Lostao M.P. Kerner C. Wright E.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 17.Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G879-G882PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Lam J.T. Martin M.G. Turk E.

In SGLT1 and other sodium cotransporters, tyrosyl residues on the extracellular side of the transporter have been involved in sodium binding based on studies with tyrosyl group-modifying agents (19.Wright E.M. Peerce B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14993-14996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Peerce B.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6026-6031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, site-directed substitution of tyrosyl residues in the OCTN2 transporter failed to affect sodium affinity (15.Seth P. Wu X. Huang W. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33388-33392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conserved acidic and polar residues in transmembrane domains have been proposed to participate in sodium binding and progression across the plasma membrane (21.Griffith D.A. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22.Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only selected transmembrane acidic residues are essential for this process (21.Griffith D.A. Pajor A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is no information on the role of acidic residues putatively facing the cytoplasmic side of mammalian sodium cotransporters. Bacterial sodium/solute cotransporters usually have a higher affinity for cotransported cations than their mammalian counterparts, withK Na values in the μm rather than the mm range (23.Jung H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Acidic residues in the N terminus of these transporters are responsible for sodium binding, whereas polar residues in the transmembrane domain of the bacterial Na+/proline cotransporters are important for sodium transfer as in their mammalian counterparts (23.Jung H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24.Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An acidic residue (Asp187) located in the cytoplasmic side of the Na+/proline cotransporter of Escherichia coli is essential for sodium and solute transfer and may play a role in the release of Na+ to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (24.Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As with substitution of Glu452 in the OCTN2 carnitine transporter, substitution of Asp187 in the bacterial Na+/proline cotransporter with Glu, Asn, or Cys resulted in a progressive decrease in the V max for proline uptake, without major changes in the K m for proline (24.Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this decrease in V max was not correlated with altered affinity for sodium, which was only minimally affected by the substitutions (24.Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), mitigating the analogy with the E452K mutation. However, a role of Glu452 in the release of sodium to the cytoplasm remains a possibility. An additional possibility is that Glu452 participates in the conformational change of the transporter during the transport process. In facilitative glucose transporters such as GLUT1 and GLUT4, the interaction of the negative and positive side chains of glutamic acid and arginine in the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane domains seems to play a key role in alternating the transporter between an outward- and inward-facing conformation (25.Schurmann A. Doege H. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Buchs A. Joost H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Substitution of some of these amino acids can lock the facilitative transporter in an outward- or inward-facing configuration, as assessed by the binding of ligands specific for the two conformations of the transporter (25.Schurmann A. Doege H. Ohnimus H. Monser V. Buchs A. Joost H.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The OCTN2 carnitine transporter has a GLUT signature motif between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (3.Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 4.Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20378-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), and the domain affected by the E452K mutation could interact with a neighboring positive residue (Arg459) to modify the conformation of the carnitine transporter. In summary, the E452K mutation represents the first natural mutation affecting sodium-stimulated substrate uptake in a mammalian cotransporter and identifies a novel functional domain of mammalian cotransporters, possibly related to the release of sodium in the cytoplasm or to the dynamic alteration of transporter conformation necessary for transmembrane solute/co-substrate transfer.

Three extracellular subregions of LFA-1 are critical in ligand binding. The first is a sequence of seven 60-amino acid repeats located in the N-terminal half of the αL subunit. These seven repeats are a common structural feature of all integrin α subunits. These repeats have been predicted to fold into a β-propeller domain with seven β-sheets (9.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl.

In contrast to αIIb, α4, and α5, the leukocyte integrins contain an additional domain of about 200 amino acids. It is inserted into a loop at the top of the β-propeller domain between β-sheets 2 and 3, and is designated the inserted (I) domain. I domain structures for αL and αMhave been determined by crystallography (15.Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.

The I domain folds into a doubly twisted α/β structure with a ligand binding site known as a metal ion-dependent adhesion site, or MIDAS, in a crevice on its upper face. The third region important for ligand binding by integrins is in the N-terminal half of the β2subunit from residue 100 to 340, which is well conserved among different integrin β subunits.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), little is known about conformational change in the β-propeller or I-like domains of leukocyte integrins. Moreover, the structural basis for interactions between these domains remains unknown. Previously, there has been no direct evidence for structural association between the α subunit β-propeller domain and the β subunit I-like domain, despite their joint role in regulating ligand binding. mAb have been used to show that folding of epitopes in the I-like domain is dependent on association with the α subunit, and that folding of epitopes in the β-propeller domain is dependent on association with the β subunit (35.Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This mutual dependence raised the possibility of an intimate structural association between the β-propeller and I-like domains. The mAb used in the above studies were demonstrated to be completely dependent for binding on species-specific residues in either the LFA-1 α or β, but not both subunits (35.Huang C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, mAb used to study folding of the β-propeller domain of the human αL subunit were reactive with αLβ2 complexes whether the β2subunit was of human, mouse, or chicken origin (36.Huang C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Mapping an antibody with an epitope combined from both integrin α and β subunits would elucidate structural information on intersubunit association. We describe here such a mAb, YTA-1. YTA-1 is specific for the human LFA-1 integrin but has properties that distinguish it from other antibodies to LFA-1 (37.Sugie K. Nakamura K. Teshigawara K. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Nakamura Y. Leonard W.J. Uchida A. Yodoi J. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 38.Sugie K. Minami Y. Kawakami T. Uchida A. Int. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1691-1698Google Scholar). It reacts strongly with CD3−/CD16+ large granular lymphocytes that function as natural killer cells, but not with other peripheral blood lymphocytes that express LFA-1. Furthermore, YTA-1 is mitogenic for natural killer cells and can activate natural killer cytotoxicity. The antibody was established to be specific for LFA-1 based on its ability to bind to transfectants expressing LFA-1 but not the related β2 integrins Mac-1 or p150,95. In distinction to other described antibodies to LFA-1, binding of YTA-1 to LFA-1 could be competed away by certain mAbs against both the αL and β2 subunits (37.Sugie K. Nakamura K. Teshigawara K. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Nakamura Y. Leonard W.J. Uchida A. Yodoi J. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that YTA-1 recognizes an activation-dependent epitope on LFA-1 consisting of residues from both the β2 subunit and the αL subunit. We identify these specific amino acid residues and their positions in models of the αLβ-propeller domain and the β2 I-like domain. Direct association between these subunits is thus demonstrated and localized.DISCUSSIONWe provide direct evidence for association between the I-like domain of integrin β subunits and the β-propeller domain of integrin α subunits. We map the epitope of the anti-LFA-1 mAb YTA-1 to specific residues in these domains, and thus localize a region of close contact between the I-like and β-propeller domains. Interestingly, we find that YTA-1 preferentially recognizes activated LFA-1 and blocks LFA-1 binding to its ligand ICAM-1, suggesting that this specific intersubunit association is related to the active conformation of LFA-1.Models of the LFA-1 β-propeller and I-like domains are useful for understanding our findings in three dimensions. We made an αL subunit β-propeller model using the alignment with the transducin G protein β subunit β-propeller domain shown in Fig.4, as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig.10). The approach was similar to that previously used to model α4 and αMβ-propellers (9.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 32.Oxvig C. Lu C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Residues Pro78, Thr79, and Asp80 of the YTA-1 epitope are predicted to be in a turn or loop between β-strands 1 and 2 in β-sheet 2 (W2) of the αL subunit β-propeller (Fig. 4). Thus, they are on the lower surface of the β-propeller (Fig. 10). Residues Ile365 and Asn367 are predicted to be in β-strand 4 of W3 of the propeller (Fig. 4), located on the approximately cylindrical side of the β-propeller, about midway between the top and bottom (Fig. 10). Because β-strand 4 is the most challenging of the four β-strands in each sheet to align, the position within this β-strand should be considered tentative, whereas the alignment of β-strands 1 and 2 and hence the position of residues 78–80 in the model is straightforward. In the YTA-1 epitope, residues 365 and 367 are more important than 78–80. Introduction of the conservative substitutions V365I and Q367N into the mouse αL subunit is sufficient to completely restore binding of YTA-1 mAb. On the other hand, the much more drastic substitutions A78P, A79T, and K80D into mouse αL only partially reconstitute the YTA-1 epitope; therefore, it is possible that these substitutions alter the backbone structure of the loop between β strands 1 and 2, and indirectly affect the conformation of nearby residues.Antibody competition experiments showed that mAb with epitopes localized to W1, to W2, or to W5–W7 did not block YTA-1 binding, whereas the CBR LFA-1/1 mAb localized to W3 did block YTA-1 binding. Overall, these findings localize the YTA-1 epitope on the β-propeller domain to a region centered near residues Ile365 and Asn367, on the side of the β-propeller at blade 3.Recently, a β2 subunit I-like domain model was constructed that is supported by threading and secondary structure predictions, and by independent mAb epitope mapping data (57.Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 11). The I-like domain was modeled using several I domains as templates. Regions of the model that are well aligned with the templates are coded with a blue ribbon backbone, and two long insertions in the I-like domain relative to the I domain, and other regions of uncertain topology, are coded with gray ribbon backbones. The previous epitope mapping studies showed that β2 subunit residues Arg133 and Asn339 are both present in the epitope of certain mAb, and residues Arg133 and His332 are both present in another mAb's epitope. In agreement, the model predicts that these residues are on α-helices α1 and α6, which are adjacent in the structure (Fig. 11) (57.Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21514-21524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The current study identified residues Ser302 and Arg303 as the YTA-1 epitope on the β2 subunit. Residues Ser302 and Arg303 were necessary for the YTA-1 epitope, as shown by substitution for mouse residues, and sufficient for the YTA-1 epitope, as shown by substitution into mouse β2. Residues Ser302 and Arg303 are predicted to be in a turn between β-strand 5 and α-helix 5, at the top of the I-like domain (gold side chains, Fig. 11). In Fig.11, other antigenic residues defined in β2 are shown asrose-pink side chains, and the positions of antigenic residues defined in β1 are shown as rose-pink lollipops. It is interesting that the antigenic residues extend only over one half of the surface of the I-like domain model (Fig. 11, A and B). In the center of this surface is the “front” face of the I-like domain, which bears helices α6, α1, and α2 (Fig. 11, A and B). All three helices bear antigenic residues, and these extend from the top to the bottom of this face. N-linked glycosylation sites in β integrin I-like domains are also restricted to the same half of the I-like domain surface (gray lollipops, Fig.11). Residues Ser302 and Arg303, in the β5-α5 loop, are on the top face of the I-like domain (Fig.11 A), and form what may be thought of as the upper-left corner of the antigenic surface (Fig. 11 B). Glu175 in β2 is on the upper right corner, in a disulfide-bonded turn (Fig. 11 B). Viewed from the top, Ser302/Arg303 and Glu175 are on opposite ends of the upper face, and in between them is the putative Mg2+ ion of the MIDAS of the I-like domain.Figure 11Stereodiagram of a theoretical model of the β2 subunit I-like domain. A, top view; B, view from the antigenic “front” face bearing the α6, α1, and α2 helices;C, view from the “back” face bearing the α3, α4, and α5 helices. Residues Ser302 and Arg303 in the YTA-1 epitope are shown as gold side chains. Other β2 antigenic residues are shown as rose-pink side chains (see Footnote 2), and positions that are antigenic in β1 integrins (20.Shih D.T. Doettiger D. Buck C.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2619-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are shown as pink lollipops with a large Cβ atom and a Cα-Cβ bond. Sites that are predicted to beN-glycosylated in at least 2 of 35 integrin β subunits are shown as gray lollipops. See Footnote 2 for preparation of the model. The ribbon trace for regions of the model that are well aligned to the I-domain templates is blue and for regions of insertions or uncertain topology is gray. The hypothetical Mg2+ bound to the MIDAS is shown as a gray sphere. Fog is used as a depth cue. Figure was prepared with RIBBONS (55.Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our model and the data on the YTA-1 epitope suggest that the I-like domain associates closely at its “top left” corner in the β5-α5 loop with the β-propeller domain. It is intriguing that Ser302 and Arg303 are at the boundary between the front face, which bears antigenic and N-linked glycosylation sites, and the back face, which is devoid of antigenic residues and N-linked sites, except for oneN-linked site near Arg303 on the α5 helix (Fig. 11 C). Thus, the back face may be buried in an interface with the β-propeller domain, with Ser302 and Arg303 on the solvent exposed face near its boundary with the buried face, and hence near to the α subunit β-propeller, and to residues on its surface including Ile365 and Asn367.The ability of many of the mAb directed to the β subunit I-like domain to competitively inhibit binding of YTA-1 is consistent with the proximity of the antigenic residues to one another on the same side of the I-like domain (Fig. 11, A and B). In the model, Cα distances are 18 Å between Ser302 and His322, and 22 Å between Ser302 and Glu175. Since antibodies have footprints about 30 Å in diameter, there could easily be overlap between the footprints of YTA-1 recognizing Ser302 and other antibodies recognizing His322 or Glu175, giving competition between antibody binding. However, there also could be an indirect interaction between the YTA-1 epitope and residues Arg133 and His332. Knockout of both Arg133 and His332, but not either residue alone, abolished binding of YTA-1. In contrast, knock-in of both of these residues yielded no reconstitution of the YTA-1 epitope whatsoever. Furthermore, some mAb that bind to Arg133 and His332 did not block binding of YTA-1, and blocking was variable depending on the cell type examined. Indirect effects on the YTA-1 epitope may occur because this epitope is dependent on the activation state of LFA-1. Therefore, we have been careful throughout this study to use two independent methods to identify residues directly involved in the YTA-1 epitope: human to mouse mutations to decrease or abolish YTA-1 binding, and mouse to human mutations to reconstitute YTA-1 binding.The YTA-1 epitope mapping results lead us to the conclusion that the top edge of the I-like domain associates with the side of the β-propeller domain at β-sheets 2 and 3. These data establish a point of contact between these domains, but not their orientation relative to one another. Interestingly, a second point of contact has very recently been revealed between the αIIbβ-propeller domain and the β3 I-like domain in elegant work by Takada and co-workers (53.Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that mapped ligand-mimetic antibodies. The residues recognized by these mAb in β3are present in the same disulfide-bonded loop that contains Glu175 in β2; thus, this contact region is on the top face of the I-like domain on the edge opposite from Ser302 and Arg303 (Fig. 11, Aand B). This same loop has been demonstrated to bear specificity for ligand and has been termed the specificity-determining loop (53.Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 54.Takagi J. Kamata T. Meredith J. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19794-19800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The contact residues in αIIb are in the 4–1 loops at the top edge of the β-propeller, between β-sheets 2 and 3, and between β-sheets 3 and 4. Thus, both YTA-1 to LFA-1 and the ligand mimetic antibodies to αIIbβ3contact the β-propeller on the side with β-sheet 3, but the ligand-mimetic-defined contact is at the top of the side, whereas the YTA-1-defined contact is on the middle to bottom of the side. With two points of contact, the relative orientation of the β-propeller and I-like domains can be predicted (Fig.12). The top of the I-like domain is in contact with the side of the β-propeller domain. Furthermore, the edge of the I-like domain with β-strand 3 and α-helix 2 is toward the top of the β-propeller, whereas the edge with β-strand 6 and α-helix 6 is toward the bottom of the β-propeller. It is tempting to speculate that the back face of the I-like domain, which lacks antigenic residues and N-linked sites, is in contact with the β-propeller. If so, then the orientation defined by the epitopes would mean that with the top of I-like domain contacting the β-propeller near β-sheet 3, the bottom would extend toward β-sheet 5, rather than toward β-sheet 1 (Fig. 12). Note that the putative MIDAS motif is positioned in the middle of the interface between the β-propeller and I-like domain, as appropriate for a function in ligand binding, or in regulating the conformation of loops involved in ligand binding. The I-like domain MIDAS and the specificity-determining loop are well situated to interact with ligand-binding loops on the upper surface of the β-propeller in β-sheets 2, 3, and 4 of the αIIb, α4, and α5 integrins (see Introduction for references).Figure 12Schematic diagram of the orientation between the β-propeller and I-like domains. The orientation is based on the points of contact defined by the YTA-1 mAb here, and the ligand mimetic mAb in (53.Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The top of the I-like domain contacts W3 of the β-propeller, with the edge bearing β-Ser302 and β-Arg303 and β-strand 6 of the I-like domain near the lower half of W2 and W3 of the β-propeller, bearing α-Pro78, α-Thr79, α-Asp80, α-Ile365, and α-Asn367, as shown with the YTA-1 mAb; and the edge bearing the specificity-determining loop with β-Glu175and β-strand 3 near the top of W3, as shown with ligand-mimetic mAb to αIIbβ3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The I domain is inserted into a loop at the top of the β-propeller domain, between β-sheets 2 and 3. Therefore, the bottom of the I domain is in close proximity to the top of the I-like domain. The C-terminal α-helix of the I domain moves 10 Å down the side of the domain in a movement that is linked to a shift from a putative inactive to active ligand binding configuration at the top of the domain (31.Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interface between the α subunit β-propeller and β subunit I-like domains is well positioned both to indirectly regulate ligand binding by I domain-containing integrins, and directly participate in ligand binding by integrins that lack I domains. We have shown here that the YTA-1 mAb selectively binds to activated LFA-1. Thus, the interface it recognizes between the β-propeller domain and I-like domain appears to alter structurally during activation of LFA-1, and may be an important linkage in the machinery for inside-out signal transduction by integrins. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)1 is a member of the leukocyte integrin family: LFA-1 (αLβ2; CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (αMβ2; CD11b/CD18), p150,95 (αXβ2; CD11c/CD18), and αDβ2 (1.Springer T.A.

https://openalex.org/W1817919515,"Many animals across the phylogenetic scale are routinely capable of depressing their metabolic rate to 5–15% of that at rest, remaining in this state sometimes for years. However, despite its widespread occurrence, the biochemical processes associated with metabolic depression remain obscure. We demonstrate here the development of an isolated cell model for the study of metabolic depression. The isolated cells from the hepatopancreas (digestive gland) of the land snail (Helix aspersa) are oxygen conformers; i.e., their rate of respiration depends on pO2. Cells isolated from estivating snails show a stable metabolic depression to 30% of control (despite the long and invasive process of cell isolation) when metabolic rate at the physiological pH and pO2 of the hemolymph of estivating snails is compared with metabolic rate at the physiological pH and pO2 of the hemolymph of control snails. When the extrinsic effects of pH and pO2 are excluded, the intrinsic metabolic depression of the cells from estivating snails is still to below 50% of control snails. The in vitro effect of pO2 on metabolic rate is independent of pH and state (awake or estivating), but the effects of pH and state significantly interact. This suggests that pH and state change affect metabolic depression by similar mechanisms but that the metabolic depression by hypoxia involves a separate mechanism. FASEB J. 14, 999–1004 (2000)"
https://openalex.org/W1815335766,"Extracellular storage of thyroglobulin (TG) is a prerequisite for maintaining constant levels of thyroid hormones in vertebrates. Storage of TG within the follicle lumen is achieved by compactation and by the formation of covalent cross-links between TG molecules. In bovine thyroids, approximately 75% of the cross-links are other than disulfide bonds (J. Cell Biol. 180, 1071-1081). We have now shown that polymeric TG contains a large number of N(epsilon)(gamma-glutamyl)lysine cross-links and that only traces of these can be found in the soluble form of TG. Because such isopeptide bridges are generated usually by the action of a transglutaminase, it is reasonable to propose that the covalent polymerization of TG in the globules is under the control of this enzyme. Soluble TG was shown to be a substrate for transglutaminase in vitro; moreover, the presence of transglutaminase was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and by immunoblotting in freshly isolated bovine thyroid globules. With immunoelectron microscopy, transglutaminase was detected in the cytoplasm of thyrocytes, but not in compartments of the secretory pathway. Only one messenger RNA for transglutaminase was found by Northern blotting. Sequencing of the cloned gene failed to reveal a secretory signal, which supports the notion that the thyroid transglutaminase is the cytosolic type. Apparently, the enzyme reaches the lumen of the follicle by an as yet unknown pathway to catalyze the covalent cross-linking of thyroid globules in this extracellular compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2047912145,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an extensively glycosylated type I ectoprotein anchored in the plasma membrane by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain. In tissue culture as well as in vivo, the extracellular domain of ACE is released into the culture medium by a regulated proteolytic cleavage. To identify the cellular proteins that regulate ACE processing and cleavage-secretion, ACE-bound proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and characterized by microsequencing and Western blotting. One protein was identified as ribophorin and another as immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a chaperone. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of ACE confirmed its interaction with BiP. Overexpression of BiP inhibited ACE secretion, an effect accentuated by the expression of an enzymatically inactive mutant BiP. This inhibition was caused by the retention of ACE precursors by BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum, as revealed by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments.

Thus, our studies have identified PKC and BiP as two proteins that directly interact with ACE and modulate its cell-surface expression and cleavage-secretion. angiotensin-converting enzyme testicular ACE pulmonary ACE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate protein kinase C endoplasmic reticulum immunoglobulin-binding protein mutant BiP human embryonic kidney cells mitogen-activated protein heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)1 is a member of a group of transmembrane ectoproteins that is proteolytically processed near the plasma membrane on the extracellular side of a single membrane-spanning domain. The entire extracellular domain is released into the culture medium, or circulation, converting a membrane-anchored enzyme, growth factor, or receptor into a diffusible protein (1Ehlers M.R.

Despite emerging evidence that this process of ectodomain shedding is an important and widely used cellular post-translational regulatory process, little is known about the responsible proteases, their mode of activation, or probable regulation by other cellular proteins. It is important that the factors regulating the secretory processing of ACE be fully understood, as tissue-bound ACE and soluble ACE in the circulatory system may have different physiological roles. ACE has two structurally related isozymes: testicular ACE (ACET) and somatic, or pulmonary, ACE (ACEP) (9Kumar R.S. Thekkumkara T.J. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

We have used extensively human, bovine, and mouse cells transfected with ACET cDNA to study this process for ACET. In one such system of a mouse epithelial cell line transfected with a rabbit ACET expression vector, the ACE 89 cells (14Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) synthesize, glycosylate, and express ACETon the cell surface, where it is cleaved off in a regulated fashion (15Ramchandran R.

Black R.A. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ACE secretase activity was enhanced by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (15Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). PMA has been shown to stimulate most of the known shedding processes (2Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), but the mode of activation of PMA or any other regulator of shedding, such as serum (24Pandiella A.

It has been reported that PKCδ directly binds to a metalloprotease disintegrin, MDC9, leading to the suggestion that these two proteins might be involved in PMA-induced shedding of membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) (28Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Raf/MAP kinase cascade has been implicated in PMA-activated shedding of HB-EGF (29Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of receptor tyrosine kinase and MAP kinase signaling cascades has also been suggested as a general mechanism to induce shedding of tumor growth factor-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and l-selectin (30Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is not yet clear which cellular component(s) regulate the constitutive or induced cleavage-secretion of this group of transmembrane ectoproteins. All newly synthesized proteins that are destined for the cell surface and secretion are folded and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This process is facilitated by interaction of the nascent proteins with various chaperones, of which immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) (31Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 32Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) is the most abundant. BiP binds instantly to nascent proteins and releases them upon folding and assembly. Such interactions often alter the processing and secretion of several biologically important proteins (33Hendershot L. Wei J. Gaut J. Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 34Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), including amyloid precursor protein (35Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), a transmembrane protein that is also cleavage-secreted. But not all proteins are affected by such interactions (34Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). A mutant BiP, in which ATP hydrolysis is impaired, retains the ability to bind nascent peptides but almost completely loses the capacity to release the bound protein, thus impeding its processing and cell surface expression. Such a recently developed mutant (GRP78 T37G, MBiP) (36Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been very helpful in analyzing the processing of certain membrane associated secretory proteins. In this study, our aim was to identify cellular proteins that regulate ACE processing and cleavage-secretion. We show here that the ER resident protein BiP and specific PKC isozymes directly interact with ACE and modulate its cell-surface expression and shedding. Hamster BiP (GRP78) and mutant BiP (GRP78 T37G), cloned into pcDNA3 were provided by James R. Gout (University of Michigan). Antibodies to BiP and various anti-PKC isozymes were obtained from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Detergent extract of ACE 89 cell membranes (mouse epithelial cells transfected with the testicular isozyme of ACE (14Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were prepared essentially as described earlier (23Sadhukhan R. Santhamma K.R. Reddy P. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ACE and the associated proteins (from 15 × 108 cells) were purified by lisinopril affinity chromatography (37Ehlers M.R.W. Chen Y.N. Riordan J.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the purified eluate was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Problot membranes (Applied Biosystems), and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or analyzed by Western blotting. The stained protein bands were cut out and used for N-terminal sequence analysis after Edman degradation using a Procise model 492 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) attached to a 140C microgradient system and a 610A, version 2.1, data analysis system in the Molecular Biotechnology Core of The Lerner Research Institute. Western blot analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The effect of PMA on the binding of PKC isozymes to ACE was quantified by densitometric scanning of films obtained after ECL using a Microtek ScanMaker scanner and the ImageQuant program. To purify ACE-associated proteins by co-immunoprecipitation, 12 μl of anti-ACE antiserum and 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose (1:1, v/v) were added to the detergent extract (prepared from 3 × 108cells). The slurry was gently mixed for 12 h at 4 °C, and the protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed extensively, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling with SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Similar lisinopril affinity chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were also performed using detergent extracts of C127 cells. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured as described by Yang et al. (35Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding rabbit testicular ACE (14Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) were used for transfection. HEK 293 cells (0.9 × 106cells/60-mm dish coated with poly-l-lysine hydrobromide, Sigma), split 1 day prior to transfection, were grown to 70% confluency. For transfection, 13 μg of DNA (3 μg of ACE cDNA and 10 μg of vector, BiP, or MBiP cDNA) and 30 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM in separate tubes and incubated at 22 °C. After 30 min, the mixture was diluted with an additional 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM. Cells (washed with Opti-MEM) were overlaid with the diluted DNA-Lipofectin mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. At the end of the transfection period, an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% serum was added to the cells. After 1 and 18 h, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% serum. 36 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine (NEN Life Science Products), 150 μCi/60-mm dish) for 8 h. The culture medium was recovered, and cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (14Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the clear lysates were equally distributed into two tubes and immunoprecipitated using anti-ACE antibody (2.5 μl) or anti-BiP antibody (5 μl) and 50 μl of 1:1 protein A-Sepharose. The anti-rodent BiP antibody does not cross-react with endogenous human BiP. Immunoprecipitation and analysis by SDS-PAGE (mini-gels) were done as described earlier (38Sen I. Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25748-25754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radiolabeled proteins were detected by fluorography. HEK 293 cells (0.1 × 106) grown on glass coverslips were either transfected with ACE or co-transfected with ACE and MBiP constructs. After 36 h, cells were fixed with formaldehyde (3.6% for 10 min) and permeabilized with Nonidet P-40 (1% for 5 min) for internal staining where indicated. They were then treated with anti-ACE antibody (1:4000) and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 Vectastain) before being visualized with a TCS-SP laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). We have used ACE 89 cells in the past to study the regulation of ACE biosynthesis (14Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol.

These cells synthesize large quantities of ACE that are transported to the plasma membrane and cleavage-secreted into the culture medium. The rate of secretion can be enhanced by treating the cells with PMA (15Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an activator of PKC, or pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. 2I. Sen, unpublished observation. As a source of ACE and its associated proteins, we used the membrane fraction of the ACE 89 cell extract. A detergent extract of these membranes was used for either immunoprecipitation with anti-ACE antibody or binding to an affinity resin consisting of lisinopril, a competitive inhibitor of ACE, covalently bound to Sepharose. After the binding of ACE and its associated proteins, the affinity resin was extensively washed, and the bound proteins were then eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1). At least seven distinct proteins were eluted from the lisinopril column (lane 4). The same proteins were eluted from the ACE antibody resin, although their proportions were different (lane 2). For example, protein 1 is much more prominent in lane 4 than protein 2, whereas protein 7 is prominent in lane 2. None of the proteins were eluted from either resin when membranes from the parental C127 cells, which do not produce ACE, were used (lanes 1 and 3) instead of ACE 89 membrane, indicating that none of these proteins bound to the resins nonspecifically. Among the eluted proteins, we anticipated the presence of both fully glycosylated and underglycosylated ACE species. Western blotting with ACE antibody confirmed that protein 1 was mature ACE and protein 2 was its underglycosylated precursor (data not shown). The identity of protein 2 was confirmed by its N-terminal sequence analysis (TableI). Its sequence perfectly matched with the N-terminal sequence of ACE from which the signal sequence had been cleaved off. Similar sequencing of protein 3 revealed that it was also ACE-related; its N-terminal sequence corresponded to residues 76–87 of ACE. Thus, protein 3 is probably a degradation product of ACE. Because proteins 4 and 7 were prominent in the eluates from both resins, they were subjected to N-terminal sequencing as well. The N-terminal sequence of protein 4 perfectly matched that of BiP, a protein chaperone in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blotting with a BiP antibody confirmed that protein 4 was indeed BiP (Fig. 1, lane 5). Its apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa was also that of BiP. The N-terminal sequence of protein 7 perfectly matched that of ribophorin 1 (Table I). Ribophorin 1, or dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase, is involved in sugar modification of proteins, and thus its association with ACE probably occurs during ACE protein modification.Table IN-terminal sequence of selected ACE-associated proteinsBandSequence obtainedMatches with2RRVTVNQGTTSQAN-terminal sequence of ACE3DEAEASRFVEEYACE sequences: 76–874EEEDKKEDNGTVVGIN-terminal sequence of BiP7SSEAPPLVNEDVKRTN-terminal sequence of dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (ribophorin 1) Open table in a new tab The functional consequences of the association of BiP with ACE were examined in a series of experiments. In these experiments, ACE and BiP were expressed in the HEK 293 cell line by transfection; the proteins were metabolically labeled and analyzed after immunoprecipitation. When an antibody to the transfected BiP was used for immunoprecipitation, a prominent BiP band was present in the precipitate (Fig. 2, lane 3). Along with BiP, a doublet of apparent molecular mass of about 90 kDa was also present in this precipitate. This doublet probably represents the endoglycosidase H-sensitive immature form of ACE, as reported by us previously (21Kasturi S. Jabbar M.A. Sen G.C. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6228-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Neither BiP nor ACE was immunoprecipitated from empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1) or ACE only-transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 2), thus confirming the specificity of the ACE-BiP interaction. The same extracts were analyzed reciprocally in the experiments shown in Fig.3. When ACE was immunoprecipitated from the transfected and labeled cell extracts, two species of ACE, the mature 115-kDa species and its 90-kDa precursor, were detected in ACE-transfected cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). When BiP or its mutant, MBiP, which has no ATPase activity (36Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was expressed along with ACE, a protein of apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa co-precipitated with ACE (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4). Western blotting confirmed that this protein was indeed BiP (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3Overexpression of BiP and its inactive mutant species impairs ACE secretion. HEK 293 cells were transfected with empty vector (lane 1), ACE (lane 2), ACE and BiP (lane 3), or ACE and MBiP (lane 4) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After the labeling period, the cell lysates and medium were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ACE antibody, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography (panels A, B, D, and E).Panel C represents Western blot (WB) analysis of the cell lysates using anti-BiP antibody. PMA (0.5 μm) was added to the culture medium during the labeling period in D and E. Mature and immature ACE (Aand D), secreted ACE (B and E), and BiP are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fully mature ACE was cleaved from the cell surface and secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 3 B). Less ACE was secreted from cells expressing BiP (Fig. 3 B, lane 3), and an even lesser amount was secreted from the cells expressing the mutant BiP (Fig. 3B, lane 4). We reasoned that this could be the result of defective transport of ACE to the cell surface because of its enhanced retention in the internal membranes through its interaction with BiP, which is known to reside in the ER. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed this scenario (Fig.4). In cells expressing ACE only, most of the ACE protein was on the cell surface, although some was detected in the internal organelles of permeabilized cells as well (Fig. 4,top panel). In contrast, in cells expressing MBiP along with ACE, massive amounts of ACE were trapped intracellularly, and less ACE was present at the cell surface (Fig. 4, bottom panel). We have previously shown that ACE cleavage-secretion from the cell surface is accelerated by treating cells with PMA. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3 E, we asked whether this process was affected by overexpression of BiP or MBiP. As expected, PMA treatment enhanced ACE secretion (compare Fig.3, E and B, lane 2). ACE secretion was similarly enhanced by PMA in cells expressing BiP and MBiP as well (Fig. 3, B and E, lanes 3 and 4). As shown previously, as a consequence of enhanced secretion, the amount of cell-associated ACE decreased slightly in PMA-treated cells (compare Fig. 3, D and A). These results showed that BiP does not affect the PMA-mediated up-regulation of the ACE secretion process. The same conclusion was reached from the results presented in Fig.5. In this experiment, secreted ACE was quantitated by measuring its enzyme activity. Although less ACE was secreted from cells expressing BiP or MBiP, PMA enhanced this secretion from all cells. To explore the mechanism of PMA-mediated regulation of ACE secretion, we considered the possibility that PKC, the target of PMA activation, may directly bind to cellular ACE. To test this hypothesis, ACE-associated proteins in ACE 89 cells were analyzed by Western blotting with PKC antibodies using the procedure described for Fig. 1. Five antibodies that recognized six specific isozymes of PKC were used for this experiment, and purified PKC isozymes were used as positive controls. As shown in Fig. 6, PKCα and PKCβ, which were recognized by the same antibody, did not co-precipitate with ACE. In contrast, PKCι, PKCγ, PKCδ, and PKCλ were all present in the anti-ACE immunoprecipitate, suggesting their specific association with ACE. When a similar analysis was carried out with cells that had been treated with PMA, much less PKCι and PKCδ co-precipitated with ACE (3- and 9-fold less, respectively), and no PKCγ was detectable. The amount of ACE-associated PKCλ, however, did not change significantly. These results clearly demonstrate that PMA-mediated up-regulation of ACE secretion is accompanied by selected dissociation of specific PKC isozyme from the ACE proteins. When a similar analysis was carried out with membrane extracts of the parental C127 cells, which do not produce ACE, none of the PKC isozymes were detected (data not shown). Many membrane-anchored ectoproteins are proteolytically converted to soluble factors on the cell surface by a regulated process of cleavage and secretion; these include ACE, β-amyloid precursor protein, pro-transforming growth factor-α, colony stimulating factor, pro-tumor necrosis factor-α, KL-1, KL-2, cell adhesion receptor Mel-14, and several others. Although the solubilization processes of these proteins share common characteristics, such as being sensitive to inhibitors of a specific class of metalloprotease and being stimulated by PMA treatment of cells, the identities of most of the secretases and their modes of regulation remain unknown. The only well characterized cell-surface secretase is the one responsible for the processing of tumor necrosis factor-α. This enzyme, however, is not required for cleavage-secretion of ACE, because ACE is normally processed in cells missing the tumor necrosis factor-α secretase (23Sadhukhan R. Santhamma K.R. Reddy P.

Thus, it appears that related but distinct secretases may be responsible for the cleavage of different ectoproteins, and each member of this family may have a distinct mode of regulation. We have been studying the mode of ACE cleavage-secretion and, in the current study, have sought to identify some of the cellular proteins that regulate the intracellular transport and secretion of ACE. The putative ACE-regulating proteins were identified by their physical association with ACE. We chose to use ACE 89 cells, which produce a large quantity of ACE proteins, to purify ACE. As ACE is a glycoprotein, it is always associated with various cell membranes during biosynthesis. Maturation of the protein, from the precursor to the final product present on the plasma membrane, is accompanied by extensive N- and O-glycosylation and a loss of the signal peptide. Probably because we used total cellular membranes as the starting material for the affinity purification of ACE, we obtained various forms of ACE (Fig. 1, Bands 1, 2, and 3) purified. It is curious to note that many more ACE proteins were detected from the lisinopril column (Fig. 1, lane 4) than from the antibody column (Fig. 1, lane 2). This observation could result from the less efficient dissociation of ACE from the antibody bound to resin. In any event, both affinity resins co-purified a number of other cellular proteins, which we have begun to characterize. It was reassuring that proteins of identical mobilities were co-purified by both methods, although the relative proportions were different. For example, much more of Band 7 was purified from the antibody column (Fig. 6, lane 2), and Band 6 was more prominent in the eluate from the lisinopril column. Microsequencing of Band 7 clearly identified it to be ribophorin 1, an enzyme involved in the early stages of protein glycosylation. It is possible that the enzyme is preferentially associated with the ACE precursor and not the mature protein, but the unavailability of appropriate reagents prevented us from examining this possibility. The other band that produced an unequivocal sequence was Band 4. Western blotting (Fig. 1) and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2) further confirmed that it was the protein chaperone BiP. As expected from the location of BiP in the ER, it was associated primarily with the underglycosylated ER form of ACE. Overexpression of BiP caused enhanced retention of ACE in the ER. Consequently, less protein was secreted. These observations suggest that optimal intracellular transport of ACE requires only a transient interaction with BiP and that their continued association, because of a higher abundance of BiP, impairs the proper transit of ACE to the next stage of processing. Results obtained with the enzymatically inactive BiP confirmed this reasoning. Because the ATPase activity is required for BiP functioning in protein folding, but not for its binding to nascent proteins in the ER, the mutant BiP blocked the intracellular transit of ACE even more effectively. The observed effect of BiP on ACE transport and secretion is distinct from that observed for the amyloid precursor protein, in which secretion was also decreased upon BiP overexpression (35Yang Y. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25552-25555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This decrease is because the amyloid precursor protein cleavage occurs in the ER membrane, where BiP resides, whereas ACE cleavage occurs on the plasma membrane. Thus, the effect of BiP on ACE biosynthesis seems to be exclusively at the transport level. The mature ACE that reached the cell surface in BiP-expressing cells was efficiently cleaved and, as shown in Fig. 5, this process was normally regulated by PMA. Although the up-regulation of cleavage-secretion of ectoproteins by PMA is well documented, the underlying mechanism is obscure. The results presented in this paper have shed some light on this process. Because PMA treatment of cells is known to activate PKC and cause its translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, we wondered whether this process was linked to the observed enhanced ACE cleavage-secretion in PMA-treated cells. We hypothesized that PKC may be specifically bound to mature ACE or the ACE secretase, both of which are known to be plasma membrane-anchored proteins, and that PMA treatment may decrease this association, causing an enhanced action of the secretase on the ACE protein. The results shown in Fig. 6 validated some features of this hypothesis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PKC was bound to ACE. The fact that this binding was highly specific was indicated by the observed association of specific isozymes of PKC, but not others, with ACE. PKCι was the most prominent ACE-associated PKC isozyme, and its migration in gel electrophoresis was in the range of Bands 5 and 6 of Fig. 1 (data not shown). As postulated, the ACE association of PKCι was greatly reduced upon PMA treatment. The same was true for PKCγ and PKCδ, but not for PKCλ, again demonstrating the specificity of the PMA effect. Thus, it appears that ACE associates with specific isozymes of PKC and that PMA treatment causes dissociation of only a subset of these PKC isozymes. How this dissociation translates into enhanced cleavage of ACE remains an open question. Whether the cleavage process is affected by a regulation of the phosphorylation status of the ACE cytoplasmic domain, as a consequence of PKC dissociation, is a relevant and important question to be addressed in the future.

https://openalex.org/W1924604258,"The effects of iontophoretically ejected angiotensin II (Ang II) on the firing rate of neurons in the basolateral complex and the central and cortical amygdala were investigated in two strains of urethane anesthetized rats. In normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats, Ang II induced a significant increase in the discharge rate of responsive amygdaloid neurons. In contrast, in the hypertensive transgenic [TGR(mREN-2)27] rats with higher brain Ang II level, Ang II more often caused inhibitory effects on the amygdaloid firing rate in comparison with controls. The distribution of nonresponsive, excited, and inhibited neurons differed significantly in the two rat strains. Moreover, the responsiveness of amygdaloid neurons was significantly higher in transgenic rats in comparison with controls. Both the increase and the decrease in the firing rate caused by Ang II could be blocked either by angiotensin AT(1) or by AT(2) receptor-specific antagonists. In many cases, the Ang II-induced decrease in the firing rate was antagonized by bicuculline, a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) antagonist. The higher responsiveness of amygdaloid neurons in transgenic rats as well as the predominance of inhibitory effects, presumedly mediated by GABAergic interneurons, could change the output of the amygdala and its influence on thirst, kidney, and cardiovascular function or on processes of learning and anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2133555485,"Brain levels of TNF-alpha increase in many inflammatory conditions, including HIV-1 infection, and may contribute to neurodegenerative processes. The paucity of agents that can selectively and potently block TNF-alpha processing or its receptors has led us to investigate the role of TNF-alpha in chronic neurodegeneration associated with retroviral infection using mice with targeted deletions of the TNF-alpha gene. Infection of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus mixture leads to the development of a severe immunodeficiency as well as cognitive deficits and neuronal damage. TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice infected with LP-BM5 developed a systemic immunopathology indistinguishable in severity from that observed in contemporaneously infected wild-type mice. In contrast, the performance of infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice in the Y-maze and Morris water maze was not different from that of uninfected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. The extent of glial activation in the striatum, as indicated by the increase in density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, was equivalent in both groups of LP-BM5-infected mice. However, the decrease in striatal MAP-2 expression, a marker of neurodegeneration observed in infected wild-type mice, was not found in infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. While the loss of TNF-alpha appeared to have no effect on the course or severity of the central or peripheral immunopathology resulting from LP-BM5 infection, the behavioral and biochemical manifestations were substantially curtailed in the TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. These findings directly support a role for TNF-alpha in the neurodegenerative processes associated with viral infections such as HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2014216265,"Barx1 and Barx2 are homeodomain proteins originally identified using regulatory elements of genes encoding certain cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). In the present study, we characterize regions of Barx2 that bind to regulatory elements of genes encoding three CAMs, L1, neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM), and neural CAM (N-CAM), and identify domains of Barx2 that regulate N-CAM transcription. The homeodomain of Barx2 was sufficient for binding to homeodomain binding sites (HBS) from all three CAM genes. The presence of a 17-amino acid Barx basic region resulted in a 2-fold decrease in binding to HBS sequences from the Ng-CAM and L1 genes, whereas it led to a 6.5-fold increase in binding to the HBS from the N-CAM promoter. Thus, the Barx basic region influences the strength and specificity of Barx2 binding to DNA. In co-transfection experiments, Barx2 repressed N-CAM promoter activity. A 24-residue N-terminal region of Barx2 was essential for repression. When this region was absent, Barx2 activated the N-CAM promoter. A 63-residue C-terminal domain was required for this activation. In GST pull-down experiments, Barx2 bound to proteins of the CREB family, CREB1 and ATF2.

In diverse species, homeobox genes have been shown to be essential for the correct positioning and differentiation of tissues and organs (8.McGinnis W. Krumlauf R.

Molecular targets that may link homeobox gene activity to cellular patterning events are the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1 and substrate adhesion molecules. These cell surface glycoproteins and molecules of the extracellular matrix guide cell interactions and influence the formation and subsequent differentiation of cell collectives (18.Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Relating the activity of particular homeodomain transcription factors to the induction or repression of the expression of particular CAMs during development provides a useful framework for understanding the mechanics of morphogenesis. Homeodomain binding sites (HBSs) have been identified as important regulatory elements in the genes encoding several of these CAMs, particularly those of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily such as neural CAM (N-CAM), neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM), and L1 (19.Jones F.S.

Rev. 1998; 26: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Among the developmentally significant homeodomain proteins that regulate CAM expression are two unusual homeodomain proteins, Barx1 and Barx2. These proteins were both originally identified as factors that bind to the regulatory elements of two different CAM genes. Barx1 was discovered in a Southwestern screening procedure (23.Vinson C.R. LaMarco K.L. Johnson P.F. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) using a regulatory element of the gene encoding the mouse neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) as a probe (24.Tissier-Seta J.-P. Mucchielli M.-L Mark M. Mattei M.-G. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Barx2 was identified via a similar procedure, using an element from the chicken Ng-CAM (25.Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Barx1 and Barx2 contain nearly identical homeodomains that are most similar to those encoded by the dual BarH genes of Drosophila melanogaster (26.Higashijima S.-I. Kojima T. Michiue T. Ishimaru S. Emori Y. Saigo K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A comparison of the homeodomains of Barx1 and Barx2 with other proteins (Fig. 1) indicates that they are most similar to invertebrate homeobox proteins of the Bar subfamily. Homeodomains of Barsubfamily all contain a glutamine residue at position 50 in the third helix of the homeodomain. This property is shared by several other homeodomain proteins including all members of the Antennapedia family and confers a binding preference for target sites containing the core sequence CATTA (27.Scott M.P. Tamkun J.W. Hartzell G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 28.Kappen C. Schughart K. Ruddle F.H. Genomics. 1993; 18: 54-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Bar class homeodomains are further distinguished from those of the Antennapedia family by threonine and tyrosine residues at positions 47 and 49, respectively. In addition to the homeodomain, Barx1 and Barx2 share a highly conserved 17-amino acid basic region, designated the Barx basic region (BBR), located immediately downstream of the homeodomain. Barx2 exhibits several other notable features, including a putative leucine zipper and polyalanine tract within the amino-terminal region and an acidic domain within the carboxyl-terminal region (25.Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Barx1 and Barx2 show dynamic expression patterns during development of the central nervous system that overlap with patterns of CAM expression. For instance, between embryonic days 10.5 and 12.5, Barx2 expression is particularly intense in the telencephalon, mesencephalon, and spinal cord, where CAMs such as N-CAM, Ng-CAM, and L1 are also expressed (25.Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Outside of the nervous system, Barx1 and Barx2 show complementary patterns of expression in the mesenchyme and epithelia during the development of craniofacial tissues. For instance, Barx1 is expressed in the mesenchyme of the mandibular and maxillary processes and in the tooth primordia, while Barx2 is expressed in the oral epithelium prior to tooth development (29.Mitsiadis T.A. Mucchielli M.L. Raffo S. Proust J.P. Koopman P. Goridis C. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 1998; 106 Suppl. 1: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A role for Barx1 in tooth development has been suggested by experiments showing that blockade of BMP signaling in the mesenchyme leads to ectopic expression of Barx1 and transformation of incisors into molars (30.Tucker A.S. Matthews K.L. Sharpe P.T. Science. 1998; 282: 1136-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, a tenable hypothesis is that Barx proteins influence patterns of cell-cell interaction by regulating the expression of particular cell adhesion molecules. This patterning is also subject to control by inductive signals from secreted differentiation factors, such as BMPs.In the present study, we examine the binding of Barx1 and Barx2 to the homeodomain binding sites of L1, Ng-CAM, and N-CAM and identify domains in Barx2 involved in transcriptional regulation of the N-CAM promoter. We also demonstrate that Barx2 interacts with two leucine zipper-containing proteins of the CREB family of transcription factors, CREB1 and ATF2. These studies provide the foundation for understanding the role of Barx proteins in regulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules in particular morphogenetic contexts. They also suggest a role for Barx proteins in modulating the function of transcription factors of the CREB family.DISCUSSIONOur ongoing studies have shown that homeobox genes, which regulate regional patterns of gene expression, have as targets certain CAMs that mediate interactions leading to morphogenesis (22.Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In particular, we have investigated the regulation of genes encoding three CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily, L1, Ng-CAM, and N-CAM. All of these genes contain HBSs that are composed of a conserved ATTA core motif but vary with respect to base pairs flanking this motif. The sequence composition of the HBS determines which homeodomain proteins can interact with these CAM gene regulatory sequences. HBS sequences have been shown to regulate the expression of CAM genes in cultured cells (19.Jones F.S. Holst B.D. Minowa O. De Robertis E.M. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32.Valarche I. Tissier-Seta J.P. Hirsch M.R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of these sequences leads to aberrant patterning of CAM gene expression in transgenic mice (20.Wang Y. Jones F.S. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21.Meech R. Kallunki P. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the functional domains of the proteins that bind to these elements and how they affect transcriptional activation or repression of target genes.Barx1 and Barx2 were originally identified in Southwestern screening procedures as novel factors that interact with HBS sequences of the N-CAM and Ng-CAM genes, respectively (24.Tissier-Seta J.-P. Mucchielli M.-L Mark M. Mattei M.-G. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25.Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The present study was carried out to identify functional domains within the Barx2 protein using CAM gene regulatory elements as model targets. We first identified domains of Barx2 that are involved in binding to DNA elements from three CAM genes and then defined domains within Barx2 that mediate both transcriptional repression and activation of the mouse N-CAM gene.Regions of Barx2 That Mediate Sequence-specific DNA BindingIn gel mobility shift analyses using in vitrotranslated proteins and probes derived from the three CAM gene HBSs, binding complexes formed between native Barx2 and the N-CAM HBS were considerably more intense (11- and 22-fold, respectively) than those formed with either the L1-HPD or the Ng-CAM HBS sequences. The homeodomain of Barx2 was sufficient for binding to each of these sequences. The binding preference of the homeodomain in isolation differed greatly from that of native Barx2, whereas a protein fragment of Barx2 containing the homeodomain and adjacent 17-amino acid BBR recapitulated the binding pattern of native Barx2. Moreover, these results indicate that the BBR can modulate binding of the Barx2 homeodomain to DNA targets in a sequence-specific manner. Since our results were obtained with in vitro-translated proteins, modulation of binding by the BBR does not require interaction with other cellular factors. Therefore, modulation of Barx2 binding to DNA by the BBR is likely to involve either direct binding of the peptide to DNA or a change in the conformation of the homeodomain that alters its ability to bind DNA. The proximity of the BBR to the DNA-binding helix of the homeodomain lends support for both of these possible mechanisms. The BBR contains consensus serine phosphorylation sites, and our recent experiments indicate that phosphorylation of Barx2 reduces binding to all three CAM gene regulatory sequences. Thus, it appears that altering the net positive charge of the BBR is likely to affect the DNA binding function of Barx proteins. 2R. Meech, D. B. Edelman, and F. S. Jones, unpublished results. Such modulation of DNA binding by an adjacent peptide domain has been observed in other homeodomain proteins. For instance, the POU domain can bind independently to DNA and also change the DNA target specificity of the POU type homeodomain (12.Deboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar).The amino-terminal domain of Barx2 also had an effect on DNA binding. The addition of this region to either the homeodomain or the homeodomain plus the BBR reduced the level of binding to all three HBS sequences of the CAM genes used in this study. The negative effect of the amino-terminal region on DNA binding may also be important for the function of this domain in the transcriptional regulation of target genes. Modulatory effects of amino-terminal domains on DNA binding and transcriptional regulation have been noted for a number of other homeodomain proteins including Bicoid, Extradenticle, MEC-3, UNC-86, and the yeast mating-type protein α2 (33.Yuan D. Ma X. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21660-21665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34.Van Dijk M.A. Murre C.

Johnson A.D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1862-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Barx2 Domains That Mediate Repression and Activation of TranscriptionIn an earlier study that examined the regulation of the L1 cell adhesion molecule, it was concluded that Barx2 contains domains that mediate both repression and activation (25.Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These conclusions were based on the observation that L1 constructs containing the HPD element were activated, whereas similar constructs without the HPD were repressed by Barx2. In the present study, we have defined domains of Barx2 that have activator or repressor functions by examining amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal Barx2 deletion constructs in co-transfection experiments using either synthetic HBS-containing promoters or native N-CAM promoter constructs. In our minimal HBS-containing promoter construct, activation of transcription is contingent on proteins binding to the HBS. However, in experiments involving the native N-CAM promoter, the HBS element represents only one of many elements that are known to be involved in the regulation of this complex promoter.In experiments using the synthetic promoter constructs, native Barx2 and three other Barx2 deletion constructs (NHD, HD, and HD17) reduced promoter activity. These results suggest a simple mechanism for repression in which the homeodomain of Barx2 prevents the binding of endogenous activators to the HBS. However, in our experiments with the native N-CAM promoter, only constructs containing the amino-terminal domain (constructs designated Barx2 and NHD) reduced the level of N-CAM promoter activity, suggesting that binding of the homeodomain alone is not sufficient to repress N-CAM promoter activity. In order for Barx2 to repress the N-CAM promoter, it must affect the function of activators bound at the HBS as well as those bound by othercis elements located within this promoter. The data therefore support the idea that the amino-terminal domain of Barx2 reduced N-CAM promoter activity by interaction either with activator proteins bound to the N-CAM promoter or components of the basic transcription machinery.Co-transfection experiments using Barx2 deletion constructs revealed that a minimal region of 24 amino acids at the extreme amino terminus was required for repression of the N-CAM promoter. A significant feature of this region is a leucine zipper motif. Leucine zippers are found in many transcription factors and are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Although the isolated amino-terminal domain does not bind to DNA, it alone could also repress N-CAM promoter activity, supporting the notion that Barx2 can repress transcription by a mechanism involving protein-protein interactions.Our co-transfection experiments reveal that Barx2 also contains an activation domain in addition to a repressor domain. This activation domain is located within the carboxyl-terminal 63 amino acids of the protein and was unmasked only when the amino-terminal repressor domain was removed from Barx2. In the context of the N-CAM promoter, the repressor domain has the capacity to block not only the function of exogenous activators but also the function of the Barx2 activation domain. The capacity of Barx2 to act as activator or repressor is likely to depend on the nature of its interactions with other proteins.Interaction of Barx2 with Transcription Factors of the CREB FamilyBinding and co-transfection experiments supported the hypothesis that protein-protein interactions are likely to play a role in the ability of Barx2 to repress the activity of the N-CAM promoter. The amino-terminal region of the Barx2 cDNA encodes a region of 50 amino acids that resemble a leucine zipper that might bind to other leucine zipper-containing transcription factors. Moreover, in GST pull-down experiments, we found that Barx2 bound to two members of the CREB family, CREB1 and ATF2. These findings suggest that Barx2 and CREB proteins might modulate each other's function in the cellular contexts in which these proteins are co-expressed.CREB proteins are transcription factors that bind to cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs) found in a large number of genes and play important roles during development of neural and nonneural tissues and in synaptic plasticity (for a review, see Ref. 37.Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). These factors are commonly referred to as constitutive transcription factors because they are ubiquitously and constitutively expressed and can be bound to DNA in inactive forms that are activated by phosphorylation (38.Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 370-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of CREB family members with other transcription factors leads to the formation of complexes that have unique functions and DNA binding properties. For instance, CREB1 heterodimerizes with ATF1 to form a protein complex that has an altered binding affinity for the CRE sequences (39.Masquilier D. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22460-22466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATF2 heterodimerizes with ATF3, NF-κB, and c-Jun, and complexes with c-Jun can recognize TRE/AP-1 elements in addition to CREs (40.Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 41.Van Dam H. Duyndam M. Rottier R. Bosch A. DeVries-Smits L. Herrlich P. Zantema A. Angel P. VanderEb A.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Future experiments with both HBS- and CRE-containing promoters will be necessary to determine whether Barx2 can modulate the function of CREB family members and whether complexes containing Barx2 and CREB proteins are involved in transcriptional repression by Barx2.The hypothesis that the function of Barx2 might be modulated by interactions with other factors, specifically members of the CREB family, could be further investigated in the context of genes that contain binding sites for both of these factors. One such gene is that encoding the cell adhesion molecule Ng-CAM. Its promoter contains both HBS and CRE sequences that are important for its regulation (42.Kallunki P. Jenkinson S. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21291-21298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The interaction of Barx2 and CREB proteins might also provide a means of indirect regulation by Barx2 of genes that contain CRE sequences but do not contain HBS sequences. Conversely, CREB may be able to regulate genes that do not contain a CRE but contain homeodomain binding sites and are bound by Barx2. The challenge for future experiments is to define developmental and physiological contexts in which Barx and CREB proteins interact. Functional integration of these various factors are likely to take place during development of the nervous system where regional regulation of neuronal differentiation and axonal path-finding by homeobox proteins and activity-dependent transcriptional regulation by CREB proteins converge. The homeobox was first identified as a common feature of genes of the homeotic complex in Drosophila (1.Lewis E.B. Nature. 1978; 276: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar, 2.Scott M.P. Weiner A.J. Polinsky B.A. Hazelrigg T.I. Pirrotta V. Scalenghe F. Kaufman T.C. Cell. 1983; 35: 428-433Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 3.McGinnis W. Levine M.S. Hafen E. Kuroiwa A. Gehring W.J. Nature. 1984; 308: 428-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). All homeobox genes encode a 61-amino acid DNA binding structure called the homeodomain, and many act as transcription factors that control regional patterning of gene expression (4.Desplan C. Theis J. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1988; 54: 1081-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5.Hoey T. Levine M.S. Nature. 1988; 332: 428-431Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 6.Beachy P.A. Krasnow M.A. Gavis E.R. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis of homeobox mutants showed that the products of these genes regulate axial patterning and specify segment identity in the Drosophilabody plan (7.Gehring W.J. Hiromi Y. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 147-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 8.McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). The vertebrate Hox genes are homologous to the genes of the Drosophila homeotic complex and appear to specify axial location in a manner similar to their fly counterparts (9.Duboule D. Dolle P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 10.Kessel M. Gruss P. Science. 1990; 249: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11.Krumlauf R. Marshall H. Studer M. Nonchev S. Sham M.H. Lumsden A. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1328-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition to homeobox genes of the homeotic complex andHox clusters, a number of nonclustered homeobox genes have been identified in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate phyla (reviewed in Ref. 12.Deboule D. Guidebook to the Homeobox Genes. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar) as well as in plants (13.Chan R.L. Gago G.M. Palena C.M. Gonzalez D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In diverse species, homeobox genes have been shown to be essential for the correct positioning and differentiation of tissues and organs (8.McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar, 14.Wolpert L. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15.Akam M. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1995; 349: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16.Castelli-Gair J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 437-444PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Gelleon G. McGinnis W. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The relationship between the activity of homeodomain transcription factors and cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration, that lead to morphogenesis is not well understood. Molecular targets that may link homeobox gene activity to cellular patterning events are the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)1 and substrate adhesion molecules. These cell surface glycoproteins and molecules of the extracellular matrix guide cell interactions and influence the formation and subsequent differentiation of cell collectives (18.Edelman G.M. Crossin K.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 155-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Relating the activity of particular homeodomain transcription factors to the induction or repression of the expression of particular CAMs during development provides a useful framework for understanding the mechanics of morphogenesis. Homeodomain binding sites (HBSs) have been identified as important regulatory elements in the genes encoding several of these CAMs, particularly those of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily such as neural CAM (N-CAM), neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM), and L1 (19.Jones F.S. Holst B.D. Minowa O. De Robertis E.M. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6557-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20.Wang Y. Jones F.S. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Proc.

To address this issue, splenocytes from schistosome-infected mice were incubated with anti-CD3 to induce VPAC2 mRNA, which only appeared when cell cultures also contained anti-IL-4 mAb. Granuloma cells expressed VPAC2 mRNA. This natural expression decreased substantially when cells were cultured 3 days in vitro. However, granuloma cells cultured with anti-IL-4 mAb strongly expressed VPAC2 mRNA. IL-4 KO mice were examined to further address the importance of IL-4 in VPAC2 regulation. Splenocytes and dispersed granuloma cells from IL-4 KO animals had substantially more VPAC2 mRNA than those in wild-type controls. VPAC2 mRNA content decreased when cells were cultured with rIL-4. VPAC2 mRNA localized to CD4+ T cells. Th1 cell lines expressed VPAC2 mRNA much stronger than Th2 cells. Anti-IL-4 mAb increased VPAC2 mRNA expression in Th2 cells cultured in vitro. However, rIL-4 could not suppress VPAC2 mRNA expression in Th1 cells. Thus, VPAC2 is an inducible CD4+ T cell receptor, and IL-4 down-modulates VPAC2 mRNA expression in Th2 cells."
