https://openalex.org/W3157357317,"<h2>Summary</h2> Thousands of interactions assemble proteins into modules that impart spatial and functional organization to the cellular proteome. Through affinity-purification mass spectrometry, we have created two proteome-scale, cell-line-specific interaction networks. The first, BioPlex 3.0, results from affinity purification of 10,128 human proteins—half the proteome—in 293T cells and includes 118,162 interactions among 14,586 proteins. The second results from 5,522 immunoprecipitations in HCT116 cells. These networks model the interactome whose structure encodes protein function, localization, and complex membership. Comparison across cell lines validates thousands of interactions and reveals extensive customization. Whereas shared interactions reside in core complexes and involve essential proteins, cell-specific interactions link these complexes, ""rewiring"" subnetworks within each cell's interactome. Interactions covary among proteins of shared function as the proteome remodels to produce each cell's phenotype. Viewable interactively online through BioPlexExplorer, these networks define principles of proteome organization and enable unknown protein characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3163351743,"cis-regulatory elements (CREs) encode the genomic blueprints of spatiotemporal gene expression programs enabling highly specialized cell functions. Using single-cell genomics in six maize organs, we determined the cis- and trans-regulatory factors defining diverse cell identities and coordinating chromatin organization by profiling transcription factor (TF) combinatorics, identifying TFs with non-cell-autonomous activity, and uncovering TFs underlying higher-order chromatin interactions. Cell-type-specific CREs were enriched for enhancer activity and within unmethylated long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Moreover, we found cell-type-specific CREs are hotspots for phenotype-associated genetic variants and were targeted by selection during modern maize breeding, highlighting the biological implications of this CRE atlas. Through comparison of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana developmental trajectories, we identified TFs and CREs with conserved and divergent chromatin dynamics, showcasing extensive evolution of gene regulatory networks. In addition to this rich dataset, we developed single-cell analysis software, Socrates, which can be used to understand cis-regulatory variation in any species."
https://openalex.org/W3160411478,"Cancer cell genetic variability and similarity to host cells have stymied development of broad anti-cancer therapeutics. Our innate immune system evolved to clear genetically diverse pathogens and limit host toxicity; however, whether/how innate immunity can produce similar effects in cancer is unknown. Here, we show that human, but not murine, neutrophils release catalytically active neutrophil elastase (ELANE) to kill many cancer cell types while sparing non-cancer cells. ELANE proteolytically liberates the CD95 death domain, which interacts with histone H1 isoforms to selectively eradicate cancer cells. ELANE attenuates primary tumor growth and produces a CD8+T cell-mediated abscopal effect to attack distant metastases. Porcine pancreatic elastase (ELANE homolog) resists tumor-derived protease inhibitors and exhibits markedly improved therapeutic efficacy. Altogether, our studies suggest that ELANE kills genetically diverse cancer cells with minimal toxicity to non-cancer cells, raising the possibility of developing it as a broad anti-cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3163347167,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the COVID-19 global pandemic, utilizes the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry. However, other host factors might also play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, providing new directions for antiviral treatments. GRP78 is a stress-inducible chaperone important for entry and infectivity for many viruses. Recent molecular docking analyses revealed putative interaction between GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (SARS-2-S). Here we report that GRP78 can form a complex with SARS-2-S and ACE2 on the surface and at the perinuclear region typical of the endoplasmic reticulum in VeroE6-ACE2 cells and that the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 is critical for this interaction. <i>In vitro</i> binding studies further confirmed that GRP78 can directly bind to the RBD of SARS-2-S and ACE2. To investigate the role of GRP78 in this complex, we knocked down GRP78 in VeroE6-ACE2 cells. Loss of GRP78 markedly reduced cell surface ACE2 expression and led to activation of markers of the unfolded protein response. Treatment of lung epithelial cells with a humanized monoclonal antibody (hMAb159) selected for its safe clinical profile in preclinical models depleted cell surface GRP78 and reduced cell surface ACE2 expression, as well as SARS-2-S-driven viral entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection <i>in vitro</i>. Our data suggest that GRP78 is an important host auxiliary factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection and a potential target to combat this novel pathogen and other viruses that utilize GRP78 in combination therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3159677655,"Most human embryos are aneuploid. Aneuploidy frequently arises during the early mitotic divisions of the embryo, but its origin remains elusive. Human zygotes that cluster their nucleoli at the pronuclear interface are thought to be more likely to develop into healthy euploid embryos. Here, we show that the parental genomes cluster with nucleoli in each pronucleus within human and bovine zygotes, and clustering is required for the reliable unification of the parental genomes after fertilization. During migration of intact pronuclei, the parental genomes polarize toward each other in a process driven by centrosomes, dynein, microtubules, and nuclear pore complexes. The maternal and paternal chromosomes eventually cluster at the pronuclear interface, in direct proximity to each other, yet separated. Parental genome clustering ensures the rapid unification of the parental genomes on nuclear envelope breakdown. However, clustering often fails, leading to chromosome segregation errors and micronuclei, incompatible with healthy embryo development."
https://openalex.org/W3157123657,"Human brain organoids represent remarkable platforms for recapitulating features of human brain development and diseases. Existing organoid models do not resolve fine brain subregions, such as different nuclei in the hypothalamus. We report the generation of arcuate organoids (ARCOs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to model the development of the human hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Single-cell RNA sequencing of ARCOs revealed significant molecular heterogeneity underlying different arcuate cell types, and machine learning-aided analysis based on the neonatal human hypothalamus single-nucleus transcriptome further showed a human arcuate nucleus molecular signature. We also explored ARCOs generated from Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) patient iPSCs. These organoids exhibit aberrant differentiation and transcriptomic dysregulation similar to postnatal hypothalamus of PWS patients, indicative of cellular differentiation deficits and exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, patient iPSC-derived ARCOs represent a promising experimental model for investigating nucleus-specific features and disease-relevant mechanisms during early human arcuate development."
https://openalex.org/W3157995762,"Background The presence of COVID-19 has led to the disruption of health systems globally, including essential reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) services. This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria’s epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. Results About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients’ satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. Being over 30 years of age was significantly associated with an increased clients’ satisfaction score (ß = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.10–2.50). Conclusion The COVID-19 lockdown posed challenges to accessing RMNCH services for a significant proportion of women surveyed. Although overall satisfaction with care was fairly high, there is a need to provide tailored COVID-19 sensitive inter-personal care to clients at all levels of care."

Training of medical doctor and pharmacy students in antimicrobial stewardship is vital to combat antimicrobial resistance. This study was designed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and perception of final year medical and pharmacy students on antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance at three universities in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania.A cross-sectional survey was carried out among final year undergraduate medical and pharmacy students at three universities in East Africa. A Self-administered questionnaire was developed which included dichotomous questions and questions using a 4-point Likert scale. The questions were based on knowledge and attitude about antibiotics, and preparedness to use antibiotics in clinical scenarios. Data were analyzed using STATA version 16 following the objective of the study.Three hundred and twenty-eight final year students participated in the survey from MUK 75, MKU 75 and CUHAS 178. Slightly majority of participants were male 192(58.5%) and their median age was 25 [23 - 27] years. In general, 36.6% (120/328) of students had good overall total knowledge. More students at MUK had good knowledge compared to MKU, and CUHAS (72% vs, 40% vs. 20.2%; p<0.001). The mean scores for overall good total knowledge, general knowledge about antibiotics, knowledge about antibiotic resistance, and knowledge about antibiotic use in clinical scenarios were 58% (CI: 57%- 60%), 95% (CI: 94%- 97%), 54% (CI: 52% - 56%), and 46% (CI:44% - 48%) respectively. More pharmacy students compared to medical students had a good attitude and perception on antibiotic use (79.6% vs. 68.4%; p = 0.026). The students at CUHAS perceived being more prepared to use antibiotic in district hospitals compared to MKU and MUK (75.3% vs. 62.7% vs. 65.3%; p = 0.079). While two hundred and seventy (82.3%) students perceived knowing when to start antimicrobial therapy, 112 (34.2%) did not know how to select the appropriate antibiotic (p<0.0001), 97 (29.6%) did not know the antibiotic dose to give (p<0.0001), and 111 (33.8%) did not know when to switch form an intravenous antibiotic to oral regimen (p<0.0001).Final year students have low scores in knowledge about antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic use in clinical scenarios. This has exposed gaps in practical training of students, while they may feel confident, are not fully prepared to prescribe antibiotics in a hospital setting. A multidisciplinary and practical approach involving medical schools across the East African region should be undertaken to train final year undergraduate students in antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship programs. Antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial stewardship courses should be introduced into the curriculum of final year medicine and pharmacy programs."
https://openalex.org/W3158104873,"The rapid trend towards globalization has led to the expansion of English as Medium of Instruction (EMI) in tertiary education. The academic challenges faced by non-native speakers have been broadly discussed in Anglophone countries, whilst those learning through EMI in the Chinese context are still underexplored. To examine Chinese EMI university students’ perceived language challenges in learning, as well as their language-related learning strategies, this study investigated 73 students studying at EMI universities in Hong Kong, taking account of their gender, EMI experience in higher education, and English exposure prior to tertiary education. Participants completed a survey to provide self-evaluations of their academic situation and their perceptions of their disciplinary learning. The study found that students perceived a relatively low level of language and learning challenges, and they showed a preference for using their second language (L2)-related learning strategies over strategies related to their first language. Specifically, male students tended to be more actively engaged in communication with their peers than females, and were more likely to search for additional learning support in English. In addition, first-year undergraduates perceived a greater degree of challenges in knowledge application and relied more on L2-related learning strategies than their senior counterparts. Although the importance of English exposure prior to higher education has been highlighted in many existing studies, this study found that prior exposure to English was neither connected with students’ perceived challenges nor their learning strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3159954902,"After the acute treatment phase, breast cancer patients often experience low quality of life and impaired mental health, which could potentially be improved by offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and addressing exercise and dietary habits. However, CBT and other behavioural interventions are rarely available beyond the acute treatment phase. Internet-based interventions could bridge such treatment gaps, given their flexibility and scalability. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we investigated the effects of such an intervention (""Optimune"") over three months.This RCT included 363 female breast cancer survivors (age range = 30-70), recruited from the community, who had completed the active treatment phase. Inclusion criteria were: breast cancer diagnosis less than 5 years ago and acute treatment completion at least 1 month ago. Participants were randomly assigned to (1) an intervention group (n = 181), in which they received care as usual (CAU) plus 12-month access to Optimune immediately after randomization, or (2) a control group (n = 182), in which they received CAU and Optimune after a delay of 3 months. Primary endpoints were quality of life (QoL), physical activity, and dietary habits at three months. We hypothesized that intervention group participants would report better QoL, more physical activity, and improved dietary habits after 3 months.Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses revealed significant effects on QoL (d = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.07-0.48) and dietary habits (d = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.15-0.56), but the effect on physical exercise was not significant (d = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10-0.51).These findings suggest the effectiveness of Optimune, a new CBT-based Internet intervention for breast cancer survivors, in facilitating improvements in quality of life and dietary habits. Efforts to disseminate this intervention more broadly may be warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03643640. Registered August 23rd 2018, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03643640."
https://openalex.org/W3157298307,"Changes in phenological events have been vastly documented in face of recent global climate change. These studies are concentrated on temperate plants, and the responses of tropical species are still little understood, likely due to the lack of long-term phenological records in the tropics. In this case, the use of herbarium specimens to gather phenological data over long periods and wide geographic areas has emerged as a powerful tool. Here, we used four Melastomataceae species endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to evaluate phenological patterns and alterations as responses to recent climate changes. Phenological data were gathered from Reflora Virtual Herbarium specimens collected between 1920 and 2018, and analyzed with circular statistics applied to the intervals 1920-1979, 1980-1999, and 2000-2018. The effects of temperature range, average temperature, precipitation, and photoperiod on flowering and fruiting of each species were tested using multiple linear regressions. Through circular statistics, we detected changes, mostly delays, in the flowering of Miconia quinquedentata, Pleroma clavatum and P. trichopodum, and in the fruiting of M. acutiflora, P. clavatum and P. trichopodum. We also found that flowering and fruiting occurrence were related to local climatic conditions from months prior to the collections. We found marked phenological variations over the decades and also that these variations are associated to global climate change, adding up to the large body of evidence from higher latitudes. Our results also support herbarium collections as an important source for long-term tropical phenological studies. The lack of consistent patterns of responses among the four species (e.g. fruiting delayed two months in P. clavatum and advanced one month in M. acutiflora) suggests that climate change has unequal effects across tropical forests. This highlights the urgent need for further research to understand and forecast the ecological implications of these changes in global ecosystems processes."
https://openalex.org/W3157850347,"E-cigarette advertising has been shown to increase e-cigarette awareness and use. Although e-cigarette marketing in the early 2010s has been well-documented, little is known about how it has changed in recent years in response to the regulatory scrutiny from the FDA and the Congress to combat youth vaping epidemic. This study aims to examine the exposure to e-cigarette TV advertising among youth and adults in the U.S. from 2013 to 2019, overall and by media market and brand.Quarterly data on e-cigarette TV advertising exposure, measured by target rating points (TRPs), and expenditures from 2013 to 2019 were compiled from the StradegyTM of Kantar Media. Trends of quarterly e-cigarette advertising TRPs were reported by age group, market, and brand.Over the study period, overall exposure to e-cigarette TV advertising was higher among adults than among youth. E-cigarette advertising TRPs and expenditures were relatively stable, despite intermittent fluctuations, between 2013 Q1 and 2017 Q1 except for a one-time dip in 2015 Q3, followed by a sharp decline in 2017 Q2 and stayed low till the end of 2018. A resurgence of e-cigarette advertising TRPs occurred in 2019 Q1, led by the advertising from JUUL, Blu, and Vuse, which peaked in the third quarter of 2019, with quarterly TRPs reaching 316.8 for youth and 1,701.9 for adults, and quarterly advertising expenditure totaling $31 million.Significant variations, both over time and across media markets and brands, were observed for e-cigarette televised advertising between 2013 and 2019. Following a lull in TV advertising in 2017/18, major e-cigarette companies have substantially increased advertising of their products on American television since early 2019, resulting in a surge in exposure to e-cigarette advertising among both youth and adults. Our findings highlighted the importance of continued monitoring of e-cigarette advertising in the U.S."
https://openalex.org/W3158067219,"With a mortality rate of 5.4 million lives worldwide every year and a healthcare cost of more than 16 billion dollars in the USA alone, sepsis is one of the leading causes of hospital mortality and an increasing concern in the ageing western world. Recently, medical and technological advances have helped re-define the illness criteria of this disease, which is otherwise poorly understood by the medical society. Together with the rise of widely accessible Electronic Health Records, the advances in data mining and complex nonlinear algorithms are a promising avenue for the early detection of sepsis. This work contributes to the research effort in the field of automated sepsis detection with an open-access labelling of the medical MIMIC-III data set. Moreover, we propose MGP-AttTCN: a joint multitask Gaussian Process and attention-based deep learning model to early predict the occurrence of sepsis in an interpretable manner. We show that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art and present evidence that different labelling heuristics lead to discrepancies in task difficulty. For instance, when predicting sepsis five hours prior to onset on our new realistic labels, our proposed model achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.660 and an area under the PR curve of 0.483, whereas the (less interpretable) previous state-of-the-art model (MGP-TCN) achieves 0.635 AUROC and 0.460 AUPR and the popular commercial InSight model achieves 0.490 AUROC and 0.359 AUPR."
https://openalex.org/W3162078396,"One of the defining pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aberrant activation of kinases in AD has been suggested to enhance phosphorylation and toxicity of tau, making the responsible tau kinases attractive therapeutic targets. The full complement of tau-interacting kinases in AD brain and their activity in disease remains incompletely defined. Here, immunoaffinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) identified TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) as a tau-interacting partner in human AD cortical brain tissues. We validated this interaction in human AD, familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) caused by mutations in MAPT (R406W & P301L) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) postmortem brain tissues as well as human cell lines. Further, we document increased TBK1 activation in both AD and FTDP-17 and map TBK1 phosphorylation sites on tau based on in vitro kinase assays coupled to MS. Lastly, in a Drosophila tauopathy model, activating expression of a conserved TBK1 ortholog triggers tau hyperphosphorylation and enhanced neurodegeneration, whereas knockdown had the reciprocal effect, suppressing tau toxicity. Collectively, our findings suggest that increased TBK1 activation may promote tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss in AD and related tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W3157743483,"Introduced mammalian predators can have devastating impacts on recipient ecosystems and disrupt native predator-prey relationships. Feral cats (Felis catus) have been implicated in the decline and extinction of many Australian native species and developing effective and affordable methods to control them is a national priority. While there has been considerable progress in the lethal control of feral cats, effective management at landscape scales has proved challenging. Justification of the allocation of resources to feral cat control programs requires demonstration of the conservation benefit baiting provides to native species susceptible to cat predation. Here, we examined the effectiveness of a landscape-scale Eradicat® baiting program to protect threatened northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) from feral cat predation in a heterogeneous rocky landscape in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. We used camera traps and GPS collars fitted to feral cats to monitor changes in activity patterns of feral cats and northern quolls at a baited treatment site and unbaited reference site over four years. Feral cat populations appeared to be naturally sparse in our study area, and camera trap monitoring showed no significant effect of baiting on cat detections. However, mortality rates of collared feral cats ranged from 18-33% after baiting, indicating that the program was reducing cat numbers. Our study demonstrated that feral cat baiting had a positive effect on northern quoll populations, with evidence of range expansion at the treatment site. We suggest that the rugged rocky habitat preferred by northern quolls in the Pilbara buffered them to some extent from feral cat predation, and baiting was sufficient to demonstrate a positive effect in this relatively short-term project. A more strategic approach to feral cat management is likely to be required in the longer-term to maximise the efficacy of control programs and thereby improve the conservation outlook for susceptible threatened fauna."
https://openalex.org/W3159135375,"Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune skin disease caused by chronic inflammation of hair follicles. Chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and lupus erythematosus can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between AA and heart diseases (HDs) remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective cohort study to evaluate the risk of subsequent HDs in patients with AA. We reviewed 3770 cases of AA and from 18,850 age, sex, and income level-matched controls from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. In the subgroup analysis, patients who suffered from alopecia totalis, alopecia universalis, and ophiasis were designated as patients with severe AA and patients having the disease for over a year were designated as patients with long-standing AA. As a result, we found that AA was not associated with a higher risk of heart failure, angina pectoris, or myocardial infarction. There was no significant increase in the risk of overall HD associated with AA (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.17; 95% confidence interval: 0.93–1.48; p = 0.177). Neither the severity nor the duration of AA was related to an increased risk of HDs. During the study period, AA patients did not show a significantly higher cumulative incidence of HDs than controls (log-rank p = 0.157). In conclusion, AA does not increase the risk of HD."
https://openalex.org/W3126487574,"The cumulative effect of mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) can result in chronic neurological damage, however the molecular mechanisms underpinning this detriment require further investigation. A closed head weight drop model that replicates the biomechanics and head acceleration forces of human mTBI was used to provide an exploration of the acute and chronic outcomes following single and repeated impacts. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into one of four impact groups (control; one, five and 15 impacts) which were delivered over 23 days. Outcomes were assessed 48 hours and 3 months following the final mTBI. Hippocampal spatial learning and memory assessment revealed impaired performance in the 15-impact group compared with control in the acute phase that persisted at chronic measurement. mRNA analyses were performed on brain tissue samples of the cortex and hippocampus using quantitative RT-PCR. Eight genes were assessed, namely MAPT, GFAP, AIF1, GRIA1, CCL11, TARDBP, TNF, and NEFL, with expression changes observed based on location and follow-up duration. The cortex and hippocampus showed vulnerability to insult, displaying upregulation of key excitotoxicity and inflammation genes. Serum samples showed no difference between groups for proteins phosphorylated tau and GFAP. These data suggest that the cumulative effect of the impacts was sufficient to induce mTBI pathophysiology and clinical features. The genes investigated in this study provide opportunity for further investigation of mTBI-related neuropathology and may provide targets in the development of therapies that help mitigate the effects of mTBI."
https://openalex.org/W3159202308,"The interactions between skeletal muscle and bone have been recently noted, and muscle-derived humoral factors related to bone metabolism play crucial roles in the muscle/bone relationships. We previously reported that extracellular vesicles from mouse muscle C2C12 cells (Myo-EVs) suppress osteoclast formation in mice. Although mechanical stress is included in extrinsic factors which are important for both muscle and bone, the detailed roles of mechanical stress in the muscle/bone interactions have still remained unknown. In present study, we examined the effects of fluid flow shear stress (FFSS) to C2C12 cells on the physiological actions of muscle cell-derived EV. Applying FFSS to C2C12 cells significantly enhanced muscle cell-derived EV-suppressed osteoclast formation and several osteoclast-related gene levels in mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of receptor activator nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL). Moreover, FFSS to C2C12 cells significantly enhanced muscle cell-derived EV-suppressed mitochondria biogenesis genes during osteoclast formation with RANKL treatment. In addition, FFSS to C2C12 cells significantly enhanced muscle cell-derived EV-suppressed osteoclast formation and several osteoclast-related gene levels in Raw264.7 cells in the presence of RANKL. Small RNA-seq-analysis showed that FFSS elevated the expression of miR196a-5p and miR155-5p with the suppressive actions of osteoclast formation and low expression in mouse bone cells. On the other hand, muscle cell-derived EVs with or without FFSS to C2C12 cells did not affect the expression of osteogenic genes, alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in mouse osteoblasts. In conclusion, we first showed that FFSS to C2C12 cells enhances the suppressive effects of muscle cell-derived EVs on osteoclast formation in mouse cells. Muscle cell-derived EVs might be partly involved in the effects of mechanical stress on the muscle/bone relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3159226907,"Cultured meat has been proposed as an alternative source of protein to overcome the environmental and ethical problems associated with conventional meat production. However, the lack of consumers' acceptance could be a major barrier to the introduction of cultured meat on a large scale. Despite Brazil being one of the countries that consumes the most meat per capita, little is known about Brazilian consumers' preferences for alternative meat. The objective of this study is to identify which attributes influence consumers to possibly replace conventional beef meat with cultured meat in Brazil. An online survey was conducted, and Best-worst scaling methodology was applied to a sample of 225 consumers. The sampling leaned towards educated and employed residents of the southeast region of Brazil, which might not fully represent the Brazilian population. Despite limitations in terms of the sampling demographic, overall, Brazilians appear to be willing to consume cultured meat: 80.9% of the sample would be willing to try it, 61.3% would be willing to eat it regularly, and 56.9% would be willing to eat cultured meat as a replacement for conventionally produced beef. Despite the focus of this study being on attributes of a hypothetical product that is not commercially available, which might pose difficulty to consumers to predict their future consumption behavior, results show that the most important attributes influencing consumers to possibly replace conventional beef meat by cultured meat in Brazil are anticipated risk of zoonotic diseases, anticipated healthiness and anticipated food safety conditions. Attributes related to benefits at a global societal level and intrinsic characteristics of cultured meat were less important."

Therefore, the aims of this study are to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in ALI based on the high-throughput sequencing. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mouse model was established, the injury of ALI mouse model was evaluated through histological analysis with hemotoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) staining assay, dry/wet ratio, infiltrated-immune cells, ET-1 mRNA expression and released-proinflammation factors. Then, expression data of lncRNAs, circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in ALI were acquired using whole-transcriptome sequencing. The differential expression of lncRNAs (DE lncRNAs), circRNAs (DE circRNAs), miRNAs (DE miRNAs) and mRNAs (DE mRNAs) were identified, and the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network were constructed, and the biological function of target genes were annotated based on bioinformatics analysis. In the present study, the LPS-induced ALI mouse model was successfully established. The biological analysis results showed that total 201 DE lncRNAs, 172 DE circRNAs, 62 DE miRNAs, and 3081 DE mRNAs were identified in ALI. The 182 lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks and 32 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were constructed were constructed based on the correlation between lncRNAs/circRNAs, miRNAs, mRNAs. The biological function analysis indicated that TNF signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway and so on involved in ALI. In the present study, the differential expression coding and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in ALI were identified, and their regulatory networks were constructed. There might provide the potential biomarkers and underlying mechanism for ALI diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3163101955,"PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are efficacious in treating high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency. However, they exhibit suboptimal efficiency in HR-proficient cancers. Here, we found that the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a transcription factor, was inversely correlated with PARPi sensitivity in vitro and in vivo, both in HR-proficient condition. High C/EBPβ expression enhanced PARPi tolerance; PARPi treatment in turn induced C/EBPβ expression. C/EBPβ directly targeted and upregulated multiple HR genes (BRCA1, BRIP1, BRIT1, and RAD51), thereby inducing restoration of HR capacity and mediating acquired PARPi resistance. C/EBPβ is a key regulator of the HR pathway and an indicator of PARPi responsiveness. Targeting C/EBPβ could induce HR deficiency and rescue PARPi sensitivity accordingly. Our findings indicate that HR-proficient patients may benefit from PARPi via targeting C/EBPβ, and C/EBPβ expression levels enable predicting and tracking PARPi responsiveness during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3160813093,"Many eye-tracking data analyses rely on the Area-of-Interest (AOI) methodology, which utilizes AOIs to analyze metrics such as fixations. However, AOI-based methods have some inherent limitations including variability and subjectivity in shape, size, and location of AOIs. In this article, we propose an alternative approach to the traditional AOI dwell time analysis: Weighted Sum Durations (WSD). This approach decreases the subjectivity of AOI definitions by using Points-of-Interest (POI) while maintaining interpretability. In WSD, the durations of fixations toward each POI is weighted by the distance from the POI and summed together to generate a metric comparable to AOI dwell time. To validate WSD, we reanalyzed data from a previously published eye-tracking study (n = 90).

SYK-6 contains eight LSD homologs with undetermined physiological roles. To investigate which homologs are involved in the catabolism of dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DCA), derived from β-5 linked lignin subunits, we heterologously produced the enzymes and screened their activities in lysates. The seven soluble enzymes all cleaved lignostilbene, but only LSD2, LSD3, and LSD4 exhibited high specific activity for 3-(4-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-5-methoxyphenyl) acrylate (DCA-S) relative to lignostilbene. LSD4 catalyzed the cleavage of DCA-S to 5-formylferulate and vanillin and cleaved lignostilbene and DCA-S (∼106 M−1 s−1) with tenfold greater specificity than pterostilbene and resveratrol. X-ray crystal structures of native LSD4 and the catalytically inactive cobalt-substituted Co-LSD4 at 1.45 Å resolution revealed the same fold, metal ion coordination, and edge-to-edge dimeric structure as observed in related enzymes. Key catalytic residues, Phe-59, Tyr-101, and Lys-134, were also conserved. Structures of Co-LSD4·vanillin, Co-LSD4·lignostilbene, and Co-LSD4·DCA-S complexes revealed that Ser-283 forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of the ferulyl portion of DCA-S. This residue is conserved in LSD2 and LSD4 but is alanine in LSD3. Substitution of Ser-283 with Ala minimally affected the specificity of LSD4 for either lignostilbene or DCA-S. By contrast, substitution with phenylalanine, as occurs in LSD5 and LSD6, reduced the specificity of the enzyme for both substrates by an order of magnitude. This study expands our understanding of an LSD critical to DCA catabolism as well as the physiological roles of other LSDs and their determinants of substrate specificity.

Due in part to their ability to catabolize a wide variety of aromatic compounds and their genetic tractability, bacteria provide an entry to developing biocatalysts to upgrade lignin depolymerization products to compounds such as muconic acid, β-ketoadipic acid, and 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid, which can be used to produce polymers (2Becker J.

Developing bacteria as lignin-valorizing biocatalysts requires elucidating and optimizing enzymes and pathways that catabolize lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 (SYK-6 hereafter) is among the best characterized bacteria able to catabolize lignin-derived aromatic compounds (2Becker J. Wittmann C.

Initially isolated from the waste water of a kraft pulp mill, SYK-6 has been shown to grow on compounds containing many of the intersubunit linkages found in lignin, including β-aryl ethers (β-O-4 linkage), pinoresinol (β-β), 2,2′-dihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dicarboxybiphenyl (5-5), 1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-propanediol (β-1), and dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (β-5, DCA), catabolizing them via vanillate and syringate (9Katayama Y.

Indeed, the bacterium appears to be wired for growth on aromatic compounds, growing better on vanillin than glucose, and deriving significant amounts of NAD(P)H from vanillin catabolism (11Varman A.M.

In addition, SYK-6 has been used to biocatalytically convert hardwood lignin hydrolyzates to muconate, which can be hydrogenated to adipate, and SYK-6 enzymes have been used to engineer a biocatalyst to convert lignosulfonate to 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylic acid (12Sonoki T.

Nevertheless, many of the enzymes responsible for the catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds by SYK-6 have yet to be characterized, particularly for those containing β-1 and β-5 linkages. In the catabolism of DCA by SYK-6, DCA is oxidized to a stilbene, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyryl)-5-methoxyphenyl) acrylate (DCA-S), which is then proposed to be cleaved by a lignostilbene-α,β-dioxygenase (LSD) (Fig. 1) (14Takahashi K.

More particularly, the two nonphenolic alcohols of DCA are successively oxidized to aldehydes, then carboxylates (14Takahashi K. Kamimura N. Hishiyama S. Hara H. Kasai D. Katayama Y. Fukuda M.

The terminal allylic alcohol of DCA is oxidized to an acrylate via an aldehyde intermediate, 3-(2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)acrylaldehyde (DCA-L), to ultimately yield 3-(2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(hydroxymethyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)acrylate (DCA-C) (14Takahashi K.

By contrast, the enzymes that oxidize the methyl alcohol attached to the coumaran moiety of DCA-C have been partially characterized. PhcC, PhcD, and an unidentified dehydrogenase catalyze the oxidation of DCA-C to the two stereoisomers of 5-(2-carboxyvinyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylate (DCA-CC) via an aldehyde intermediate, 3-(3-formyl-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)acrylate (DCA-CL) (16Takahashi K.

LSDs belong to the family of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCD), best characterized in eukaryotes whose structural fold is characterized by a seven-bladed β-propeller fold (20Daruwalla A.

The active site Fe2+ resides at the core of the β-propeller and is ligated by four histidines, three of which are hydrogen-bonded to acidic residues (21Sui X. Kiser P.D. Lintig J. Palczewski K.

The sixth site is unoccupied, partly due to occlusion by a nearby hydrophobic residue (23Sui X. Zhang J. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Kiser P.D.

Due to their relative ease of preparation and the relative solubility of their substrates, LSDs have served as important models for understanding CCDs and their catalytic mechanism (20Daruwalla A.

In bacteria, LSDs have been assigned catabolic and protective roles. For example, the catabolism of β-1-diaryl propane by Sphingomonas paucimobilis TMY1009 (TMY1009 hereafter), which, like SYK-6, grows on a variety of lignin-derived aromatic compounds, involves a stilbenoid intermediate in the form of lignostilbene (25Kishi K.

TMY1009 harbors four isoforms of LSD, which cleave lignostilbene to two equivalents of vanillin (19Kamoda S. Saburi Y.

LSDs have also been proposed to function as virulence factors in plant pathogens, potentially conferring protection against stilbenoid-based phytoalexins (30Brefort T. Scherzinger D. Limon M.C. Estrada A.F. Trautmann D. Mengel C. Avalos J. Al-Babili S. Cleavage of resveratrol in fungi: Characterization of the enzyme Rco1 from Ustilago maydis.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2011; 48: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SYK-6 harbors eight LSD homologs (4Kamimura N. Takahashi K. Mori K. Araki T. Fujita M. Higuchi Y. Masai E. Bacterial catabolism of lignin-derived aromatics: New findings in a recent decade: Update on bacterial lignin catabolism.Environ. Microbiol. Rep. 2017; 9: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Of these, LSD1 and LSD2 share 99% amino acid sequence identity with LsdATMY1009 and LsdBTMY1009 of TMY1009, respectively, while the other six share 35 to 58% amino acid sequence identity. It is unclear why SYK-6 harbors so many LSD homologs. To elucidate the physiological roles of the eight LSD homologs of SYK-6, we produced the enzymes in Escherichia coli and investigated their relative abilities to cleave lignostilbene and DCA-S. Based on this screen, we further characterized the structure and function of LSD4. Chromatographic and mass spectrometry analyses were employed to identify LSD-catalyzed reaction products of DCA-S. Steady-state kinetic studies were performed to evaluate the substrate specificity of LSD4 against a variety of stilbenoids. X-ray crystal structures were determined, including that of LSD4 bound to each of two substrates and a product. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was employed to evaluate the role of Ser-283 in determining the substrate specificity of the enzyme. The results are discussed with respect to the physiological roles of LSDs and the catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds by SYK-6. To better understand the relationship of the eight LSD homologs of SYK-6 (4Kamimura N. Takahashi K. Mori K. Araki T. Fujita M. Higuchi Y. Masai E. Bacterial catabolism of lignin-derived aromatics: New findings in a recent decade: Update on bacterial lignin catabolism.Environ. Microbiol. Rep. 2017; 9: 679-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we performed phylogenetic analyses of select LSDs and CCDs using a structure-guided alignment (Fig. 2). Importantly, all eight homologs of SYK-6 are most closely related to characterized stilbenoid-cleaving dioxygenases than to other CCDs. Moreover, LSD1 through 4 comprise a clade of enzymes that includes LsdATMY1009 and LsdBTMY1009 and LSDNOV1 of Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM12444. The enzymes of this clade share at least 57% amino acid sequence identity. To evaluate which of the eight LSD homologs of SYK-6 are involved in the catabolism of DCA, we screened their relative abilities to cleave DCA-S and lignostilbene (Fig. 3A). To this end, the genes encoding each homolog were cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that seven of the homologs (LSD1–LSD7) were produced as soluble proteins when cells were grown on LB medium supplemented with iron, although LSD1 and LSD2 required the coproduction of chaperones GroEL and GroES (Fig. S1). By contrast, LSD8 was insoluble even in the presence of the chaperones. In an oxygraph assay performed using 100 μM stilbenoid substrate, cell lysates containing LSD1, LSD5, LSD6, or LSD7 preferentially cleaved lignostilbene over DCA-S (Fig. 3B). By contrast, lysates containing LSD2, LSD3, or LSD4 preferentially cleaved DCA-S over lignostilbene. Finally, lysates prepared from cells expressing LSD8 did not detectably cleave either stilbene, consistent with the apparent insolubility of this enzyme. Overall, lysate containing LSD4 displayed approximately twofold more DCA-S-cleavage activity than any other lysate. However, lysate containing LSD3 displayed the highest DCA-S-cleavage activity relative to lignostilbene cleavage. To further characterize LSD4, the heterologously produced protein was purified to >99% apparent homogeneity using hydrophobic interaction and anion exchange chromatographies. Approximately 20 mg of purified LSD4 was obtained per liter of cell culture and contained ≥0.9 equivalent of iron per protomer as measured using a Ferene S-based assay. Size-exclusion chromatography–multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis indicated that LSD4 exists in solution as a mono-dispersed species with a mass of 106.3 ± 0.4 kDa, consistent with a dimer (Fig. S2; LSD4 protomer: 54 kDa). To facilitate the structural characterization of LSD4·substrate complexes, we generated Co-LSD4 in which the catalytic Fe2+ was substituted with Co2+. This metal ion substitution in CAO1 yielded an inactive but isostructural enzyme (31Sui X. Farquhar E.R. Hill H.E. von Lintig J. Shi W. Kiser P.D.

Purification yielded ∼8 mg of protein per liter of cell culture. Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis revealed that each protomer of Co-LSD4 contained 0.92 ± 0.06 equivalents of Co2+ and ∼0.02 equivalents of Fe2+. Co-LSD4 had a faint purple hue and a λmax of ∼480 nm (Fig. S3). To identify products of the LSD4-catalyzed cleavage of DCA-S, the substrate and enzyme were incubated for ∼15 min at room temperature in potassium phosphate (ionic strength (I) = 0.1 M), pH 7.5. HPLC analysis of the reaction revealed the depletion of DCA-S (retention time (tR), ∼38 min) and the appearance of two products (tR ∼25 min and ∼30 min; Fig. 4). The first peak eluted with the same tR as vanillin and, when analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), had an m/z value of 224.1 (Fig. S4), consistent with trimethylsilylyated vanillin. The second HPLC peak had an m/z value of 366.2 when analyzed using GC-MS, consistent with doubly trimethylsilylyated 5-formylferulate. HPLC-based assays further revealed that the LSD4-catalyzed cleavage of DCA-S and lignostilbene yielded 1.1 ± 0.3 mol and 2.6 ± 0.2 mol vanillin per mol O2 consumed, respectively. Overall, these analyses demonstrated that LSD4 catalyzes the cleavage of DCA-S to vanillin and 5-formylferulate, consistent with the proposed DCA catabolic pathway of SYK-6 (14Takahashi K.

To investigate the substrate specificity of LSD4, we used an oxygraph assay to evaluate the enzyme’s apparent specificity (kcat/KM) for a variety of stilbenes (HEPES (I = 0.1 M), pH 7.5 at 25 °C). For all tested stilbenes, the dependence of the initial reaction rate on substrate concentration obeyed Michaelis–Menten kinetics. As summarized in Table 1, LSD4 exhibited slightly higher specificity for lignostilbene over DCA-S and cleaved both with approximately tenfold higher apparent specificity than either pterostilbene or resveratrol. Interestingly, LSD4 was relatively unreactive toward piceatannol, cleaving it with a specific activity <1% that of lignostilbene. Subsequent analysis of the steady-state utilization of O2 revealed KM values comparable with those of LsdATMY1009 (33Kuatsjah E. Verstraete M.M. Kobylarz M.J. Liu A.K.N. Murphy M.E.P. Eltis L.D.

https://openalex.org/W3161177035,"Electron microscopy (EM) has been employed for decades to analyze cell structure. To also analyze the positions and functions of specific proteins, one typically relies on immuno-EM or on a correlation with fluorescence microscopy, in the form of correlated light and electron microscopy (CLEM). Nevertheless, neither of these procedures is able to also address the isotopic composition of cells. To solve this, a correlation with secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) would be necessary. SIMS has been correlated in the past to EM or to fluorescence microscopy in biological samples, but not to CLEM. We achieved this here, using a protocol based on transmission EM, conventional epifluorescence microscopy and nanoSIMS. The protocol is easily applied, and enables the use of all three technologies at high performance parameters. We suggest that CLEM-SIMS will provide substantial information that is currently beyond the scope of conventional correlative approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3157497286,"Farms need to invest in order to earn incomes and maintain their competitive edge. However, the scale and extent of investments must be aligned with resources of other productive inputs, primarily including land, because otherwise there is risk of overinvestment. Since 2004, Central and Eastern European countries have been provided with access to investment support programs; these are non-repayable aid funds which can potentially lead to overinvestment issues. Therefore, this paper attempts to answer the question on the scale of overinvestment in the countries covered. This is all the more important since that problem has rarely been addressed in economic and agricultural research. The study presented in this paper is unique in that the research tasks are based on unpublished Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) microdata for 5839 selected Central and Eastern European farms provided by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI). Based on variables relating to the amount of productive inputs and production volumes, the authors developed their own typology of farms which includes the following categories: optimum investment levels (the growth rate of labor productivity is greater than growth in the assets-to-land ratio); relative overinvestment (while labor productivity grows, it does so at a slower rate than the assets-to-land ratio); absolute overinvestment (labor productivity declines while the assets-to-land ratio grows); underinvestment (decline in both labor productivity and the assets-to-land ratio). The authors demonstrated that members of the 'absolute overinvestment' group made flagrant mistakes in investment planning and implementation, whereas members of the 'relative overinvestment' group did record an improvement in labor productivity which ultimately can be considered a positive outcome. Underinvested farms were a very small minority in each country. In addition to filling a gap in the methodology for determining agricultural overinvestment, this paper also indicates the scale of that issue in Central and Eastern European countries. This study may be of importance both to farms (as guidelines for investment planning) and to agricultural policymakers who develop investment support programs."

In a region with a high burden of infectious disease, this has serious consequences for PLWD.Using routinely collected longitudinal health data, we describe the epidemiology of diabetes in a large virtual cohort of PLWD who have a high burden of HIV and TB, from the Khayelitsha subdistrict in the Western Cape Province in South Africa. We described the relationship between previous TB, newly diagnosed TB disease and HIV infection on diabetes using HbA1c results as an outcome measure. The study population was predominately female (67%), 13% had a history of active TB disease and 18% were HIV positive. The HIV positive group had diabetes ascertained at a significantly younger age (46 years c.f. 53 years respectively, p<0.001) and in general had increased HbA1c values over time after their HIV diagnosis, when compared to the HIV-negative group. There was no evidence of TB disease influencing the trajectory of glycaemic control in the long term, but diabetes patients who developed active TB had higher mortality than those without TB (12.4% vs 6.7% p-value < 0.001). HIV and diabetes are both chronic diseases whose long-term management includes drug therapy, however, only 52.8% of the study population with an HIV-diabetes comorbidity had a record of diabetes treatment. In addition, the data suggest overall poor glycaemic control in the study population with only 24.5% of the participants having an HbA1c <7% at baseline despite 85% of the study population being on diabetes treatment.The epidemiologic findings in this exploratory study highlight the need for further research into diabetes outcomes in a high TB and HIV burden setting and demonstrate that routine health data are a valuable resource for understanding disease epidemiology in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W3159018336,"Background Non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation benefit from targeted treatments. Previous studies reported EGFR mutation-positive proportions among tested non-squamous NSCLC patients. However, incidence rates and population risk of EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative non-squamous NSCLC have not been assessed. This study therefore aimed to estimate the population-based incidence rates of EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative non-squamous NSCLC in different population groups defined by sex, ethnic group and smoking status. Methods This study included data from all non-squamous NSCLC patients diagnosed in northern New Zealand between 1/02/2010 and 31/07/2017 (N = 3815), obtained from a population-based cancer registry. Age-specific incidence rates, WHO age-standardised rates (ASRs) and rates adjusted for incomplete testing were calculated for EGFR mutation-positive and EGFR mutation-negative diseases for the study cohort as a whole and subgroups of patients. Results Among 3815 patients, 45% were tested for EGFR mutations; 22.5% of those tested were EGFR mutation-positive. The ASR of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC was 5.05 (95%CI 4.71–5.39) per 100,000 person-years. ASRs for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC were higher for females than males: standardised incidence ratio (SIR) 1.50 (1.31–1.73); higher for Pacifica, Asians and Māori compared with New Zealand Europeans: SIRs 3.47 (2.48–4.85), 3.35 (2.62–4.28), and 2.02 (1.43–2.87), respectively; and, only slightly increased in ever-smokers compared with never-smokers: SIR 1.25 (1.02–1.53). In contrast, the ASR of EGFR mutation-negative NSCLC was 17.39 (16.75–18.02) per 100,000 person-years, showing a strong association with smoking; was higher for men; highest for Māori, followed by Pacifica and then New Zealand Europeans, and lowest for Asians. When corrected for incomplete testing, SIRs by sex, ethnicity and smoking, for both diseases, remained similar to those based on tested patients. Conclusion The population risk of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC was significantly higher for Māori and Pacifica compared with New Zealand Europeans."
https://openalex.org/W3159050699,"This work explores the changes in vegetation coverage and submergence time of floodplains along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (i.e., the Jingjiang River) and the relations between them. As the Three Gorges Dam has been operating for more than 10 years, the original vegetative environment has been greatly altered in this region. The two main aspects of these changes were discovered by analyzing year-end image data from remote sensing satellites using a dimidiate pixel model, based on the normalized difference vegetation index, and by calculating water level and topographic data over a distance of 360 km from 2003–2015. Given that the channels had adjusted laterally, thus exhibiting deeper and broader geometries due to the Three Gorges Dam, 11 floodplains were classified into three groups with distinctive features. The evidence shows that, the floodplains with high elevation have formed steady vegetation areas and could hardly be affected by runoff and usually occupied by humans. The low elevation group has not met the minimal threshold of submerging time for vegetation growth, and no plants were observed so far. Based on the facts summed up from the floodplains with variable elevation, days needed to spot vegetation ranges from 70 to 120 days which happened typically near 2006 and between 2008 and 2010, respectively, and a negative correlation was detected between submergence time and vegetation coverage within a certain range. Thus, floods optimized by the Three Gorges Dam have directly influenced plant growth in the floodplains and may also affect our ability to manage certain types of large floods. Our conclusions may provide a basis for establishing flood criteria to manage the floodplain vegetation and evaluating possible increases in resistance caused by high-flow flooding when these floodplains are submerged."
https://openalex.org/W3157296568,"Background This paper aimed to describe the airway practices of intensive care units (ICUs) in Australia and New Zealand specific to patients presenting with COVID-19 and to inform whether consistent clinical practice was achieved. Specific clinical airway guidelines were endorsed in March 2020 by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) and College of Intensive Care Medicine (CICM). Methods and findings Prospective, structured questionnaire for all ICU directors in Australia and New Zealand was completed by 69 ICU directors after email invitation from ANZICS. The online questionnaire was accessible for three weeks during September 2020 and analysed by cloud-based software. Basic ICU demographics (private or public, metropolitan or rural) and location, purchasing, airway management practices, guideline uptake, checklist and cognitive aid use and staff training relevant to airway management during the COVID-19 pandemic were the main outcome measures. The 69 ICU directors reported significant simulation-based inter-professional airway training of staff (97%), and use of video laryngoscopy (94%), intubation checklists (94%), cognitive aids (83%) and PPE “spotters” (89%) during the airway management of patients with COVID-19. Tracheal intubation was almost always performed by a Specialist (97% of ICUs), who was more likely to be an intensivist than an anaesthetist (61% vs 36%). There was a more frequent adoption of specific airway guidelines for the management of COVID-19 patients in public ICUs (94% vs 71%) and reliance on specialist intensivists to perform intubations in private ICUs (92% vs 53%). Conclusion There was a high uptake of a standardised approach to airway management in COVID-19 patients in ICUs in Australia and New Zealand, likely due to endorsement of national guidelines."

https://openalex.org/W3159053754,"Work-life conflicts (WLC) may impact health, but few studies prospectively consider the impact of WLC on objective outcomes such as cardiovascular disease. Using data from the Gutenberg Health Study (GHS), we examined if WLC at baseline was associated with an increased five-year incidence of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarct, stroke, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, sudden cardiac death). We also considered if WLC was associated with incident hypertension and arterial stiffness and if the effects of WLC on cardiovascular health differ for men and women.A working subsample of the 15,010 GHS cohort participants completed the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, which included five ""work-privacy conflict"" questions at baseline and at the five-year follow-up. Relative risks for incident hypertension due to increased WLC at baseline (WLC scores exceeding 60 out of 100) were estimated with Poisson regression in the subgroup of participants without hypertension at baseline (n = 2426). Categories of WLC at baseline and follow-up were also used to examine the risk of hypertension due to chronic/recurrent WLC. In this subgroup, we also examined the association between WLC as a continuous score ranging from 0 to 100 with change to arterial stiffness after five years using linear regression. Hazard ratios were estimated for incident cardiovascular events in a larger subsample of participants without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline (n = 3698) using Cox regression. We used various multivariable regression models to adjust for sex, age, socioeconomic status, occupational, household, and cardiovascular risk factors.We found no association between WLC and incident hypertension or increased arterial stiffness. The fully-adjusted relative risk for WLC >60 at baseline and hypertension was 0.93 (95% 0.74-1.17). The risk of hypertension due to chronic/recurrent WLC >60 was increased but not statistically significant (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.83-1.54). Overall, hazard ratios for incident cardiovascular events were also not increased. However, stratifying the results by sex resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.47 (95% CI 0.54-3.98) for incident cardiovascular disease among women in the fully adjusted model.Although our results were not statistically significant, they indicate that WLC is negatively impacting the cardiovascular health of women. While these results need to be confirmed with additional research and a longer follow-up, interventions to prevent WLC will promote health and could be especially beneficial for women."

The study population was recruited by inviting all adult refugees who participated in the mandatory public integration support programme. All refugees that participated had received refugee status. A total of 681 of the invited participants returned the GHQ-12 questionnaires, through which the risk for mental illness was measured and only Arabic- speaking refugees (N = 638) were included in the analyses.Marital status per se was not associated with a risk for mental illness. However, for the whole study sample there was a statistical significant odds ratio of 1.72 (95% CI 1.03-2.86). For male Arabic-speaking refugees with a spouse or child left behind in the home country there was a borderline significant increased risk for mental illness, odds ratio = 1. 87 (95% CI 0.99-3.56). The risk for female Arabic-speaking refugees was non-significant, odds ratio = 1.35 (95% CI 0.55-3.33).Arabic- speaking refugees who were separated from family members reported an increased risk for mental illness after arriving in the host country. Actions to facilitate family reunion after arriving as a refugee (in Sweden) seems to be an important factor to promote mental health among refugees."

It imposes a substantial economic burden up on patients, carers, healthcare systems, and wider society. This is the first study to examine the direct health care costs of SLE in Alberta using real-world data. Alberta maintains a publicly funded, universally available health care system. Health service use and direct healthcare costs of SLE and non-SLE cases were determined from inpatient hospital services, fee-for-physician services, emergency services, and ambulatory care services. All costs were estimated for calendar year 2016. Data were analysed using central measures specifically the mean to determine the annual costs of SLE and non-SLE. A total number of 10,932 (Male = 2,546; Female = 8,386), and 41,851,36 (Male = 21,157,76; Female = 20,693,60) of SLE and non-SLE cases, respectively were included in this study. The mean annual costs of SLE, and non-SLE per case were $7,740.19 (Male = $7,986.59; Female = $7,665.38), and $2,479.53 (Male = $2,265.57; Female = $2,698.30), (p < 0.001) respectively. The mean annual costs of fee-for-physician services (SLE = $2,160.03; non-SLE = $840.00) (p < 0.001), inpatient hospital services (SLE = $3,462.86; non-SLE = $1,007.29), (p < 0.001) emergency services (SLE = $440.28; non-SLE = $176.65), (p < 0.001) and ambulatory care services (SLE = $1,677.03; non-SLE = $455.05) (p < 0.001) per case were estimated. The findings showed that the costs of SLE were considerably high for patients and healthcare system. This highlights the importance of appropriate treatment and management of SLE. Further studies are required to fully investigate both the direct and indirect economic burden of SLE including out-of-pocket expenses, costs to patients and caregivers and productivity loss."

CKD is typically discovered at a late stage. HCV-nephropathy may show different histopathologic patterns, as both glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage have been described. Identification of patients with early renal manifestations would be beneficial to provide treatment and avoid progression to CKD. The observational prospective single-center HCVKID study assessed the prevalence of early renal manifestations in patients with chronic HCV and compared these patients with HCV-negative healthy controls cross-sectionally. HCV-positive patients with and without renal manifestations were also compared to define biomarkers suitable for identifying early manifestations in standard clinical practice. Tubular proteinuria as judged by urine α 1-microglobulin was the most common early renal manifestation found in 11% in HCV-positive patients, followed by hematuria in 8%. Kidney filtration was statistically significantly lower among HCV-positive patients with renal manifestation according to any calculation method. There were no significant differences in duration of infection or stage of liver fibrosis between patients with or without renal manifestations. Tubular cell damage may be the earliest sign of renal dysfunction caused by HCV. Complement activation also correlates with the dysfunction, indicating of contribution to HCV-induced renal manifestations even in their early phase."
https://openalex.org/W3159790207,"Some evidence suggests that young adults exhibit a selective laterality of auditory brainstem response (ABR) elicited with speech stimuli. Little is known about such an auditory laterality in older adults.The aim of this study was to investigate possible asymmetric auditory brainstem processing between right and left ear presentation in older adults.Sixty-two older adults presenting with normal hearing thresholds according to their age and who were native speakers of Quebec French participated in this study. ABR was recorded using click and a 40-ms /da/ syllable. ABR was elicited through monaural right and monaural left stimulation. Latency and amplitude for click-and speech-ABR components were compared between right and left ear presentations. In addition, for the /da/ syllable, a fast Fourier transform analysis of the sustained frequency-following response (FFR) of the vowel was performed along with stimulus-to-response and right-left ear correlation analyses.No significant differences between right and left ear presentation were found for amplitudes and latencies of the click-ABR components. Significantly shorter latencies for right ear presentation as compared to left ear presentation were observed for onset and offset transient components (V, A and O), sustained components (D and E), and voiced transition components (C) of the speech-ABR. In addition, the spectral amplitude of the fundamental frequency (F0) was significantly larger for the left ear presentation than the right ear presentation.Results of this study show that older adults with normal hearing exhibit symmetric encoding for click stimuli at the brainstem level between the right and left ear presentation. However, they present with brainstem asymmetries for the encoding of selective stimulus components of the speech-ABR between the right and left ear presentation. The right ear presentation of a /da/ syllable elicited reduced neural timing for both transient and sustained components compared to the left ear. Conversely, a stronger left ear F0 encoding was observed. These findings suggest that at a preattentive, sensory stage of auditory processing, older adults lateralize speech stimuli similarly to young adults."

We investigated interannual variability in NEP, expressed as annual values and anomalies, and its climatic and biotic controls using an eddy-covariance dataset for 2005–2018 for rain-fed spring maize in northeastern China. Average annual NEP was 270±31 g C m −2 yr −1 , with no significant changes over time. The effects on interannual variability in NEP of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) that was mainly controlled by soil water content (SWC) and leaf area index (LAI), were more than those of respiration (RE) that was controlled by temperature and LAI. Further, maximum daily NEP (NEP max ) that was dominated by summer vapor pressure deficit explained the largest fraction of annual anomalies in NEP, followed by carbon dioxide uptake period (CUP) that was defined by the beginning date (BDOY) and the end date (EDOY) of CUP. The variability in BDOY was mainly determined by spring precipitation and the effective accumulated temperature, and the variability in EDOY was determined by autumn precipitation, SWC and LAI. NEP may decrease with declining precipitation in the future due to decreasing GEP, NEP max , or CUP, and irrigation and residues cover may be useful in efforts to maintain current NEP levels. Our results indicate that interannual variability in NEP in agroecosystems may be more sensitive to changes in water conditions (such as precipitation, SWC and VPD) induced by climate changes, while temperature may be an important indirect factor when VPD is dominated."
https://openalex.org/W3162556779,"Objective To evaluate the impact of an intervention improving the continuum of care monitoring (CCM) within HIV public healthcare services in São Paulo, Brazil, and implementing a clinical monitoring system. This system identified three patient groups prioritized for additional care engagement: (1) individuals diagnosed with HIV, but not receiving treatment (the treatment gap group); (2) individuals receiving treatment for &gt;6 months with a detectable viral load (the virologic failure group); and (3) patients lost to follow-up (LTFU). Methods The implementation strategies included three training sessions, covering system logistics, case discussions, and development of maintenance goals. These strategies were conducted within 30 HIV public healthcare services (May 2019 to April 2020). After each training session, professionals shared their experiences with CCM at regional meetings. Before and after the intervention, providers were invited to answer 23 items from the normalization process theory questionnaire (online) to understand contextual factors. The mean item scores were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test. The RE-AIM implementation science framework (evaluating reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) was used to evaluate the integration of the CCM. Results In the study, 47 (19.3%) of 243 patients with a treatment gap initiated treatment, 456 (49.1%) of 928 patients with virologic failure achieved suppression, and 700 of 1552 (45.1%) LTFU patients restarted treatment. Strategies for the search and reengagement of patients were developed and shared. Providers recognized the positive effects of CCM on their work and how it modified existing activities (3.7 vs. 4.4, p&lt;0.0001, and 3.9 vs. 4.1, p&lt;0.05); 27 (90%) centers developed plans to sustain routine CCM. Conclusion Implementing CCM helped identify patients requiring more intensive attention. This intervention led to changes in providers’ perceptions of CCM and care and management processes, which increased the number of patients engaged across the care continuum and improved outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3163342985,"The development of effective therapies as well as early, molecular diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is impeded by the lack of understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms. Metabolomics studies of body fluids as well as brain tissues have shown major changes in metabolic profiles of Alzheimer’s patients. However, with analysis performed at the late stages of the disease it is not possible to distinguish causes and consequence. The mouse model APP/PS1 expresses a mutant amyloid precursor protein resulting in early Amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation as well as many resulting physiological changes including changes in metabolic profile and metabolism. Analysis of metabolic profile of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of APP/PS1 mouse model can provide information about metabolic changes in these body fluids caused by Aβ accumulation. Using our novel method for analysis of correlation and mathematical ranking of significant correlations between metabolites in CSF and blood, we have explored changes in metabolite correlation and connectedness in APP/PS1 and wild type mice. Metabolites concentration and correlation changes in CSF, blood and across the blood brain barrier determined in this work are affected by the production of amyloid plaque. Metabolite changes observed in the APP/PS1 mouse model are the response to the mutation causing plaque formation, not the cause for the plaque suggesting that they are less relevant in the context of early treatment and prevention then the metabolic changes observed only in humans."

The meadow jumping mouse, a small North American hibernator, exhibits traits–including a short generation time–that would facilitate genetic approaches to hibernation research. Here we report the collection, captive breeding, and laboratory hibernation of meadow jumping mice. Captive breeders in our colony produced a statistically significant excess of male offspring and a large number of all-male and all-female litters. We confirmed that short photoperiod induced pre-hibernation fattening, and cold ambient temperature facilitated entry into hibernation. During pre-hibernation fattening, food consumption exhibited non-linear dependence on both body mass and temperature, such that food consumption was greatest in the heaviest animals at the coldest temperatures. Meadow jumping mice exhibited a strong circadian rhythm of nightly activity that was disrupted during the hibernation interval. We conclude that it is possible to study hibernation phenotypes using captive-bred meadow jumping mice in a laboratory setting."

Here we evaluate a new, comprehensive approach that incorporates interactions among multiple management strategies, land use/cover change, wildfire, and climate, although the potential effects of climate change are not evaluated in this study. The California natural and working lands carbon and greenhouse gas model (CALAND) indicates that summing individual practice estimates of greenhouse gas impacts may underestimate emission reduction benefits in comparison with an integrated estimate. Annual per-area estimates of the potential impact of specific management practices on landscape emissions can vary based on the estimation period, which can be problematic for extrapolating such estimates over space and time. Furthermore, the actual area of implementation is a primary factor in determining potential impacts of management on landscape emissions. Nonetheless, less intensive forest management, avoided conversion to urban land, and urban forest expansion generally create the largest annual per-area reductions, while meadow restoration and forest fuel reduction and harvest practices generally create the largest increases with respect to no management. CALAND also shows that data uncertainty is too high to determine whether California land is a source or a sink of carbon emissions, but that estimating effects of management with respect to a baseline provides valid results. Important sources of this uncertainty are initial carbon density, net ecosystem carbon accumulation rates, and land use/cover change data. The appropriate choice of baseline is critical for generating valid results."
https://openalex.org/W3159050908,"The CD200R family comprises a group of paired receptors that can modulate the activation of immune cells. They are expressed both on myeloid cells and lymphocyte subsets. Here we report that the expression of these receptors on porcine B cells is tightly regulated, being mainly expressed on mature cells. The expression of the inhibitory receptors CD200R1 and/or its splicing variant CD200R1X2, either in combination or not with the activating receptor CD200R1L, is upregulated in sIgM+ effector/memory cells, and tends to decline thereafter as these cells progress to plasmablasts or switch the Ig isotype. sIgM+ naïve and primed cells only express, by contrast, the CD200R1X2 receptor. B-1 like cells also express CD200R1 isoforms, either alone or in combination with CD200R1L. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a monoclonal antibody specific for inhibitory receptors, enhances the IgM and IgG production induced by TLR7 stimulation suggesting a modulatory role of B cell functions of these receptors."

Over the past year, Cell Stem Cell has introduced early-career researchers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent closures to our readers. One year since our first introductions, we’ve invited several participants to reflect on their experiences and key issues. In this Story, Weiqi Zhang discusses her lab’s research focus and how they found opportunities during COVID-19 shutdowns to provide new resources for the aging research community. Aging is a process that we all face, and its biology has long fascinated me. The mechanism of aging remains elusive, and my curiosity about this enigma drives my lab’s daily research. Stem cell aging is critically linked to organismal aging. To address the fact that primate aging usually takes years, we established an accelerated aging model using human stem cells and linked stem cell homeostasis to compact heterochromatin. Recently, using CRISPR-based screening, we identified histone acetyltransferase KAT7 as a new aging-linked gene, inhibition of which reshapes chromatin structure and delays cell senescence. More importantly, we showed that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated Kat7 knockout alleviated liver senescence and extended healthspan and lifespan of mice, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of KAT7 inactivation in aging-related processes. This link between epigenetic factors and rewiring the molecular program of aging gives me hope that we can one day understand this process. My lab seeks to integrate the advantages of different disciplines such as multi-omics, bioinformatics, chemical biology, and genetic engineering to provide new ideas for the treatment of aging-related diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we still adhered to our research direction by adapting our research approaches and thinking differently about how we investigate the molecular underpinnings of aging. I think of aging as studying a community. The individuals (cells) are prone to aging, and intrinsic changes (in organelles, epigenetics, and molecular pathways, etc.), can change communication between individuals (cell-cell interaction). The community environment (chronic inflammation, nutritional supply, etc.) has a deep impact, too. By studying this “community ecosystem,” we hope to identify early biomarkers and intervention targets to mitigate the effects of, and even delay, aging. We are also exploring new methods to delay cellular senescence or expand the lifespan/healthspan of animal models. During the outbreak of the pandemic last year, we could not routinely go to the laboratory, and then we began to think about what could be done to make the best use of our timeIn doing so, we realized that aging research is inseparable from bioinformatics and data science. High-throughput omics technologies (including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics) have been widely applied in aging studies, facilitating large-scale profiling of aging-associated molecular changes and regulatory states. In addition, emerging methods are allowing us to probe aging at single-cell resolution, providing integrated and multi-dimensional data at an unprecedented scale and depth. As a result, a growing volume of valuable aging-related data necessitates an open, integrated database to support new lines of aging research. During the outbreak of the pandemic last year, we could not routinely go to the laboratory, and then we began to think about what could be done to make the best use of our time. We soon realized that accelerating the construction of an aging-related database might be an excellent idea. We therefore established the Aging Atlas (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/aging/index) to collect multi-omics data related to aging, providing a broad map of the community of tissues we study for researchers. The Aging Atlas provides user-friendly functionalities to explore aging-related changes in gene expression and provides download services for raw multi-omics data from aging-related researches. The database is currently online, and more than 25 countries have accessed the database in a short period of time. As a continuation of this work, we are also constructing a sister database, called the Regeneration Roadmap, or RR for short, to include multi-level omics data related to regeneration. In 2020, we also spent much time analyzing the sequencing data we had already obtained and consulting a large amount of literature to help us interpret these data. At the same time, we tried our best to keep the laboratory operational as long as possible. In addition, we had more time to read papers, write, and publish reviews. Last year, we reviewed the epigenome of aging and conducted systematic discussions on epigenetic changes that occur during aging, and on how life-extending interventions modulate epigenetic factors to alleviate aging features. In fact, due to the reduction of meetings, business trips, and social time, we were able to concentrate more on scientific research. This includes having more time to communicate with colleagues and students and thinking more deeply about the implications of our research. Thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government, our life and work have basically returned to normal this year. However, some of our pandemic habits have remained, such as online group meetings and regular cloud salons. Caring more about your friends and partners and exercising more are also important lessons from the epidemic. I am fortunate to have excellent collaborators, a community of researchers that together explores the mysteries of aging in synergy."

In this Story, Aaron Viny discusses the emotional toll faced by physician-scientists over this past year and highlights how we need vaccinations, and each other, to see the pandemic through. We on the healthcare frontlines are fighting a war against a microbial enemy. We signed up for this. We were trained for this. Yet we have also been forced against our will to fight on a second front—the struggle against misinformation and politically charged anti-science rhetoric. In March 2020, as the first cases of COVID-19 were being detected in the New York City area, I doubt most foresaw the world still grappling with this virus over a year later. However, many knew this would portend a major public health challenge ahead. Healthcare providers were armed with virtually no clinical or scientific knowledge on this new disease, and I recalled many of the stories I’ve heard over the years from my professors and mentors who lived through the HIV pandemic. This was a call to arms for the physician-scientist community—our training had uniquely positioned us to heed the call. As I was preparing to take over the inpatient leukemia service, I was informed that my predecessor was being quarantined due to exposure to a COVID-positive patient. I also learned that, after a long road, my wife was pregnant with our second child. With little information on the virus, I moved out of our home to keep my pregnant wife and young daughter safe. I thought back to the stories I’d heard from the heroes of the HIV pandemic—of their courage and bravery and of the impact they had in turning that disease into a chronic illness rather than a death sentence. In March and early April 2020, I primarily took care of COVID patients who also unfortunately carried a leukemia diagnosis. Anti-cancer therapy took a back seat to supplemental oxygen and supportive care with the hope that the virus would eventually pass and we could then return to fighting cancer, the enemy I knew and understood. Whether it was the virus itself or cancer treatment delays and cancer progression, many patients did not fare well. We tried our best to learn as much as we could from each case—T cell activation versus anergy, cytokine storm versus healthy immune response. We tried to collect patient samples and use our laboratory skills to make sense of it all. There were many more questions than answers. At 7 p.m. each night, the eerily quiet streets of New York would erupt with cheers as healthcare workers changed shifts, but with the reality of so many patients succumbing to COVID pneumonia with very little I could offer therapeutically, these cheers did not feel earned. After two of the most physically and emotionally challenging weeks of clinical service I had experienced, it was now time for the next attending physician to take over. We on the healthcare frontlines are fighting a war against a microbial enemy. We signed up for this. We were trained for this. Yet we have also been forced against our will to fight on a second front—the struggle against misinformation and politically charged anti-science rhetoric. Rather than “listen to the experts,” many people, isolated and quarantined, were susceptible to the loud voices of conspiracy theorists and skeptics intentionally aiming to undermine the data and the science. More than 550,000 lives have been lost, many of them avoidable had adequate measures been taken. When dedicating one’s life to improving the health of others, how can the irresponsible actions of others not seem like personal insults? The data on hydroxychloroquine came back in the following months as ineffective. Remdesivir had a modest effect. Convalescent plasma and recombinant antibody were effective in specific contexts. We finally had some tools. Now, a year later, attending on a step-down unit with mostly COVID-positive patients, regretfully, these patients largely still depended on supplemental oxygen and supportive care. Many are still dying of this virus. The tide, is, however, turning. On December 24th, I received my first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine alongside so many of my brothers and sisters in the healthcare community. The vaccine is working (Benenson et al., 2021Benenson S. Oster Y. Cohen M.J. Nir-Paz R. BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Effectiveness among Health Care Workers.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; (Published online March 23, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2101951Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; Keehner et al., 2021Keehner J. Horton L.E. Pfeffer M.A. Longhurst C.A.

Med. 2021; (Published online March 23, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2101927Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Many Americans are rolling up their sleeves to be vaccinated. The accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines is one of the most remarkable achievements of modern science, and it is my deep and sincere hope that it inspires a whole new generation to look upon the bravery, altruism, and worldwide impact of the doctors and scientists of this pandemic and pursue a career as a physician-scientist. There are true heroes here to be lauded—Drs. Anthony Fauci, David Ho, Trevor Bedford, Ugur Sahin, and Oslem Tureci. But all of us in science need to help wield our power of data and beg everyone we know to get vaccinated. To everyone reading this, please reach out to one person each day who might need help or coaxing to get vaccinated. Picking up takeout? Ask the staff if they’ve been vaccinated—give them links to local resources. Have octogenarian neighbors with no kids? Help them make an appointment and a plan. The more needles in arms, the safer my patients will be, the safer our families will be, the safer my daughters will be (“daughters,” now plural)."
