https://openalex.org/W2077875027,"Real-space observations of long-range electronic perturbations caused by defects have been made with scanning tunneling microscopy. The defects are isolated adsorbed molecules on the surface of graphite. These defects perturb the charge density, giving periodic oscillations similar to Friedel oscillations. The oscillations have a wavelength radical3 times that of the graphite lattice, and the symmetry of the oscillations reflects the nature of the defect."

https://openalex.org/W2008527121,"The private nonprofit form of institutions is large and growing. Its role in a mixed economy is the subject of this article. Nonprofits differ from private enterprises primarily in the constraints on them. The key element is that nonprofits may not distribute profits to anyone associated with the organization, a restriction that is in sharp contrast to the freedom that private firms have to reward owners and managers for generating profit. The theoretical case that such a constraint can be useful when consumers are poorly informed is examined. Also, the available empirical evidence on differences in behavior between nonprofit and for-profit organizations is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2089554231,"Microearthquake data from a downhole seismometer network on the San Andreas fault appear to outline two aseismic asperities that may correspond to the locations of the foreshocks and main shocks of the Parkfield characteristic earthquakes. The source parameters of the microearthquakes show that a few of the earthquakes have significantly higher stress drops than most. Furthermore, the magnitude-frequency statistics suggest that at local magnitude 0.6, the cumulative number of small events begins to fall off the usual Gutenberg-Richter (b = -1) relation, in which the number of events increases exponentially with decreasing magnitude. The downhole seismometer data establish a baseline from which the evolution of the earthquake process at Parkfield can be monitored and suggest that different mechanical conditions than those that lead to the typical Gutenberg-Richter relation may be operating for the smallest of Parkfield microearthquakes."

Diffusible factors cause this response in the fusing gynoecium of the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus). Surgical manipulations of the gynoecium showed that epidermal cells from normally nonfusing surfaces could trasmit and respond to the diffusible factors. Furthermore, the diffusible fators could be trapped in agar-impregnated barriers, as shown by the redifferentiation of carpel epidermal cells from nonfusing regions when the factor-loaded barriers were appressed to them."

https://openalex.org/W2001475424,"Physiography may be viewed from two distinct angles, the one dynamic, the other passive. The processes hold the fascination inherent in energy and force; the products exhibit all the beauty and diversity of form in the composition of landscapes. The tacit adoption of a particular view-point not only will avoid confusion but will also simplify to a great extent both oral and written presentation of physiographic subjects, especially to beginners. We ought, perhaps, to discriminate clearly between process and product. In a restricted fashion geodynamics studies the process, force or activity, simply acknowledging the form as a passive result. Geomorphology considers that form to be a detailed expression of the influence of rock and structure and acknowledges the process as a cause chiefly in relation to the gross lineaments of the ensemble. In a large fashion geodynamics is intimately associated with certain branches of geology, as sedimentation, while geomorphology connects physiography with geography. The dynamic interlude representing the active phase of physiography weaves the basic threads of geologic history."
