https://openalex.org/W2793861965,"We surveyed 807 researchers (494 ecologists and 313 evolutionary biologists) about their use of Questionable Research Practices (QRPs), including cherry picking statistically significant results, p hacking, and hypothesising after the results are known (HARKing). We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2883613552,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs originally involved in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. We have shown in previous work that the miRNA let-7b can act as a signalling molecule for Toll-like receptor 7, thereby initiating innate immune pathways and apoptosis in the central nervous system. Here, we investigated whether different members of the miRNA family let-7, abundantly expressed in the brain, are released into the human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether quantitative differences in let-7 copies exist in neurodegenerative diseases. RNA isolated from CSF of patients with Alzheimer´s disease (AD) and from control patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD), major depressive episode (MDE) without clinical or neurobiological signs of AD, and healthy individuals, was reverse transcribed with primers against nine let-7 family members, and miRNAs were quantified and analyzed comparatively by quantitative PCR. let-7 miRNAs were present in CSF from patients with AD, FTLD, MDE, and healthy controls. However, the amount of individual let-7 miRNAs in the CSF varied substantially. CSF from AD patients contained higher amounts of let-7b and let-7e compared to healthy controls, while no differences were observed regarding the other let-7 miRNAs. No increase in let-7b and let-7e was detected in CSF from FTLD patients, while in CSF from MDE patients, let-7b and let-7e copy levels were elevated. In CSF from AD patients, let-7b and let-7e were associated with extracellular vesicles. let-7 family members present in the CSF mediated neurotoxicity in vitro, albeit to a variable extent. Taken together, neurotoxic let-7 miRNAs are differentially and specifically released in AD, but also in MDE patients. Thus, these miRNAs may mirror common neuropathological paths and by this serve to unscramble mechanisms of different neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2884902589,"Mercury and methylmercury were measured in seawater and biota collected from the outer Bay of Fundy to better document mercury bioaccumulation in a temperate marine food web. The size of an organism, together with δ13 C and δ15 N isotopes, were measured to interpret mercury levels in biota ranging in size from microplankton (25μm) to swordfish, dolphins and whales. Levels of mercury in seawater were no different with depth and not elevated relative to upstream sources. The δ13 C values of primary producers were found to be inadequate to specify the original energy source of various faunas, however, there was no reason to separate the food web into benthic, demersal and pelagic food chains because phytoplankton has been documented to almost exclusively fuel the ecosystem. The apparent abrupt increase in mercury content from “seawater” to phytoplankton, on a wet weight basis, can be explained from an environmental volume basis by the exponential increase in surface area of smaller particles included in “seawater” determinations. This physical sorption process may be important up to the macroplankton size category dominated by copepods according to the calculated biomagnification factors (BMF). The rapid increase in methylmercury concentration, relative to the total mercury, between the predominantly phytoplankton (<125μm) and the zooplankton categories is likely augmented by gut microbe methylation. Further up the food chain, trophic transfer of methylmercury dominates resulting in biomagnification factors greater than 10 in swordfish, Atlantic bluefin tuna, harbour porpoise, Atlantic white-sided dolphin and common thresher shark. The biomagnification power of the northern Gulf of Maine ecosystem is remarkably similar to that measured in tropical, subtropical, other temperate and arctic oceanic ecozones."
https://openalex.org/W2883805947,"Big data offer a great opportunity for nature-based recreation (NbR) mapping and evaluation. However, it is important to determine when and how it is appropriate to use this resource. We used Scotland as a case study to validate the use of data from Flickr as an indicator of NbR on a national scale and at several regional spatial and temporal resolutions. We compared Flickr photographs to visitor statistics in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and determined whether temporal variability in photo counts could be explained by known annual estimates of CNP visitor numbers. We then used a unique recent national survey of nature recreation in Scotland to determine whether the spatial distribution of Flickr photos could be explained by known spatial variability in nature use. Following this validation work, we used Flickr data to identify hotspots of wildlife watching in Scotland and investigated how they changed between 2005 and 2015. We found that spatial and temporal patterns in Flickr count are explained by measures of visitation obtained through surveys and that this relationship is reliable down to a 10 Km scale resolution. Our findings have implications for planning and management of NbR as they suggest that photographs uploaded on Flickr reflect patterns of NbR at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for ecosystem management."
https://openalex.org/W2884217504,"This study was designed to characterize morphologic stages during neuroma development post amputation with an eye toward developing better treatment strategies that intervene before neuromas are fully formed. Right forelimbs of 30 Sprague Dawley rats were amputated and limb stumps were collected at 3, 7, 28, 60 and 90 Days Post Amputation (DPA). Morphology of newly formed nerves and neuromas were assessed via general histology and neurofilament protein antibody staining. Analysis revealed six morphological characteristics during nerve and neuroma development; 1) normal nerve, 2) degenerating axons, 3) axonal sprouts, 4) unorganized bundles of axons, 5) unorganized axon growth into muscles, and 6) unorganized axon growth into fibrotic tissue (neuroma). At early stages (3 & 7 DPA) after amputation, normal nerves could be identified throughout the limb stump and small areas of axonal sprouts were present near the site of injury. Signs of degenerating axons were evident from 7 to 90 DPA. From day 28 on, variability of nerve characteristics with signs of unorganized axon growth into muscle and fibrotic tissue and neuroma formation became visible in multiple areas of stump tissue. These pathological features became more evident on days 60 and 90. At 90 DPA frank neuroma formation was present in all stump tissue. By following nerve regrowth and neuroma formation after amputation we were able to identify 6 separate histological stages of nerve regrowth and neuroma development. Axonal regrowth was observed as early as 3 DPA and signs of unorganized axonal growth and neuroma formation were evident by 28 DPA. Based on these observations we speculate that neuroma treatment and or prevention strategies might be more successful if targeted at the initial stages of development and not after 28 DPA."

https://openalex.org/W2883695687,"Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) gene family is one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, and members of this family play important roles in multiple biological processes such as light signaling, seed maturation, flower development as well as abiotic and biotic stress responses. Nonetheless, genome-wide comprehensive analysis of the bZIP family is lacking in the important oil crop sesame. In the present study, 63 bZIP genes distributed on 14 linkage groups were identified in sesame, and denominated as SibZIP01-SibZIP63. Besides, all members of SibZIP family were divided into nine groups based on the phylogenetic relationship of Arabidopsis bZIPs, which was further supported by the analysis of their conserved motifs and gene structures. Promoter analysis showed that all SibZIP genes harbor cis-elements related to stress responsiveness in their promoter regions. Expression analyses of SibZIP genes based on transcriptome data showed that these genes have different expression patterns in different tissues. Additionally, we showed that a majority of SibZIPs (85.71%) exhibited significant transcriptional changes in responses to abiotic stresses, including drought, waterlogging, osmotic, salt, and cold, suggesting that SibZIPs may play a cardinal role in the regulation of stress responses in sesame. Together, these results provide new insights into stress-responsive SibZIP genes and pave the way for future studies of SibZIPs-mediated abiotic stress response in sesame."
https://openalex.org/W2952729540,"Neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) involve complex data collection and analysis protocols, which necessitate the establishment of good research data management (RDM). Despite efforts within the field to address issues related to rigor and reproducibility, information about the RDM-related practices and perceptions of neuroimaging researchers remains largely anecdotal. To inform such efforts, we conducted an online survey of active MRI researchers that covered a range of RDM-related topics. Survey questions addressed the type(s) of data collected, tools used for data storage, organization, and analysis, and the degree to which practices are defined and standardized within a research group. Our results demonstrate that neuroimaging data is acquired in multifarious forms, transformed and analyzed using a wide variety of software tools, and that RDM practices and perceptions vary considerably both within and between research groups, with trainees reporting less consistency than faculty. Ratings of the maturity of RDM practices from ad-hoc to refined were relatively high during the data collection and analysis phases of a project and significantly lower during the data sharing phase. Perceptions of emerging practices including open access publishing and preregistration were largely positive, but demonstrated little adoption into current practice."
https://openalex.org/W2884881998,"Many medications including antibiotics taste bitter. The potency of these antibiotics on the 25 bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) in humans remains poorly understood. Here we characterize by sensory and structure-function analyses how antibiotics frequently used to treat airway infections in cystic fibrosis activate multiple human T2Rs. The potency of the broad-spectrum antibiotics, tobramycin, levofloxacin, and azithromycin on the highly expressed T2Rs in airways, T2R4, T2R14, and T2R20 was pursued. The amino acids and structural features of T2R4, T2R14, and T2R20 important for antibiotic binding were characterized by mutational analysis in heterologous cell-based assays. Strikingly, extracellular loop 2 in T2Rs performs a key function in binding to antibiotics with contribution from residues in transmembrane helices. Our results suggest that different antibiotics activate multiple T2Rs with different potencies. An understanding of the nonantibiotic and physiologic effects mediated through T2Rs on the host cells is much needed.-Jaggupilli, A., Singh, N., De Jesus, V. C., Gounni, M. S., Dhanaraj, P., Chelikani, P. Chemosensory bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are activated by multiple antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2883046597,"Previously, we showed that exposure of human normal and cancer cells to a 6 mT, 60 Hz gradient electromagnetic field (EMF) induced genotoxicity. Here, we investigated the cellular effects of a uniform EMF. Single or repetitive exposure to a 6 mT, 60 Hz uniform EMF neither induced DNA damage nor affected cell viability in HeLa and primary IMR-90 fibroblasts. However, continuous exposure of these cells to an EMF promoted cell proliferation. Cell viability increased 24.4% for HeLa and 15.2% for IMR-90 cells after a total 168 h exposure by subculture. This increase in cell proliferation was directly correlated with EMF strength and exposure time. When further incubated without EMF, cell proliferation slowed down to that of unexposed cells, suggesting that the proliferative effect is reversible. The expression of cell cycle markers increased in cells continuously exposed to an EMF as expected, but the distribution of cells in each stage of the cell cycle did not change. Notably, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels decreased and phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 increased in cells exposed to an EMF, suggesting that reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species play a role in increased proliferation. These results demonstrate that EMF uniformity at an extremely low frequency (ELF) is an important factor in the cellular effects of ELF-EMF."

The aim of this study is to provide a standardized and reproducible protocol for infrared oculography measurements of eye movements and analysis, which can be applied for various diseases in a multicenter setting.Development of a protocol to Demonstrate Eye Movement Networks with Saccades (DEMoNS) using infrared oculography. Automated analysis methods were used to calculate parameters describing the characteristics of the saccadic eye movements. The two measurements of the subjects were compared with descriptive and reproducibility statistics.Infrared oculography measurements of all subjects were performed using the DEMoNS protocol and various saccadic parameters were calculated automatically from 28 subjects. Saccadic parameters such as: peak velocity, latency and saccade pair ratios showed excellent reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients > 0.9). Parameters describing performance of more complex tasks showed moderate to good reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients 0.63-0.78).This study provides a standardized and transparent protocol for measuring and analyzing saccadic eye movements in a multicenter setting. The DEMoNS protocol details outcome measures for treatment trial which are of excellent reproducibility. The DEMoNS protocol can be applied to the study of saccadic eye movements in various neurodegenerative and motor diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2883396883,"Objectives Physical inactivity is a leading global risk to health by contributing to obesity and other chronic diseases. Many chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), can be prevented and controlled by modifying lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity [PA]. However, prevalence of insufficient physical activity and obesity is high in the Middle East Region. In Qatar, the incidence rates of CVDs, diabetes, colon, and breast cancer have been rising rapidly. The purpose of this study was to explore facilitators and barriers influencing PA of adult Arab men and women living in Qatar and to understand what they think would be helpful to increase PA. The goal of the research is to identify culturally appropriate and effective interventions that improve the health of Arab population. Design Using the socioecological model as the theoretical framework, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 128 Arab adult men and women living in Qatar. We utilized focus group interviews to collect the data and performed thematic analysis to generate themes. Results At the individual level, perceived benefits of PA, presence of diseases, person’s will, motivation and goals, and time to exercise influenced the individual’s PA. At the sociocultural level, religious teachings of Islam, cultural, attitude, beliefs, and practices, and informal support influenced the participants’ PA. At the organizational and political level, physical environment to exercise, accessibility of facilities, organizational support, and health information about PA influenced their PA. Conclusion Arab men and women are aware of the importance and benefits of PA. They have the motivation to be physically active, but in the absence of supportive environment, their knowledge might not translate into action. Creating supportive environments at multiple levels that are conducive to PA is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2883419158,"Dopamine (DA) is a key regulator of circuits controlling movement and motivation. A. subset of midbrain DA neurons has been shown to express the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)2, underlying their capacity for glutamate release. Glutamate release is found mainly by DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and can be detected at terminals contacting ventral, but not dorsal, striatal neurons, suggesting the possibility that target-derived signals regulate the neurotransmitter phenotype of DA neurons. Whether glutamate can be released from the same terminals that release DA or from a special subset of axon terminals is unclear. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo data supporting the hypothesis that DA and glutamate-releasing terminals in mice are mostly segregated and that striatal neurons regulate the cophenotype of midbrain DA neurons and the segregation of release sites. Our work unveils a fundamental feature of dual neurotransmission and plasticity of the DA system.—Fortin, G. M., Ducrot, C., Giguère, N., Kouwenhoven, W.

https://openalex.org/W2884148601,"There are very few articles in the literature describing continuous models of bacterial infections that mimic disease pathogenesis in humans and animals without using separate cohorts of animals at each stage of disease. In this work, we developed bioluminescent mouse models of partial-thickness scald wound infection and sepsis that mimic disease pathogenesis in humans and animals using a recombinant luciferase-expressing Staphylococcus aureus strain (Xen29). Two days post-scald wound infection, mice were treated twice daily with a 2% topical mupirocin ointment for 7 days. For sepsis experiments, mice were treated intraperitoneally with 6 mg/kg daptomycin 2 h and 6 h post-infection and time to moribund monitored for 72 h. Consistent bacterial burden data were obtained from individual mice by regular photon intensity quantification on a Xenogen IVIS Lumina XRMS Series III biophotonic imaging system, with concomitant significant reduction in photon intensities in drug-treated mice. Post-mortem histopathological examination of wounds and bacterial counts in blood correlated closely with disease severity and total flux obtained from Xen29. The bioluminescent murine models provide a refinement to existing techniques of multiple bacterial enumeration during disease pathogenesis and promote animal usage reduction. The models also provide an efficient and information-rich platform for preclinical efficacy evaluation of new drug classes for treating acute and chronic human and animal bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2883179762,"Non-invasive wearable biosensors provide real-time, continuous, and actionable health information. However, difficulties detecting diluted biomarkers in excreted biofluids limit practical applications. Most biomarkers of interest are transported paracellularly into excreted biofluids from biomarker-rich blood and interstitial fluid during normal modulation of cellular tight junctions. Calcium chelators are reversible tight junction modulators that have been shown to increase absorption across the intestinal epithelium. However, calcium chelators have not yet been shown to improve the extraction of biomarkers. Here we show that for glucose, a paracellularly transported biomarker, the flux into sweat can be increased by >10x using citrate, a calcium chelator, in combination with electroosmosis. Our results demonstrate a method of increasing glucose flux through the sweat gland epithelium, thereby increasing the concentration in sweat. Future work should examine if this method enhances flux for other paracellularly transported biomarkers to make it possible to detect more biomarkers with currently available biosensors."
https://openalex.org/W2884804736,"Pregnancy is accompanied by maternal physiological adaptations including metabolic, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, skeletomuscular and neurological modifications that facilitate fetal and placental growth and development. Emerging evidence suggests that the maternal intestinal microbiota is modified over the course of healthy pregnancy. We have recently identified a maternal intestinal microbial shift within hours of conception; a shift that continued with advancing gestation. It is possible that maternal gut bacterial profiles might be associated with the known endocrine changes that accompany the female reproductive (estrous) cycle.To determine whether the estrous cycle influenced the shifts in the maternal intestinal microbiota, time-matched fecal pellets were collected daily for 3 consecutive estrous cycles from individually housed, non-pregnant female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10) fed a control diet. Estrous stage was identified by cell type predominance in vaginal cytological samples. The corresponding fecal pellets for each estrous stage were processed for bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing of the variable 3 (V3) region.Estrous cycle stage accounted for a very small and not statistically significant proportion of the variation in the fecal microbiota according to PERMANOVA testing performed on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity scores. These values displayed no significant clustering of fecal microbial communities by estrous stage.The estrous cycle does not result in any significant shift in the intestinal microbial community in the reproductively mature, regularly cycling female mouse."
https://openalex.org/W2884537054,"Background and aims Expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), an enzyme expressed in response to hypoxia, acidosis and oncogenic alterations, is reported to be a prognostic factor in HCC patients. Here we evaluated serum CA9 levels in HCC and cirrhosis patients. Methods HCC and cirrhosis patients were prospectively recruited and CA9 levels were determined. CA9 levels were compared to stages of cirrhosis and HCC stages. The association of the CA9 levels and overall survival (OS) was assessed. Furthermore, immunohistochemical CA9 expression in HCC and cirrhosis was evaluated. Results 215 patients with HCC were included. The median serum CA9 concentration in patients with HCC was 370 pg/ml and significantly higher than in a healthy cohort. Patients with advanced cancer stages (BCLC and ALBI score) had hid significant higher levels of CA9 in the serum. HCC patients with high serum CA9 concentrations (>400 pg/ml) had an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) 1.690, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.017–2.809, P = 0.043). Serum CA9 concentration in cirrhotic patients did not differ significantly from HCC patients. Higher CA9 levels in cirrhotic patients correlated with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. Patients with ethanol induced cirrhosis had the highest CA9 levels in both cohorts. Levels of CA9 did not correlate with immunohistochemical expression. Conclusions We conclude that a high CA9 level is a possible prognostic indicator for a poor outcome in HCC patients. The high CA9 levels are probably mainly associated with portal hypertension. Ductular reactions might be a possible source of serum CA9."
https://openalex.org/W2952679296,"Sustainability is a key concept in economic and policy debates. Nevertheless, it is usually treated only in a qualitative way and has eluded quantitative analysis. Here, we propose a sustainability index based on the premise that sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher Information over time. We test this approach using time series data from the AmeriFlux network that measures ecosystem respiration, water and energy fluxes in order to elucidate two key sustainability features: ecosystem health and stability. A novel definition of ecosystem health is developed based on the concept of criticality, which implies that if a system’s fluctuations are scale invariant then the system is in a balance between robustness and adaptability. We define ecosystem stability by taking an information theory approach that measures its entropy and Fisher information. Analysis of the Ameriflux consortium big data set of ecosystem respiration time series is contrasted with land condition data. In general we find a good agreement between the sustainability index and land condition data. However, we acknowledge that the results are a preliminary test of the approach and further verification will require a multi-signal analysis. For example, high values of the sustainability index for some croplands are counter-intuitive and we interpret these results as ecosystems maintained in artificial health due to continuous human-induced inflows of matter and energy in the form of soil nutrients and control of competition, pests and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2884142074,"Central venous catheter (CVC) placement is a standard procedure in critical care. Ultrasound guidance during placement is recommended by current guidelines, but there is no consensus on the best method for evaluating the correct CVC tip position. Recently, the ""rapid atrial swirl sign"" (RASS) has been investigated in a limited number of studies.We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of focused echocardiography for the evaluation of CVC tip position in our medical ICU and IMC units.We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study in 100 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and Intermediate Care Unit at our center. The first 10 subjects were assessed by one staff physician investigator (reference cohort), the remaining 90 patients by different residents (test cohort). All patients received a post-procedural chest radiograph (CXR) as gold standard. CVC placement was assessed with focused echocardiography performed by residents after a short training session. A rapid opacification of the right atrium (RASS) after injection of 10 mL of normal saline was regarded as ""positive"", flush after more than two seconds was defined as ""delayed"", no flush was a ""negative"" test result.Overall sensitivity of the RASS was 100% (95% CI 73.54-100%), specificity was 94.32% (CI 87.24-98.13%). Positive and negative predictive values were 70.59% (CI 44.04-89.09%) and 100% (CI 95.65-100%), respectively. Median time for echocardiographic testing was 5 minutes (1-28) in the whole cohort, CXRs were available after 49.5 minutes (13-254). Interrater agreement of the RASS was 0.77 (Cohen's kappa), Measurement of CVC tip position was not different between two observers. Test characteristics were similar among differently experienced residents.Presence of the RASS by focused echocardiography showed excellent sensitivity and specificity and was equally performed by residents after minimal training. In patients with a positive RASS, routine CXR can be safely omitted, reducing time, costs and radiation exposure. A negative RASS should lead to a search for misplaced catheters.The study was registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02661607)."
https://openalex.org/W2884289401,"Cognitive processes differ markedly between children from different cultures, with best evidence for attention to visual scenes and the activities of others. Children from urban Western cultures tend to focus on focal objects, whereas children from urban East-Asian cultures rather attend to contextual elements of a visual scene. Regarding the attention to others' activities, children from subsistence-based farming communities often observe several activities simultaneously, while children from urban Western contexts focus on activities sequentially. Here we assessed 144 5-year-old children from three prototypical cultural contexts (urban Germany, rural Cameroon, urban Japan) to investigate variations in attention across a variety of tasks. Attention to the elements of a visual scene was assessed in an optical illusion task, in picture descriptions and an eye-tracking paradigm. Attention to and learning from others' activities was assessed in a parallel action task and a rule-based game. Some tasks indicated higher context-sensitive attention in urban Japan, while other findings indicated higher context-sensitive attention in urban Germany. Levels of parallel attention and learning from others' activities were lower in rural Cameroonian children compared to the urban samples. Across tasks, the visual attention measures were unrelated. These findings substantiate that culture has a profound influence on early cognitive development, already in the preschool years. Furthermore, they raise critical questions about the early origins of cultural specificities in attention and the generalizability of attention phenomena beyond specific tasks and populations."
https://openalex.org/W2884445228,"In recent decades, vaccination has substantially reduced the number of measles cases to levels close to the elimination stage. However, major measles outbreaks occurred in Europe during 2010–2012, after the introduction of the D4-Enfield lineage. We have performed a molecular characterization of 75 measles virus genotype D4 strains from patients infected in Spain between 2004 and 2012 by sequencing the N-450 region and the M-F non-coding region (M-F NCR) in order to identify genetic features of these viruses. The analysis of the N-450 region confirmed that all samples obtained since 2008 belonged to variants or sets of identical sequences of the D4-Enfield lineage, including a new one named MVs/Madrid.ESP/46.10/. Analysis of the M-F NCR showed insertions and deletions associated with previously described, uncommon non-standard genome length measles viruses. This genetic feature was identified in the D4-Enfield lineage viruses, but not in the other D4 viruses that were circulating in Spain before 2008, suggesting that these non-standard length M-F NCR sequences are characteristic of the D4-Enfield lineage. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of Spanish M-F NCRs suggest higher resolution in discriminating strains than did the N-450 analysis. In addition, the results of the analysis of the M-F NCR on the MVs/Madrid.ESP/46.10/ sub-lineage seem to support the potential utility of this region as a tool for epidemiological surveillance complementary to the N-450 region, as previously suggested. Further investigation on this question, as well as the surveillance of new potentially emerging strains with non-standard length M-F NCR are strongly recommended as part of future strategies for measles elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2884970528,"In this study we apply two methods for data collection that are relatively new in the field of atmospheric science. The two developed methods are designed to collect essential geo-localized information to be used as input data for a high resolution emission inventory for residential wood combustion (RWC). The first method is a webcrawler that extracts openly online available real estate data in a systematic way, and thereafter structures them for analysis. The webcrawler reads online Norwegian real estate advertisements and it collects the geo-position of the dwellings. Dwellings are classified according to the type (e.g., apartment, detached house) they belong to and the heating systems they are equipped with. The second method is a model trained for image recognition and classification based on machine learning techniques. The images from the real estate advertisements are collected and processed to identify wood burning installations, which are automatically classified according to the three classes used in official statistics, i.e., open fireplaces, stoves produced before 1998 and stoves produced after 1998. The model recognizes and classifies the wood appliances with a precision of 81%, 85% and 91% for open fireplaces, old stoves and new stoves, respectively. Emission factors are heavily dependent on technology and this information is therefore essential for determining accurate emissions. The collected data are compared with existing information from the statistical register at county and national level in Norway. The comparison shows good agreement for the proportion of residential heating systems between the webcrawled data and the official statistics. The high resolution and level of detail of the extracted data show the value of open data to improve emission inventories. With the increased amount and availability of data, the techniques presented here add significant value to emission accuracy and potential applications should also be considered across all emission sectors."
https://openalex.org/W2884970764,"Poliovirus (PV) environmental surveillance (ES) plays an important role in the global eradication program and is crucial for monitoring silent PV circulation especially as clinical cases decrease. This study compared ES results using the novel bag-mediated filtration system (BMFS) with the current two-phase separation method. From February to November 2016, BMFS and two-phase samples were collected concurrently from twelve sites in Pakistan (n = 117). Detection was higher in BMFS than two-phase samples for each Sabin-like (SL) PV serotype (p<0.001) and wild PV type 1 (WPV1) (p = 0.065). Seventeen sampling events were positive for WPV1, with eight discordant in favor of BMFS and two in favor of two-phase. A vaccine-derived PV type 2 was detected in one BMFS sample but not the matched two-phase. After the removal of SL PV type 2 (SL2) from the oral polio vaccine in April 2016, BMFS samples detected SL2 more frequently than two-phase (p = 0.016), with the last detection by either method occurring June 12, 2016. More frequent PV detection in BMFS compared to two-phase samples is likely due to the greater effective volume assayed (1620 mL vs. 150 mL). This study demonstrated that the BMFS achieves enhanced ES for all PV serotypes in an endemic country."
https://openalex.org/W2883121984,"Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) photoreceptors consist of conserved photo-responsive domains in bacteria, archaea, plants and fungi, and detect blue-light via a flavin cofactor. We investigated the blue-light induced conformational transition of the dimeric photoreceptor PpSB1-LOV-R66I from Pseudomonas putida in solution by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). SAXS experiments of the fully populated light- and dark-states under steady-state conditions revealed significant structural differences between the two states that are in agreement with the known structures determined by crystallography. We followed the transition from the light- to the dark-state by using SAXS measurements in real-time. A two-state model based on the light- and dark-state conformations could describe the measured time-course SAXS data with a relaxation time τREC of ~ 34 to 35 min being larger than the recovery time found with UV/vis spectroscopy. Unlike the flavin chromophore-based UV/vis method that is sensitive to the local chromophore environment in flavoproteins, SAXS-based assay depends on protein conformational changes and provides with an alternative to measure the recovery kinetics."

RR specimens were further analyzed in the DRplus and DRsl tests. We identified 1 extensively drug-resistant (XDR), 8 pre-XDR, 18 simple multidrug-resistant (MDR), 22 mono-RR, and 2 RR cases with concurrent second-line injection DR-TB. Of these, 25 (49%) were relapses, 13 (25.5%) were treatment failures, 10 (19.6%) were from MDR-TB high-incidence areas/countries, 1 was from MDR-TB contact and 2 were unknown. Among culture-positive TB cases, the sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values (PPVs) of the Xpert test and RR cases were 73.6% and 100.0%, 85.7% and 98.6%, and 73.5% and 80.0%, respectively. Gene sequencing of discordant results revealed 7 disputed rpoB mutations and 2 silent mutations for RIF, 1 ahpC mutation for isoniazid and 1 gyrA mutation for fluoroquinolone. The algorithm effectively identified approximately 23% of annual MDR-/XDR-TB and 37.5% of RR-TB cases that were enrolled in our DR-TB treatment and management program within 3 days."
https://openalex.org/W2884115324,"Aim Evaluate response and predict prognosis of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer treated with first line systemic therapy using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria and PET Response Criteria in solid Tumours (PERCIST). Methods From December 2006 to August 2013, 57 women with newly diagnosed metastatic breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated. FDG-PET/CT was performed within one month before treatment and repeated after at least 3 cycles of treatment. Metabolic response evaluation was evaluated by two readers according to both EORTC criteria and PERCIST, classifying the patients into 4 response groups: complete metabolic response (CMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), stable metabolic disease (SMD), and progressive metabolic disease (PMD). Results With EORTC criteria, 22 patients had CMR, 17 PMR, 6 SMD and 12 PMD. With PERCIST, 20 patients had CMR, 15 PMR, 10 SMD and 12 PMD. There was agreement between EORTC and PERCIST in 84% of the patients. By log-rank analysis, metabolic response evaluated with both EORTC criteria and PERCIST was able to predict overall survival (p = 0.028 and 0.002 respectively). CMR patient group had longer median OS than patients in the combined PMR+SMD+PMD group (60 vs 26 months both with EORTC and PERCIST; p = 0.009 and 0.006 respectively). By multivariate analysis, CMR either with EORTC or PERCIST remained an independent predictor of survival. Conclusion Metabolic response evaluation with EORTC criteria and PERCIST gave similar prognostic stratification for metastatic breast cancer treated with a first line of systemic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2884221274,"The aim of this study was to examine the impacts on blood lactate concentration, measured heart rate and assessment of perceived exertion during split sessions of equal relative load, as also their relationship to the specific sport practised. Nineteen regional-level athletes (nine middle and long-distance runners (cyclic group) and ten field-sport team players (acyclic group)) performed four high-intensity interval training (HIIT) sessions with work-interval durations of 10 s, 50 s, 90 s and 130 s. The sessions were carried out at their usual training sites with a separation of at least 48 hours. Blood lactate concentration was measured at rest and 3 min after the completion of each protocol. Heart rate was measured continuously during all sessions with a sampling rate of 1 s, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was requested at the end of the trial. The results showed an increase in blood lactate concentration, peak heart rate and rating of perceived exertion during long protocols as compared with short ones. No differences were observed in dependent variables between cyclic and acyclic groups. Significant but moderate correlations were observed between post-exercise blood lactate concentration, peak heart rate and RPE."
https://openalex.org/W2884377697,"Annual estimates of CO2 and dissolved carbon concentrations in the soil profile provide valuable insight into the dynamics of organic matter in soil and the effect of changes to vegetation cover. The aim of this study was to observe the spatial influence of litter decomposition in the first few centimeters of the soil for CO2 fluxes and to describe the processing of soil organic matter throughout the soil profile by comparing three small tropical watersheds. Data were collected biweekly for six months, from December 2015 to May 2016. CO2 was measured using an infrared gas analyzer in fixed chambers and the dissolved carbon of soil solution was analyzed in a TOC analyzer. No differences were found in the total soil CO2 fluxes (control flux treatments) between the three study areas. In both cacao agroforestry systems (managed and unmanaged), total CO2 fluxes were influenced by the decomposition of litter. CO2 emissions in the soil profile of the cacao agroforestry systems were highly variable, compared to the preserved forest, and highly dependent on the soil characteristics attributed to the type of vegetation cover. Although a definite pattern between the temperature and soil moisture was not identified, these parameters showed a strong relationship in controlling the release of CO2 between treatments. The organic and inorganic dissolved carbon patterns in the soil solution of the three areas revealed different responses of soil organic matter processing related to soil characteristics and vegetation. The results confirm the hypothesis that the top of soils (total CO2 fluxes) of both cacao agroforestry systems (managed and unmanaged) emits fluxes of CO2, which do not differ statistically from the preserved forest. However, depending on the soil characteristics, the cacao agroforestry system can result in an accumulation of CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon in the soil profile that is prone to being transported by hydrological routes to groundwater and stream water."
https://openalex.org/W2804762309,"Previous studies, which examined whether symbolic and non-symbolic quantity representations are processed by two independent systems or by one common system, reached contradicting findings, possibly due to methodological differences. Indeed, some researchers advocate the two systems approach, based on the presence of notation-specific switch cost in conditions where adults have to compare pairs of symbolic and non-symbolic quantities, in combination with the absence of such a cost in conditions containing quantities of the same notation. However, other researchers used matching instructions, and reported a facilitation in the mixed notation conditions, suggesting that the two systems are automatically integrated. In the current study, we conducted three experiments, in which we examined the existence of two separate quantity systems, but we used various experimental manipulations (e.g., task instructions, presentation order) to unravel the previous inconsistent findings. In Experiment 1, we investigated the role of task instructions by presenting participants with pure and mixed notation trials with both comparison and matching tasks. In Experiment 2, we tested the role of blocked and randomized presentation order for the pure and mixed trials. Our data showed that cost for switching between the symbolic and non-symbolic quantities is present, but is prone to a certain methodological drawback: when the differences between the processing times for two sequentially presented stimuli of different notations are not taken into account, this masks the cost for switching between the two systems. To overcome this problem, in Experiment 3 we used an audio-visual paradigm. Overall, our results provide further evidence for the existence of distinct quantity representations, independently of task instructions or presentation order. Additionally, considering this methodological pitfall we argue that the audio-visual paradigm is better suited when investigating the integration between symbolic and non- symbolic quantities."
https://openalex.org/W2883821392,"Background The aim of the study was to analyse the presence of several metabolites related to atherosclerosis in the plasma of patients with unstable carotid plaque and in the plasma of healthy subjects. Materials and methods We included 20 patients who had undergone carotid endarterectomy and 20 healthy subjects as a control group. All the subjects recruited were male. We used a metabolomic approach with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to evaluate plasma metabolite levels in the metabolic pathway involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. Results We observed that circulating levels of 20-HETE were significantly higher in patients with atheroma plaque than in healthy subjects (p = 0.018). No differences were found with regard to the other metabolites analysed. We also conducted a random forest analysis and found that 20-HETE was the main differentiator in the list of selected metabolites. In addition, plasma levels of 20-HETE correlated positively with body mass index (r = 0.427, p = 0.007) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.365, p = 0.028). Conclusion This study confirms that of all the molecules studied only 20-HETE is related to carotid plaque. Further studies are needed to compare patients with stable carotid plaque vs. patients with unstable carotid plaque in order to confirm that 20-HETE could be a potential factor related to carotid plaque."
https://openalex.org/W2884138372,"Preferential processing of self-related information is a well-documented phenomenon on both the behavioral and neural levels. However, the impact of self-esteem on this self-preference has not been studied in a systematic way. Here, the electrophysiological correlates of explicit self-reflection were investigated in individuals with low (LSE) and high self-esteem (HSE). Participants evaluated trait adjectives in reference to the self or to an ""other"" person (close-other, famous) while EEG was recorded. The analysis of event-related potentials focused on the late positive component (LPC), which exhibits a fronto-central distribution and latency over 500 ms. In both LSE and HSE groups, the amplitudes of LPC were enhanced in the self condition when compared to control conditions (both close-other and famous). Crucially, LPC amplitudes in the HSE group were significantly higher than in the LSE group. Moreover, the self-preference effect, defined as the difference between amplitudes of LPC associated with the evaluation of words in relation to oneself vs. other people, was significantly higher in the HSE group than in the LSE group. Overall, our findings indicate that people with high self-esteem tend to engage in self-referential processing to a higher extent."
https://openalex.org/W2884944234,"Background HBV infection affects about 257 million people globally and Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest burden. The disease still constitutes a major public health problem despite the advent of preventive measures like the HBV vaccine. This study was aimed at identifying factors that influence vaccine uptake and the efficacy of administered vaccines among people at high risk of HBV infection. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January 2016 and December 2017. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used to capture information on sociodemographic and vaccination status from healthcare workers, household and sexual contacts to HBV infected people. HBV serological panel as well as quantitative anti-HBs ELISA test was done for all participants. Additional information was obtained from the institutions that administered the vaccines. Results A total of 265 participants with a mean age of 32.1±8.7 were enrolled. Eighty (30.2%) of them had received at least 1 dose of the HBV vaccine while 185 (69.8%) were unvaccinated. Healthcare workers were the most vaccinated (37%). Ignorance, negligence, fear of injection and the cost of the vaccine all contributed to poor vaccine uptake in the study population. Natural immunity was seen in 9 (3.4%) of the participants. Only 64.9% of the vaccinated participants attained the desirable level of anti-HBs (≥10mIU/ml) 1–2 months after ≥ 3 doses of the vaccine. Age, gender, obesity, alcohol and smoking were not significantly associated with poor immune responses. No standardized protocol was followed by the institutions administering the vaccine. Conclusion This study revealed very poor vaccine uptake and poor immune responses to the HBV vaccine in the study population and this should urge the health sector in Cameroon to intensify their sensitization on HBV vaccine, standardize the protocol for storing and administering the vaccine, subsidize the cost of the vaccine especially amongst healthcare workers and encourage anti-HBs post vaccination testing."
https://openalex.org/W2884116248,"The brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery is of great socio-economic importance to coastal communities on the North Sea. The fishery is exploited by beam trawlers often using codends with very small mesh sizes, leading to concerns about catch rates of undersized shrimp. However, little information is available on codend size selection, making it difficult to provide scientifically based advice on alternative codend designs. Therefore, this study establishes a predictive framework for codend size selection of brown shrimp, based on a large selectivity dataset from 33 different codend designs tested during four experimental fishing cruises, during which more than 350,000 brown shrimp were length measured. Predictions by the framework confirm concerns about the exploitation pattern in the fishery, because the retention probability of undersized shrimp reaches 95% with the currently applied designs. The framework predictions allow the exploration of obtainable exploitation patterns depending on codend design. For example, increasing codend mesh size to 25–29 mm would reduce the retention rate of undersized shrimp to a maximum of 50%, depending on codend mesh type."
https://openalex.org/W2884328521,"The prevalence of hepatitis B and C virus infections may be higher in vulnerable populations or in individuals likely to be exposed through risk behaviors such as female garment factory workers in Lao People’s Democratic Republic. A cross-sectional study was performed on 400 female garment workers in Vientiane Capital. Women were tested for hepatitis B virus surface antigen and antibodies against hepatitis B core, surface antigen and hepatitis C virus using commercial Enzyme-linked immuno-absorbent assays. Participants completed a standardized questionnaire about potential risk factors for both infections. Sixteen women (4±1.9%) were HBsAg carriers, 187 (47%) had anti-HBc, 116 (29%) anti-HBs and 7 (1.8±1.3%) anti-HCV antibodies. Three factors were significantly associated with the presence of anti-HBc (indicating previous exposure to HBV): (i) residence in dormitories, (ii) more than one sexual partner, (iii) history of abortion. Despite a high risk of exposure, the prevalence of anti HBV and anti HCV infection markers in this sample of female workers was not higher than in the Lao general population. Our data suggest that exposure to HBV happens later during life and was significantly associated with sexual risk behavior. Thus, this study highlights the vulnerability of these women who were mostly young, uneducated, unvaccinated, of rural origin and were not aware of the risk of infections. An occupational health program targeting the female factory workers should be implemented in Lao PDR."
https://openalex.org/W2883273726,"To prevent renal graft thrombosis in kidney transplantation, centres use different perioperative anticoagulant strategies, based on various risk factors. In our centre, patients transplanted preemptively are considered at increased risk of renal graft thrombosis compared to patients who are dialysis-dependent at time of transplantation. Therefore these patients are given a single dose of 5000 IU unfractionated heparin intraoperatively before clamping of the vessels. We questioned whether there is a difference in haemostatic state between preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients and whether the distinction in intraoperative heparin administration used in our center is justified. For this analysis, citrate samples of patients participating in the VAPOR-1 trial were used and several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured in 29 preemptively and 28 non-preemptively transplanted patients and compared to 37 living kidney donors. Sample points were: induction anaesthesia (T1), 5 minutes after reperfusion (T2) and 2 hours postoperative (T3). At T1, recipient groups showed comparable elevated levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4, indicating platelet activation), prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer (indicating coagulation activation) and Von Willebrand Factor (indicating endothelial activation) compared to the donors. The Clot Lysis Time (CLT, a measure of fibrinolytic potential) was prolonged in both recipient groups compared to the donors. At T3, F1+2, PF4 and CLT were higher in non-preemptively transplanted recipients compared to preemptively transplanted recipients. Compared to donors, non-preemptive recipients showed a prolonged CLT, but comparable levels of PF4 and D-dimer. In conclusion pre-transplantation, preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients show a comparable enhanced haemostatic state. A distinction in intraoperative heparin administration between preemptive and non-preemptive transplantation does not seem justified."
https://openalex.org/W2883902874,"This study aims to use the conceptual framework of social determinants of health (SDH) to elucidate the social determinants that affect the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) from the perspectives of both intermediary and structural determinants. Data were derived from a survey mailed to 1,500 randomly selected residents (20–69 years old; May–July 2009) of Sendai city in Japan. A generalized linear model was used in the analysis, with CAM use over the past one month as the dependent variable, SDH structural and intermediary determinants as independent variables, and demographic characteristics, indicators of health status, and the evaluation of health or healthcare systems as control variables. The prevalence of CAM usage was 62.1%. The generalized linear model showed that middle subjective social status (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.04–2.07) as structural determinants was significantly associated with CAM usage. Adding the intermediary determinants, the same effect was observed. When demographic characteristics, indicators of health status, and the evaluation of health or healthcare systems were introduced as control variables, the associations of the structural determinants disappeared, revealing that hope (OR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.04–1.50) as intermediary determinants was associated with the use of CAM. Female sex (OR = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.02–2.12) and health anxiety (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.20–2.34) were associated with CAM usage. We found that intermediary rather than structural determinants were associated with CAM usage. Hope as an intermediary determinant was particularly associated with CAM usage."
https://openalex.org/W2883920682,"Genetic encoded multilabeling is essential for modern cell biology. In fluorescence microscopy this need has been satisfied by the development of numerous color-variants of the green fluorescent protein. In electron microscopy, however, true genetic encoded multilabeling is currently not possible. Here, we introduce combinatorial cell organelle type-specific labeling as a strategy for multilabeling. First, we created a reliable and high sensitive label by evolving the catalytic activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). We then built fusion proteins that targeted our new enhanced HRP (eHRP) to three cell organelles whose labeling pattern did not overlap with each other. The labeling of the endoplasmic reticulum, synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane consequently allowed for triple labeling in the EM. The combinatorial expression of the three organelle-specific constructs increased the number of clearly distinguishable labels to seven. This strategy of multilabeling for EM closes a significant gap in our tool set and has a broad application range in cell biology."
https://openalex.org/W2884284255,"Background Maternal nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding is important for the healthy growth and development of the fetus and infant. Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of a maternal milk supplementation (MMS) in conjunction with a breastfeeding support program on breastfeeding practices including duration of any breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding and child neurodevelopment outcomes at 30 months old. Methods We followed up the offspring of 204 Vietnamese women who completed a randomized controlled trial where the intervention group received MMS with a breastfeeding support program from the last trimester to 12 weeks postpartum while the control group received standard care. At 30 months postpartum, information on child feeding practices was collected and child neurodevelopment was assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III). Results There was no significant difference in the duration of any breastfeeding (ABF) from birth between the groups. However, the intervention group had longer exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) duration (p = 0.0172), higher EBF rate at 6 months (p = 0.0093) and lower risk of discontinuing EBF (p = 0.0071) than the control. Children in the intervention group had significantly higher Bayley-III composite scores in the domains of cognitive (p = 0.0498) and motor (p = 0.0422) functions, as well as a tendency toward better social-emotional behavior (p = 0.0513) than children in the control group. The association between maternal intervention and child development was attenuated after further adjustment for birth weight but not EBF duration, suggesting that improvements in child development may be partially attributed to the benefits of prenatal nutrition supplementation on birth outcomes. Conclusions MMS with breastfeeding support during late pregnancy and early postpartum significantly improved EBF practices. The intervention was also associated with improvements in neurodevelopment in children at 30 months old."

Participants completed the general socio-demographic and behavioral questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the SF-36 questionnaire for HRQoL assessment. Data on lifetime illicit drug use were self-reported.As much as 16.0% of students reported ever illicit drug use. The most frequently used drugs were marijuana (9.3%) and bromazepam (7.6%). Factors associated with ever illicit drug use were: being smoker and alcohol user, having chronic diseases and having higher depressive symptoms score. Ever illicit drug users reported all domains of HRQoL as worse.These results could serve as a tool for implementation of preventive strategies and University policies to promote healthy lifestyles and behaviors. Measurement of HRQoL could also be used as indicator of the effect of interventions designed to reduce and/or prevent illicit drug use at institutions of higher education."
https://openalex.org/W2883107381,"The present study was designed to investigate the pathways involved in the effect of betel nut arecoline on cell viability in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Arecoline, but not arecaidine or guvacine, inhibited preadipocyte viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Arecoline arrested preadipocyte growth in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle; decreased the total levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), p21, and p27 proteins; increased p53 and cyclin B1 protein levels; and had no effect on CDK2 protein levels. These results suggested that arecoline selectively affected a particular CDK subfamily. Arecoline inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity; conversely, the AMPK activator, AICAR, blocked the arecoline-induced inhibition of cell viability. Pre-treatment with the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, prevented the actions of arecoline on cell viability, G2/M growth arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the levels of CDK1, p21, p27, p53, cyclin B1, and phospho-AMPK proteins. These AMPK- and ROS-dependent effects of arecoline on preadipocyte growth may be related to the mechanism underlying the modulatory effect of arecoline on body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2884986451,"The golden ratio, ϕ = 1.61803…, has often been found in connection with biological phenomena, ranging from spirals in sunflowers to gene frequency. One example where the golden ratio often arises is in self-replication, having its mathematical origins in Fibonacci's sequence for ""rabbit reproduction"". Recently, it has been claimed that ϕ determines the ratio between the number of different nucleobases in human genome. Such empirical examples continue to give credence to the idea that the golden ratio is a universal constant, not only in mathematics but also for biology. In this paper, we employ a general framework for chemically realistic self-replicating reaction systems and investigate whether the ratio of chemical species population follows ""universal constants"". We find that many self-replicating systems can be characterised by an algebraic number, which, in some cases, is the golden ratio. However, many other algebraic numbers arise from these systems, and some of them-such as [Formula: see text] and 1.22074… which is also known as the 3rd lower golden ratio-arise more frequently in self-replicating systems than the golden ratio. The ""universal constants"" in these systems arise as roots of a limited number of distinct characteristic equations. In addition, these ""universal constants"" are transient behaviours of self-replicating systems, corresponding to the scenario that the resource inside the system is infinite, which is not always the case in practice. Therefore, we argue that the golden ratio should not be considered as a special universal constant in self-replicating systems, and that the ratios between different chemical species only go to certain numbers under some idealised scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2884421089,"The reproductive biology of three yellow catfish congeners was studied in the Three Gorges Reservoir of the Yangtze River, China. We compared reproductive traits among the lentic, transitional, and lotic zones. A total of 4502 individuals of the three species was collected, and the sex ratio, size at 50% maturity, spawning season, fecundity, and egg size were determined. Results showed that populations inhabiting the lotic zone spawned earlier than those inhabiting the lentic zone. For the three species, fecundities were significantly higher for populations in the lotic zone than for those in the lentic and transitional zones (P < 0.05). Pelteobagrus vachelli (Richardson) and P. fulvidraco (Richardson) displayed an obvious trade-off between egg size and fecundity, whereas P. nitidus (Sauvage et Dabry) produced the largest eggs in the lotic zone. Sex ratios were significantly different among zones (P < 0.05, for each species), but the bias patterns were different. Sizes at 50% maturity of female P. nitidus and P. vachelli were the largest in the lotic zone and the smallest in the transitional zone, but was similar among zones for P. fulvidraco. Overall results suggest that the three yellow catfish species developed different reproductive traits among the three habitats in the TGR, whereas the variations reflected further interspecific differences. Our study indicates the importance of riverine habitats for the conservation of species of fish, even for species such as these eurytopic catfish inhabiting the upper reach of the Yangtze River. This study further suggests that species-specific responses should be considered when evaluating the influences of new hydropower projects, even for such closely related species of fish."
https://openalex.org/W2884906064,"Rationale Advances in image-guided drug delivery for liver cancer have shown a significant survival benefit. However, incomplete treatment is common and residual disease is often found in explanted liver specimens. In addition, the need to treat a malignancy from multiple mechanisms at the same time for optimal outcomes is becoming more widely appreciated. To address this, we hypothesized that an exothermic chemical reaction could be performed in situ. Such a strategy could in principle combine several angles of attack, including ischemia, hyperthermia, acidic protein denaturation, and metabolic modulation of the local environment. Methods The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved this study. Outbred swine (25–35 kg, 5 control and 5 experimental) were treated under general anesthesia. Embolization was performed with coaxial microcatheter technique in a segmental hepatic arterial branch using either ethiodized oil as control or with thermoembolic solutionBlood samples were obtained before, immediately after, and the day following the procedure just before CT scans and euthanasia. Livers were explanted and samples were obtained for histologic analysis. Results All animals survived the procedure and laboratory values of the control and experimental groups remained within normal limits. The control group had a diffuse or cloudy pattern of attenuation on follow-up CT scan the day after, consistent with gradual antegrade sinusoidal transit of the embolic material. The experimental group had clearly defined vascular casts with some degree of peripheral involvement. At histology, the control group samples had the appearance of normal liver, whereas the experimental group had coagulative necrosis in small pale, punctate areas extending several hundred microns away from the treated vessels and a brisk inflammatory response just outside the margins. Conclusion In situ chemistry via thermoembolization shows early promise as a fundamentally new tactic for image-guided therapy of solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2884990319,"Identifying individuals who are influential in diffusing information, ideas or products in a population remains a challenging problem. Most extant work can be abstracted by a process in which researchers first decide which features describe an influencer and then identify them as the individuals with the highest values of these features. This makes the identification dependent on the relevance of the selected features and it still remains uncertain if triggering the identified influencers leads to a behavioral change in others. Furthermore, most work was developed for cross-sectional or time-aggregated datasets, where the time-evolution of influence processes cannot be observed. We show that mapping the influencer identification to a wisdom of crowds problem overcomes these limitations. We present a framework in which the individuals in a social group repeatedly evaluate the contribution of other members according to what they perceive as valuable and not according to predefined features. We propose a method to aggregate the behavioral reactions of the members of the social group into a collective judgment that considers the temporal variation of influence processes. Using data from three large news providers, we show that the members of the group surprisingly agree on who are the influential individuals. The aggregation method addresses different sources of heterogeneity encountered in social systems and leads to results that are easily interpretable and comparable within and across systems. The approach we propose is computationally scalable and can be applied to any social systems where behavioral reactions are observable."

First, we investigated the relationship between CD161+CD4+ T and Th17 cells by flow cytometry and microarray analysis in an in vitro study. Second, we compared the proportion of T cell subsets including CD161+CD4+ T cells in cAMR (n = 18), long-term graft survival (LTGS) (n = 46), and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) (n = 22). We compared CD161+ cell infiltration between cAMR and IF/TA and also examined the effect of CD161+ T cells on human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEpiC). In flow cytometry, the proportion of CD161+CD4+ T cells showed a significant correlation with the proportion of Th17 cells. In microarray analysis, transcripts associated with the Th17 pathway such as IL18RAP, IL-18R1, IL23R, IL12RB2, RORC, TBX21, and EOMES were upregulated in CD161+ cells compared with CD161- cells. In an ex vivo study, only CD161+CD4+ T cells showed a significant increase in the cAMR group compared with IF/TA and LTGS groups. In allograft tissue, CD161+ cells showed a higher level of infiltration in the cAMR group than the IF/TA group. Lastly, CD161+ T cells increased the production of inflammatory cytokines from HRPTEpiC in a dose-dependent manner. This study suggests that monitoring of CD161+ T cells can be useful to detect the progression of cAMR."
https://openalex.org/W2581158898,"RstB/RstA is an uncharacterized Escherichia coli two-component system, the regulatory effects of which on the E. coli cell cycle remain unclear. We found that the doubling time and average number of replication origins per cell in an ΔrstB mutant were the same as the wild-type, and the average number of replication origins in an ΔrstA mutant was 18.2% lower than in wild-type cells. The doubling times were 34 min, 35 min, and 40 min for the wild-type, ΔrstB, and ΔrstA strains, respectively. Ectopic expression of RstA from plasmid pACYC-rstA partly reversed the ΔrstA mutant phenotypes. The amount of initiator protein DnaA per cell was reduced by 40% in the ΔrstA mutant compared with the wild-type, but the concentration of DnaA did not change as the total amount of cellular protein was also reduced in these cells. Deletion or overproduction of RstA does not change the temperature sensitivity of dnaA46, dnaB252 and dnaC2. The expression of hupA was decreased by 0.53-fold in ΔrstA. RstA interacted with Topoisomerase I weakly in vivo and increased its activity of relaxing the negative supercoiled plasmid. Our data suggest that deletion of RstA leads to delayed initiation of DNA replication, and RstA may affect initiation of replication by controlling expression of dnaA or hupA. Furthermore, the delayed initiation may by caused by the decreased activity of topoisomerase I in RstA mutant."

We observe that innovation inputs and outputs present strong regional heterogeneity between coastal and inland regions. Although most regions continue to engage in processing trade or assembly manufacturing in GVCs, NVCs are gradually established and led by coastal regions. The results indicate a good chance for cultivating innovation capacity in coastal regions. After assessing the influence of determinants on innovation performance, we observe that from supply-side, innovation capacity has a positive effect on innovation performance, production capacity in coastal regions is improving, and domestic demand for domestic products is increasingly important. From the demand side, innovation capacity continues to have a positive effect on innovation performance, production capacity improves rapidly, and imported intermediate inputs enhance innovation performance more effectively than domestic intermediate inputs."

In some plant species, such activity has been attributed to diterpene secondary metabolites. Plant JHD diterpenes disrupt insect development by interfering with the juvenile hormone (JH)-mediated formation of JH receptor complexes. Here, we demonstrate that a plant extract and a diterpene from Lindera erythrocarpa (methyl lucidone) interfere with the formation of both methoprene-tolerant (Met)/Taiman and Germ cell-expressed (GCE)/Taiman heterodimer complexes in yeast two-hybrid assays in vitro. In addition to the in vitro JHD activity, the diterpene and the plant extract from L. erythrocarpa also disrupt the development of larvae and pupae in Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing the transcriptomes of juvenile hormone analog (JHA, methoprene)- and JHD (methyl lucidone)-fed wandering third-instar larvae revealed a large number of genes that were coregulated by JHA and JHD. Moreover, most (83%) of the genes that were repressed by methyl lucidone were significantly activated by methoprene, indicating that JHDs and JHAs have opposing effects on the transcriptional regulation of many JH-dependent genes. Gene ontology analysis also suggested that some of the genes activated-by-JHA/repressed-by-JHD play roles in spermatogenesis. Affymetrix microarray-based analysis indicated that the expression of genes activated-by-JHA/repressed-by-JHD was testis-specific. Together, these results suggest that JH is involved in testis-specific gene expression and that plant JHD diterpenes function as JH antagonists in such JHA-mediated gene regulation."

CpBV virion genome consists of 35 circular DNAs encoding 157 putative open reading frames (ORFs). This study re-annotated 157 ORFs with update genome database and analyzed their gene expressions at early and late parasitic stages. Re-annotation has established 15 different viral gene families, to which 83 ORFs are assigned with remaining 74 hypothetical genes. Among 157 ORFs, 147 genes were expressed at early or late parasitic stages, among which 141 genes were expressed in both parasitic stages, indicating persistent nature of gene expression. Relative frequencies of different viral circles present in the ovarian lumen did not explain the expression variation of the viral ORFs. Furthermore, expression level of each viral gene was varied during parasitism along with host development. Highly up-regulated CpBV genes at early parasitic stage included BEN (BANP, E5R and NAC1), ELP (EP1-like protein), IkB (inhibitor kB), P494 (protein 494 kDa) family genes, while those at late stage were mostly hypothetical genes. Along with the viral gene expression, 362 host genes exhibited more than two fold changes in expression levels at early parasitic stage compared to nonparasitized host. At late stage, more number (1,858) of host genes was regulated. These results suggest that persistent expression of most CpBV genes may be necessary to regulate host physiological processes during C. plutellae parasitism."
