https://openalex.org/W1976494486,"Previously, type C RNA tumor virus-related components have been described in blood leukocytes from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. These components, for example, reverse transcriptase, have been shown to be most closely related to those from two oncogenic subhuman primate type C viruses (woolly monkey sarcoma virus and gibbon ape leukemia virus). Now, we report the continuous production of budding type C viruses with the same characteristic reverse transcriptase by three separate culturings of leukocytes from a single bleeding from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. These isolations were made possible by the discovery of a source of conditioned media which sustains exponential growth of human myelogenous leukemia cells in liquid suspension culture."

The cDNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions in formamide-polyacrylamide gels. Discrete size products were detected, ranging from 65 to 650 nucleotides-that is, up to the full length of the mRNA template. Increasing the concentrations of all four dNTPs stimulated formation of full-length transcripts and made the incomplete copies less abundant. Hybridization and nuclease digestion experiments indicated that the full-size product is indeed a complete transcript of globin mRNA. Similar results were obtained with chorion mRNAs. The possible usefulness of the discrete partial transcripts is discussed."

As early as 1 day after drug injection cells demonstrated an intense Nissl staining, intense argyrophilia, cellular shrinkage, and perineuronal spaces. At 30 days after injection both stains revealed cellular debris and glial reactions characteristic of cellular dissolution. The neurotoxic effects of 2.5, 5, or 10 milligrams of p-chloroamphetamine per kilogram were primarily restricted to an area of the ventral midbrain tegmentum corresponding to the distribution of the B-9 serotonergic cell group. After 20 milligrams of p-chloroamphetamine per kilogram there was also evidence of neurotoxic effects on cells within the substantia nigra. These results confirm previous suggestions that the long-term reduction in serotonin content of brain, tryptophan-5-hydroxylase activity, and uptake of serotonin after injection of p-chloroamphetamine is due to a neurotoxic effect of the drug or some metabolite on serotonergic cell bodies."

https://openalex.org/W2039905437,"Beta2-Microglobulin is normally present in low concentrations in serum and other bodily fluids. By use of a radioimmunoassay, elevated concentrations of beta2--microglobulin were found in saliva and synovial fluid from patients with Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune inflammatory diseases that attack and destroy the salivary glands and articular tissues, respectively. Elevated beta2-microglobulin concentrations decreased in the saliva of two patients who simultaneously showed a clinical response to systemic treatment. Measurement of beta2-microglobulin in inflammatory fluids may offer a simple method of quantifying local activity in autoimmune states."

https://openalex.org/W2041562755,"In vitro axonal transport of tritiated protein decreased 40 to 60 percent when neuronal cell bodies were incubated in calcium-free medium, but was not affected when only nerve trunks were exposed to calcium-free conditions. In addition, calcium-45 was transported along axons at a rate similar to that of rapidly transported tritiated protein. These data are interpreted to suggest that calcium ions are involved in the initiation of axonal transport and in the coupling of transported proteins to the transport system."

https://openalex.org/W1500495638,"Dexamethasone (1,4-pregnadiene-9-fluor-16alpha-methyl-11beta,17alpha,21-triol-3,20-dione), a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, stimulates mouse mammary tumor virus expression 10- to 20-fold in tissue culture cells. This hormone effect was observed at concentrations as low as 1 times 10-10 M and was maximal at 10-7 to 10-8 M. The time course of induction indicated that detectable increases in extracellular viral DNA polymerase were first noted 18 to 24 hours following the addition of dexamethasone, and cells produced the highest polymerase levels at the time monolayers approached confluence. Steroid responsiveness was associated with specific increases in type B murine mammary tumor virus structural polypeptide (gp52(sl) expression and murine mammary tumor virus RNA that quantitatively paralleled the increase in extracellular virus production as measured by electron microscopy and supernatant RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Another virally transformed murine cell line, KA 31, did not contain detectable levels of murine mammary tumor virus gp52(sl) or RNA before or after dexamethasone stimulation; thus induction was noted only in murine cells with pre-existing murine mammary tumor virus expression. No increase in basal levels of type C murine leukemia viral proteins or RNA was detected in dexamethasone-treated mammary cell lines which were producing increased levels of murine mammary tumor virus. Therefore, increases in murine mammary tumor virus gene products are specific for murine mammary tumor virus DNA sequences under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1563683236,A 17-residue peptide (Peptide Y) was isolated from the COOH-terminal end of the basic protein of bovine myelin by peptic digestion. This peptide induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in the rhesus monkey. Treatment of Peptide Y with cyanogen bromide released three amino acids from the COOH-terminal end and resulted in a tetradecapeptide (Peptide M) which was also encephalitogenic in the rhesus monkey. The sequence of Peptide M is: Phe-Lys-LEU-Gly-Gly-Arg-Asp-Ser-Arg-Ser-Gly-Ser-Pro-Met. Thus a major disease-inducing site active in the rhesus monkey is contained within a 14-residue peptide localized near the COOH-terminal end of the protein. This peptide differs markedly in location and sequence from the 9-residue peptide shown to contain the encephalitogenic determinant for the guinea pig.

https://openalex.org/W2039646626,"The results of molecular hybridization experiments with high-molecular-weight RNA isolated from RNA tumor viruses and DNA from normal cells suggest that RNA tumor virus genomes originate from cell genes. Some RNA tumor viruses (here called class 1) appear to have been generated in recent times in that their RNA is closely related in nucleotide sequence to certain cell genes (class 1 genes). A second class of RNA tumor viruses (here called class 2) is more distantly related to genomic information of normal cells. Structural properties of the RNA of RNA tumor viruses lead us to propose that the tumor virus RNA is originated when RNA transcripts of class 1 genes are processed by a mechanism we call ""paraprocessing."" We postulate that RNA paraprocessing is normally used only at particular times during differentiation and is characterized by the cytoplasmic appearance of high-molecular-weight RNA chains containing terminal polyadenylic acid (200 residues). Paraprocessing of class 1 gene transcripts in committed or differentiated cells is considered to be aberrant in transcription that can lead to the generation of an RNA tumor virus genome. If the paraprocessed class 1 gene transcript codes for a reverse transcriptase, replication of the RNA becomes possible. Transfer of the replicating RNA to a new cell can result in genetic change such that the virus genome mutates, differing from the original progenitor genes. We propose that this genetic change causes class 1 viruses to become class 2. These ideas are applied to evidence concerning the biology of infection of RNA tumor viruses and concerning the involvement of RNA tumor viruses in human cancer."

By correlation of this data with the genetic and physical maps of the adenovirus genome, obtained by recombination and restriction endonuclease analysis, the genes coding for the hexon and fiber have been assigned to specific locations on the adenovirus DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1588609700,"The preparation and properties of an antiserum to human DNA polymerase I (6 to 8 S) are described. Care was taken in the purification of the antigen to remove certain other DNA polymerases found in human cells. An incubation of antigen and antiserum lasting about 48 hours is necessary to achieve maximal inhibition. About 1 mug of the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G, prepared in rats, neutralizes 60% of the activity present in 54 ng of the enzyme. Tritrations varying both antiserum and enzyme demonstrate clear regions of antigen and antibody excess. Inhibition of enzyme activity is about the same whether the templateprimer is (dA)n-(dT)12-18, or partially digested DNA. An assay was developed which measures the remaining activity in the supernatant after precipitation of enzyme-antibody complexes with goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G. In this assay, 2.2 mug of the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G quantitatively bind 33 ng of DNA polymerase I. With use of the direct neutralization assay and the immuno-precipitation test, we found little, if any, antigenic relationship between DNA polymerase I and DNA polymerase II (3.4 S). Similarly, little, if any, relationship was found to the DNA polymerases from five RNA tumor viruses. The activities of RNA-directed DNA polymerases from the blood leukocytes of two patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and from the placentas of rhesus monkeys were not inhibited in neutralization assays which were shortened because these enzymes were thermolabile. In identically shortened neutralization assays, the antipolymerase immunoglobulin G neutralized up to 76% of the activity of DNA polymerase I. In addition to its utility in distinguishing cellular DNA polymerases, the rat antiserum should be useful reagent for testing of novel DNA polymerases isolated in small quantities from human tumors for contamination with DNA polymerase I. This enzyme is present in abundance in proliferating tissue and often confuses the biochemical characterization of these novel enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2032110995,"Batrachotoxin (BTX) irreversibly blocks fast axoplasmic transport in nerve in concentrations as low as 0.2 micromolar. The action of BTX was studied in cat sciatic nerves in vitro by measuring the rate of the crest outflow after injection of the L7 dorsal root ganglion with [3-H]leucine. Tetrodotoxin, which in itself does not affect fast axoplasmic transport, inhibited the blocking action of BTX. Unlike the BTX block of nerve and muscle membrane excitability brought about through increased permeability to sodium ion, the BTX block of fast axoplasmic transport occurs with or without sodium ion in the medium. High concentrations of calcium ion protected against the blocking action of BTX, while magnesium ion did not. An action of BTX on the transport mechanism inside the fibers was indicated by the small reduction of adenosine triphosphate plus creatine phosphate, which in itself did not account for the block of axoplasmic transport."
https://openalex.org/W1964279352,"When the ascitic forms of two antigenically distinct guinea pig hepatomas induced by diethylnitrosamine are treated in vitro with chemotherapeutic drugs, their sensitivity to killing by xenogeneic antibody plus guinea pig complement increases. The effect is dependent on drug dose, is reversible, and does not appear to be due to increased antigen expression or fixation of the early acting components of guinea pig complement."
https://openalex.org/W1549330604,"Several methods were used to study the source of energy in the uptake of hexose phosphates by Escherichia coli K12. The uptake was sensitive to inhibition by agents that affect electron transport, such as lack of oxygen, cyanide, and heptylhydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, and by agents that affect ATP utilization, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and arsenate. It was also sensitive to uncouplers in the presence of absence of oxygen. The strain of E. coli used extruded protons during respiration. Uncer anaerobic conditions, the uptake of approximately 1 eg to H+ per glucose 6-phosphate. These observations are consistent with a chemiosmotic mechanism of genergized glucose 6-phosphate uptake. The rate of glucose 6-phosphate uptake was maximal in KC1, but was also stimulated by MgC12 or CaC12. Inhibition by A217, a nigericin-like antibiotic, was prevented by K+ whereas valinomycin and gramicidin inhibited in the presence or absence of K+."
https://openalex.org/W1576905269,"One side chain in the cell wall mannan of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis has the structure (see article). (Raschke, W. C., and Ballou, C. E. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 3807). This (Man)4GNAc unit (the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine derivative of mannotetroase) and the (Man)4 side chain, aMan(1 yields 3)aMan(1 yields 2)aMan(1 yields 2)Man, are the principle immunochemical determinants on the cell surface. Two classes of mutants were obtained which lack the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-containing determinant. The mannan of one class, designated mmnl, lacks both the (Man)4GNAc and (Man)4 side chains. Apparently, it has a defective alpha-1 yields 3-mannosyltransferase and the (Man)4 unit must be formed to serve as the acceptor before the alpha-1 yields 2-N-acetyl-glucosamine transferase can act. The other mutant class, mnn2, lacks only the (Man)4GNAc determinant and must be defective in adding N-acetylglucosamine to the mannotetrasose side chains. Two members of this class were obtained, one which still showed a wild type N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity in cell-free extracts and the other lacking it. They are allelic or tightly linked, and were designated mnn2-1 mnn2-2. Protoplast particles from the wild type cells catalyzed a Mn2+-dependent transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to the mannotetraose side chain of endogenous acceptors. Exogenous mannotetraose also served as an acceptor in a Mn2+-dependent reaction and yielded (Man)4GNAc. Related oligosaccharides with terminal alpha (1 yields 3)mannosyl units were also good acceptors. The product from the reaction with alphaMan(1 yields 3)Man had the N-acetylglucosamine attached to the mannose unit at the reducing end, which supports the conclusion that the cell-free glycosyltransferase activity is identical with that involved in mannan synthesis. The reaction was inhibited by uridine diphosphate. Protoplast particles from the mmnl mutants showed wild type N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity with exogenous acceptor, but they had no endogenous activity because the endogenous mannan lacked acceptor side chains. Particles from the mnn2-1 mutant failed to catalyze N-acetylglucosamine transfer. In contrast, particles from the mnn2-2 mutant were indistinguishable from wild type cells in their transferase activity. Some event accompanying cell breakage and assay of the mnn2-2 mutant allowed expression of a latent alpha-1 yields 2-N-acetylglucosamine transferase with kinetic properties similar to those of the wild type enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1523243338,"Conformational and structural modulations of the NH2-terminal region of fibrinogen and fibrin associated with plasmin cleavage have been examined utilizing specific antibody probes. The E region derived from the NH2-terminal aspects of fibrinogen undergoes complex structural and conformational changes throughout the cleavage process as indicated by differences in the quantitative and qualitative expression of antigenic determinants by the E region of each isolated cleavage fragment. When the range of antigenic determinants recognized by the antibody probe is limited to a specific molecular marker on the gamma chain within the E region, fg-E-neo, evidence for a systematic and progressive modulation of this site during plasmin cleavage is observed. Fg-E-neo undergoes progressive exposure as the cleavage of fibrinogen proceeds from X to Y to D:E complex. Separation of the D:E complex into its constituent, D and E fragments, is associated with further exposure of fg-E-neo determinants. The sequential cleavage of fibrin by plasmin also leads to progressive exposure of the fg-E-neo site; however, comparison of corresponding fragments derived from fibrinogen and fibrin reveals significant differences in the character of fg-E-neo expression. Immunochemical differences between fibrin and fibrinogen E fragments are not abolished by further exposure of the fragments to plasmin, are apparently not due to the presence or absence of fibrinopeptides, and are maintained following denaturation and renaturation of the fragments. These results suggest that the differential expression of fg-E-neo by the E fragments may be primarily dependent upon differences in amino acid compositions of the fragments."
https://openalex.org/W2074360386,"Radioactive anti-messenger DNA (3H-cDNA) complementary to silk fibroin mRNA has been synthesized using reverse transcriptase. This 3H-cDNA has been found to be a specific and sensitive probe for the detection of fibroin genes in the genome of Brombyx mori. Actinomycin-CsCl gradients give a large separation of the high GC fibroin genes from the bulk DNA. This density shift of fibroin genes has been measured as a function of DNA molecular weight. The data support a model in which a single high GC fibroin gene of 11.6 times 10-6 daltons is surrounded by at least 6 times 10-7 daltons of low GC DNA (30-39 percent). This finding, along with saturation hybridization studies (Suzuki, Gage, and Brown, 1972), demonstrate that the fibroin gene is present in a single copy per haploid genome."

https://openalex.org/W1601052229,"The E fragment, derived from the NH2-terminal aspect of fibrinogen by plasmin cleavage (fg-E), possesses two generically distinct sets of antigenic expressions. The major set of antigens is expressed by the parent molecule as indicated by the capacity of a major subpopulation of antibodies present in antiserum to fg-E and reactive with fg-E to: (a) react with fibrinogen, and (b) be specifically absorbed by fibrinogen but appears following proteolysis with plasmin. These cleavage associated neoantigens (fg-E-neo) specifically react with a minor subpopulation of antibodies present in antiserum to fg-E.E fragments isolated after varying exposures to plasmin all expressed fg-E-neo, but early E fragments exhibited quantitatively less neoantigenic expression than more extensively degraded E fragments. The entire fg-E-neo expression is recovered on a single isolated constituent chain of the E fragment, and immunochemical analysis with antiserum to the isolated constituent chain-bearing fg-E-neo identifies it as a derivative of the gamma chain constituent, exhibits marked stability to physicochemical denaturation and enzymatic degradation. These properties suggest that the neoantigen may be associated with a specific amino acid sequence which is exposed by the cleavage process. The identification and localization of fg-E-neo provides a specific molecular marker site for the characterization of structural and conformational changes associated with catabolism and function of fibrinogen."
