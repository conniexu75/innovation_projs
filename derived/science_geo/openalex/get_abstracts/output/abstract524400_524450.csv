https://openalex.org/W2038110764,"A phase I study of passive immunization with a CD4 binding-site-directed broadly neutralizing antibody shows that it transiently reduces HIV-1 viral loads in humans. The passive administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV has been effective against HIV-1 infection in humanized mice and macaque models of HIV-1 infection. It has been suggested that bNAbs, administered passively or by viral vectors, may be effective for prevention and immunotherapy in humans. The safety and efficacy of the approach had not been tested in humans previously but here Michel Nussenzweig and colleagues report the results of a phase I study of passive immunization with neutralizing antibodies directed at CD4 binding sites, and show that the treatment transiently reduces HIV viral loads in humans. HIV-1 immunotherapy with a combination of first generation monoclonal antibodies was largely ineffective in pre-clinical and clinical settings and was therefore abandoned1,2,3. However, recently developed single-cell-based antibody cloning methods have uncovered a new generation of far more potent broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 (refs 4, 5). These antibodies can prevent infection and suppress viraemia in humanized mice and nonhuman primates, but their potential for human HIV-1 immunotherapy has not been evaluated6,7,8,9,10. Here we report the results of a first-in-man dose escalation phase 1 clinical trial of 3BNC117, a potent human CD4 binding site antibody11, in uninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals. 3BNC117 infusion was well tolerated and demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetics. A single 30 mg kg−1 infusion of 3BNC117 reduced the viral load in HIV-1-infected individuals by 0.8–2.5 log10 and viraemia remained significantly reduced for 28 days. Emergence of resistant viral strains was variable, with some individuals remaining sensitive to 3BNC117 for a period of 28 days. We conclude that, as a single agent, 3BNC117 is safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viraemia, and that immunotherapy should be explored as a new modality for HIV-1 prevention, therapy and cure."

https://openalex.org/W1979486580,"Different clones of a mammary tumour cell line possess differential abilities to contribute to the formation of metastasis; the expression of Serpine2 and Slp1 proteins drives vascular mimicry and metastasis to the lung, with similar associations observed in human data sets, and these proteins also function as anticoagulants, thus further promoting extravasation of tumour cells. Using a mouse model of tumour heterogeneity that can be perturbed genetically to validate drivers of specific clonal behaviours, Elvin Wagenblast et al. demonstrate that different clones of a mammary tumour cell lines possess different abilities to contribute to the formation of metastasis. The expression of Serpine2 and Slpi proteins correlates with lung metastasis, and similar associations were observed in human datasets. Serpine2 and Slpi act as anticoagulants and also allow tumour cells to undergo vascular mimicry, whereby the tumour cells themselves form part of blood vessels and contribute to increased intravasation by building more leaky blood vessels. Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2,3,4,5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1993238514,"Cancer cells adapt their metabolic processes to support rapid proliferation, but less is known about how cancer cells alter metabolism to promote cell survival in a poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment. Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2019122457,"Continuing degradation of coral reef ecosystems has generated substantial interest in how management can support reef resilience. Fishing is the primary source of diminished reef function globally, leading to widespread calls for additional marine reserves to recover fish biomass and restore key ecosystem functions. Yet there are no established baselines for determining when these conservation objectives have been met or whether alternative management strategies provide similar ecosystem benefits. Here we establish empirical conservation benchmarks and fish biomass recovery timelines against which coral reefs can be assessed and managed by studying the recovery potential of more than 800 coral reefs along an exploitation gradient. We show that resident reef fish biomass in the absence of fishing (B0) averages ∼1,000 kg ha(-1), and that the vast majority (83%) of fished reefs are missing more than half their expected biomass, with severe consequences for key ecosystem functions such as predation. Given protection from fishing, reef fish biomass has the potential to recover within 35 years on average and less than 60 years when heavily depleted. Notably, alternative fisheries restrictions are largely (64%) successful at maintaining biomass above 50% of B0, sustaining key functions such as herbivory. Our results demonstrate that crucial ecosystem functions can be maintained through a range of fisheries restrictions, allowing coral reef managers to develop recovery plans that meet conservation and livelihood objectives in areas where marine reserves are not socially or politically feasible solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2000702886,"The detection of complex cyanides in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480, and the similarity of their abundance ratios to those found in comets, implies that the rich organic chemistry of our solar nebula was not unique. The idea that comets once seeded the early Earth with the water and organics needed for life to originate has been widely discussed. This raises the question of whether the composition of comets — a reliable indicator of the composition of the solar nebula — is unique to the Solar System or commonly accompanies planet formation. Here Karin Öberg et al. report the detection of cyanides — CH3CN, HC3N and HCN — in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480, an analogue to the solar nebula. The abundance ratios of these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas-phase are similar to those in comets, implying that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the prebiotic chemistry present in the young Solar System is not unique. Observations of comets and asteroids show that the solar nebula that spawned our planetary system was rich in water and organic molecules. Bombardment brought these organics to the young Earth’s surface1. Unlike asteroids, comets preserve a nearly pristine record of the solar nebula composition. The presence of cyanides in comets, including 0.01 per cent of methyl cyanide (CH3CN) with respect to water, is of special interest because of the importance of C–N bonds for abiotic amino acid synthesis2. Comet-like compositions of simple and complex volatiles are found in protostars, and can readily be explained by a combination of gas-phase chemistry (to form, for example, HCN) and an active ice-phase chemistry on grain surfaces that advances complexity3. Simple volatiles, including water and HCN, have been detected previously in solar nebula analogues, indicating that they survive disk formation or are re-formed in situ4,5,6,7. It has hitherto been unclear whether the same holds for more complex organic molecules outside the solar nebula, given that recent observations show a marked change in the chemistry at the boundary between nascent envelopes and young disks due to accretion shocks8. Here we report the detection of the complex cyanides CH3CN and HC3N (and HCN) in the protoplanetary disk around the young star MWC 480. We find that the abundance ratios of these nitrogen-bearing organics in the gas phase are similar to those in comets, which suggests an even higher relative abundance of complex cyanides in the disk ice. This implies that complex organics accompany simpler volatiles in protoplanetary disks, and that the rich organic chemistry of our solar nebula was not unique."
https://openalex.org/W2033627791,"Four-wave mixing (FWM) processes, based on third-order nonlinear light-matter interactions, can combine ultrafast time resolution with energy and wavevector selectivity, and enable the exploration of dynamics inaccessible by linear methods. The coherent and multi-wave nature of the FWM approach has been crucial in the development of advanced technologies, such as silicon photonics, subwavelength imaging and quantum communications. All these technologies operate at optical wavelengths, which limits the spatial resolution and does not allow the probing of excitations with energy in the electronvolt range. Extension to shorter wavelengths--that is, the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray ranges--would allow the spatial resolution to be improved and the excitation energy range to be expanded, as well as enabling elemental selectivity to be achieved by exploiting core resonances. So far, FWM applications at such wavelengths have been prevented by the absence of coherent sources of sufficient brightness and of suitable experimental set-ups. Here we show how transient gratings, generated by the interference of coherent extreme-ultraviolet pulses delivered by the FERMI free-electron laser, can be used to stimulate FWM processes at suboptical wavelengths. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the possibility of observing the time evolution of the FWM signal, which shows the dynamics of coherent excitations as molecular vibrations. This result opens the way to FWM with nanometre spatial resolution and elemental selectivity, which, for example, would enable the investigation of charge-transfer dynamics. The theoretical possibility of realizing these applications has already stimulated ongoing developments of free-electron lasers: our results show that FWM at suboptical wavelengths is feasible, and we hope that they will enable advances in present and future photon sources."

AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were predicted to contain seven transmembrane helices with the opposite topology to G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we report the crystal structures of human AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 at 2.9 and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, which represent a novel class of receptor structure. The seven-transmembrane helices, conformationally distinct from those of G-protein-coupled receptors, enclose a large cavity where three conserved histidine residues coordinate a zinc ion. The zinc-binding structure may have a role in the adiponectin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and UCP2 upregulation. Adiponectin may broadly interact with the extracellular face, rather than the carboxy-terminal tail, of the receptors. The present information will facilitate the understanding of novel structure-function relationships and the development and optimization of AdipoR agonists for the treatment of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2035049870,"The chemical properties of an element are primarily governed by the configuration of electrons in the valence shell. Relativistic effects influence the electronic structure of heavy elements in the sixth row of the periodic table, and these effects increase dramatically in the seventh row--including the actinides--even affecting ground-state configurations. Atomic s and p1/2 orbitals are stabilized by relativistic effects, whereas p3/2, d and f orbitals are destabilized, so that ground-state configurations of heavy elements may differ from those of lighter elements in the same group. The first ionization potential (IP1) is a measure of the energy required to remove one valence electron from a neutral atom, and is an atomic property that reflects the outermost electronic configuration. Precise and accurate experimental determination of IP1 gives information on the binding energy of valence electrons, and also, therefore, on the degree of relativistic stabilization. However, such measurements are hampered by the difficulty in obtaining the heaviest elements on scales of more than one atom at a time. Here we report that the experimentally obtained IP1 of the heaviest actinide, lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103), is 4.96(+0.08)(-0.07) electronvolts. The IP1 of Lr was measured with (256)Lr (half-life 27 seconds) using an efficient surface ion-source and a radioisotope detection system coupled to a mass separator. The measured IP1 is in excellent agreement with the value of 4.963(15) electronvolts predicted here by state-of-the-art relativistic calculations. The present work provides a reliable benchmark for theoretical calculations and also opens the way for IP1 measurements of superheavy elements (that is, transactinides) on an atom-at-a-time scale."
https://openalex.org/W2078774206,"Examination of three lunar samples reveals that the Moon’s mantle has an excess of the tungsten isotope 182W of about 20 parts per million relative to the present-day Earth’s mantle; this suggests that the two bodies had identical compositions immediately following the formation of the Moon, and that the compositions then diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion of chondritic material to the Earth and Moon. Two papers published in this issue of Nature present precise measurements of tungsten isotope composition in lunar rocks that are best explained by the Earth and Moon having had similar composition immediately following formation of the Moon, and then having diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion of material to the two bodies. Mathieu Touboul et al. found small 182W excess of about 21 parts per million relative to the present-day Earth's mantle in metals extracted from two KREEP-rich Apollo 16 impact-melt rocks, while Thomas Kruijer et al. measured tungsten isotopes in seven KREEP-rich whole rock samples that span a wide range of cosmic ray exposure ages, and found a 182W excess of about 27 parts per million over the present-day Earth's mantle. Characterization of the hafnium–tungsten systematics (182Hf decaying to 182W and emitting two electrons with a half-life of 8.9 million years) of the lunar mantle will enable better constraints on the timescale and processes involved in the currently accepted giant-impact theory for the formation and evolution of the Moon, and for testing the late-accretion hypothesis. Uniform, terrestrial-mantle-like W isotopic compositions have been reported1,2 among crystallization products of the lunar magma ocean. These observations were interpreted to reflect formation of the Moon and crystallization of the lunar magma ocean after 182Hf was no longer extant—that is, more than about 60 million years after the Solar System formed. Here we present W isotope data for three lunar samples that are more precise by a factor of ≥4 than those previously reported1,2. The new data reveal that the lunar mantle has a well-resolved 182W excess of 20.6 ± 5.1 parts per million (±2 standard deviations), relative to the modern terrestrial mantle. The offset between the mantles of the Moon and the modern Earth is best explained by assuming that the W isotopic compositions of the two bodies were identical immediately following formation of the Moon, and that they then diverged as a result of disproportional late accretion to the Earth and Moon3,4. One implication of this model is that metal from the core of the Moon-forming impactor must have efficiently stripped the Earth’s mantle of highly siderophile elements on its way to merge with the terrestrial core, requiring a substantial, but still poorly defined, level of metal–silicate equilibration."
https://openalex.org/W2051119427,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an emerging human coronavirus, causes severe acute respiratory illness with a 35% mortality rate. In light of the recent surge in reported infections we have developed asymmetric five-primer reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays for detection of MERS-CoV. Isothermal amplification assays will facilitate the development of portable point-of-care diagnostics that are crucial for management of emerging infections. The RT-LAMP assays are designed to amplify MERS-CoV genomic loci located within the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene. Additionally we applied one-step strand displacement probes (OSD) for real-time sequence-specific verification of LAMP amplicons. Asymmetric amplification effected by incorporating a single loop primer in each assay accelerated the time-to-result of the OSD-RT-LAMP assays. The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 plaque forming units (PFU) (5 to 50 PFU/ml) of MERS-CoV in infected cell culture supernatants within 30 to 50 min and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2079160564,"The Moon is thought to have formed mainly from a giant impactor striking the Earth but it has seemed odd that the Earth and its impactor (and hence the Moon) had such similar compositions; here simulations of planetary accretion show that although the different planets have distinct compositions, the composition of each giant impactor is indeed often very similar to that of the planet it strikes. The Moon is thought to have formed mainly from material within a giant impactor that struck the proto-Earth, so it seems odd that the compositions of the Moon and Earth are so similar, given the differing composition of other Solar System bodies. Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti et al. track the feeding zones of growing planets in a suite of computational simulations of planetary accretion and find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are more similar to the planets they impact. A significant fraction of planet–impactor pairs have virtually identical compositions. The authors conclude that the similarity in composition between the Earth and Moon could be a natural consequence of a late giant impact. Most of the properties of the Earth–Moon system can be explained by a collision between a planetary embryo (giant impactor) and the growing Earth late in the accretion process1,2,3. Simulations show that most of the material that eventually aggregates to form the Moon originates from the impactor1,4,5. However, analysis of the terrestrial and lunar isotopic compositions show them to be highly similar6,7,8,9,10,11. In contrast, the compositions of other Solar System bodies are significantly different from those of the Earth and Moon12,13,14, suggesting that different Solar System bodies have distinct compositions. This challenges the giant impact scenario, because the Moon-forming impactor must then also be thought to have a composition different from that of the proto-Earth. Here we track the feeding zones of growing planets in a suite of simulations of planetary accretion15, to measure the composition of Moon-forming impactors. We find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact. A large fraction of planet–impactor pairs have almost identical compositions. Thus, the similarity in composition between the Earth and Moon could be a natural consequence of a late giant impact."

Despite the clinical interest in P450 21A2, only limited work has been done directly with the human enzyme. Bovine P450 21A2 was purified from adrenal cortex (14Kominami S. Ochi H. Kobayashi Y.

In order to address several catalytic and structural issues related to the function of P450 21A2, we expressed the human enzyme in E. coli and purified the enzyme. This protein was used to obtain an x-ray crystal structure in the presence of the substrate progesterone (6Zhao B. Lei L. Kagawa N. Sundaramoorthy M. Banerjee S. Nagy L.D. Guengerich F.P.

Kinetic analyses indicate that human P450 21A2 is more catalytically efficient than the bovine enzyme and may be the most catalytically efficient mammalian P450 reported (i.e. has the highest kcat/Km value) (3Guengerich F.P. Human cytochrome P450 enzymes.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Springer, New York2015: 523-785Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports on the bovine enzyme (17Kominami S. Owaki A. Iwanaga T. Tagashira-Ikushiro H. Yamazaki T. The rate-determining step in P450 C21-catalyzing reactions in a membrane-reconstituted system.J. Biol.

Progesterone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and 17α-OH-progesterone was purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). All radiolabeled steroids were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). 21,21,21-d3-progesterone and 21,21,21-d3-17α-OH-progesterone were synthesized as described previously (13Yoshimoto F.K. Zhou Y. Peng H.M. Stidd D. Yoshimoto J.A. Sharma K.K. Matthew S. Auchus R.J.

In the human CYP21A2 open reading frame, the region encoding the N-terminal transmembrane helix (residues 1–29) was replaced by nucleotides coding for the peptide MAKKTSSKGK (P450 2C3 N-terminal region), and the 3′-end was extended by 18 nucleotides encoding six histidines. The entire modified cDNA was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and inserted into a pET17b expression vector (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The pET-17b plasmid containing the gene encoding human P450 21A2 was co-transformed with a chaperone pGro12 plasmid into E. coli BL21-Gold DE(3)-competent cells. The cultures were used for inoculation in Terrific Broth medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C and 250 rpm. When an OD600 of 1.0 was achieved (∼3.5 h), the shaker speed was lowered to 100 rpm, and δ-aminolevulinic acid and arabinose were added to final concentrations of 1.0 and 27 mm, respectively. After 60 min, the temperature was lowered to 26 °C, and 1.0 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce the expression of human P450 21A2. The cells were cultured for another 40 h at 26 °C (shaking at 100 rpm) and harvested by centrifugation (2.5 × 103 g, 20 min). The cells were subsequently suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 mm sucrose and 0.5 mm EDTA (200 ml/liter of cell culture) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the cells were pelleted and stored at −80 °C. Human P450 21A2 was purified from the E. coli cells as described previously for the recombinant bovine enzyme, with minor modifications (6Zhao B. Lei L. Kagawa N. Sundaramoorthy M. Banerjee S. Nagy L.D. Guengerich F.P. Waterman M.R. Three-dimensional structure of steroid 21-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450 21A2) with two substrates reveals locations of disease-associated variants.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 10613-10622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell pellets were thawed and sonicated in 200 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 m NaCl, 1.0% sodium cholate (w/v) (added to extract the protein from the membranes), 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Complete Tablets, EDTA-free, EASYpack)). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 105 × g. The reddish brown supernatant was applied to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, followed by 10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.25% sodium cholate (w/v), 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA). The bound P450 21A2 was subsequently eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole) and collected in 2-ml fractions. The most concentrated fractions were combined and dialyzed against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 m NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, which removed the sodium cholate. The protein for crystallization experiments was purified with a method similar to that used for purifying bovine P450 21A2, except that no detergent was used for chromatography with an SP Fast-Flow Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 400 mm NaCl. Steady-state binding experiments were carried out using an Aminco DW2/OLIS spectrophotometer (On-Line Instruments, Bogart, GA) at 23 °C. In general, P450 21A2 (1.0 μm, in 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer) was titrated with increasing concentrations of ligands (in C2H5OH) in the sample cuvette, and the same amount of C2H5OH was added to the reference cuvette. The UV-visible spectra from 350 to 500 nm were recorded. The spectral change Δ(A390 − A418), as a function of ligand concentration, was fit to a quadratic equation of the form, y = B + (A/2)*(1/E)*((Kd + E + X) − sqrt((Kd + E + X)∧2 − (4*E*X)), using Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). In order to obtain more accurate Kd values for the ligands with initial Kd values of <1 μm, titration experiments were repeated in a Cary 14/OLIS spectrophotometer using a 10-cm path length cylindrical cuvette (Starna Cells (Atascadero, CA), catalogue no. 34-Q-100, volume 25 ml). P450 21A2 (0.10 μm, in 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer) was titrated with increasing concentrations of ligands (dissolved in C2H5OH). The spectral change Δ(A390 − A418), as a function of ligand concentration, was fit to a quadratic equation (see above) using GraphPad Prism software. An OLIS RSM-1000 instrument (1.24-mm slits, 20-mm path length) was used to study pre-steady-state kinetics of ligand binding to P450 21A2. Experiments were performed in the rapid scanning mode at 23 °C in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 60 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Briefly, 2 or 4 μm P450 was mixed with 4 μm ligand, and spectral data were collected for 1 s. The traces at 390 nm were fit to equations using the manufacturer’s software (GlobalWorks). The basis of the experimental design is described by Daniels and Alberty (18Daniels F. Alberty R.A. Physical Chemistry.3rd Ed. Wiley, New York1966: 330-331Google Scholar). A second-order reaction 2A → A2 is kinetically equivalent to A + B → AB, if similar concentrations of A and B are mixed; the analysis is straightforward, especially if the back-reaction is slow (AB → A + B), which was the case here. This approach was used instead of trying to achieve pseudo-first-order kinetics with excess substrate, because of the low Kd values (i.e. Kd < 1–2 μm, which is a minimum for detection of changes in the kinetic binding experiments). Experiments with higher concentrations of substrate did not result in faster rates, in that the enzyme was already saturated with substrate. In general, steady-state enzyme assays were done in 500-μl reaction volumes at 37 °C in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reconstituted enzyme system contained 2 nm P450, 0.6 μm recombinant rat NADPH-P450 reductase (19Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Role of the alanine at position 363 of cytochrome P450 2B2 in influencing the NADPH- and hydroperoxide-supported activities.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 15 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and varying concentrations of progesterone or 17α-OH-progesterone (0–40 μm). The reactions were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-regenerating system containing 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm NADP+, and 1 IU/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (20Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Kruger C.L. Hayes' Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 6th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2014: 1905-1964Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched by the addition of 2 ml of CH2Cl2, and the steroid products were extracted into the organic solvent (lower phase) by mixing with a vortex device. After centrifugation to separate the layers (3 × 103 g, 10 min), an aliquot of the organic phase was transferred and dried under an N2 stream. The extracted products were dissolved in a CH3OH/H2O mixture (70%, v/v) and injected onto an Acquity BEH octadecylsilane (C18) UPLC column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) in a Waters Acquity UPLC system connected to a UV detector set to a wavelength of 243 nm. The UPLC column was used at 40 °C. The product was identified and quantified using external standards. With progesterone as the substrate, the following CH3OH/H2O linear gradient was used, at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min: 0–2 min, hold at 70% CH3OH (v/v); 2–6 min, linear increase from 70 to 95% CH3OH (v/v); 6–6.5 min, hold at 95% CH3OH (v/v); 6.5–7 min, linear decrease from 95 to 70% CH3OH (v/v); 7–10 min, hold at 70% CH3OH (v/v). With 17α-OH-progesterone as the substrate, the following CH3OH/H2O linear gradient was used, at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min: 0–2 min, hold at 60% CH3OH (v/v); 2–6 min, linear increase from 60 to 85% CH3OH (v/v); 6–6.5 min, hold at 85% CH3OH (v/v); 6.5–7 min, linear decrease from 85 to 60% CH3OH (v/v); 7–10 min, hold at 60% CH3OH (v/v). Pre-steady-state 21-hydroxylation reactions with P450 21A2 were carried out in a KinTek instrument (model RQF-3, KinTek Corp., State College, PA). All reactions were performed in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Human P450 21A2 (2 μm) was reconstituted with 4 μm recombinant rat NADPH-P450 reductase (19Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Role of the alanine at position 363 of cytochrome P450 2B2 in influencing the NADPH- and hydroperoxide-supported activities.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 15 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and either 20 μm progesterone ([4-14C]progesterone) or 17α-OH-progesterone (17α-OH-[1,2,6,7-3H]progesterone). The reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing with an NADPH-regenerating system (20 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2 mm NADPH, and 2 IU/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (20Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Kruger C.L. Hayes' Principles and Methods of Toxicology. 6th Ed. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2014: 1905-1964Google Scholar)) and quenched with 1 m HCl as a function of time from 10 ms to 1 s. A 50-μl aliquot of each reaction mixture was spotted onto the loading zone of a channeled silica gel G TLC plate (Analtech, Newark, DE), and the plates were developed with ethyl acetate/CH2Cl2 (1:4 (v/v) for progesterone and 1:3 (v/v) for 17α-OH-progesterone). With progesterone as the substrate, the plate was exposed to a phosphor imager screen (Imaging Screen K, Bio-Rad) for 7 days and analyzed with a molecular imager system (Pharos FX Plus Molecular Imager, Bio-Rad) using the manufacturer's Quantity One software. With 17α-OH-progesterone as the substrate, the plate was scanned with an AR-2000 Radio-TLC imaging scanner (Bioscan, Poway, CA) and analyzed with the manufacturer's Winscan software. The data points were fit to a burst equation, y = A(1 − e−kpt) + ksst, where A is the burst amplitude, kp is the first-order rate of the pre-steady-state burst, and kss is the steady-state rate, using GraphPad Prism software. To obtain the human P450 21A2-progesterone complex, substrate (dissolved in C2H5OH) was added in a 1:5 (P450/progesterone) molar ratio, followed by mixing and concentrating to 25 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the complex solution were frozen in liquid N2 and then stored at −80 °C. Human P450 21A2-progesterone complex crystals were grown using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing equal volumes (200 nl) of complex solution and mother liquor (0.10 m sodium HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 0.20 m ammonium sulfate and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350) and equilibrating droplets against 60 μl of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Microcrystals were obtained within 2 weeks, and in order to increase their size, one round of microseeding was performed. Wells containing microcrystals were washed with 10 μl of reservoir buffer and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube with 40 μl of mother liquor. After vortex mixing the seeds for 2 min and diluting 1:1000 with mother liquor, 200 nl of the seed solution was mixed with 200 nl of protein for each drop. Larger crystals of the complex grew from microseeded droplets in 5 days. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops and swiped through a droplet of 25% glycerol (v/v) in mother liquor for flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on the insertion device beam line (21-ID-G) of the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team, located at Sector 21 of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) at a wavelength of 0.9782 Å using a Mar300 CCD detector (at 100 K). Processing was done with the program HKL2000 (21Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities.Acta Crystallogr.

https://openalex.org/W2168117686,"Background Dexamethasone has been studied as an effective adjuvant to prolong the analgesia duration of local anesthetics in peripheral nerve block. However, the route of action for dexamethasone and its potential neurotoxicity are still unclear. Methods A mouse sciatic nerve block model was used. The sciatic nerve was injected with 60ul of combinations of various medications, including dexamethasone and/or bupivacaine. Neurobehavioral changes were observed for 2 days prior to injection, and then continuously for up to 7 days after injection. In addition, the sciatic nerves were harvested at either 2 days or 7 days after injection. Toluidine blue dyeing and immunohistochemistry test were performed to study the short-term and long-term histopathological changes of the sciatic nerves. There were six study groups: normal saline control, bupivacaine (10mg/kg) only, dexamethasone (0.5mg/kg) only, bupivacaine (10mg/kg) combined with low-dose (0.14mg/kg) dexamethasone, bupivacaine (10mg/kg) combined with high-dose (0.5mg/kg) dexamethasone, and bupivacaine (10mg/kg) combined with intramuscular dexamethasone (0.5mg/kg). Results High-dose perineural dexamethasone, but not systemic dexamethasone, combined with bupivacaine prolonged the duration of both sensory and motor block of mouse sciatic nerve. There was no significant difference on the onset time of the sciatic nerve block. There was “rebound hyperalgesia” to thermal stimulus after the resolution of plain bupivacaine sciatic nerve block. Interestingly, both low and high dose perineural dexamethasone prevented bupivacaine-induced hyperalgesia. There was an early phase of axon degeneration and Schwann cell response as represented by S-100 expression as well as the percentage of demyelinated axon and nucleus in the plain bupivacaine group compared with the bupivacaine plus dexamethasone groups on post-injection day 2, which resolved on post-injection day 7. Furthermore, we demonstrated that perineural dexamethasone, but not systemic dexamethasone, could prevent axon degeneration and demyelination. There was no significant caspase-dependent apoptosis process in the mouse sciatic nerve among all study groups during our study period. Conclusions Perineural, not systemic, dexamethasone added to a clinical concentration of bupivacaine may not only prolong the duration of sensory and motor blockade of sciatic nerve, but also prevent the bupivacaine-induced reversible neurotoxicity and short-term “rebound hyperalgesia” after the resolution of nerve block."
https://openalex.org/W2324250261,"Thyroid hormone (TH) balance is essential for vertebrate development. Deiodinase type 1 (D1) and type 2 (D2) increase and deiodinase type 3 (D3) decreases local intracellular levels of T3, the most important active TH. The role of deiodinase-mediated TH effects in early vertebrate development is only partially understood. Therefore, we investigated the role of deiodinases during early development of zebrafish until 96 hours post fertilization at the level of the transcriptome (microarray), biochemistry, morphology and physiology using morpholino (MO) knockdown. Knockdown of D1+D2 (D1D2MO) and knockdown of D3 (D3MO) both resulted in transcriptional regulation of energy metabolism and (muscle) development in abdomen and tail, together with reduced growth, impaired swim bladder inflation, reduced protein content and reduced motility. The reduced growth and impaired swim bladder inflation in D1D2MO could be due to lower levels of T3 which is known to drive growth and development. The pronounced upregulation of a large number of transcripts coding for key proteins in ATP-producing pathways in D1D2MO could reflect a compensatory response to a decreased metabolic rate, also typically linked to hypothyroidism. Compared to D1D2MO, the effects were more pronounced or more frequent in D3MO, in which hyperthyroidism is expected. More specifically, increased heart rate, delayed hatching and increased carbohydrate content were observed only in D3MO. An increase of the metabolic rate, a decrease of the metabolic efficiency and a stimulation of gluconeogenesis using amino acids as substrates may have been involved in the observed reduced protein content, growth and motility in D3MO larvae. Furthermore, expression of transcripts involved in purine metabolism coupled to vision was decreased in both knockdown conditions, suggesting that both may impair vision. This study provides new insights, not only into the role of deiodinases, but also into the importance of a correct TH balance during vertebrate embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2062426035,"This study aimed at investigating the genetic diversity, relationship and population structure of 110 local Swedish chickens derived from five breeds (Gotlandshöna, Hedemorahöna, Öländsk dvärghöna, Skånsk blommehöna, and Bohuslän- Dals svarthöna, in the rest of the paper the shorter name Svarthöna is used) using 24 microsatellite markers. In total, one hundred thirteen alleles were detected in all populations, with a mean of 4.7 alleles per locus. For the five chicken breeds, the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.225 to 0.408 and from 0.231 to 0.515, with the lowest scores for the Svarthöna and the highest scores for the Skånsk blommehöna breeds, respectively. Similarly, the average within breed molecular kinship varied from 0.496 to 0.745, showing high coancestry, with Skånsk blommehöna having the lowest and Svarthöna the highest coancestry. Furthermore, all breeds showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Across the five breeds, the global heterozygosity deficit (FIT) was 0.545, population differentiation index (FST) was 0.440, and the global inbreeding of individuals within breed (FIS) was 0.187. The phylogenetic relationships of chickens were examined using neighbor-joining trees constructed at the level of breeds and individual samples. The neighbor-joining tree constructed at breed level revealed two main clusters, with Hedemorahöna and Öländsk dvärghöna breeds in one cluster, and Gotlandshöna and Svarthöna breeds in the second cluster leaving the Skånsk blommehöna in the middle. Based on the results of the STRUCTURE analysis, the most likely number of clustering of the five breeds was at K = 4, with Hedemorahöna, Gotlandshöna and Svarthöna breeds forming their own distinct clusters, while Öländsk dvärghöna and Skånsk blommehöna breeds clustered together. Losses in the overall genetic diversity of local Swedish chickens due to breeds extinction varied from -1.46% to -6.723%. The results of the current study can be used as baseline genetic information for genetic conservation program, for instance, to control inbreeding and to implement further genetic studies in local Swedish chickens."

https://openalex.org/W2002973947,"Resource availability can affect the coevolutionary dynamics between host and parasites, shaping communities and hence ecosystem function. A key finding from theoretical and in vitro studies is that host resistance evolves to greater levels with increased resources, but the relevance to natural communities is less clear. We took two complementary approaches to investigate the effect of resource availability on the evolution of bacterial resistance to phages in soil. First, we measured the resistance and infectivity of natural communities of soil bacteria and phage in the presence and absence of nutrient-providing plants. Second, we followed the real-time coevolution between defined bacteria and phage populations with resource availability manipulated by the addition or not of an artificial plant root exudate. Increased resource availability resulted in increases in bacterial resistance to phages, but without a concomitant increase in phage infectivity. These results suggest that phages may have a reduced impact on the control of bacterial densities and community composition in stable, high resource environments."

Coronary CTAs were reviewed for CAD, graded based on the extent of calcified and non-calcified plaque, and the degree of major vessel stenosis. A four point grading scale was used for both coronary CTA and mammography. The overall prevalence of positive BAC and CAD in the studied population were 12% and 29%, respectively. Ten of the 12 patients with moderate or advanced BAC on mammography demonstrated moderate to severe CAD as determined by coronary CTA. For all women, the positive predictive value of BAC for CAD was 0.83 and the negative predictive value was 0.78. The presence of BAC on mammography appears to correlate with CAD as determined by coronary CTA (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient = 0.48, p<.000001). Using logistic regression, the inclusion of BAC as a feature in CAD predication significantly increased classification results (p=0.04)."

TREX1-D200N, an Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome disease-causing mutant, is defective in degrading RNA. TREX1 activity is strongly inhibited by a stretch of pyrimidine residues as is a bacterial homolog, RNase T. Kinetic measurements indicate that the apparent Km of TREX1 for RNA is higher than that for DNA. Like RNase T, human TREX1 is active in degrading native tRNA substrates. Previously reported TREX1 crystal structures have revealed that the substrate binding sites are open enough to accommodate the extra hydroxyl group in RNA, further supporting our conclusion that TREX1 acts on RNA.

https://openalex.org/W2044311891,"Neuropathic pain is common in peripheral nerve injury and often fails to respond to ordinary medication. Here, we investigated whether the two novel epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) polyphenolic derivatives, compound 23 and 30, reduce the neuropathic pain in mice chronic constriction nerve injury (CCI). First, we performed a dose-response study to evaluate nociceptive sensation after administration of EGCG and its derivatives 23 and 30, using the Hargreaves test at 7 and 21 days after injury (dpi). We daily administered EGCG, 23 and 30 (10 to 100 mg/Kg; i.p.) during the first week post-CCI. None of the doses of compound 23 caused significant pain diminution, whereas 50mg/kg was optimal for both EGCG and 30 to delay the latency of paw withdrawal. With 50 mg/Kg, we showed that EGCC prevented the thermal hyperalgesia from 7 to 21 dpi and compound 30 from 14 to 56 dpi. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms underpinning why EGCG and compound 30 differentially prevented the thermal hyperalgesia, we studied several biochemical parameters in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at 14 and 56 dpi. We showed that the effect observed with EGCG and compound 30 was related to the inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN), a known target of these polyphenolic compounds. Additionally, we observed that EGCG and compound 30 reduced the expression of CCI-mediated inflammatory proteins and the nuclear localization of nuclear factor-kappa B at 14 dpi, but not at 56 dpi. We also strongly detected a decrease of synaptic plasma membrane levels of N-methyl-D-asparte receptor 2B in CCI-mice treated with compound 30 at 56 dpi. Altogether, compound 30 reduced the chronic thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI better than the natural compound EGCG. Thus, our findings provide a rationale for the preclinical development of compound 30 as an agent to treat neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2009570398,"Food Policy Councils (FPC) help to identify and address the priorities of local, state, and regional food systems with the goal of improving food systems through policy. There is limited research describing FPCs’ strategies for accomplishing this goal. As part of a larger study examining FPC policy efforts, this paper investigates the role of partnerships in food systems policy change. We conducted interviews with representatives from 12 purposefully selected FPCs in the United States and 6 policy experts identified by the selected FPC representatives to document and describe their policy work. One theme that emerged from those interviews was the role of partners. Interviewees described a range of partners (e.g., stakeholders from government, business, and education) and credited FPC partnerships with advancing their policy goals by increasing the visibility and credibility of FPCs, focusing their policy agenda, connecting FPCs to key policy inputs (e.g., local food community knowledge and priorities), and obtaining stakeholder buy-in for policy initiatives. Partnerships were also described as barriers to policy progress when partners were less engaged or had either disproportionate or little influence in a given food sector. Despite these challenges, partnerships were found to be valuable for FPCs efforts to effectively engage in the food policy arena."
https://openalex.org/W2017897081,"Objective It was the aim of our study to evaluate the independent effect of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) as a cause of preterm delivery on mortality during primary hospital stay and significant morbidities in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants < 32 weeks of gestation. Design Observational, epidemiological study design. Setting Population-based cohort, German Neonatal Network (GNN). Population 6102 VLBW infants were enrolled in GNN from 2009-2012, n=4120 fulfilled criteria for primary analysis (< 32 gestational weeks, no pre-eclampsia, HELLP (highly elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome) or placental abruption as cause of preterm birth). Methods Multivariable logistic regression analyses included PPROM as potential risk factors for adverse outcomes and well established items such as gestational age in weeks, birth weight, antenatal steroids, center, inborn delivery, multiple birth, gender and being small-for-gestational-age. Results PPROM as cause of preterm delivery had no independent effect on the risk of early-onset sepsis, clinical sepsis and blood-culture proven sepsis, while gestational age proved to be the most important contributor to sepsis risk. The diagnosis of PPROM was associated with an increased risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD; OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02-1.55, p=0.03) but not with other major outcomes. Conclusions The diagnosis of PPROM per se is not associated with adverse outcome in VLBW infants < 32 weeks apart from a moderately increased risk for BPD. Randomized controlled trials with primary neonatal outcomes are needed to determine which subgroup of VLBW infants benefit from expectant or intentional management of PPROM."

Like the parent capuramycin, A-500359s and A-503083s consist of three structural components: a uridine-5′-carboxamide (CarU), a rare unsaturated hexuronic acid, and an aminocaprolactam, the last of which is substituted by an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide in A-102395. The biosynthetic gene clusters for A-500359s and A-503083s have been reported, and two genes encoding a putative non-heme Fe(II)-dependent α-ketoglutarate:UMP dioxygenase and an l-Thr:uridine-5′-aldehyde transaldolase were uncovered, suggesting that C–C bond formation during assembly of the high carbon (C6) sugar backbone of CarU proceeds from the precursors UMP and l-Thr to form 5′-C-glycyluridine (C7) as a biosynthetic intermediate.

Two additional structural variants of note include the deaminocaprolactam (de-ACL) congeners that contain a free carboxylic acid (A-500359 F, 1c) or a methyl ester (A-500359 E, 1d), the former of which has a significantly decreased TL1 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.1 μm), whereas the latter has a slight decrease (IC50 = 27 nm) (3.Muramatsu Y.

The A-503083s 2a-2d have structures identical to those of A-500359s with one exception; in all cases, CarU is modified with a 2′-O-carbamoyl group that has minimal effect on TL1 inhibition and antibacterial activity (5.Muramatsu Y.

A-102395 3 significantly diverges from the other capuramycins in both structure, wherein the l-ACL is substituted with an unusual arylamine-containing polyamide, and activity, with 3 being the most potent inhibitor of TL1 (IC50 = 11 nm) yet completely inactive against Mycobacteria sp. and other bacterial strains (6.Murakami R.

Antibiot. 2007; 60: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Shortly after the rediscovery of capuramycin, the biosynthesis of each component was interrogated using feeding experiments with the producing strain of 1 (4.Ohnuki T. Muramatsu Y. Miyakoshi S. Takatsu T. Inukai M. Studies on novel bacterial translocase I inhibitors, A-500359s: IV. Biosynthesis of A-500359s.J. Antibiot. 2003; 56: 268-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As expected, high incorporation was observed for l-ACL using l-[1-13C]Lys (16-fold enrichment of C-1‴); α-d-mannopyranuronate using d-[1-13C]mannose (11-fold enrichment of C-1″); and CarU using d-[1-13C]ribose (17-fold enrichment of C-1′) (Fig. 1B). The metabolic origin of the 5′-carboxamide of CarU was less clear, although a modest 3-fold enrichment of C-6′ using [3-13C]pyruvate led to a proposal that the biosynthesis involves an aldol reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate and uridine-5′-aldehyde (UA). This mechanism of ribose chain extension is analogous to that previously proposed for the biosynthesis of polyoxin and nikkomycin, two nucleoside antibiotics that also contain a high carbon sugar albeit with distinct chemical features (23.Isono K. Sato T. Hirasawa K. Funayama S. Suzuki S. Biosynthesis of the nucleoside skeleton of polyoxins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the specific enzymatic transformations required for the assembly of the high carbon sugar nucleoside of either the capuramycins or polyoxin and nikkomycin have not been biochemically established. The biosynthetic gene cluster for 1 and 2 have been identified, and evidence for the involvement of 21 open reading frames (ORFs) was provided by gene expression profiling of the wild-type, 1-producing strain and several null mutants created by random chemical mutagenesis (24.Funabashi M.

Additional evidence that the correct gene cluster was identified was provided by functional assignment of genes involved in 2 biosynthesis: one (capP) encoding an ATP-dependent phosphotransferase that modifies the 3″-OH of the unsaturated α-d-mannopyranuronate as a mechanism of self-resistance (26.Yang Z.

These two enzymes sequentially convert UMP to (5′S,6′S)-5′-C-glycyluridine (GlyU) during the biosynthesis of A-90289, a member of a distinct group of TL1 inhibitors that contain a GlyU component in the final product (Fig. 2) (29.Funabashi M.

Thus, the uncovering of these two genes within the clusters for 1 and 2 suggested that the biosynthesis of CarU proceeds via condensation of l-Thr with UA to generate GlyU as a cryptic pathway intermediate. Herein we provide evidence through newly designed feeding experiments that this is indeed the case. The probability for the involvement of an l-Thr:UA transaldolase in CarU biosynthesis was subsequently exploited to clone and characterize the 3 gene cluster. The first genetic system for a producer of the capuramycin-type antibiotics was developed using the 3-producing strain, which, in addition to in vitro characterization of enzymes with sequence similarity to CapP (Cpr17), LipL (Cpr19), and LipK (CapH), has provided new insight into the resistance and biosynthetic strategies for the capuramycin-type antibiotics.

A seed culture was incubated at 28 °C for 48 h, when 1.5 ml was used to inoculate fresh media (50 ml of liquid medium in a 250-ml flask). After fermentation for 70 h, 25 mg of filter-sterilized [1-13C]Gly, [2-13C]Gly, or l-[13C4,15N]Thr was added to each flask. Fermentation was continued an additional 72 h. An equal volume of methanol was added directly to the culture and mixed vigorously prior to centrifugation to remove cell debris. The supernatant was lyophilized, and the dried powder was resuspended in water (100 mg/ml) for HPLC purification using a C-18 reverse phase semipreparative column. A series of linear gradients was developed from A (0.1% TFA, 2.5% acetonitrile) to B (0.1% TFA, 90% acetonitrile) in the following manner (beginning time and ending time with linear increase to percentage of B): 0–6 min, 0% B; 6–26 min, 100% B; 26–30 min, 100% B; 30–34 min, 0% B; and 34–35 min, 0% B. The flow rate was kept constant at 3.5 ml/min, and elution was monitored at 260 nm. Purified 2a and 2c were analyzed by NMR, and relative peak intensities were assigned based on C-2″ and C-3″ from the natural abundance 13C NMR spectra. Amycolatopsis sp. SANK 60206 genomic DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI to give ∼40-kb DNA fragments that were dephosphorylated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase and ligated into BamHI-digested cosmid vector SuperCos1 (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), which was dephosphorylated by bacterial alkaline phosphatase after XbaI digestion. The ligation products were packaged with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene), and the resulting recombinant phage was used to transfect Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue MR. Approximately 8,000 colonies from the obtained genomic library were screened by colony hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled lipK/capH homologous DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers (supplemental Table 1) and genomic DNA from Amycolatopsis sp. SANK 60206. Hybridization was carried out using DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Applied Science) at 42 °C, and the resulting filter was washed under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC including 0.1% SDS, 68 °C). Detection was performed using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Based on restriction digest analysis, three positive cosmids, pNCap01, pNCap02, and pNCap03, were isolated and sequenced using a Roche Applied Science GS FLX system (Operon Biotechnologies). The terminal region of pNCap03 was used as a probe to identify a 10-kb DNA fragment following BamHI digestion of genomic DNA, which was cloned into pUC19 to yield pUC/B10k. This insert was subsequently used as a probe to rescreen the library to identify a fourth cosmid, pNCap04, which was also sequenced to complete the genetic locus. Potential open reading frames were defined using Frameplot version 4.0, and database comparison for sequence homology was performed with BLAST search tools using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). Genes were inactivated using REDIRECT technology (36.Gust B. Chandra G. Jakimowicz D. Yuqing T. Bruton C.J. Chater K.F. λ Red-mediated genetic manipulation of antibiotic-producing Streptomyces.Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 107-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In short, pNCap03 was introduced into E. coli BW25141/pKD78, and the linear PCR fragment obtained with template pIJ773 was introduced by electroporation. Following confirmation of the genotype using PCR, the modified cosmids were introduced into Amycolatopsis sp. SANK 60206 by conjugation using E. coli ET12567(pUZ8002). Apramycin resistance was used to select for a double-crossover event, the genotype of which was subsequently confirmed by both PCR and Southern blot analysis. For comparative analysis of 3 production in the wild-type and mutant strains, 2 liters of culture broth was centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 20 min to remove mycelia. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 3.0 with concentrated HCl followed by the addition of an equal volume of methanol. After vigorous mixing for 1 h, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (6,000 × g for 40 min), and the solvent from the recovered supernatant was removed by rotary evaporation and lyophilization. Dried bacterial extracts (250–400 mg) were dissolved in 1.6 ml of 1:1 water/methanol, and the pH was adjusted to 3–4 with concentrated HCl if necessary prior to the addition of 6.4 ml of cold acetonitrile. The resulting mixture was vortexed for 5 min, followed by sonication for 1 min, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (2,600 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was recovered and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried sample was resuspended in 50 μl of methanol for analysis by LC-MS-MS. LC-MS-MS analysis of 3 was carried out using a Shimadzu UFLC equipped with an Apollo C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) coupled to an AB Sciex 4000-Qtrap hybrid linear ion trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode. The mobile phase consisted of 10 mm ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). A series of linear gradients was developed from A to B in the following manner (beginning time and ending time with linear increase to percentage of B): 0 min, 2% B; 0–8 min, 2% B; 8–27 min, 90% B; 27–30 min, 90% B; and 30–32 min, 2% B. The flow rate was kept constant at 0.5 ml/min with a column temperature of 30 °C, and elution was monitored at 260 nm."

The role of CD34+/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 2+ progenitor cells (PCs) in vascular repair in HHcy is unknown. We studied the effect of HHcy on PCs and its role in vascular repair in severe HHcy (~150 μM), which was induced in cystathionine-β synthase heterozygous mice fed a high-methionine diet for 8 weeks. Vascular injury was introduced by carotid air-dry endothelium denudation. CD34+/VEGFR2+ cells were examined by flow cytometry. HHcy reduced bone marrow (BM) CD34+/VEGFR2+ cells and suppressed replenishment of postinjury CD34+/VEGFR2+ cells in peripheral blood (PB). Donor green fluorescent protein-positive PC homing to the injured vessel was reduced in HHcy after CD34+ PCs from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice were adoptively transferred following carotid injury. CD34+ PC transfusion partially reversed HHcy-suppressed re-endothelialization and HHcy-induced neointimal formation. Furthermore, homocysteine (Hcy) inhibited proliferation, adhesion, and migration and suppressed β1-integrin expression and activity in human CD34+ endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) isolated from PBs in a dose-dependent manner. A functional-activating β1-integrin antibody rescued Hcy-suppressed adhesion and migration in CD34+ ECFCs. In conclusion, HHcy reduces BM CD34+/VEGFR2+ generation and suppresses CD34+/VEGFR2+ cell mobilization and homing to the injured vessel via β1-integrin inhibition, which partially contributes to impaired re-endothelialization and vascular remodeling.—Nelson, J., Wu, Y., Jiang, X., Berretta, R., Houser, S., Choi, E., Wang, J., Huang, J., Yang, X., Wang, H.

The influence on technical success and rate of complications was assessed for intervention-related predictors (lesion diameter, length of biopsy pathway, number of pleural transgressions, and needle size) and patient-related predictors (age, gender, reduced lung function). In addition, technical success and rate of complications were compared between different interventional radiologists.One hundred thirty-eight patients underwent biopsies by 15 interventional radiologists. The overall technical success rate was 84.1% and was significantly different between interventional radiologists (range 25%-100%; p<0.01). Intervention-related and patient-related predictors did not influence the technical success rate. The overall complication rate was 59.4% with 39.1% minor complications and 21.0% major complications. The rate of complications was influenced by lesion diameter and distance of biopsy pathway. Interventional radiologist-related rates of complications were not statistically different.Technical success of percutaneous, transthoracic lung needle biopsies of pulmonary tumors is probably dependent on the interventional radiologist. In addition, lesion diameter and length of biopsy pathway are predictors of the rate of complications."

To determine the mechanism, we overexpressed hyaluronidase 1 (Hyal1) as a fluorescent fusion protein and examined its impact on endocytosis and vesicular trafficking. Overexpression of Hyal1 led to increased rates of internalization of HA and the endocytic recycling marker transferrin. Live imaging of Hyal1, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and specific colocalization of Rab GTPases defined the subcellular distribution of Hyal1 as early and late endosomes, lysosomes, and recycling vesicles. Manipulation of vesicular trafficking by chemical inhibitors or with constitutively active and dominant negative Rab expression constructs caused atypical localization of Hyal1.

https://openalex.org/W2061796818,"Abstract Protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in the assembly of the cellulosome, one of nature's most intricate nanomachines dedicated to the depolymerization of complex carbohydrates. The integration of cellulosomal components usually occurs through the binding of type I dockerin modules located at the C terminus of the enzymes to cohesin modules located in the primary scaffoldin subunit. Cellulosomes are typically recruited to the cell surface via type II cohesin-dockerin interactions established between primary and cell-surface anchoring scaffoldin subunits. In contrast with type II interactions, type I dockerins usually display a dual binding mode that may allow increased conformational flexibility during cellulosome assembly. Acetivibrio cellulolyticus produces a highly complex cellulosome comprising an unusual adaptor scaffoldin, ScaB, which mediates the interaction between the primary scaffoldin, ScaA, through type II cohesin-dockerin interactions and the anchoring scaffoldin, ScaC, via type I cohesin-dockerin interactions. Here, we report the crystal structure of the type I ScaB dockerin in complex with a type I ScaC cohesin in two distinct orientations. The data show that the ScaB dockerin displays structural symmetry, reflected by the presence of two essentially identical binding surfaces. The complex interface is more extensive than those observed in other type I complexes, which results in an ultra-high affinity interaction (Ka ∼1012 m). A subset of ScaB dockerin residues was also identified as modulating the specificity of type I cohesin-dockerin interactions in A. cellulolyticus. This report reveals that recruitment of cellulosomes onto the cell surface may involve dockerins presenting a dual binding mode to incorporate additional flexibility into the quaternary structure of highly populated multienzyme complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2098956636,"Latent infection with Toxoplasma gondii is common in humans (approximately 30% of the global population) and is a significant risk factor for schizophrenia. Since prevalence of T. gondii infection is far greater than prevalence of schizophrenia (0.5-1%), genetic risk factors are likely also necessary to contribute to schizophrenia. To test this concept in an animal model, Nurr1-null heterozygous (+/-) mice and wild-type (+/+) mice were evaluate using an emergence test, activity in an open field and with a novel object, response to bobcat urine and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI) prior to and 6 weeks after infection with T. gondii. In the emergence test, T. gondii infection significantly decreased the amount of time spent in the cylinder. Toxoplasma gondii infection significantly elevated open field activity in both +/+ and +/- mice but this increase was significantly exacerbated in +/- mice. T. gondii infection reduced PPI in male +/- mice but this was not statistically significant. Aversion to bobcat urine was abolished by T. gondii infection in +/+ mice. In female +/- mice, aversion to bobcat urine remained after T. gondii infection while the male +/- mice showed no aversion to bobcat urine. Antibody titers of infected mice were a critical variable associated with changes in open field activity, such that an inverted U shaped relationship existed between antibody titers and the percent change in open field activity with a significant increase in activity at low and medium antibody titers but no effect at high antibody titers. These data demonstrate that the Nurr1 +/- genotype predisposes mice to T. gondii-induced alterations in behaviors that involve dopamine neurotransmission and are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. We propose that these alterations in murine behavior were due to further exacerbation of the altered dopamine neurotransmission in Nurr1 +/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W1966912320,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant forms of Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is a modular, multidomain protein containing 2 enzymatic domains, including a kinase domain, as well as several protein-protein interaction domains, pointing to a role in cellular signaling. Although enormous efforts have been made, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of LRRK2 are still not completely known. In this study, we used a chemical genetics approach to identify LRRK2 substrates from mouse brain. This approach allows the identification of substrates of 1 particular kinase in a complex cellular environment. Several of the identified peptides are involved in the regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics, including microtubule-associating protein (MAP)/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 1 (MARK1). MARK1 is a serine/threonine kinase known to phosphorylate MT-binding proteins such as Tau, MAP2, and MAP4 at KXGS motifs leading to MT destabilization. In vitro kinase assays and metabolic-labeling experiments in living cells confirmed MARK1 as an LRRK2 substrate. Moreover, we also showed that LRRK2 and MARK1 are interacting in eukaryotic cells. Our findings contribute to the identification of physiologic LRRK2 substrates and point to a potential mechanism explaining the reported effects of LRRK2 on neurite morphology.—Krumova, P., Reyniers, L., Meyer, M., Lobbestael, E., Stauffer, D., Gerrits, B., Muller, L., Hoving, S., Kaupmann, K., Voshol, J., Fabbro, D., Bauer, A., Rovelli, G., Taymans, J.-M., Bouwmeester, T., Baekelandt, V.

https://openalex.org/W2067267904,"Background Cleavable linkers, which are specifically cleaved by defined conditions or enzymes, are powerful tools that can be used for various purposes. Amongst other things, they have been successfully used to deliver toxic payloads as prodrugs into target tissues. In this work novel linker sequences targeting meprin β, a metalloprotease expressed in the kidney brush-border membrane, were designed and included in the sequence of three radiolabelled exendin-4 derivatives. As radiolabelled exendin-4 derivatives strongly accumulate in the kidneys, we hypothesised that specific cleavage of the radiolabelled moiety at the kidney brush-border membrane would allow easier excretion of the activity into the urine and therefore improve the pharmacological properties of the peptide. Results The insertion of a cleavable linker did not negatively influence the in vitro properties of the peptides. They showed a good affinity to the GLP-1 receptor expressed in CHL cells, a high internalisation and sufficiently high stability in fresh human blood plasma. In vitro digestion with recombinant meprin β rapidly metabolised the corresponding linker sequences. After 60 min the majority of the corresponding peptides were digested and at the same time the anticipated fragments were formed. The peptides were also quickly metabolised in CD1 nu/nu mouse kidney homogenates. Immunofluorescence staining of meprin β in kidney sections confirmed the expression of the protease in the kidney brush-border membrane. Biodistribution in GLP-1 receptor positive tumour-xenograft bearing mice revealed high specific uptake of the 111In-labelled tracers in receptor positive tissue. Accumulation in the kidneys, however, was still high and comparable to the lead compound 111In-Ex4NOD40. Conclusion In conclusion, we show that the concept of cleavable linkers specific for meprin β is feasible, as the peptides are rapidly cleaved by the enzyme while retaining their biological properties."

It is well established that individual HPV types vary in oncogenicity, but current data on their prognostic implication remain controversial. We examined the association between HPV types/species and the survival of 236 Chinese women aged 26–87 (mean 54.4) years after receiving primary treatment for cervical cancer. Overall, 45.8% were of FIGO stage I, 41.9% stage II, and 12.3% stage III. The four most prevalent types found were HPV-16 (60.2%), HPV-18 (21.6%), HPV-52 (11.9%), and HPV-58 (9.3%). Overall, 19.5% of patients had multiple-type infections, 78.4% harboured one or more alpha-9 species, and 28.8% harboured one or more alpha-7 species. After a median follow-up of 8.0 years, 156 (66.1%) patients survived. The 3-year overall survival rate was 75.5%. Factors independently associated with a poorer 3-year overall survival were age >60 years, tumour size >4 cm, lymph node involvement and treatment with radiotherapy+/-chemotherapy. Univariate analysis showed HPV-16 single-type infection was associated with a marginally poorer disease-specific survival (71.6% vs. 87.0%, HR: 1.71, 95% CI = 1.01–2.90), whereas non-HPV-16 alpha-9 species was associated with a better disease-specific survival (90.0% vs. 76.2%, HR: 0.36, 95% CI = 0.16–0.79). However, on multivariate analysis, HPV infection status irrespective of different grouping methods, including individual types, species, single-type or co-infection, did not carry any significant prognostic significance. In conclusion, we did not observe any association between infection with a particular HPV type/species and survival. An HPV type-based stratification in treatment and follow-up plan could not be recommended."

It is therefore not surprising that one of the many approaches to understanding and predicting protein folding and properties has come from genomics and more specifically from multiple sequence alignments. In this work I explore ways in which data derived from sequence alignment data can be used to investigate in a predictive way three different aspects of protein structure: secondary structures, inter-residue contacts and the dynamics of switching between different states of the protein. In particular the use of Kolmogorov complexity has identified a novel pathway towards achieving these goals."
https://openalex.org/W2020141426,"We present a general approach in 1H-detected 13C solid-state NMR (SSNMR) for side-chain signal assignments of 10-50 nmol quantities of proteins using a combination of a high magnetic field, ultra-fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) at ~80 kHz, and stereo-array-isotope-labeled (SAIL) proteins [Kainosho M. et al., Nature 440, 52–57, 2006]. First, we demonstrate that 1H indirect detection improves the sensitivity and resolution of 13C SSNMR of SAIL proteins for side-chain assignments in the ultra-fast MAS condition. 1H-detected SSNMR was performed for micro-crystalline ubiquitin (~55 nmol or ~0.5mg) that was SAIL-labeled at seven isoleucine (Ile) residues. Sensitivity was dramatically improved by 1H-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR by factors of 5.4-9.7 and 2.1-5.0, respectively, over 13C-detected 2D 1H/13C SSNMR and 1D 13C CPMAS, demonstrating that 2D 1H-detected SSNMR offers not only additional resolution but also sensitivity advantage over 1D 13C detection for the first time. High 1H resolution for the SAIL-labeled side-chain residues offered reasonable resolution even in the 2D data. A 1H-detected 3D 13C/13C/1H experiment on SAIL-ubiquitin provided nearly complete 1H and 13C assignments for seven Ile residues only within ~2.5 h. The results demonstrate the feasibility of side-chain signal assignment in this approach for as little as 10 nmol of a protein sample within ~3 days. The approach is likely applicable to a variety of proteins of biological interest without any requirements of highly efficient protein expression systems."

Altered control of the finger forces can impart unwanted torque on the object affecting its orientation, thus impairing manual performance. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex (M1) has been shown to improve the performance speed on manual tasks in older adults. However, the effects of anodal tDCS over M1 on the finger force control during object manipulation in older adults remain to be fully explored. Here we determined the effects of anodal tDCS over M1 on the control of grip force in older adults while they manipulated an object with an uncertain mechanical property. Eight healthy older adults were instructed to grip and lift an object whose contact surfaces were unexpectedly made more or less slippery across trials using acetate and sandpaper surfaces, respectively. Subjects performed this task before and after receiving anodal or sham tDCS over M1 on two separate sessions using a cross-over design. We found that older adults used significantly lower grip force following anodal tDCS compared to sham tDCS. Friction measured at the finger-object interface remained invariant after anodal and sham tDCS. These findings suggest that anodal tDCS over M1 improved the control of grip force during object manipulation in healthy older adults. Although the cortical networks for representing objects and manipulative actions are complex, the reduction in grip force following anodal tDCS over M1 might be due to a cortical excitation yielding improved processing of object-specific sensory information and its integration with the motor commands for production of manipulative forces. Our findings indicate that tDCS has a potential to improve the control of finger force during dexterous manipulation in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2047222931,"Aims The objective of this study is to determine the role of perilipin 1 (Plin1) in whole body or bone marrow-derived cells on atherogenesis. Methods and Results Accumulated evidence have indicated the role of Plin1 in atherosclerosis, however, these findings are controversial. In this study, we showed that Plin1 was assembled and colocalized with CD68 in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of ApoE-/- mice. We further found 39% reduction of plaque size in the aortic roots of Plin1 and ApoE double knockout (Plin1-/-ApoE-/-) females compared with ApoE-/- female littermates. In order to verify whether this reduction was macrophage-specific, the bone marrow cells from wild-type or Plin1 deficient mice (Plin1-/-) were transplanted into LDL receptor deficient mice (LDLR-/-). Mice receiving Plin1-/- bone marrow cells showed also 49% reduction in aortic atherosclerotic lesions compared with LDLR-/- mice received wild-type bone marrow cells. In vitro experiments showed that Plin1-/- macrophages had decreased protein expression of CD36 translocase and an enhanced cholesterol ester hydrolysis upon aggregated-LDL loading, with unaltered expression of many other regulators of cholesterol metabolism, such as cellular lipases, and Plin2 and 3. Given the fundamental role of Plin1 in protecting LD lipids from lipase hydrolysis, it is reasonably speculated that the assembly of Plin1 in microphages might function to reduce lipolysis and hence increase lipid retention in ApoE-/- plaques, but this pro-atherosclerotic property would be abrogated on inactivation of Plin1. Conclusion Plin1 deficiency in bone marrow-derived cells may be responsible for reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the mice."
https://openalex.org/W2049902384,"The vertebrate genome is a result of two rapid and successive rounds of whole genome duplication, referred to as 1R and 2R. Furthermore, teleost fish have undergone a third whole genome duplication (3R) specific to their lineage, resulting in the retention of multiple gene paralogs. The more recent 3R event in teleosts provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into how genes evolve through specific evolutionary processes. In this study we compare molecular activities of vitamin D receptors (VDR) from basal species that diverged at key points in vertebrate evolution in order to infer derived and ancestral VDR functions of teleost paralogs. Species include the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), a 1R jawless fish; the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), a cartilaginous fish that diverged after the 2R event; and the Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus), a primitive 2R ray-finned fish. Saturation binding assays and gel mobility shift assays demonstrate high affinity ligand binding and classic DNA binding characteristics of VDR has been conserved across vertebrate evolution. Concentration response curves in transient transfection assays reveal EC50 values in the low nanomolar range, however maximum transactivational efficacy varies significantly between receptor orthologs. Protein-protein interactions were investigated using co-transfection, mammalian 2-hybrid assays, and mutations of coregulator activation domains. We then combined these results with our previous study of VDR paralogs from 3R teleosts into a bioinformatics analysis. Our results suggest that 1, 25D3 acts as a partial agonist in basal species. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis suggests that functional differences between VDR orthologs and paralogs are influenced by differential protein interactions with essential coregulator proteins. We speculate that we may be observing a change in the pharmacodynamics relationship between VDR and 1, 25D3 throughout vertebrate evolution that may have been driven by changes in protein-protein interactions between VDR and essential coregulators."
https://openalex.org/W1996692060,"The increased use of molecular tools for species identification in recent decades revealed that each of many apparently generalist parasitoids are actually a complex of morphologically similar congeners, most of which have a rather narrow host range. Ooencyrtus pityocampae (OP), an important egg parasitoid of the pine processionary moth (PPM), is considered a generalist parasitoid. OP emerges from PPM eggs after winter hibernation, mainly in spring and early summer, long before the eggs of the next PPM generation occurs. The occurrence of OP in eggs of the variegated caper bug (CB) Stenozygum coloratum in spring and summer suggests that OP populations alternate seasonally between PPM and CB. However, the identity of OP population on CB eggs seemed uncertain; unlike OP-PPM populations, the former displayed apparently high male/female ratios and lack of attraction to the PPM sex pheromone. We studied the molecular identities of the two populations since the morphological identification of the genus Ooencyrtus, and OP in particular, is difficult. Sequencing of COI and ITS2 DNA fragments and AFLP analysis of individuals from both hosts revealed no apparent differences between the OP-PPM and the OP-CB populations for both the Israeli and the Turkish OPs, which therefore supported the possibility of host alternation. Sequencing data extended our knowledge of the genetic structure of OP populations in the Mediterranean area, and revealed clear separation between East and West Mediterranean populations. The overall level of genetic diversity was rather small, with the Israeli population much less diverse than all others; possible explanations for this finding are discussed. The findings support the possibility of utilizing the CB and other hosts for enhancing biological control of the PPM."
https://openalex.org/W1999238307,"Countries in eastern Africa have set aside significant proportions of their land for protection. But are these areas representative of the diverse range of species and habitats found in the region? And do conservation efforts include areas where the state of biodiversity is likely to deteriorate without further interventions? Various studies have addressed these questions at global and continental scales. However, meaningful conservation decisions are required at finer geographical scales. To operate more effectively at the national level, finer scale baseline data on species and on higher levels of biological organization such as the eco-regions are required, among other factors. Here we adopted a recently developed high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map for eastern Africa as a baseline to more effectively identify conservation priorities. We examined how well different potential natural vegetations (PNVs) are represented in the protected area (PA) network of eastern Africa and used a multivariate environmental similarity index to evaluate biases in PA versus PNV coverage. We additionally overlaid data of anthropogenic factors that potentially influence the natural vegetation to assess the level of threat to different PNVs. Our results indicate substantial differences in the conservation status of PNVs. In addition, particular PNVs in which biodiversity protection and ecological functions are at risk due to human influences are revealed. The data and approach presented here provide a step forward in developing more transparent and better informed translation from global priorities to regional or national implementation in eastern Africa, and are valid for other geographic regions."
https://openalex.org/W2058131922,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistent infection is associated with ineffective immune response for the clearance of virus. Immunomodulators represent an important class of therapeutics, which potentially could be beneficial for the treatment of HBV infection. The particulate yeast-derived glucan (PYDG) has been shown to enhance the innate and adaptive immune responses. We therefore, assessed the efficacy of PYDG in enhancing HBV specific immune responses by employing the hydrodynamic injection-based (HDI) HBV transfection mouse model. Mice were intragatric administered PYDG daily for 9 weeks post pAAV/HBV1.2 hydrodynamic injection. PYDG treatment significantly promoted HBV DNA clearance and production of HBsAb compared to control mice. PYDG treatment resulted in recruitment of macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) and effector T cells to the liver microenvironment, accompanied by a significantly augmented DCs maturation and HBV-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α production by T cell. In addition, enhanced production of Th1 cytokines in liver tissue interstitial fluid (TIF) was associated with PYDG administration. Live imaging showed the accumulation of PYDG in the mouse liver. Our results demonstrate that PYDG treatment significantly enhances HBV-specific Th1 immune responses, accompanied by clearance of HBV DNA, and therefore holds promise for further development of therapeutics against chronic hepatitis B."
https://openalex.org/W2065182138,"The magnitude of variation in economic costs of tobacco consumption among socio-economic status (SES) groups in Nigeria is unclear. Understanding the factors that influence tobacco use and expenditure among different socio-economic groups would inform decisions on interventions for tobacco control in Nigeria. Secondary data was obtained from the 2008 National demographic and health survey. Information on tobacco use and expenditure in households and individual males were extracted from the database. A total of 34,070 households and 15,846 individual males were sampled. Analysis was done using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis. Information on wealth index obtained were categorized into socio-economic quintile groups (Q1 to Q5), representing poorest to richest socio-economic groups. To estimate expenditure on cigarettes, the average cost of a stick of cigarette was obtained and multiplied with the number of sticks smoked per day. The proportion of households that use tobacco in Nigeria is 5.25% with a greater percentage (89.6%) residing in the rural areas. Prevalence of cigarette smoking in individual males is 8.59%, and the poorer SES group smoked more cigarettes (20.9%) and spent more (0.60–1.19USD) than the richest SES group. Low education level, traditional beliefs, literacy levels, SES and employment status all influence cigarette smoking in adult males. Although poor people smoked more and spent more of their income on cigarettes, other factors like educational level and traditional beliefs were found to influence practice of cigarette smoking in men. This implies that tobacco control legislation through increased taxes alone may not effectively reduce the use of tobacco and its products in Nigeria. A consolidated approach that includes behavioral change procedures, enforcing bans on tobacco advertisement and the use of strong graphic anti-tobacco messages targeted at both the poor and rich as well as the educated and uneducated need to be effected to reduce tobacco use."
https://openalex.org/W2140169896,"Background The benefits of a decreased slice thickness and/or in-plane voxel size in carotid MRI for atherosclerotic plaque component quantification accuracy and biomechanical peak cap stress analysis have not yet been investigated in detail because of practical limitations. Methods In order to provide a methodology that allows such an investigation in detail, numerical simulations of a T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced, 2D MRI sequence were employed. Both the slice thickness (2 mm, 1 mm, and 0.5 mm) and the in plane acquired voxel size (0.62x0.62 mm2 and 0.31x0.31 mm2) were varied. This virtual MRI approach was applied to 8 histology-based 3D patient carotid atherosclerotic plaque models. Results A decreased slice thickness did not result in major improvements in lumen, vessel wall, and lipid-rich necrotic core size measurements. At 0.62x0.62 mm2 in-plane, only a 0.5 mm slice thickness resulted in improved minimum fibrous cap thickness measurements (a 2–3 fold reduction in measurement error) and only marginally improved peak cap stress computations. Acquiring voxels of 0.31x0.31 mm2 in-plane, however, led to either similar or significantly larger improvements in plaque component quantification and computed peak cap stress. Conclusions This study provides evidence that for currently-used 2D carotid MRI protocols, a decreased slice thickness might not be more beneficial for plaque measurement accuracy than a decreased in-plane voxel size. The MRI simulations performed indicate that not a reduced slice thickness (i.e. more isotropic imaging), but the acquisition of anisotropic voxels with a relatively smaller in-plane voxel size could improve carotid plaque quantification and computed peak cap stress accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2328985165,"Introduction Severe cervical contracture after burns causes obvious impairment of neck movement and the aesthetic silhouette. Although various surgical techniques for treatment have been described, there is not a definitive strategy to guide treatment. Over the past 6 years, we have been utilizing a region-oriented and staged treatment strategy to guide reconstruction of severe cervical contracture. Satisfactory results have been achieved with this strategy. Methods The first stage of treatment focuses on the anterior cervical region and submental region. Procedures include cicatrix resection, contracture release, division and elevation of the platysma to form two platysma flaps, and skin grafting. Three to six months later, the second stage treatment is performed, which localize to the mental region. This includes scar resection, correction of the lower lip eversion, and reconstruction with free (para)scapular skin flap. Three subtypes of cervicomental angle that we proposed were measured as quantitative tool for evaluation of the reconstruction. Results 24 patients who completed the treatment were reviewed. By the 3rd postoperative month, their CM angles changed significantly: the soft tissue CM angle was reduced from 135.0° ± 17.3° to 111.1° ± 11.3°, the osseous CM angle increased from 67.1° ± 9.0° to 90.5° ± 11.6° and the dynamic CM angle increased from 21.9° ± 8.7° to 67.4° ± 13.1°. 22 in 24 (91.7%) of these patients gained notable improvement of cervical motion and aesthetic contour. Conclusions Our results suggest that the region-oriented and staged treatment strategy can achieve satisfactory functional and aesthetic results, combining usage of both skin graft and skin flap while minimizing the donor site morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2086797885,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) volume and left ventricular global torsion on cardiac function by real time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3DE) and two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging(2D-STI), to determine the accuracy of RT-3DE and 2D-STI in assessing LV function.Thirty New Zealand rabbit models of with LVA were prepared by ligation of the middle segment of the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. Four weeks post-procedure, RT-3DE was conducted to obtain data on LVEF, left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LVA volume (LVAV), Peak rotation angles at the mitral valve annulus level (MV-ROT), peak rotation angles at the apical level (AP-ROT), and left ventricular global torsion angles (LV-TOR) were measured by 2D-STI.Compared with controls, LVEDV and LVESV were significantly increased in the LVA group, while LVEF, MV-ROT, AP-ROT, and LV-TOR were consistently reduced (p<0.01). Moreover, LVEF correlated with LVA volume and LV torsion angle (r= -0.778 and 0.821, p<0.01). LVA volume/LVEDV had the strongest inverse relationship with LVEF (r= -0.911, p<0.01).LVA volume, LVA volume/LVEDV, and LV torsion may be used as an indicator for evaluation of cardiac function after LVA. Moreover, LVA volume/LVEDV may be a more sensitive and reliable marker of cardiac function after LVA formation."
https://openalex.org/W2327693434,"Understanding spontaneous transitions between dynamical modes in a network is of significant importance. These transitions may separate pathological and normal functions of the brain. In this paper, we develop a set of measures that, based on spatio-temporal features of network activity, predict autonomous network transitions from asynchronous to synchronous dynamics under various conditions. These metrics quantify spike-timing distributions within a narrow time window as a function of the relative location of the active neurons. We applied these metrics to investigate the properties of these transitions in excitatory-only and excitatory-and-inhibitory networks and elucidate how network topology, noise level, and cellular heterogeneity affect both the reliability and the timeliness of the predictions. The developed measures can be calculated in real time and therefore potentially applied in clinical situations."
https://openalex.org/W2067930577,"Background Perioperative chemotherapy increases the overall and progression-free survival of patients suffering from resectable adenocarcinomas of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction and stomach (GEC). Comparing different chemotherapy regimens platin-based protocols with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/calcium folinate (CF) or oral fluoropyrimidines were favorable in terms of efficacy and side-effects. However, there is no consensus which regimen is the most efficacious. Methods 42 consecutive patients with resectable GEC (UICC II and III) were treated with 3 pre- and postoperative chemotherapy cycles each consisting of epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (EOX). We analyzed the overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity retrospectively in comparison to published data. Results The median overall survival in our cohort was 29 months and the progression-free survival was 17 months. The most frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities during preoperative chemotherapy were diarrhea (16.7%), leukocytopenia (9.5%) and nausea (9.5%); overall 38.1% of our patients suffered from grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Surgery was carried out in 83% of our patients, 69% of those achieved R0 resection. Conclusion Comparing our data with the results of previously published randomized trials EOX is at least non-inferior with regard to overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity. In conclusion, EOX is an appropriate perioperative therapy for patients with resectable GEC."
