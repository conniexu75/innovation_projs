https://openalex.org/W2101759139,"We demonstrate an essential role for the proteasome complex in two proteolytic processes required for activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The p105 precursor of the p50 subunit of NF-κB is processed in vitro by an ATP-dependent process that requires proteasomes and ubiquitin conjugation. The C-terminal region of p105 is rapidly degraded, leaving the N-terminal p50 domain. p105 processing can be blocked in intact cells with inhibitors of the proteasome or in yeast with proteasome mutants. These inhibitors also block the activation of NF-κB and the rapid degradation of IκBα induced by tumor necrosis factor α. Thus, the ubiquitinproteasome pathway functions not only in the complete degradation of polypeptides, but also in the regulated processing of precursors into active proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2002223631,"The role of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system in c-Jun breakdown was investigated. Using in vitro experiments and a novel in vivo assay that utilizes molecularly-tagged ubiquitin and c-Jun proteins, it was shown that c-Jun, but not its transforming counterpart, retroviral v-Jun, can be efficiently multiubiquitinated. Consistently, v-Jun has a longer half-life than c-Jun. Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the reason for the escape of v-Jun from multiubiquitination and its resulting stabilization is the deletion of the delta domain, a stretch of 27 amino acids that is present in c-Jun but not in v-Jun. c-Jun sequences containing the delta domain, when transferred to the bacterial beta-galactosidase protein, function as a cis-acting ubiquitination and degradation signal. The correlation between transforming ability and the escape from ubiquitin-dependent degradation described here suggests a novel route to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2052172628,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an immunomodulatory cytokine secreted by activated T lymphocytes, basophils, and mast cells. It plays an important role in modulating the balance of T helper (Th) cell subsets, favoring expansion of the Th2 lineage relative to Th1. Imbalance of these T lymphocyte subsets has been implicated in immunological diseases including allergy, inflammation, and autoimmune disease. IL-4 may mediate its biological effects, at least in part, by activating a tyrosine-phosphorylated DNA binding protein. This protein has now been purified and its encoding gene cloned. Examination of the primary amino acid sequence of this protein indicates that it is a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) family of DNA binding proteins, hereby designated IL-4 Stat. Study of the inhibitory activities of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the IL-4 receptor provided evidence for direct coupling of receptor and transcription factor during the IL-4 Stat activation cycle. Such observations indicate that IL-4 Stat has the same functional domain for both receptor coupling and dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W1993584057,"Sodium ion (Na+) channels, which initiate the action potential in electrically excitable cells, are the molecular targets of local anesthetic drugs. Site-directed mutations in transmembrane segment S6 of domain IV of the Na+ channel alpha subunit from rat brain selectively modified drug binding to resting or to open and inactivated channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation F1764A, near the middle of this segment, decreased the affinity of open and inactivated channels to 1 percent of the wild-type value, resulting in almost complete abolition of both the use-dependence and voltage-dependence of drug block, whereas mutation N1769A increased the affinity of the resting channel 15-fold. Mutation I1760A created an access pathway for drug molecules to reach the receptor site from the extracellular side. The results define the location of the local anesthetic receptor site in the pore of the Na+ channel and identify molecular determinants of the state-dependent binding of local anesthetics."
https://openalex.org/W2063225252,"The opposing effects of SF2/ASF and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 influence alternative splicing in vitro. SF2/ASF or hnRNP A1 complementary DNAs were transiently overexpressed in HeLa cells, and the effect on alternative splicing of several cotransfected reporter genes was measured. Increased expression of SF2/ASF activated proximal 5' splice sites, promoted inclusion of a neuron-specific exon, and prevented abnormal exon skipping. Increased expression of hnRNP A1 activated distal 5' splice sites. Therefore, variations in the intracellular levels of antagonistic splicing factors influence different modes of alternative splicing in vivo and may be a natural mechanism for tissue-specific or developmental regulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2066537459,"SecA, the peripheral subunit of E. coli preprotein translocase, alternates between a membrane inserted and a deinserted state as part of the catalytic cycle of preprotein translocation. When SecA is complexed with SecY/E and preprotein, ATP drives a profound conformational change, leading to membrane insertion of a 30 kDa domain of SecA. The inserted domain is protease-inaccessible from the cytosolic side of the membrane, but becomes accessible upon membrane disruption. Concomitant with 30 kDa domain insertion, approximately 20 aminoacyl residues of the preprotein are translocated. Additional ATP, which may be hydrolyzed at the second ATP site of SecA, releases the translocated preprotein and allows the 30 kDa domain to deinsert, whence it can exchange with cytosolic SecA. Thus, SecA is the mobile subunit of an integral membrane transporter, consuming ATP during both the insertion and deinsertion phases of its catalytic cycle while guiding preprotein segments across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2128565374,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE), particularly the e4 allele, is genetically linked to the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is present in the extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles associated with Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, apoE has been shown to bind beta-amyloid (A beta), an amyloidogenic proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein. To analyze the interaction of A beta and apoE, we used Western immunoblotting of human A beta-(1-40)-peptide incubated with conditioned medium from HEK-293 cells transfected with either human apoE3 or apoE4 (products of the e3 and e4 alleles, respectively) cDNA. Nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of an approximately 45-kDa complex with both A beta and apoE immunoreactivity. The level of the apoE3.A beta complex was approximately 20-fold greater than that of the apoE4.A beta complex. This apoE isoform-specific binding pattern was maintained from pH 5.0 to 9.0, from 2 min to 24 h of peptide incubation, and at concentrations of apoE from 5 to 100 micrograms/ml and of A beta from 10 microM to 1 mM. The higher level of apoE3 binding to A beta is in contrast to previously published data using purified apoE (Strittmatter, W. J., Weisgraber, K.H., Huang, D. Y., Dong, L.-M., Salvesen, G. S., Pericak-Vance, M., Schmechel, D., Saunders, A. M., Goldgaber, D., and Roses, A.D. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 8098-8102). Factors responsible for the isoform-specific interactions between apoE and A beta will require further study before the apparent discrepancy between these data can be reconciled."
https://openalex.org/W1996862455,"In nerve terminals, Ca(2+)-stimulated synaptic vesicle exocytosis is rapidly followed by endocytosis. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis requires clathrin-coated pits similar to receptor-mediated endocytosis in fibroblasts. Binding of clathrin AP-2 (adaptor complex) to an unidentified high affinity membrane receptor appears to be necessary for coated pit assembly in fibroblasts. We now show that synaptic vesicles have a high affinity AP-2 site (KD, approximately 1 x 10(-10) M) similar to the one observed in fibroblasts. Using a combination of competition and direct binding assays, we demonstrate that synaptotagmin I, an intrinsic membrane protein of synaptic vesicles, has all of the properties of the AP-2 receptor and that AP-2 binds to the second C2 domain in the molecule. Thus, synaptotagmin I may be a multifunctional protein with a function in endocytosis in addition to the previously proposed role in exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014770336,"To identify proteins that may participate in the activation of the protein kinase Raf, proteins that interact with Raf were selected in a two-hybrid screen. Two members of the 14-3-3 protein family were isolated that interacted with both the amino terminal regulatory regions of Raf and the kinase domain of Raf, but did not compete with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras for binding to Raf. 14-3-3 proteins associated with Raf in mammalian cells and accompanied Raf to the membrane in the presence of activated Ras. In yeast cells expressing Raf and MEK, mammalian 14-3-3 ζ or 14-3-3 ζ activated Raf to a similar extent as did expression of Ras. Therefore, 14-3-3 proteins may participate in or be required for the regulation of Raf function. These findings suggest a role for 14-3-3 proteins in Raf-mediated signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1533259206,"Several manganic porphyrins, with substituents on the methine bridge carbons, were prepared and examined for stability, redox behavior, catalysis of the dismutation of superoxide radical (O2-), and the ability to protect a superoxide dismutase (SOD)-null strain of E. coli against dissolved oxygen and a SOD-competent strain against paraquat. All of the compounds tested exhibited reversible redox behavior and were stable to EDTA in both the oxidized and reduced states, and several were able to catalyze the dismutation of O2- with the rate constants of approximately 10(7) M-1 s-1. The marked protective effects of some of these compounds exceeded that which could be anticipated on the basis of such rate constants. The tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) compound was reduced enzymatically at the expense of NADPH and nonenzymatically by GSH and was kept in the reduced state within E. coli. Since the rate constant for reoxidation of the reduced form by O2- is 4 x 10(9) M-1 s-1, it appears that this compound acts in vivo as an NADPH/GSH:O2- oxidoreductase rather than as an SOD mimic. Its ability to facilitate aerobic growth of the SOD-null strain can be explained on this basis."
https://openalex.org/W1997408971,"We show here that the state of the p34cdc2p56cdc13 mitotic B cyclin complex determines whether a fission yeast cell undergoes S phase or mitosis. Mutants defective for p56cdc13 reset to G1 and rereplicate their DNA, while cells completely lacking the p34cdc2p56cdc13 complex undergo multiple rounds of S phase. In contrast, formation of the p34cdc2p56cdc13 complex in G1 promotes cells inappropriately into mitosis. We propose that the temporal order of S phase and mitosis is maintained by the presence or absence of the p34cdc2p56cdc13 complex."
https://openalex.org/W1510633031,"The respiratory burst oxidase catalyzes the production of O2.- from oxygen and NADPH. It is dormant in resting cells but becomes active when the cells are stimulated. Activation is accompanied by the phosphorylation of multiple serines in the cytosolic oxidase component p47phox, which moves from cytosol to the membrane during oxidase activation. Using immunopurified p47phox isolated from 32Pi-loaded neutrophils activated with phorbol myristate acetate, we showed that all the 32P was in the C-terminal CNBr fragment of the protein, and that in that fragment, Ser-303, Ser-304, Ser-320, Ser-328, Ser-345, and Ser-348 and at least one of the three serines, Ser-359, Ser-370, and Ser-379, were phosphorylated, while Ser-282, Ser-287, Ser-381, and Ser-388 were not. Of the phosphorylated serines, Ser-303, Ser-304, Ser-320, and Ser-328 are located in protein kinase C substrate sequences. Ser-345 and Ser-348, however, are located in sequences recognized by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (-PXSP-). This finding suggests that MAP kinase or a related proline-directed kinase may participate in the regulation of O2.- production by activated neutrophils. The tryptic peptide map of p47phox phosphopeptides from neutrophils activated by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine closely resembled that of p47phox phosphopeptides from phorbol-activated cells, suggesting that the same serines were phosphorylated in response to each agent."
https://openalex.org/W2029381805,"Intracellular signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases in mammalian cells results in activation of a signal cascade that includes the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras and the protein kinases Raf, MEK [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase], and MAPK. MAPK activation that is dependent on the coupling of Ras and Raf was reconstituted in yeast. Yeast genes were isolated that, when overexpressed, enhanced the function of Raf. One of them is identical to BMH1, which encodes a protein similar to members of the mammalian 14-3-3 family. Bacterially synthesized mammalian 14-3-3 protein stimulated the activity of Raf prepared from yeast cells expressing c-Raf-1. Thus, the 14-3-3 protein may participate in or be required for activation of Raf."
https://openalex.org/W1602747859,"Four distinct isoforms of the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) have been identified by molecular cloning. Three of these (NHE-1, NHE-2, and NHE-3) have been shown to be functionally active by heterologous expression. Their kinetic and pharmacological properties are well documented, yet comparatively little is known about their regulation. In this report, rat NHE-1, NHE-2, and NHE-3 were stably transfected into antiporter-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells to study their role in cellular proliferation and their regulation by nucleotides and cell volume. Their ability to influence cell proliferation was assessed by measuring the growth of antiporter-deficient cells and of the different transfectants in media of varying pH. While antiporter-deficient cells were unable to grow at acidic pH levels, all three isoforms supported proliferation under these conditions. Therefore, while the epithelia-specific isoforms (NHE-2 and NHE-3) are thought to play primarily a role in transcellular ion transport, they can also contribute to intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and have a permissive role in cell growth. The activity of the three isoforms was markedly inhibited by depletion of cellular ATP. In the pHi 6.0-7.2 range, decreases in the affinity for internal H+ and/or the maximal rate of transport accounted for the inhibitory effect, depending on the isoform. The osmotic responsiveness of the three isoforms was also compared. As reported earlier, NHE-1 was stimulated by hypertonicity. Under similar conditions, NHE-2 was also stimulated to a comparable extent. Conversely, both isoforms were inhibited in hypotonic media. In contrast, NHE-3 was markedly inhibited by hypertonic cell shrinking but was unaffected by hypotonicity. Osmotic inhibition of NHE-3 was rapid, reversible, and apparent throughout the pH range studied. Osmotic inhibition of NHE-3 may play a role in the physiology and pathophysiology of epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1999980020,"Using limited proteolysis, we show that the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase α subunit consists of an N-terminal domain comprised of amino acids 8241, a C-terminal domain comprised of amino acids 249329, and an unstructured and/or flexible interdomain linker. We have carried out a detailed structural and functional analysis of an 85 amino acid proteolytic fragment corresponding to the C-terminal domain (αCTD-2). Our results establish that αCTD-2 has a defined secondary structure (∼40% α helix, ∼0% β sheet). Our results further establish that αCTD-2 is a dimer and that αCTD-2 exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Our results suggest a model for the mechanism of involvement of α in transcription activation by promoter upstream elements and upstream-binding activator proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2049145056,"Anterior patterning of the Drosophila embryo is specified by the localized expression of the gap genes, which is controlled by the gradient of the maternal morphogen bicoid (bcd). Another maternal component, hunchback (hb), can substitute for bcd in the thorax and abdomen. Here we show that hb is required for bcd to execute all of its functions. Removal of both maternal and zygotic hb produces embryos with disrupted polarity that fail to express all known bcd target genes correctly. Proper expression of hb and the head gap genes requires synergistic activation by hb and bcd. We propose that it is the combined activity of bcd and hb, and not bcd alone, that forms the morphogenetic gradient that specifies polarity along the embryonic axis and patterns the embryo. bcd may be a newly acquired Drosophila gene, which is gradually replacing some of the functions performed by maternal hb in other species."
https://openalex.org/W2070665377,"The evolutionary origins of the protistan phylum, Myxozoa, have long been questioned. Although these obligate parasites are like protozoans in many features, several aspects of their ontogeny and morphology have implied a closer relationship to metazoan lineages. Phylogenetic analyses of 18S ribosomal RNA sequences from myxozoans and other eukaryotes, with the use of parsimony, distance, and maximum-likelihood methods, support the hypothesis that myxozoans are closely related to the bilateral animals. These results suggest that the Myxozoa, long considered an assemblage of protozoans, should be considered a metazoan phylum."
https://openalex.org/W2009433219,"The organization of the hippocampus is generally thought of as a series of cell groups that form a unidirectionally excited chain, regulated by localized inhibitory circuits. With the use of in vivo intracellular labeling, histochemical, and extracellular tracing methods, a longitudinally widespread, inhibitory feedback in rat brain from the CA1 area to the CA3 and hilar regions was observed. This long-range, cross-regional inhibition may allow precise synchronization of population activity by timing the occurrence of action potentials in the principal cells and may contribute to the coordinated induction of synaptic plasticity in distributed networks."
https://openalex.org/W2082602549,"Plants contain most of the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in conjugated forms believed to be inactive in promoting growth. The iaglu gene, which controls the first step in the biosynthesis of the IAA conjugates of Zea mays, encodes (uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose:indol-3-ylacetyl)-beta-D-glucosyl transferase. Protein synthesized by Escherichia coli that contained cloned 1-O-beta-D-indol-3-ylacetyl-glucose complementary DNA (cDNA) was catalytically active. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme. Homologous nucleotide sequences were found in all plants tested. The blockage or enhancement of iaglu expression may permit regulation of plant growth."
https://openalex.org/W2009509451,"The replicase of E. coli, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, is tightly fastened to DNA by its ring-shaped beta sliding clamp. However, despite being clamped to DNA, the polymerase must rapidly cycle on and off DNA to synthesize thousands of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. This study shows that DNA polymerase III holoenzyme cycles from one DNA to another by a novel mechanism of partial disassembly of its multisubunit structure and then reassembly. Upon completing a template, the polymerase disengages from its beta clamp, hops off DNA, and reassociates with another beta clamp at a new primed site. The original beta clamp is left on DNA and may be harnessed by other machineries to coordinate their action with chromosome replication."
https://openalex.org/W1964618468,"The formation of specific connections in the developing central nervous system is thought to result from mechanisms that increase the strengths of synapses at which pre- and postsynaptic activity are correlated and decrease it otherwise. In the visual cortex, initially widespread inputs normally sort out into eye-specific patches during early life. If only one eye can see during this period, its patches are much larger than normal, and patches from the occluded eye become much smaller. Anatomical experiments here show that closed-eye inputs expand within a region of cortex that is silenced, establishing that inhibition of common target cells gives less active inputs a competitive advantage."
https://openalex.org/W1490342290,"Sphingomyelin (SM) is a membrane phosphosphingolipid that has recently been identified as a key component of the SM cycle. In this signal transduction pathway, extracellular inducers such as tumor necrosis factor alpha cause hydrolysis of membrane SM, resulting in the generation of the lipid second messenger ceramide. Only 10-20% of cellular SM appears to be involved in the SM cycle, raising the possibility of the existence of a unique pool of SM. The existence and subcellular location of such a pool were investigated. Using bacterial sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus (bSMase), we first characterized two pools of SM, identified as an outer leaflet bSMase-sensitive pool and a distinct bSMase-resistant pool. These pools were further characterized by their differential solubility in Triton X-100 and by their kinetics of labeling. The signaling pool of SM was distinguished by the following: 1) resistance to bSMase, 2) solubility in Triton X-100, and 3) delayed labeling kinetics. In subfractionation studies, the signaling pool of SM co-fractionated with the plasma membrane. Since the SM cycle involves a cytosolic sphingomyelinase and the intracellular release of choline phosphate, this pool of SM appears to localize to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (or to a closely related compartment). These results identify a unique signaling pool of SM that undergoes significant hydrolysis (20-40%) in response to inducers of the SM cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2053211842,"E. coli cells harboring pCG169 containing the secD secF locus possessed SecA protein almost entirely in an integral membrane form in which it displayed normal protein translocation activity. These results imply that integral membrane SecA is the catalytically active form of this enzyme and that products of the secD secF locus regulate SecA association with the inner membrane. Protease and biotinylation accessibility studies of right side-out and inside-out membrane vesicles derived from this strain revealed that SecA was exposed to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane. These studies suggest a model of bacterial protein secretion, whereby insertion of SecA into the inner membrane and its association with SecY/E/G promotes assembly of active protein-conducting channels comprised in part of integral membrane SecA protein, and products of the secD secF locus regulate the channel assembly-disassembly reaction by modulating the SecA insertion-deinsertion step.

https://openalex.org/W1480846298,"We have previously demonstrated that the V0 domain of the coated vesicle V-ATPase, a 250-kDa integral complex, does not form a functional proton channel (Zhang, J., Myers, M., and Forgac, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9773-9778). In the present study we describe dissociation of the V0 complex and separation of the V0 subunits by gel filtration. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-inhibitable passive proton conductance of reconstituted vesicles containing reassembled V0 subunits was measured in response to a K+/valinomycin-generated membrane potential. We observed that reconstituted vesicles containing the 17/19-kDa subunits carried out passive proton transport, with the addition of the 38- and 100-kDa subunits increasing proton conductance. Reconstituted vesicles containing the 38- and/or 100-kDa subunits showed no proton transport. Partial separation of the 17- and 19-kDa subunits revealed that the 17-kDa subunit alone carried out proton transport, with increased conductance on the addition of the 19-kDa subunit. These results indicate that the V0 domain possesses the information necessary to form a dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-inhibitable passive proton channel. Bafilomycin binding by native and reassembled V0 complexes was also measured by their ability to protect V-ATPase activity against bafilomycin inhibition. The native V0 domain, the isolated 100-kDa subunit and the 100/38-kDa subunits were able to protect against inhibition by bafilomycin, suggesting that the binding site for bafilomycin resides on the 100-kDa subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1495670687,"Previously, we have cloned a candidate for the 595-amino acid neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor called NF2 or Merlin, with striking sequence similarity in its N-terminal half to an F-actin-binding protein family called TERM, which includes talin, ezrin, radixin, and moesin (Trofatter, J. A., MacCollin, M. M., Rutter, J. L., Murrell, J. R., Duyao, M. P., Parry, D. M., Eldridge, R., Kley, N., Menon, A. G., Pulaski, K., Haase, V. H., Ambrose, C. M., Munro, D., Bove, C., Haines, J. L., Martuza, R. L., MacDonald, M. E., Seizinger, B. R., Short, M. P., Buckler, A. J., and Gusella, J. F. (1993) Cell 72, 791-800). In an attempt to determine whether NF2 serves as a tumor suppressor and if so whether its N-terminal half is involved in its anti-oncogenicity, both full-length NF2 and its N-terminal half (NF2-N, residues 9-359) have been expressed in v-Ha-Ras-transformed NIH/3T3 cells. Like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) fragments (Nur-E-Kamal, M. S. A., Varga, M., and Maruta, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22331-22337), full-length NF2 can reverse the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, i.e. anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar, and restore contact inhibition of cell growth, indicating that NF2 is indeed a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, NF2-N also suppresses the Ras-induced malignant phenotype, although it appears to be less effective than the full-length NF2. These observations indicate that the anti-Ras function of NF2 resides in part in its N-terminal half. Thus, NF2 appears to be a new member of the tumor suppressor family of actin-cytoskeleton-associated proteins, which includes vinculin, alpha-actinin, tropomyosin-1, gelsolin, and tensin."
https://openalex.org/W1833657849,"9-cis Retinoic acid is a highly preferred ligand for the nuclear retinoic acid receptor RXR. Although 9-cis retinoic acid can be formed from all-trans retinoic acid in vivo and in vitro, the nature of the isomerization process has not been defined. 9-cis-Retinoic acid might also be formed biologically from 9-cis beta-carotene, an isomer of beta-carotene commonly found in foods. We have observed that enzyme preparations of rat liver and intestine convert highly purified 9-cis beta-carotene (99.8%) to a mixture of 9-cis, all-trans, and 13-cis retinals. Highly purified all-trans beta-carotene (99.7%) and 13-cis beta-carotene (99%) are primarily converted to all-trans retinal. Several aldehyde dehydrogenases in tissues can convert retinal to retinoic acid. Although the rates of cleavage of 9-cis and 13-cis beta-carotenes are slower than that of the all-trans isomer, the oxidative conversion of 9-cis beta-carotene to 9-cis and all-trans retinals is the first identified enzymatic reaction for the formation of 9-cis retinal in animal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2024307256,"B. hermsii counters host immunity with multiphasic antigenic variation. This is conferred by interplasmidic and intraplasmidic rearrangements of vmp genes. In several independent events, activation of a silent vmp gene through intraplasmidic deletions but not interplasmidic recombinations was followed by the appearance at its 5' end of multiple mutations that were not present in the silent gene. The prevalence of mutant alleles in postwitch populations increased during infections. Differences between the silent and expressed genes were at the same nucleotides at which vmp pseudogenes differed, suggesting these were templates for postswitch gene conversions. The mechanism of this bacterium to generate diversity, namely, intramolecular deletions followed by mutations in the rearranged gene, mirrors the strategy used by vertebrate hosts to eliminate it."
https://openalex.org/W2011940759,"Pulse-probe transient Raman spectroscopy, with probe excitation at 230 nanometers, reveals changes in signals arising from tyrosine and tryptophan residues of the hemoglobin molecule as it moves from the relaxed (R) to the tense (T) state after photodeligation. Signals associated with intersubunit contacts in the T state develop in about 10 microseconds but are preceded by quite different signals, which reach maximum amplitude in about 50 nanoseconds. These signals involve the interior tryptophan residues that bridge the A and E helices by means of H bonds between the indole rings and serine or threonine side chains. Alterations of the H bond strengths, as a result of interhelix motions, can account for the signals. A model is proposed here in which loss of the ligand from the heme binding pocket is concerted with inward motion of the adjacent E helix; this motion, along with a complementary motion of the proximal F helix, transmits the energy associated with heme deligation to the subunit interfaces, leading to the T state rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W1979767529,"A reverse protocol for measurements of molecular binding and reactivity by excited-state quenching has been developed in which the quencher, held at a fixed concentration, is titrated by a photoexcitable probe molecule whose decay is monitored. The binding stoichiometries, affinities, and reactivities of the electron-transfer complexes between cytochrome c (Cc) and cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) were determined over a wide range of ionic strengths (4.5 to 118 millimolar) by the study of photoinduced electron-transfer quenching of the triplet excited state of zinc-substituted Cc (ZnCc) by Fe3+CcP. The 2:1 stoichiometry seen for the binding of Cc to CcP at low ionic strength persists at the physiologically relevant ionic strengths and likely has functional significance. Analysis of the stoichiometric binding and rate constants confirms that one surface domain of CcP binds Cc with a high affinity but with poor electron-transfer quenching of triplet-state ZnCc, whereas a second binds weakly but with a high rate of electron-transfer quenching."

https://openalex.org/W1500422783,"The glucose transporter of the bacterial phosphotransferase system couples vectorial translocation to phosphorylation of the transported sugar. It consists of a transmembrane subunit (IICBGlc) and a hydrophilic subunit (IIAGlc). The IICBGlc subunit consists of two domains. The NH2-terminal IIC domain (residues 1-386) spans the membrane eight times and contains the substrate binding site. The COOH-terminal hydrophilic IIB domain (residues 391-476) is accessible from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. It contains the phosphorylation site (Cys421) and together with the IIC domain catalyzes the transfer of phosphoryl groups from the IIAGlc subunit to the transported solute. Starting from a plasmid vector containing ptsG under an inducible promoter, the IIB and the IIC domains have been subcloned separately, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified by Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography. Approximately 40 mg of IIBGlc-6H and 4 mg of IICGlc-6H could be purified from 1 liter of culture. Cells expressing IIBGlc-6H and IICGlc-6H separately have a three times longer generation time on glucose minimal medium than cells expressing wild-type IICBGlc. The rate of IIBGlc-6H phosphorylation determined in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay is indistinguishable from wild-type IICBGlc. The in vitro specific activity of IICGlc-6H in the presence of excess IIBGlc-6H is 2% of the control. IIBGlc-6H also complements the activity of a IICBGlc mutant with an inactive IIB domain (C421S) indicating that IIC and IIB are flexibly linked such that a free IIB domain can displace an inactive IIB domain from its contact site on the IIC domain. Based on this work, the secondary structure of the IIBGlc domain has been determined by isotope-edited NMR spectroscopy (Golic Grdadolnik, S., Eberstadt, M., Gemmecker, G., Kessler, H., Buhr, A., and Erni, B. (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 219, 945-952)."
https://openalex.org/W2013725032,"All catalytic activities of the Na,K-ATPase have been ascribed to the alpha-subunit; however, normal activity requires the presence of the beta-subunit. Using recombinant baculoviruses to infect insect cells, we demonstrate that the alpha-subunit, without the beta-subunit, has catalytic activity. During the normal catalytic cycle of the Na,K-ATPase, the alpha-subunit is transiently phosphorylated by ATP at an aspartate residue. This phosphorylation requires Na+, in the presence of K+ the enzyme undergoes rapid dephosphorylation. In contrast, phosphorylation of the independent alpha-subunit by ATP occurs in the presence of Mg2+, does not require Na+ or K+, and is not affected by ouabain. The phosphorylation is, however, inhibited by EGTA and increasing ionic strength. Chemical properties of the alpha-subunit phosphointermediate are consistent with phosphorylation at the normal aspartyl residue. Membranes from cells infected with the recombinant alpha baculovirus exhibit an EGTA-sensitive Mg(2+)-ATPase activity that is not present in the uninfected cells. The Mg(2+)-ATPase of the alpha-infected cells is reduced under conditions of high ionic strength and completely inhibited by EGTA. Thus the phosphorylation of the unassociated alpha-subunit is representative of the ATPase activity of the enzyme. These results suggest that the alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase can catalyze an activity not normally associated with the enzyme and demonstrate that the bea-subunit plays an important role in conferring normal activity to the enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1541568526,"Recently, TEM beta-lactamase variants with amino acid substitutions in the active-site pocket of the enzyme have been identified in natural isolates with increased resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. To identify other amino acid substitutions that alter the activity of TEM-1 toward extended-spectrum cephalosporins, a random library was constructed that contained all possible amino acid substitutions over the 3-residue window of 238-241 (ABL numbering). Mutants were selected for 100-fold greater ceftazidime resistance than wild-type. All mutants had a serine substitution at position 238, a lysine or arginine at position 240, and a small amino acid at position 241. The role of each substitution was investigated by constructing individual G238S, E240K, and R241G substitutions as well as the G238S:E240K double mutant. Each enzyme was purified to homogeneity and the kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined using several substrates. The G238S substitution increases catalytic efficiency for both ceftazidime and cefotaxime. However, to achieve large increases in catalytic efficiency, both G238S and the E240K substitutions are required. The R241G substitution results in a small increase in catalytic efficiency for only ceftazidime. The contribution of each residue to the transition-state stabilization energy was found to be additive indicating that the substitutions act independently to change the catalytic properties of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1525718130,"Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I) catalyzes the prenylation of a number of proteins that play important roles in cellular signaling. The recent cDNA cloning of this enzyme (Zhang, F. L., Diehl, R. E., Kohl, N. E., Gibbs, J. B., Giros, B., Casey, P. J., and Omer, C. A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3175-3180) has allowed us to develop an expression system for obtaining large quantities of the enzyme. Co-infection of insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the two subunits of the enzyme results in GGTase I accumulation within the cells to levels of > 20% of cytosolic protein. The recombinant enzyme could be readily purified by ion-exchange chromatography and is shown to possess the activity and specificity of the enzyme obtained from mammalian tissues. Production of the recombinant enzyme allowed us to confirm its identity as a zinc metalloenzyme by direct identification of the metal using atomic absorption spectroscopy. We also identify two substrate analogs that are competitive inhibitors of GGTase I. One is a novel isoprenoid analog, 3-aza-GGPP, which inhibits the enzyme with a Ki of 15 nM. The second inhibitor is the tetrapeptide Cys-Val-Phe-Leu, which exhibits a Ki of 50 nM. The use of these inhibitors, coupled with a steady-state kinetic analysis of the enzyme, reveals that the reaction catalyzed by GGTase I proceeds through a random ordered sequential mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2084343652,"Coaxial stacking of helical elements is a determinant of three-dimensional structure in RNA. In the catalytic center of the Tetrahymena group I intron, helices P4 and P6 are part of a tertiary structural domain that folds independently of the remainder of the intron. When P4 and P6 were fused with a phosphodiester linkage, the resulting RNA retained the detailed tertiary interactions characteristic of the native P4-P6 domain and even required lower magnesium ion concentrations for folding. These results indicate that P4 and P6 are coaxial in the P4-P6 domain and, therefore, in the native ribozyme. Helix fusion could provide a general method for identifying pairs of coaxially stacked helices in biological RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1603373149,"Pervanadate has been shown to rapidly increase the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells. Because one of the most rapidly detectable events following treatment of human T cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) is tyrosine kinase activation, we were interested to determine whether pervanadate could act to induce IL-2-associated events. We show here that pervanadate does act to induce IL-2 signal transduction pathways as determined by induction of mitogenesis and interferon gamma production in normal human T cells and the factor independent T cell line YT. Analysis of signal transduction events shows that pervanadate induces the activity of the src family of tyrosine kinases lck and fyn and the tyrosine phosphorylation of a major IL-2 responsive protein of 97 kDa. Pervanadate does not, however, induce the activity of tyrosine kinases associated with the IL-2 receptor or the phosphorylation of a major IL-2 responsive protein of 116 kDa (Jak-3). Together these data suggest that src family kinase activation is a down stream event following IL-2 stimulation and is not directly associated with the activation of the IL-2 receptor-associated tyrosine kinase. The data also imply that tyrosine phosphorylation of p116/Jak-3 is strictly associated with activation of tyrosine kinases associated with the IL-2 receptor. With the use of pervanadate as a tool, we have established a dissociation of src family kinases with IL-2 receptor activation and imply the involvement of two distinct tyrosine kinase pathways, a receptor-associated pathway closely coupled with Jak-3 phosphorylation and a downstream pathway involving src family kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1578180940,"In plasma the thyroid hormone-binding protein transthyretin (TTR) forms a tight complex with the specific retinol carrier retinol-binding protein (RBP). The Ile-84–>Ser mutation and several other point mutations in TTR are associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, which is characterized by extracellular depositions of amyloid fibrils mainly consisting of mutated TTRs. The interactions with human RBP of recombinant human normal and Ser-84 TTRs were investigated by monitoring the fluorescence anisotropy of RBP-bound retinol. A nearly negligible affinity of the recombinant Ser-84 TTR for RBP was found. This result indicates the participation of a region on the outer surface of TTR that comprises Ile-84 in the recognition of RBP. In preliminary studies the Ser-84 TTR was the only one among several amyloidogenic variant TTRs to display negligible interaction with RBP. Therefore, in general a substantially altered binding of TTR to RBP is not associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. Instead, the altered binding of Ser-84 TTR to RBP appears to be responsible for an abnormal plasma transport of RBP. The recombinant normal TTR exhibits binding properties, in its interaction with human RBP, approximately similar to those of TTR purified from human plasma. Two independent and equivalent RBP binding sites on recombinant normal TTR are characterized by a dissociation constant of about 0.4 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1608351694,"Yeast possess two homologs of the synaptobrevin family of vesicle-associated proteins that are proposed to be involved in membrane recognition and to act as receptors for components of the fusion machinery in neurons. We have previously described the yeast homologs, Snc1 and Snc2, and demonstrated that they localize to secretory vesicles and are required for normal secretion. Yeast lacking Snc protein expression accumulate post-Golgi transport vesicles that contain secretory proteins. Therefore, Snc proteins are essential for the fusion of carrier vesicles with the plasma membrane, and this property appears to have been conserved in evolution. We have now examined whether Snc proteins interact with other components of the late secretory pathway in yeast. Here we show that Snc proteins form a tight genetic and physical interaction with a plasma membrane protein, Sec9. Sec9 is the yeast equivalent of SNAP-25, a second receptor protein from neurons that has been shown to interact with synaptobrevin. We suggest, then, that recognition of the plasma membrane by secretory vesicles may involve the formation of a Snc-Sec9 complex and that this interaction has evolved as a fundamental step in secretory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1516313439,"The receptor for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a member of the seven-transmembrane-spanning, GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor family. We showed that tyrosine at position 106 in transmembrane helix 3 of the TRH receptor directly binds the ring carbonyl of the pyroglutamyl moiety of TRH (Perlman, J. H., Thaw, C. N., Laakkonen L., Bowers, C. Y., Osman, R., and Gershengorn, M. C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 1610-1613). We now show that asparagine at position 110 of transmembrane helix 3 directly interacts with the ring N-H of the TRH pyroglutamyl moiety. Based on these findings and evidence that two transmembrane arginines are important in binding, we developed a three-dimensional model of the TRH receptor binding pocket using molecular modeling and simulation programs. The model places the binding pocket for TRH within the transmembrane domains of the receptor and predicts that multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions are involved in binding TRH. To our knowledge, this is the first model, at an atomic level of detail, of the interaction of a peptide ligand with a GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1584730117,"This investigation was designed to determine how information about the lipid chain melting and structural characteristics of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 monounsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines, a subclass of naturally occurring phospholipids, can be generalized among these lipid molecules. Specifically, 30 molecular species of sn-1 saturated/sn-2 unsaturated monoenoic phosphatidylethanolamines were semi-synthesized. The phase transition behavior of these monoenoic lipids in excess water was studied calorimetrically. The computer-based molecular mechanics approach was used to simulate the energy-minimized structures and to calculate steric energies for the diglyceride moieties of some of the 30 monoenoic lipid molecules, at T < Tm, in various aggregated states. These combined calorimetric and computational studies led to the following results and conclusions. 1) For a homologous series of monoenoic lipids with a common molecular weight and with a cis-double bond at various positions along the sn-2 acyl chain, the characteristic reduction of the main phase transition temperature (Tm) is proposed to be a result of an entropy-driven phenomenon. 2) The maximal decrease in the Tm for bilayers prepared from four series of monoenoic phosphatidylethanolamines containing a sn-2 octadecenoyl chain is shown by interpolation of calorimetric data to occur uniquely when the cis double bond is located commonly between C(10) and C(11) positions from the carboxyl end. 3) Monoenoic phosphatidylethanolamines can be divided into two groups. The Tm values obtained with bilayers of monoenoic lipids within each group can be systematically correlated with their structural parameters, leading to the derivation of two general Tm-structure relationships."

https://openalex.org/W1556885607,"A housekeeping basolateral Cl- channel of rabbit gastric parietal cells, the single channel conductance of which is about 0.3 picosiemens, is opened by prostaglandin E2 and closed by intracellular application of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). In the present patch clamp study, we found a novel GTP gamma S-dependent regulatory mechanism of the Cl- channel. GTP gamma S significantly decreased the open probability of the single Cl- channel without altering unit conductance. An intracellular application of superoxide dismutase (SOD; 100 units/ml) inhibited the GTP gamma S (50 microM)-induced closure of the Cl- channel. SOD plus catalase (100 units/ml) also inhibited the GTP gamma S-induced effect, while catalase alone did not inhibit it. In the absence of GTP gamma S, an intracellular application of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 30 microM) did not affect the Cl- channel current. Desferrioxamine (50 microM) which inhibits hydroxyl radical (.OH) production was without effect on the GTP gamma S-induced closure. These results suggest that the GTP gamma S-induced closure of the Cl- channel was due to intracellular production of superoxide (O2.-), but not due to .OH or H2O2. Furthermore, an artificial production of O2.- inside the cell by lumazine (50-100 microM) plus xanthine oxidase (0.5-1 milliunit/ml) in the absence of GTP gamma S also closed the channel. The lumazine/xanthine oxidase-induced closure of the channel was inhibited by SOD, but not by catalase or desferrioxamine. We conclude from these results that GTP-binding protein-coupled production of O2.- leads to closure of the Cl- channel in rabbit gastric parietal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1505233742,"In membrane lipids of the prokaryote Acholeplasma laidlawii similar phase equilibria and a nearly constant spontaneous curvature are maintained by an extensive metabolic regulation of especially the major polar lipids monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG) and diglucosyldiacylglycerol (DGlcDAG), forming nonlamellar and lamellar phases, respectively. A constant surface charge density is maintained by the anionic phospholipid fraction. These lipids are synthesized from phosphatidic acid in two competing pathways. The in vitro synthesis of MGlcDAG and DGlcDAG were totally lost upon delipidation of the membrane proteins by detergent solubilization or solvent extraction of lyophilized cells. Activities were restored by critical concentrations of anionic lipids, but not by bilayer or nonbilayer zwitterionic phospholipids or glucolipids. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and to a lesser extent certain other anionic lipids, could activate the synthesis of MGlcDAG in lipid bilayers, whereas the synthesis of DGlcDAG was similarly dependent upon PG only. Two endogenous phosphoglucolipids with no activating potency could partially replace the PG activator for the MGlcDAG synthesis but less so for DGlcDAG formation. A change of inert matrix from phosphatidylcholine to DGlcDAG lowered the apparent cooperativity, but enhanced the efficiency, of activation by PG for both glucolipid synthesizing enzymes, most strongly the synthesis of DGlcDAG. These results indicate that the enzymatic formation of MGlcDAG is regulated by the lipid surface charge density, whereas the consecutive step to DGlcDAG is more dependent upon the specific properties of PG. The modulating effect of the surrounding matrix on the activator efficiencies and cooperativity may constitute part of the bilayer-nonbilayer lipid regulation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1521081922,"Enzyme adsorption and inactivation at the solid/liquid interface for subtilisin BPN' show a strong dependence on the nature of the solid surface. Adsorption of BPN' at the solid/liquid interface is considerably greater for a hydrophobic surface than for a hydrophilic one. Likewise, the rate of inactivation of the wild-type BPN' is over five times greater when equilibrated with a hydrophobic surface than with a hydrophilic surface. The rate data from these enzyme inactivation experiments performed at 50 degrees C are best fit by a second-order kinetic equation, suggesting a bimolecular pathway to inactivation. The role of increased surface adsorption on this bimolecular inactivation is discussed in terms of two different mechanisms. Several site-specific variants of subtilisin BPN' have been made in an attempt to alter the surface-inactivation of the wild-type enzyme. The extent of adsorption on the model surfaces is significantly lowered by certain lysine to phenylalanine changes in BPN'. Consequently, the surface autolytic stability shows a 4-fold improvement. The change in surface autolytic stability is achieved even though the basic kinetic parameters (kcat and KM) of the variant enzymes are not significantly different on a soluble substrate. The results provide insights into the use of mutagenesis to probe the mechanism of protein interactions with surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1500418850,"The DNA-bending properties of several C/EBP family proteins, bound to two different sites, have been determined using circular permutation and phasing analyses. All the proteins examined by circular permutation analysis induced a significant distortion in the DNA (40-66 degrees), and this distortion was of the same magnitude at both C/EBP sites. However, phasing analysis revealed that the size of the directed bend induced in the DNA by C/EBP proteins was only 1-4 degrees. Both the magnitude and orientation of the directed bend were affected by the specific sequence of the DNA-binding site. All proteins induced a directed bend of similar magnitude and orientation (toward the minor groove) when bound to the C/EBP site derived from the IgH enhancer, but the induced bend was smaller when the protein was bound to the C/EBP site derived from the VH1 promoter. The study also included a heterodimer between Ig/EBP and ATF4. Similar to C/EBP protein homodimers, this heterodimer induces a small directed bend of 4 degrees oriented toward the minor groove when bound to the enhancer-derived C/EBP site."
https://openalex.org/W1562710137,"An apparently unique enzyme, designated protein NH2-terminal asparagine deamidase (PNAD), that specifically converts NH2-terminal asparagine residues of peptide and protein substrates to aspartic acid, has been isolated to homogeneity from porcine liver by an eight-step procedure. PNAD is a relatively low abundance protein, is readily solubilized, and exists as a monomeric species of approximately 33 kDa. PNAD does not act on internal asparagine residues and requires a free N alpha-amino group. It has reduced or no activity on NH2-terminal asparagine dipeptides and no activity toward free asparagine or asparagine amide. It does not act on any NH2-terminal glutamine substrates. PNAD does not show a strong pH dependence suggesting that the enzyme can act equally well on substrates with ionized or unionized alpha-amino groups. The properties and specificity of PNAD are consistent with those expected for the enzyme required for the ubiquitin-dependent turnover of intracellular proteins that initiate with Met-Asn-. Such proteins should be N alpha-acetylated on the retained initiator methionine and can subsequently be modified by the removal of N-acetyl methionine by acylaminoacid hydrolase. Conversion of the resulting NH2-terminal asparagine to aspartic acid by PNAD would render the protein susceptible to arginylation, polyubiquitinylation and degradation as specified by the N-end rule."
https://openalex.org/W1540478252,"The solution structure of sarafotoxin-c has been determined using NMR spectroscopy. A total of 112 interproton distance constraints derived from two-dimensional NMR spectra were used to calculate a family of structures using a combination of distance geometry and dynamical simulated annealing calculations. The structures reveal a well defined alpha-helix extending from Glu9 to Cys15 and an N-terminal region (Cys1-Asp8) that is tightly constrained by disulfide bonds to Cys residues in the central helix. In contrast, the C-terminal region (His16-Trp21) does not adopt a defined conformation in the final family of structures. This is consistent with the paucity of NMR-derived structural constraints obtained for this region and leads to the suggestion that the C-terminal region oscillates rapidly between a number of substantially different conformers. It is proposed that differences between the central helix of the endothelin and sarafotoxin isopeptides might be important in binding of these ligands by the G protein-coupled endothelin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1569014469,"Sulfate transport was examined in rat liver lysosomes that were isolated from thyroid hormone-treated, thyroidectomized, and control animals. Sulfate uptake was significantly decreased in lysosomes from animals that had received intraperitoneal T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) at a dose of 20 micrograms/100 g body weight. The effect of T3 was maximal by 24 h post-injection and resulted in marked decreases in both Vmax (control: 155 +/- 33 pmol/unit of beta-hexosaminidase/30 s versus T3 treated: 24 +/- 7 pmol/unit of beta-hexosaminidase/30 s) and Km (control: 213 +/- 34 microM versus T3 treated: 92 +/- 6 microM). Thyroidectomy was associated with a significant increase in Vmax (control: 250 pmol/unit of beta-hexosaminidase/30 s versus thyroidectomized: 564 pmol/unit of beta-hexosaminidase/30 s), while Km was not significantly affected. The effect of thyroid hormone on lysosomal sulfate transport appeared to be relatively specific. In contrast to its effect on sulfate transport, T3 treatment had no effect on the uptake of either glucose or N-acetylglucosamine by rat liver lysosomes. Lysosomal pH, acidification in response to Mg/ATP, and the specific activities of alpha-L-iduronidase, beta-hexosaminidase, beta-D-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase were unaffected by T3 administration. Incubation of T3 with lysosomes from control animals had little or no effect on sulfate transport. Treatment of isolated lysosomes with either protein kinase A or alkaline phosphatase resulted in modest stimulation of transport. Thus, T3 does not appear to regulate transport by either direct interaction with the lysosomal transporter or protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. The exact mechanism for the inhibitory effect of T3 on lysosomal sulfate transport remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1812497732,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-1) molecules bind peptide fragments derived from cytosolic antigens, and class II (MHC-2) molecules bind fragments of proteins that enter the endocytic pathway. How peptides of the right affinity and size are generated in vivo is still the focus of intense research. Current data are consistent with the view that precursor peptides of varying length are produced in the cytosol and transported into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen where nascent MHC-1 could sample the peptides for their affinity. High-affinity peptides would form stable complexes with MHC-1, which are resistant to proteolysis by luminal enzymes; peptides unable to bind to MHC-1 presumably undergo proteolysis in the lumen. On the other hand, multiple mechanisms are probably used to load MHC-2. Some proteins denatured in the acidic and reducing environment of the endosomes most likely bind to MHC-2 through the antigen's immunodominant region, and the exposed portions of the antigen are degraded by endosomal proteases. Other antigens must first be proteolysed into peptide fragments, which compete among themselves for binding to MHC-2, whereas heat shock proteins could also contribute peptides for MHC-2 loading. Because of their respective loading modes, there is a partial correlation between the MHC-2 binding affinity of the protein fragments and their in vivo immunodominance, which may not necessarily be the case for MHC-1.— Ojcius, D.

The wild-type OmpA signal peptide, WT, a deletion mutant lacking the amino acid stretch 6-9, delta 6-9, and a substitution mutant with the isoleucine residue at position 8 replaced by asparagine, I8N, were incorporated into mixed lipid vesicles containing negatively charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and zwitterionic 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE). Spin-labeled derivatives of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine containing a nitroxide moiety at the 12th position in the sn-2 acyl chain, 12-PGSL and 12-PESL, respectively, were employed for the ESR experiments. The 12-PGSL and 12-PESL exhibited two-component spectra in the presence of the WT and delta 6-9, but not when I8N was present. Using difference spectroscopy, the number of POPG and POPE molecules associated with an ordered lipid layer surrounding the peptides was estimated. The results suggest that WT exists as a transmembrane monomer in the membrane. The delta 6-9 mutant signal peptide appears to exist either as a transmembrane aggregate or partially inserted into the acyl chain region. The substitution mutant, I8N, has a most probable location near the membrane surface. Among these variants of the OmpA signal peptide, the ability to adopt a transmembrane monomeric orientation correlates well with the export activity."
