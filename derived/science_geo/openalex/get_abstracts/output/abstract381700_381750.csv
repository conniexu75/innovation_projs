https://openalex.org/W2072411272,"Lymphocytes and neutrophils are rapidly depleted by systemic infection. Progenitor cells of the haematopoietic system, such as common myeloid progenitors and common lymphoid progenitors, increase the production of immune cells to restore and maintain homeostasis during chronic infection, but the contribution of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to this process is largely unknown. Here we show, using an in vivo mouse model of Mycobacterium avium infection, that an increased proportion of long-term repopulating HSCs proliferate during M. avium infection, and that this response requires interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) signalling. Thus, the haematopoietic response to chronic bacterial infection involves the activation not only of intermediate blood progenitors but of long-term repopulating HSCs as well. IFN-gamma is sufficient to promote long-term repopulating HSC proliferation in vivo; furthermore, HSCs from IFN-gamma-deficient mice have a lower proliferative rate, indicating that baseline IFN-gamma tone regulates HSC activity. These findings implicate IFN-gamma both as a regulator of HSCs during homeostasis and under conditions of infectious stress. Our studies contribute to a deeper understanding of haematological responses in patients with chronic infections such as HIV/AIDS or tuberculosis."

https://openalex.org/W2143747124,"Patient-specific iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells are seen as key to modelling genetic disorders and developing new treatments for them. Now iPS cell lines have been generated by nuclear reprogramming from patients with LEOPARD syndrome, a rare developmental disorder characterized by skin lesions, heart abnormalities and deafness. Cardiomyocytes derived from the resulting LEOPARD iPS cells have hypertrophic properties resembling those typical of the disease — cardiac hypertrophy occurs in 90% of children with the syndrome. The reprogrammed cells feature extensive alterations in various signal transduction pathway components, including RAS–MAPK, some previously described in association with cardiac hypertrophy. Using these cell lines, together with robust differentiation protocols, it may be possible to identify compounds that reverse diseased cellular phenotypes. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with defined genetic disorders promises to help the basic understanding of complex diseases and the development of therapeutics. Here iPSCs have been generated from patients with LEOPARD syndrome, a developmental disorder with pleiomorphic effects on several tissues and organs. The iPSCs are characterized and the phenotype of cardiomyocytes derived from these cells is investigated. The generation of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with defined genetic disorders holds the promise of increased understanding of the aetiologies of complex diseases and may also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic interventions. We have generated iPSCs from patients with LEOPARD syndrome (an acronym formed from its main features; that is, lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth and deafness), an autosomal-dominant developmental disorder belonging to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling diseases, which also includes Noonan syndrome, with pleomorphic effects on several tissues and organ systems1,2. The patient-derived cells have a mutation in the PTPN11 gene, which encodes the SHP2 phosphatase. The iPSCs have been extensively characterized and produce multiple differentiated cell lineages. A major disease phenotype in patients with LEOPARD syndrome is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes from LEOPARD syndrome iPSCs are larger, have a higher degree of sarcomeric organization and preferential localization of NFATC4 in the nucleus when compared with cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells or wild-type iPSCs derived from a healthy brother of one of the LEOPARD syndrome patients. These features correlate with a potential hypertrophic state. We also provide molecular insights into signalling pathways that may promote the disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2056559042,"For the past several decades, we have been able to directly probe the motion of atoms that is associated with chemical transformations and which occurs on the femtosecond (10(-15)-s) timescale. However, studying the inner workings of atoms and molecules on the electronic timescale has become possible only with the recent development of isolated attosecond (10(-18)-s) laser pulses. Such pulses have been used to investigate atomic photoexcitation and photoionization and electron dynamics in solids, and in molecules could help explore the prompt charge redistribution and localization that accompany photoexcitation processes. In recent work, the dissociative ionization of H(2) and D(2) was monitored on femtosecond timescales and controlled using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses. Here we report a molecular attosecond pump-probe experiment based on that work: H(2) and D(2) are dissociatively ionized by a sequence comprising an isolated attosecond ultraviolet pulse and an intense few-cycle infrared pulse, and a localization of the electronic charge distribution within the molecule is measured that depends-with attosecond time resolution-on the delay between the pump and probe pulses. The localization occurs by means of two mechanisms, where the infrared laser influences the photoionization or the dissociation of the molecular ion. In the first case, charge localization arises from quantum mechanical interference involving autoionizing states and the laser-altered wavefunction of the departing electron. In the second case, charge localization arises owing to laser-driven population transfer between different electronic states of the molecular ion. These results establish attosecond pump-probe strategies as a powerful tool for investigating the complex molecular dynamics that result from the coupling between electronic and nuclear motions beyond the usual Born-Oppenheimer approximation."

https://openalex.org/W2057569198,"Elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate synapse formation is required for the understanding of neural wiring, higher brain functions, and mental disorders. Despite the wealth of in vitro information, fundamental questions about how glutamatergic synapses are formed in the mammalian brain remain unanswered. Glutamate receptor (GluR) delta2 is essential for cerebellar synapse formation in vivo. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluRdelta2 interacts with presynaptic neurexins (NRXNs) through cerebellin 1 precursor protein (Cbln1). The synaptogenic activity of GluRdelta2 is abolished in cerebellar primary cultures from Cbln1 knockout mice and is restored by recombinant Cbln1. Knockdown of NRXNs in cerebellar granule cells also hinders the synaptogenic activity of GluRdelta2. Both the NTD of GluRdelta2 and the extracellular domain of NRXN1beta suppressed the synaptogenic activity of Cbln1 in cerebellar primary cultures and in vivo. These results suggest that GluRdelta2 mediates cerebellar synapse formation by interacting with presynaptic NRXNs through Cbln1."

https://openalex.org/W2127284613,"Regulation of the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome is accomplished in large part by controlling transcription elongation. The viral protein Tat hijacks the host cell's RNA polymerase II elongation control machinery through interaction with the positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, and directs the factor to promote productive elongation of HIV mRNA. Here we describe the crystal structure of the Tat.P-TEFb complex containing HIV-1 Tat, human Cdk9 (also known as CDK9), and human cyclin T1 (also known as CCNT1). Tat adopts a structure complementary to the surface of P-TEFb and makes extensive contacts, mainly with the cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb, but also with the T-loop of the Cdk9 subunit. The structure provides a plausible explanation for the tolerance of Tat to sequence variations at certain sites. Importantly, Tat induces significant conformational changes in P-TEFb. This finding lays a foundation for the design of compounds that would specifically inhibit the Tat.P-TEFb complex and block HIV replication."

https://openalex.org/W2089590252,"Salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium (S. enterica sv. Typhimurium) has two metal-transporting P(1)-type ATPases whose actions largely overlap with respect to growth in elevated copper. Mutants lacking both ATPases over-accumulate copper relative to wild-type or either single mutant. Such duplication of ATPases is unusual in bacterial copper tolerance. Both ATPases are under the control of MerR family metal-responsive transcriptional activators. Analyses of periplasmic copper complexes identified copper-CueP as one of the predominant metal pools. Expression of cueP was recently shown to be controlled by the same metal-responsive activator as one of the P(1)-type ATPase genes (copA), and copper-CueP is a further atypical feature of copper homeostasis in S. enterica sv. Typhimurium. Elevated copper is detected by a reporter construct driven by the promoter of copA in wild-type S. enterica sv. Typhimurium during infection of macrophages. Double mutants missing both ATPases also show reduced survival inside cultured macrophages. It is hypothesized that elevated copper within macrophages may have selected for specialized copper-resistance systems in pathogenic microorganism such as S. enterica sv. Typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W2097439505,"Ca(2+) signals through store-operated Ca(2+) (SOC) channels, activated by the depletion of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum, regulate various physiological events. Orai1 is the pore-forming subunit of the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, the best characterized SOC channel. Orai1 is activated by stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1, a Ca(2+) sensor located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Orai1 and STIM1 are crucial for SOC channel activation, but the molecular mechanisms regulating Orai1 function are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) suppresses store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) by phosphorylation of Orai1. PKC inhibitors and knockdown of PKCbeta both resulted in increased Ca(2+) influx. Orai1 is strongly phosphorylated by PKC in vitro and in vivo at N-terminal Ser-27 and Ser-30 residues. Consistent with these results, substitution of endogenous Orai1 with an Orai1 S27A/S30A mutant resulted in increased SOCE and CRAC channel currents. We propose that PKC suppresses SOCE and CRAC channel function by phosphorylation of Orai1 at N-terminal serine residues Ser-27 and Ser-30."
https://openalex.org/W1989976355,"Down's syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by full or partial trisomy of human chromosome 21 and presents with many clinical phenotypes including a reduced incidence of solid tumours. Recent work with the Ts65Dn model of DS, which has orthologues of about 50% of the genes on chromosome 21 (Hsa21), has indicated that three copies of the ETS2 (ref. 3) or DS candidate region 1 (DSCR1) genes (a previously known suppressor of angiogenesis) is sufficient to inhibit tumour growth. Here we use the Tc1 transchromosomic mouse model of DS to dissect the contribution of extra copies of genes on Hsa21 to tumour angiogenesis. This mouse expresses roughly 81% of Hsa21 genes but not the human DSCR1 region. We transplanted B16F0 and Lewis lung carcinoma tumour cells into Tc1 mice and showed that growth of these tumours was substantially reduced compared with wild-type littermate controls. Furthermore, tumour angiogenesis was significantly repressed in Tc1 mice. In particular, in vitro and in vivo angiogenic responses to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were inhibited. Examination of the genes on the segment of Hsa21 in Tc1 mice identified putative anti-angiogenic genes (ADAMTS1and ERG) and novel endothelial cell-specific genes, never previously shown to be involved in angiogenesis (JAM-B and PTTG1IP), that, when overexpressed, are responsible for inhibiting angiogenic responses to VEGF. Three copies of these genes within the stromal compartment reduced tumour angiogenesis, explaining the reduced tumour growth in DS. Furthermore, we expect that, in addition to the candidate genes that we show to be involved in the repression of angiogenesis, the Tc1 mouse model of DS will permit the identification of other endothelium-specific anti-angiogenic targets relevant to a broad spectrum of cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2064860971,"Type A Clostridium perfringens causes poultry necrotic enteritis (NE), an enteric disease of considerable economic importance, yet can also exist as a member of the normal intestinal microbiota. A recently discovered pore-forming toxin, NetB, is associated with pathogenesis in most, but not all, NE isolates. This finding suggested that NE-causing strains may possess other virulence gene(s) not present in commensal type A isolates. We used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies to generate draft genome sequences of seven unrelated C. perfringens poultry NE isolates and one isolate from a healthy bird, and identified additional novel NE-associated genes by comparison with nine publicly available reference genomes. Thirty-one open reading frames (ORFs) were unique to all NE strains and formed the basis for three highly conserved NE-associated loci that we designated NELoc-1 (42 kb), NELoc-2 (11.2 kb) and NELoc-3 (5.6 kb). The largest locus, NELoc-1, consisted of netB and 36 additional genes, including those predicted to encode two leukocidins, an internalin-like protein and a ricin-domain protein. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern blotting revealed that the NE strains each carried 2 to 5 large plasmids, and that NELoc-1 and -3 were localized on distinct plasmids of sizes approximately 85 and approximately 70 kb, respectively. Sequencing of the regions flanking these loci revealed similarity to previously characterized conjugative plasmids of C. perfringens. These results provide significant insight into the pathogenetic basis of poultry NE and are the first to demonstrate that netB resides in a large, plasmid-encoded locus. Our findings strongly suggest that poultry NE is caused by several novel virulence factors, whose genes are clustered on discrete pathogenicity loci, some of which are plasmid-borne."

https://openalex.org/W2068784971,"Vertebrate muscle differentiation is coordinated by an intricate network of transcription factors requiring proliferating myogenic precursors to withdraw irreversibly from the cell cycle. Recent studies have implicated a large number of microRNAs exerting another layer of control in many aspects of muscle differentiation. By annealing to short recognition sequences in the 3'-untranslated region, microRNAs attenuate target gene expression through translation repression or mRNA degradation. Here, we show that miR-214 promotes myogenic differentiation in mouse C2C12 myoblasts at a step preceding the induction of p21 and myogenin. Blocking miR-214 function with a 2'-O-methylated double-stranded inhibitor maintained C2C12 cells in the active cell cycle, thereby inhibiting the myogenic differentiation. By global gene expression profiling, we identified the proto-oncogene N-ras as one of miR-214 targets. Furthermore, manipulating the N-Ras level with small interfering RNA or adenovirus-mediated forced expression either augmented or attenuated the effect of miR-214, respectively. Thus, our data uncovered a novel microRNA-mediated mechanism that controls myogenic differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2112592259,"Despite the critical role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma pathogenesis, EGFR targeted therapies have achieved limited clinical efficacy. Here we propose an alternate therapeutic strategy based on the conceptual framework of non-oncogene addiction. A directed RNAi screen revealed that glioblastoma cells over-expressing EGFRvIII, an oncogenic variant of EGFR, become hyper-dependent on a variety of DNA repair genes. Among these, there was an enrichment of Base Excision Repair (BER) genes required for the repair of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced DNA damage, including poly-ADP ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Subsequent studies revealed that EGFRvIII over-expression in glioblastoma cells caused increased levels of ROS, DNA strand break accumulation, and genome instability. In a panel of primary glioblastoma lines, sensitivity to PARP1 inhibition correlated with the levels of EGFR activation and oxidative stress. Gene expression analysis indicated that reduced expression of BER genes in glioblastomas with high EGFR expression correlated with improved patient survival. These observations suggest that oxidative stress secondary to EGFR hyper-activation necessitates increased cellular reliance on PARP1 mediated BER, and offer critical insights into clinical trial design."
https://openalex.org/W2144573432,"Insertion of transposed elements within mammalian genes is thought to be an important contributor to mammalian evolution and speciation. Insertion of transposed elements into introns can lead to their activation as alternatively spliced cassette exons, an event called exonization. Elucidation of the evolutionary constraints that have shaped fixation of transposed elements within human and mouse protein coding genes and subsequent exonization is important for understanding of how the exonization process has affected transcriptome and proteome complexities. Here we show that exonization of transposed elements is biased towards the beginning of the coding sequence in both human and mouse genes. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that exonization of transposed elements can be population-specific, implying that exonizations may enhance divergence and lead to speciation. SNP density analysis revealed differences between Alu and other transposed elements. Finally, we identified cases of primate-specific Alu elements that depend on RNA editing for their exonization. These results shed light on TE fixation and the exonization process within human and mouse genes."
https://openalex.org/W3021125815,"Background Little is known about the kinetics of anti-H5 neutralizing antibodies in naturally H5N1-infected patients with severe clinical illness or asymptomatic infection. Methods Using H5N1 microneutralisation (MN) and H5-pseudotype particle-based microneutralisation assays (H5pp) we analyzed sera sequentially obtained from 11 severely ill patients diagnosed by RT-PCR (follow-up range 1–139 weeks of disease onset) and 31 asymptomatically infected individuals detected in a sero-epidemiological study after exposure to H5N1 virus (follow-up range: 1–2 month –11 months after exposure). Results Of 44 sera from 11 patients with H5N1 disease, 70% tested positive by MN (antibody titre ≥80) after 2 weeks and 100% were positive by 3 weeks after disease onset. The geometric mean MN titers in severely ill patients were 540 at 1–2 months and 173 at 10–12 months and thus were higher than the titers from asymptomatic individuals (149 at 1–2 months, 62.2 at 10–12 months). Fractional polynomial regression analysis demonstrated that in all severely ill patients, positive titers persisted beyond 2 years of disease onset, while 10 of 23 sera collected 10–11 months after exposure in asymptomatically infected individuals tested negative. Conclusions Our results indicate that people with asymptomatic H5N1 infection have lower H5N1 antibody titres compared to those with severe illness and that in many asymptomatically infected patients the antibody titer decreased to levels below the threshold of positivity within one year. These data are essential for the design and interpretation of sero-epidemiological studies."
https://openalex.org/W1968267890,"Sepsis is a leading cause of death, which is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory response. In this study, we report that caveolin-1, a major component of caveolae, is a critical survival factor of sepsis. We induced sepsis using a well established sepsis animal model, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CLP induced 67% fatality in caveolin-1 null mice, but only 27% fatality in wild type littermates (p = 0.015). Further studies revealed that mice deficient in caveolin-1 exhibited marked increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 production 20 h following CLP treatment, indicating uncontrolled inflammatory responses in the absence of caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 null mice also had a significant increase in bacteria number recovered from liver and spleen, indicating elevated bacterial burdens. In addition, caveolin-1 null mice had a 2-fold increase in thymocyte apoptosis compared with wild type littermates, indicating caveolin-1 as a critical modulator of thymocyte apoptosis during sepsis. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that caveolin-1 is a critical protective modulator of sepsis in mice. Caveolin-1 exerts its protective function likely through its roles in modulating inflammatory response, alleviating bacterial burdens, and suppressing thymocyte apoptosis."

The drug-resistant human melanoma Malme3M (Malme3MR) and the human hepatic cancer cell line SNU387 (SNU387R) showed in vivo drug resistance and CAGE induction. Induction of CAGE resulted from decreased expression and thereby displacement of DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1) from CAGE promoter sequences. Various drugs induce expression of CAGE by decreasing expression of DNMT1, and hypomethylation of CAGE was correlated with the increased expression of CAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2039252050,"Background Almost all animals, including insects, need to adapt to temperature fluctuations. The molecular basis of thermal adaptation is not well understood, although a number of candidate genes have been proposed. However, a functional link between candidate genes and thermal tolerance has rarely been established. The gene Frost (Fst) was first discovered when Drosophila flies were exposed to cold stress, but the biological function(s) of Fst has so far not been characterized. Because Fst is up-regulated after a cold stress, we tested whether it was essential for chill-coma recovery. Methodology/Principal Findings A marked increase in Fst expression was detected (by RT-PCR) during recovery from cold stress, peaking at 42-fold after 2 h. The GAL4/UAS system was used to knock down expression of Fst and recovery ability was assessed in transgenic adults following 12 h of chill coma at 0°C. The ability to recover from cold stress (short-, medium- and long-term) was significantly altered in the transgenic adults that had Fst silenced. These findings show that Fst plays an essential role in the recovery from chill coma in both males and females. Conclusions/Significance The Frost gene is essential for cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster and may play an important role in thermal adaptation."

After gp120 binding to the cellular receptor CD4 and coreceptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, the fusion peptide at the N terminus of gp41 is exposed, enabling its insertion into the target cell membrane. A series of conformational changes in gp41 takes place, leading the protein to the transition from a pre-fusion state to a post-fusion state through different intermediates that are crucial for fusion (1Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 2Moore J.P. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10598-10602Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The core structure of gp41 ectodomain consists of two 4-3 hydrophobic heptad repeat regions defined as N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) (3Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Crystallographic studies have shown that CHR can interact with NHR to form a conformation termed “trimer-of-hairpins” or “six-helix bundle” (6-HB), within which three parallel NHRs form a trimeric coiled-coil core, and three CHRs pack in an antiparallel manner into the highly conserved hydrophobic grooves along the surface of the inner coiled-coil (4Chan D.C.

Peptides derived from the NHR and CHR regions are called N- and C-peptides, respectively. Some C-peptides, such as SJ-2176 (7Jiang S. Lin K. Strick N. Neurath A.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), T20 (8Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Matthews T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), and C34 (9Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), are potent inhibitors of HIV infection. They interfere with 6-HB formation by binding to the viral gp41 inner NHR coiled-coil. T20 (brand name: Fuzeon; generic name: enfuvirtide) has been approved by the U.S. FDA as the first member of a new class of anti-HIV drugs: HIV fusion inhibitors. Some mutated N-peptides, e.g. N36Mut(e,g), could also inhibit HIV-1 infection by interacting with NHR to form heterotrimers that disrupt the formation of the inner NHR trimer of the gp41 core (10Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The gp41 CHR is a key target for 5-helix, an engineered peptide inhibitor that consists of three N helices and two C helices and inhibits HIV-1 entry by binding to the viral gp41 CHR region (11Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In principle, N-peptides should also block the interaction between the viral gp41 NHR and CHR and inhibit HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion as effectively as the C-peptides. However, the actual potency of N-peptides is 2 to 3 orders lower than C-peptides, mainly because N-peptides tend to aggregate in physiological solutions (3Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 9Lu M. Kim P.S. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is proposed that a properly designed N-peptide able to fold into stable and soluble trimeric coiled-coils without aggregating should possess anti-HIV-1 efficiency just as high as that of a C-peptide (3Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 11Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Accordingly, several NHR trimer inhibitors have been designed and constructed by introducing intermolecular disulfide bond(s) or trimeric coiled-coil motif(s) into the N-peptide to stabilize the trimeric conformation. For example, by introducing intermolecular disulfide bonds (the CCG motif) into N-peptides N35 or N34, Louis et al. constructed three anti-HIV-1 N-peptides, NCCG-gp41, in which the N35CCG peptide was linked to a minimal thermostable 6-HB (N34/C28) (12Louis J.M. Bewley C.A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29485-29489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and N34CCG and N35CCG-N13, which consist of only NHR fragments (13Louis J.M. Nesheiwat I. Chang L. Clore G.M. Bewley C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20278-20285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). By introducing trimeric coiled-coil motifs, such as a portion of GCN4-pIQI′ (IQ) or IZm (IZ) into N-peptides N17 or N23, Eckert et al. (14Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 15Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S. Cell. 1999; 99: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) constructed stable N-helical trimers, including IQN17, IQN23, and IZN17. All of the aforementioned peptide constructs showed much higher anti-HIV-1 activity than their corresponding N-peptides. An even more potent NHR trimer inhibitor, (CCIZN17)3, was designed by combining these two methods, i.e. adding disulfide bridges to the N terminus of the IZN17 sequence (16Bianchi E. Finotto M. Ingallinella P. Hrin R. Carella A.V. Hou X.S. Schleif W.A. Miller M.D. Geleziunas R. Pessi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12903-12908Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, it may not be practical to develop these peptides as drugs, because they are very expensive to be synthesized and refolded into active conformation. In this study, we describe new recombinant NHR trimer inhibitors constructed in a novel way by fusing N-peptides to the N terminus of Foldon (Fd), the natural trimerization domain of T4 bacteriophage fibritin (17Yang X. Lee J. Mahony E.M. Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Papanikolopoulou K. Forge V. Goeltz P. Mitraki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8991-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The peptides, named N36Fd and N28Fd, were shown to be stable trimers and interact strongly with C-peptide to form soluble coiled-coils. These peptides, especially N28Fd trimer, were highly potent inhibitors of infection by a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains. Compared with T20, N28Fd trimer is much more potent in inhibiting T20-resistant HIV-1 strains, much less sensitive to proteinases, and more affordable because N28Fd, which is expressed in prokaryotic Escherichia coli cells, can be put into large-scale production at reduced cost. The sequences of the N-peptides, N36 (aa 546–581) and N28 (aa 559–586), and the C-peptides, C34 (aa 628–661) and T20 (aa 638–673), used in this study were derived from the NHR and CHR, respectively, of the HIV-1HXB2 gp41 (Fig. 1, A and B). These peptides and T1249 and T1144 were synthesized by a standard solid-phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) method using an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer. The N and C termini of these peptides were acetylated and amidated, respectively. The peptides were purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) by high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by laser desorption mass spectrometry (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The concentration of peptides was determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar extinction coefficient ° (280 nm) of 5500 and 1490 mol/liter−1cm−1 based on the number of tryptophan (Trp) residues and tyrosine (Tyr) residues (all the peptides tested contain Trp and/or Tyr), respectively (19Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). N36Fd consists of N36 peptide and the Fd sequence (GYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) that was derived from the natural trimeric motif of T4 bacteriophage fibritin, whereas N28Fd consists of N28 and Fd sequence. Fd was fused to the C terminus of the N-peptide with no linker (Fig. 1C). The DNA fragments of N36 and N28 were amplified by PCR using the Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen) from a pHBX-env/wt plasmid with a forward primer containing a BamH1 site and a reverse primer that had no restriction site. The fragment of Fd was produced by annealing a long synthetic forward primer coding the last 9 amino acids of the N-peptide (N36 or N28) and the Fd with its complement, a long reverse primer with an Xhol1 site. Then the two overlapping fragments were mixed and used as templates for another PCR reaction using the BamH1 forward primer and a shorter reverse primer coding the last few amino acids of the Fd with an Xhol1 site. The product was purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), digested with BamH1 and Xhol1 enzymes (TaKaRa Bio, Madison, WI), and cloned into a pGEX6p-1 vector (Qiagen). The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Either the N36Fd-pGEX6p-1 or N28Fd-pGEX6p-1 plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). The cells were incubated at 37 °C in LB medium until the A600 reached 0.8–1.0. The culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. Then, the cells were harvested and broken by sonication in 1% Triton PBS buffer. After the samples were centrifuged, the supernatant was loaded into a GST-bind column (Novagen). The column was rinsed, and the bound GST-fused N-Fd peptides were then cleaved onto the column with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C overnight. The cleaved peptides were eluted from the column on the next day by washing with cleavage buffer. Either N36Fd or N28Fd in this rough product was further separated from GST by a series of ultrafiltrations using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). N36Fd and N28Fd performed monomeric conformation in the buffer with pH lower than 3.0, which enabled them to be collected in the centrifuge tube of the 30-kDa Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Device, while GST was kept in the filter unit. Finally, the N-Fd peptide was dialyzed against ddH2O (pH 7.0) and refolded into trimers using the 10-kDa Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Device. Purified N36Fd and N28Fd were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (18Papanikolopoulou K. Forge V. Goeltz P. Mitraki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8991-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl/well 100 μm N36Fd or N28Fd was mixed with 4× SDS sample buffer (Novagen). The sample was boiled for 5 min or kept at room temperature before loading onto a 10–20% Tricine-glycine gel (Invitrogen). The electrophoresis was conducted in SDS-PAGE running buffer with 125 V of constant voltage at 4 °C. The gels were stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen). Sedimentation velocity measurements were performed on the ProteomelabTM XL-A/XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) equipped with a three-channel An-60 Ti rotor. N28Fd and N36Fd peptides were dialyzed against 100 mm CH3COONa/CH3COOH buffer (pH 6.0) and diluted to 50 μm by using the dialysis buffer. 30 μm N28Fd or N36Fd was mixed with 30 μm C34 in pH 7.4 PBS. The sample (380 μl) and corresponding buffer (400 μl) were loaded pairwise into the double sector quartz cell and run at 60,000 rpm at 20 °C. Data were collected at wavelength of 280 nm in a continuous scan mode with scanning spaces of 30 s. Sedimentation coefficient distribution, c(s), and molecular mass distribution, c(M), were calculated from the data by using the program SEDFIT. The secondary structures of N36Fd, N28Fd, and their complexes with C34 peptide were determined by CD spectroscopy. All the N-peptides were diluted in ddH2O (pH 7.0), and all the C-peptides or the mixture of the N- and C-peptides were diluted in 50 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl (PBS, pH 7.2) to a final concentration of 10 μm. The individual peptides and their mixtures were incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 0.5 h before testing. The spectra of each sample were acquired on a spectropolarimeter (Model J-715, Jasco Inc., Japan) at room temperature, using a 5.0 nm bandwidth, 0.1 nm resolution, 0.1-cm path length, 4.0-s response time, and a 50 nm/min scanning speed, and were corrected by a subtraction of the background corresponding to the solvent. The spectrum of the N-peptide portion in the individual N36Fd or N28Fd, or in the N36Fd/C34 or N28Fd/C34 mixture, was calculated by subtracting the spectrum of free Fd peptide from that of N36Fd, N28Fd, N36Fd+C34, or N28Fd+C34. The α-helicity was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (i.e. 33,000° cm2 dmol−1) according to previous studies (4Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 20Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Radigen L. Jiang S. Lu M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1634-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation of the samples was monitored at 222 nm by applying a temperature gradient from 20 °C to 98 °C with a 2-degree interval, an equilibration time of 1.5 min, and an averaging time of 60 s. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (Tm) values was calculated using Jasco software utilities as described previously (21Liu S. Lu H. Niu J. Xu Y. Wu S. Jiang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11259-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion was measured by utilizing a dye transfer assay as previously described (22Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chronically HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 (H9/HIV-1IIIB) cells were labeled with Calcein-Am (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After washes, the fluorescence-labeled H9/HIV-1IIIB cells were incubated with MT-2 cells at 37 °C for 2 h in the absence or presence of N36Fd or N28Fd at a graded concentration. The percentage of fused cells was counted under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and the 50% inhibitory concentration of each drug was calculated with the Calcusyn software program (22Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Inhibitory activities of N36Fd and N28Fd trimers on HIV-1 infection were determined as previously described (22Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Lu H. Zhao Q. Wallace G. Liu S. He Y. Shattock R. Neurath A.R. Jiang B.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2006; 22: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For inhibition of infection by T-tropic HIV-1 strain IIIB (subtype B, X4) or the T20-resistant variants (HIV-1NL4–3(36G) bearing the N42S, N42T/N43K, V38E/N42S, or V38A/N42D mutations that were obtained from NIH through the AIDS Reagent Program) (24Rimsky L.T. Shugars D.C. Matthews T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 986-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 1 × 104/ml MT-2 cells in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% FBS were infected with HIV-1 isolates at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) in 200 μl of culture medium in the presence or absence of the test peptide overnight. The culture supernatants were removed, and fresh media were added on the next day. On the fourth day post-infection, 100 μl of culture supernatants were collected from each well, mixed with equal volumes of 5% Triton X-100, and assayed for p24 antigen by ELISA. For inhibition of infection by the M-tropic HIV-1 strain Bal (subtype B, R5), 100 μl of TZM-bl cells (1 × 105/ml) was pre-cultured overnight and infected with Bal at 100 TCID50 in the presence or absence of the test peptide overnight. The cells were harvested and lysed on the fourth day post-infection with 50 μl of lysing reagent. The luciferase activity was analyzed using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Ultra 386, Tecan, Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The percent inhibition of luciferase activity was calculated. For inhibition of infection by the primary HIV-1 isolate 93IN101 (subtype C, R5), the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors using a standard density gradient (Histopaque-1077, Sigma) centrifugation. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the non-adherent cells were collected and resuspended at 5 × 105/ml in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/ml, and 100 units of interleukin-2/ml, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 3 days. The PHA-stimulated cells were infected with the primary HIV-1 isolate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 in the absence or presence of N-Fd peptides at graded concentrations. The supernatants were collected on the 7th day post-infection and tested for p24 antigen by ELISA as previously described (23Lu H. Zhao Q. Wallace G. Liu S. He Y. Shattock R. Neurath A.R. Jiang B.S. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2006; 22: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The stability of N28Fd or T20 against digestion by proteinase K was tested as previously described (25Pang W. Wang R.R. Yang L.M. Liu C.M. Tien P. Zheng Y.T. Virology. 2008; 377: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Peptide (40 μg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 microunit/ml proteinase K-Acrylic Beads (Sigma). Samples were collected at different times and centrifuged immediately. The supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C before testing. The residual peptide concentration in each sample was then detected by ELISA as previously described (25Pang W. Wang R.R. Yang L.M. Liu C.M. Tien P. Zheng Y.T. Virology. 2008; 377: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μl of sample was coated onto wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate, followed by addition of rabbit antibodies directed against the HIV-1 gp41 N- and C-peptide mixture (22Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) for binding N28Fd (at 1:400 dilution) and T20 (at 1:2000 dilution), respectively. Then, biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were added sequentially. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured with an automatic ELISA reader (Ultra 384, Tecan). The remaining antiviral activity in the supernatants against HIV-1IIIB infection was determined as described above. In both assays, the untreated N28Fd and T20 were used as controls. N-peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 NHR are commonly regarded as weak HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, because free N-peptides have a tendency to aggregate and thus cannot fold into a stable trimeric α-helical conformation in physiological solution (3Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 26Wild C. Greenwell T. Shugars D. Rimsky-Clarke L. Matthews T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1995; 11: 323-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we utilized the 27-mer Fd sequence to facilitate the trimerization of the N-peptides N36 and N28 by fusing the Fd sequence directly to the C terminus of N36 or N28 without any linking sequence (Fig. 1C). We first chose N36 for this study, because of its ability to form highly stable 6-HB with peptides derived from gp41 CHR (4Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). This peptide includes a 17-amino acid sequence that provides a critical hydrophobic pocket for the interaction between gp41 NHR and CHR (Fig. 1B, in red) (4Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar, 27Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Later, we selected N28 peptide to replace N36, because we found that the AVERY (aa 582–586) sequence adjacent to the C terminus of pocket-formation sequence may also be important for gp41 6-HB formation. Specifically, the C-peptides CP-32 (aa 621–652) and CP-32M, which contain an AVERY-binding motif, QIWNNMT (aa 621–627) (Fig. 1B), are more potent than T20 in blocking 6-HB formation and inhibiting infection by HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20 and C34 (28He Y. Chen J. Li J. Qi Z. Lu H. Dong M. Jiang S. Dai Q. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 6349-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29He Y. Cheng J. Lu H. Li J. Hu J. Qi Z. Liu Z. Jiang S. Dai Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16332-16337Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). N28 contains the 17-mer pocket-forming sequence (N17) plus the hexamer IEAQQH (aa 559–564) sequence and the 5-mer AVERY motif at the N and C termini of N17 sequence, respectively (Fig. 1B). Addition of the short flanking sequences at both sides of the pocket-forming sequence may improve refolding and solubility of the highly hydrophobic pocket sequence in N28. The full length of the designed N36Fd and N28Fd peptides consists of 63 and 55 aa residues (Fig. 1C), respectively. Based on our experience, peptides longer than 50 aa are technically difficult to synthesize, but can be well expressed in E. coli. The N36Fd and N28Fd peptides expressed in E. coli were purified and analyzed with SDS-PAGE. After boiling for 5 min in the presence of 2% SDS, N36Fd was denatured and exhibited a band in the gel corresponding to the monomer form. N36Fd treated with SDS buffer under room temperature exhibited one major band corresponding to the trimeric form and a number of minor bands with lower molecular size (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that a major portion of the N36Fd maintains trimeric conformation in SDS buffer under room temperature. A major monomer band and a minor trimer band were revealed when N28Fd was treated by boiling for 5 min, whereas only one band corresponding to the trimeric form was shown when N28Fd was treated in SDS buffer at room temperature (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that N28Fd, as a trimer, is more stable than N36Fd under SDS condition. Sedimentation velocity analysis (SVA) provides hydrodynamic information about the size and shape of macromolecules (30Laue T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is particularly useful for quantitatively charactering the solution behavior such as self- or hetero-association of biomolecules (31Jacobs A. Hartman K. Laue T. Caffrey M.

As shown in Fig. 3A, in 100 mm CH3COONa/CH3COOH buffer (pH 6.0), almost all the N28Fd appears in a sharp peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 1.55 s that corresponds to 21,811 Da, which agrees with the theoretical molecular mass for an N28Fd trimer (19,149 Da). N36Fd was also shown to mostly form trimers, as a single peak appeared at 1.60 s with an obtained molecular mass of 22,272 Da (Fig. 3B), which is in agreement with the calculated molecular mass for an N36Fd trimer (21,561 Da). Meanwhile, the populations of higher molecular weight increased in this sample, which indicates that, in comparison with N28Fd, N36Fd has a stronger tendency to aggregate in solution. CD spectroscopy was used to study the secondary conformation of N36Fd and N28Fd trimers. Free Fd peptide and N-peptides presented little α-helicity. Unexpectedly, the chimeric N36Fd and N28Fd did not exhibit typical α-helical spectra either, but rather a mixture of α-helix and β-sheet conformation (Fig. 4, A and B). Indeed, after subtraction of the spectra of free Fd peptide, which consists of β-sheet structure (18Papanikolopoulou K. Forge V. Goeltz P. Mitraki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8991-8998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), from those of N36Fd or N28Fd, a typical α-helical spectrum was revealed (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that the Fd domain in the N36Fd and N28Fd greatly facilitated N-peptide folding into trimeric α-helical conformation, mimicking the conformation of NHR trimer in the fusion intermediate state of the HIV-1 gp41. The α-helicity of the N36 or N28 portion in N36Fd or N28Fd was 42 and 31%, respectively. The frictional coefficient (f/f0) measures the diffusional boundary spread during the sedimentation analysis. This value relates to the s value of species in solution and can be extracted from the experimental data of SVA using SEDFIT program. It indicates the molecular shape asymmetry and the degree of salvation of the protein (35Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, the f/f0 values of N28Fd trimer and N36Fd trimer are both in the interval between 1.6 and 1.9, which indicates the moderately elongated molecular shape of these oligomers (32Lelj-Garolla B.

However, little information is known about its impact on the developing brain submitted to excitotoxic challenge.We investigated here the effect of iNO in a neonatal model of excitotoxic brain lesions. Rat pups and their dams were placed in a chamber containing 20 ppm NO during the first week of life. At postnatal day (P)5, rat pups were submitted to intracranial injection of glutamate agonists. At P10, rat pups exposed to iNO exhibited a significant decrease of lesion size in both the white matter and cortical plate compared to controls. Microglia activation and astrogliosis were found significantly decreased in NO-exposed animals. This neuroprotective effect was associated with a significant decrease of several glutamate receptor subunits expression at P5. iNO was associated with an early (P1) downregulation of pCREB/pAkt expression and induced an increase in pAkt protein concentration in response to excitotoxic challenge (P7).This study is the first describe and investigate the neuroprotective effect of iNO in neonatal excitotoxic-induced brain damage. This effect may be mediated through CREB pathway and subsequent modulation of glutamate receptor subunits expression."
https://openalex.org/W2089548877,"Mammalian myosin IXb (Myo9b) has been shown to exhibit unique motor properties in that it is a single-headed processive motor and the rate-limiting step in its chemical cycle is ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, it has been reported to move toward the minus- and the plus-end of actin filaments. To analyze the contribution of the light chain-binding domain to the movement, processivity, and directionality of a single-headed processive myosin, we expressed constructs of Caenorhabditis elegans myosin IX (Myo9) containing either the head (Myo9-head) or the head and the light chain-binding domain (Myo9-head-4IQ). Both constructs supported actin filament gliding and moved toward the plus-end of actin filaments. We identified in the head of class IX myosins a calmodulin-binding site at the N terminus of loop 2 that is unique among the myosin superfamily members. Ca(2+)/calmodulin negatively regulated ATPase and motility of the Myo9-head. The Myo9-head demonstrated characteristics of a processive motor in that it supported actin filament gliding and pivoting at low motor densities. Quantum dot-labeled Myo9-head moved along actin filaments with a considerable run length and frequently paused without dissociating even in the presence of obstacles. We conclude that class IX myosins are plus-end-directed motors and that even a single head exhibits characteristics of a processive motor."
https://openalex.org/W2127798977,"An insight into the conformation and dynamics of unfolded and early intermediate states of a protein is essential to understand the mechanism of its aggregation and to design potent inhibitor molecules. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has been used to study the effects of several model protein stabilizers on the conformation of the unfolded state and early folding dynamics of tetramethyl rhodamine-labeled cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae at single molecular resolution. Special attention has been given to arginine, which is a widely used stabilizer for improving refolding yield of different proteins. The value of the hydrodynamic radius (rH) obtained by analyzing the intensity fluctuations of the diffusing molecules has been found to increase in a two-state manner as the protein is unfolded by urea. The results further show that the presence of arginine and other protein stabilizers favors a relatively structured conformation of the unfolded states (rH of 29 Å) over an extended one (rH of 40 Å), which forms in their absence. Also, the time constant of a kinetic component (τR) of about 30 μs has been observed by analyzing the correlation functions, which represents formation of a collapsed state. This time constant varies with urea concentration representing an inverted Chevron plot that shows a roll-over and behavior in the absence of arginine.

Protein aggregation has been well studied in recent literature because of its implication in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (1Dobson C.M. Protein Pept. Lett. 2006; 13: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Aggregation also poses serious complications in the manufacturing and formulation development of therapeutically relevant proteins (2Bee J.S. Davis M. Freund E. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W.

Extensive research efforts have been devoted to discover inhibitor molecules and to design formulation strategies to block protein aggregation (4Carpenter J.F. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Coligan J.E.

The majority of these inhibitor molecules are targeted to the intermediate states, which occur prior to the formation of large aggregates (or amyloids under suitable solution conditions) (7Harrison R.S. Sharpe P.C. Singh Y. Fairlie D.P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 159: 1-77PubMed Google Scholar). This is because of the fact that early intermediates (and often not the large aggregates or amyloids) have been shown to represent the cytotoxic species (7Harrison R.S. Sharpe P.C. Singh Y. Fairlie D.P. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 159: 1-77PubMed Google Scholar). Use of small molecules of osmo-protecting ability (osmolytes) has generated widespread interests for their roles as protein stabilizers, particularly for industrial protein productions.(8Andya J.D.

Although the exact mechanism of their action is not known, these stabilizers have been shown to interact efficiently with the unfolded state of a protein (12Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl.

Although native-like contact formation early in the unfolded state would lead to efficient folding, incorrect contacts may result in misfolding and subsequent aggregation. Early conformational dynamics are generally rapid and often fall in the μs time scale, which is difficult to monitor by conventional techniques such as NMR and stopped flow because their time resolution is limited to ms. Computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulation could offer limited help because enormous computational resources are needed for the simulation in the μs time scale. Specialized experimental techniques have been designed to probe conformation (14Bowler B.E. May K. Zaragoza T. York P. Dong A. Caughey W.S.

There is, however, no report on how a protein stabilizer would affect the conformation of unfolded and early intermediate states of a protein. Any systematic understanding of the role of a stabilizer on the early stage of the protein-folding kinetics is also not available. In this study, we have shown for the first time that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 2The abbreviations used are: FCSfluorescence correlation spectroscopyTMRtetramethyl rhodamine-5-maleimideTMR-cytctetramethyl rhodamine-maleimide-labeled cytochrome c from S. cerevisiaeNnativeUunfolded. can be used to monitor the conformation of the unfolded states and early folding kinetics of a protein at single molecular resolution. Tetramethyl rhodamine-maleimide-labeled cytochrome c from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (TMR-cytc) has been used as a model system for this study for the following reasons. First, different aspects of cytochrome c folding and related problems have been investigated (19Chen E. Goldbeck R.A. Kliger D.S. Curr. Protein Pept.

Second, the cofactor heme, present intrinsically in the protein structure, and the extrinsically attached tetramethyl rhodamine maleimide (TMR) constitute a convenient fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair, which has already been explored using FCS (25Werner J.H. Joggerst R. Dyer R.B. Goodwin P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11130-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and photon-counting histogram methods (26Perroud T.D. Bokoch M.P. Zare R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17570-17575Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have selected a number of protein stabilizers such as sucrose, NaCl, proline, and arginine to understand their roles on the conformation of the unfolded state and on the early folding kinetics of cytochrome c. Special emphasis has been given to arginine as a model stabilizer as it has been used extensively to increase the refolding yield and to prevent protein self-association (27Arakawa T. Ejima D.

Our results show that arginine and other protein stabilizers prefer a relatively compact conformation of the unfolded state. Variation of the time constant of a fast kinetic event representing the decrease in distance between TMR and heme with urea concentrations suggests a Chevron-like behavior. Measuring urea-induced unfolding of TMR-cytc in the absence and presence of arginine, we show that the use of high concentration of arginine influences formation of a partially folded intermediate. Other stabilizers, e.g. sucrose, NaCl, and proline, do not show this behavior. Yeast Cytochrome c from S. cerevisiae (C2436) was obtained from Sigma. Urea, NaCl, and sucrose were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich in the highest available purity. TMR was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). dl-Arginine and dl-proline (for CD experiments) were obtained from MP Biomedicals (Cleveland, OH). All other reagents used were of high quality analytical grades. Labeling of cytochrome c with TMR was carried out using a published procedure (31Ghosh R. Sharma S. Chattopadhyay K. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Excess free dye was removed by extensive dialysis followed by column chromatography using a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Far UV CD spectra (in the range 200-nm) were recorded using a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Ltd.). Experiments were performed typically with 20 μm unlabeled protein using a cuvette of 1-mm path length. Steady state fluorescence experiments were carried out with 200 nm of labeled protein samples using a PTI fluorometer (Photon Technology International). The samples were excited at 550 nm, and the emission wavelengths were scanned between 560 and 650 nm; emission intensity at 576 nm was typically monitored for the unfolding experiments. FCS experiments were carried out using a commercial instrument, ConfoCor 3 LSM (Carl Zeiss, Evotec, Jena, Germany) using a 40× water immersion objective. Typically 500 μl of the sample (dye or labeled protein) was placed into Nunc chambers (Nalge Nunc) and excited with an argon laser at 514 nm. FCS measurements were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. Typically, 50–100 nm labeled protein concentration was used. To correct for the refractive index and viscosity of urea and arginine solutions, necessary correction measures were taken using microscope correction collar and height as described previously (32Chattopadhyay K. Saffarian S. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1413-1422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additionally, the experiments were carried out with free TMR at each solution condition to normalize the protein data. For a single component system without any chemical reaction or conformational change event, the diffusion time (τD) of a fluorophore and the number of particles in the observation volume (Np) can be calculated by fitting the correlation function (G(τ)) to Equation 1 (33Hess S.T. Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar)G(τ)=1+1Np(11+ττD)(11+s2ττD)0.5(Eq. 1) where S is the structure parameter, the depth-to-diameter ratio of the Gaussian observation volume. The correlation function for a single component system with diffusion time, τD, and an associated chemical reaction or conformational change event (A⇄B) with a relaxation time constant of τR can be described by Equation 2 (34Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar).G(τ)=(1−F+Fexp⁡(−τ/τR))Np(1−F)((1+ττD)(1+τω2τD)0.5)−1(Eq. 2) Equation 2 assumes that one of the states involving the conformational change event (A or B) is non-fluorescent, and there is no difference in τD between A and B. F is the amplitude of τR, which corresponds to the average fraction of the molecule in the non-fluorescent state (34Haupts U. Maiti S. Schwille P. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The value of τR could only be measured if both the following conditions are satisfied. First, the rate of chemical reaction or conformational change event should be significantly faster than the diffusion of the molecule or τR ≪ τD, and second, a large difference in fluorescence intensity between A and B should exist. TMR-cytc is an ideal molecule for this study as the diffusion time values (τD of about 92 μs for the native state in the absence of urea and 160 μs for the unfolded state in the presence of 10 m urea in our setup) allow observation of any faster μs dynamics between a relatively compact (non-fluorescent because the attached TMR and heme are close to each other) and an extended state (fluorescent because the attached TMR and heme are separated from each other). For Equations 1 and 2, the contribution of a rapid triplet component has been ignored. An exponential component of a triplet state of 20–30% amplitude with time constant of 1–3 μs has been present in the experimental data. The diffusion coefficient (D) of a molecule can be calculated from τD using Equation 3τD=ω24D(Eq. 3) where w is the beam radius of the observation volume, which can be obtained by measuring τD of a fluorophore of known D. The hydrodynamic radius (rH) of a molecule can be calculated from D using the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 4)D=kT6πηrH(Eq. 4) where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and η corresponds to the viscosity of the solution. Protein samples in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 were incubated overnight with different concentrations of urea at room temperature. The samples were analyzed using different spectroscopic techniques, such as steady state fluorescence, CD, and FCS. Experimental data were fit to a two-state unfolding transition using Equation 5 (35Chattopadhyay K. Zhong S. Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4040-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)θ=((θN+mN[ Ureal )+(θD+mD[ Urea ])exp⁡(−(ΔG0+m[ Urea ]/0.58263)))(1+exp⁡(−(ΔG0+m[ Urea ]/0.58263)))(Eq. 5) where θ is the observed spectroscopic data (measured by steady state fluorescence, CD, or FCS) and θN and θD are the spectroscopic data for the native and completely unfolded proteins extrapolated to zero urea concentration. ΔG0 is the free energy of unfolding, and m corresponds to the cooperativity of unfolding transition. The use of the two-state approximations has been common in protein folding literatures including in the case of cytochrome c folding (36Chattopadhyay K. Mazumdar S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14606-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 37Lee J.C. Chang I.J. Gray H.B. Winkler J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, deviation from the two-state behavior can result from significant accumulation of intermediate states in the unfolding pathway (see “Results”). The data were analyzed and fit using OriginPro 8.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). In an FCS experiment (outlined using a schematic in Fig. 1), fluorescence fluctuations are measured in a small observation volume, keeping the system under thermodynamic equilibrium. These fluorescence intensity fluctuations can originate either from molecular diffusion of a labeled molecule inside the observation volume (Fig. 1a) or through any chemical kinetics or conformational events (Fig. 1b) whose rate is faster than its molecular diffusion (32Chattopadhyay K.

Determination of molecular diffusion (τD) using a suitable correlation function (Equation 1 for example) yields rH (31Ghosh R. Sharma S. Chattopadhyay K. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Chattopadhyay K. Saffarian S. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Biophys.

Analysis of the intensity fluctuations due to any rapid chemical reaction or conformational events can, in addition, be performed using an exponential component in the correlation function (Equation 2 for example), yielding time constant values (τR) in the μs time scale (Fig. 1b). Applications of this methodology have been shown recently, when FCS in combination with fluorescence quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to monitor folding and conformational dynamics of different proteins (38Chattopadhyay K. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 39Chattopadhyay K. Saffarian S. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The use of Equation 1 has been found inappropriate to fit the correlation functions obtained by the FCS experiments with TMR-cytc because the fit results in non-random behavior in the residual distribution (Fig. 1b). The data fit satisfactorily to Equation 2, and the goodness of the fit is verified by random residual distribution (Fig. 1b). Equation 2 contains a diffusional component with diffusion time of τD and an exponential component (τR with an amplitude of F). Use of an equation containing one diffusional component (τD) and two exponential components (τR1 and τR2 with the amplitude of F1 and F2 and F2 = 1 − F1) does not improve the fit (not shown). The hydrodynamic radius of the protein (rH) calculated from the value of τD obtained from the fit using Equation 2 (22 Å) has been found similar to the published results (43Morar A.S. Olteanu A. Young G.B. Pielak G.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results establish that Equation 2 provides the simplest but sufficiently accurate model to fit the correlation functions obtained by the FCS experiments with TMR-cytc. The exponential component (τR of 28 μs with the amplitude of ∼20%) accounts for the μs conformational dynamics probed by the changes in the distance between the fluorophore (TMR) and the heme group present in the protein. The values of τR and F are similar to those reported earlier (25Werner J.H. Joggerst R. Dyer R.B. Goodwin P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11130-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The dye TMR and the visible region of heme absorption have been shown to constitute a fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair of Forster radius of 40 Å (25Werner J.H. Joggerst R. Dyer R.B. Goodwin P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 11130-11135Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently that the use of imperfect Gaussian approximation at large pinhole diameters in FCS data analysis could lead to erroneous extra components (44Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2300-2317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). FCS experiments were carried out with the labeled protein using pinholes of different diameters and at variable laser powers. No systematic change in the values of τR has been observed (Fig. 2). This indicates that τR represents the time constant of a true physical motion, and it is not an artifactual component arising either from the blinking of the fluorophore or from imperfect Gaussian approximation of the confocal volume element (44Hess S.T. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2300-2317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Normalized correlation functions observed with TMR-cytc in the absence and presence of arginine are shown in Fig. 3 at three different urea concentrations, viz. 0, 3, and 10 m urea. As mentioned before, arginine has been used in this study as a model protein stabilizer. In the absence of arginine (Fig. 3a), the data clearly show that the amplitude (F) of the faster exponential component increases between 0 and 3 m. The amplitude subsequently decreases beyond 3 m urea and attains a minimum at 10 m urea. The decrease in F beyond 3 m urea coincides with the unfolding of the secondary structure of the protein as monitored by far UV CD (supplemental Fig. S1). In the presence of 500 mm arginine (Fig. 3b), exponential components are superimposable, and no change has been observed between 0 and 3 m urea. Beyond 3 m urea, the amplitude of the faster exponential process decreases (Fig. 3b), which is accompanied by the unfolding of the secondary structure of the protein. Fig. 4 shows the variation of different fit parameters with urea concentration in the absence (Fig. 4a) and presence of arginine (Fig. 4b). Both in the absence (Fig. 4a) and in the presence of arginine (Fig. 4b), rH increases with urea concentrations as the protein unfolds. The data have been fit to Equation 5 using the two-state approximation (35Chattopadhyay K. Zhong S. Yeh S.R. Rousseau D.L. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4040-4047Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The increase in rH with urea concentration suggests an extended structure of the unfolded state. In the absence of arginine, rH of the native protein (no urea) is observed to be 22 Å, which decreases to 17 Å in the presence of 500 mm arginine (Fig. 4, a and b). A large decrease in rH for the unfolded protein (from 40 to 29 Å) is also observed in the presence of 500 mm arginine. The decrease in rH of the unfolded state by arginine occurs due to the increase in the free energy of the unfolded state (12Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Arginine-induced decrease in rH of the native state may arise from the ability of arginine to interact with the native or native-like states of the protein (see below). In the absence of arginine, the variation of the amplitude (F) of the exponential component with urea concentration shows the presence of two steps (Fig. 4c). In the first step, the value of F increases at low urea concentration and reaches a maximum between 2 and 3 m urea (Fig. 4c). The second step is accompanied by a large decrease in F at high urea concentration. This step occurs simultaneously with the unfolding of the secondary structure of the protein (supplemental Fig. S1). In the presence of arginine, the initial increase in F is absent, and F decreases in a single step as the secondary structure of the protein unfolds (Fig. 4d). Both in the presence and in the absence of arginine, the variation of τR with urea concentration represents the inverted Chevron behaviors. In the absence of arginine, the value of τR deviates from linearity at low urea concentration, resulting in the roll-over behavior (Fig. 4e). No roll-over behavior is observed in the presence of arginine (Fig. 4f). FCS has been used in a number of recent protein folding studies to measure μs dynamics of native and unfolded states. For example, fluctuation dynamics between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent conformer of the intestinal fatty acid binding protein have been measured, which yield a time constant of 35 μs (39Chattopadhyay K. Saffarian S. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14171-14176Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A more complex analysis of the correlation functions involving more than one exponential component has been used for the Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide-labeled apo-myoglobin (41Chen H. Rhoades E. Butler J.S. Loh S.N. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10459-10464Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Rapid conformational dynamics in the unfolded states of two different proteins at early μs time regions have also been measured using a combination of FCS and fluorescence quenching techniques (38Chattopadhyay K. Elson E.L. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2385-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 42Neuweiler H. Johnson C.M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2009; 106: 18569-18574Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although the majority of these measurements show no change in the time constant of the exponential component (defined by τR in this study) with denaturant concentrations (pH or urea or guanidinium hydrochloride), we see a distinctly different behavior. This is because of the fact that in case of these previous experiments, τR was found to measure the internal conformational fluctuations between two conformers of a particular state (native or unfolded), and τR did not correspond to the interconversion (or folding/unfolding kinetics) between the states. Because τR is solely a representation of that particular state (folded or unfolded), it would not change as the protein folds or unfolds. The amplitude of τR would of course change with denaturant concentration as the concentration of that state would change by the folding or unfolding events. A significantly different behavior in the variation of τR with urea concentration in the absence (Fig. 4e) and presence of arginine (Fig. 4f) is observed. The data represent an inverted Chevron plot. This behavior can be explained by assuming that τR measures the time constant of the interconversion between the native (N) and the unfolded states (U). Assuming kU and kN to be the rate of formation of U (N to U conversion) and N (U to N conversion), respectively, in an ideal two-state transition (N⇄U),τR=1(kU+kN)(Eq. 6) K=[U][N]=kUkN(Eq. 7) where K is the equilibrium constant of unfolding and [U] and [N] represent the concentration values for the unfolded and the native state of the protein. At low urea concentration, folded state (N) dominates the equilibrium and kN ≫ kU and hence τR ∼ 1/kN. Alternatively, at high urea concentration, kU ≫ kN and hence τR ∼ 1/kU. Essentially the dependence of τR with urea concentration would have a profile of an inverted Chevron plot (as τR is proportional to the inverse of the rate constant). The presence of intermediates at low denaturant concentration typically introduces non-linearity (roll-over behavior) at the low denaturant concentration of the Chevron plot.

The toxin activates Gq- and G12/13-dependent pathways through the deamidation of a glutamine residue in the α-subunit of heterotrimeric GTPases. We recently reported the crystal structure of the C terminus (residues 575–1285) of PMT (C-PMT), which is composed of three domains (C1, C2, and C3), and that the C1 domain is involved in the localization of C-PMT to the plasma membrane, and the C3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad. In this study, we analyzed the membrane-targeting function of the C1 domain in detail. The C1 domain consists of seven helices of which the first four (residues 590–670), showing structural similarity to the N terminus of Clostridium difficile toxin B, were found to be involved in the recruitment of C-PMT to the plasma membrane. C-PMT lacking these helices (C-PMT ΔC1(4H)) neither localized to the plasma membrane nor stimulated the Gq/12/13-dependent signaling pathways. When the membrane-targeting property was complemented by a peptide tag with an N-myristoylation motif, C-PMT ΔC1(4H) recovered the PMT activity. Direct binding between the C1 domain and liposomes containing phospholipids was evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analyses.

Because of this, PMT is also referred to as cyclomodulin, which promotes or interferes with the cell cycle progression of target cells (4Nougayrède J.P. Taieb F. De Rycke J. Oswald E. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 103-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). PMT exerts its effects by up-regulating various signaling cascades in which Rho, phospholipase Cβ, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved (5Essler M.

More recently, it was reported that PMT activated Gi2 through the deamidation of Gln205 of Gαi2 (14Orth J.H. Fester I. Preuss I. Agnoletto L. Wilson B.A. Aktories K. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of PMT is not completely understood. Previous studies implied that the toxin is internalized by endocytosis after binding to a putative receptor on target cells and escapes from endosomes into the cytoplasm (7Murphy A.C. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25296-25303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Baldwin M.R. Lakey J.H. Lax A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) where it activates heterotrimeric GTPases through deamidation. PMT consists of a single polypeptide chain of 1285 amino acids. Several lines of evidence indicate that the N-terminal region of the toxin binds to target cells and that the C-terminal region carries the intracellularly active moiety (17Busch C. Orth J. Djouder N. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3628-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Orth J.H. Blöcker D. Aktories K.

The N-terminal region is partly homologous to Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factors CNF1 and CNF2 (21Falbo V. Pace T. Picci L. Pizzi E. Caprioli A. Infect.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3814-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the C-terminal region of PMT, there is neither a known catalytic motif nor a region homologous with any other toxin or enzyme. Recently, we clarified the crystal structure of the C-terminal region (residues 575–1285) of PMT (C-PMT), which is toxic when directly introduced into cells (23Kitadokoro K. Kamitani S. Miyazawa M. Hanajima-Ozawa M. Fukui A. Miyake M. Horiguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5139-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and found that C-PMT was composed of three domains (C1, C2, and C3). In addition, we clearly showed that the C1 domain is involved in the recruitment of C-PMT to the plasma membrane, and the C3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad.

Here we analyzed the function of the C1 domain in detail. The results revealed that the C1 domain, essential to the toxicity of PMT, was exchangeable with a different signal motif for membrane targeting. The direct binding of the C1 domain with liposomes including phospholipids was also demonstrated. From these results, we conclude that the C1 domain functions to recruit PMT to the plasma membrane where the heterotrimeric GTPases, the substrates for the toxin, reside. All the derivatives of pcDNA3-C1(4H)-EGFP and pcDNA3-TcdB(N4H)-EGFP were constructed by PCR cloning as follows. PCR was performed with a sense primer with a HindIII site for pcDNA3-C1(4H)-EGFP derivatives or a BamHI site for pcDNA3-TcdB(N4H)-EGFP and an antisense primer with a HindIII site (see supplemental Table S1). pPROEX-1-PMT (23Kitadokoro K.

Consequently, each amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The fragment containing the sequence of the PMT or tcd B gene was excised with HindIII and cloned into the HindIII site of pcDNA3-EGFP (24Hanajima-Ozawa M. Matsuzawa T. Fukui A. Kamitani S.

After a 48-h incubation, the culture medium was discarded, and the cells were lysed with 100 μl of 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The cell lysates were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for the determination of luciferase activity with the Steady-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). The relative light units of luciferase activity were measured with a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega). The other aliquot was used for the determination of β-galactosidase activity with the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). The absorbance at 414 nm of β-galactosidase activity was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microtiter plate reader (Multiskan, Titertek). The value for the luciferase activity was divided by that for the β-galactosidase activity and normalized. Swiss3T3 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well into a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. The cells were washed with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium twice and labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (Moravek Biochemicals Inc.) at 37 kBq/ml in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm LiCl and treated with the HVJ (Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan) envelope vector (Ishihara Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan) loaded with C-PMT or C-PMT ΔC1(4H) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h after treatment with the toxins and lysed by incubation in 200 μl/well 0.1 m formic acid for 20 min at room temperature. The amount of total [3H]inositol phosphates was determined by the yttrium silicate scintillation proximity assay (28Brandish P.E. Hill L.A. Zheng W. Scolnick E.M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 313: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Twenty microliters of cell extract was mixed with 80 μl of yttrium silicate scintillation proximity assay beads (GE healthcare) in water to give a final concentration of 1.0 mg of beads/ml in each well of white 96-well plates (Picoplate-96, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the plates were sealed with adhesive and clear plastic cover sheets (Topseal-A, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The contents were mixed by shaking for 1 h. After the beads had settled for 2 h, the radioactivity of each well was measured by using a TopCount microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidic acid (PA), egg phosphatidylethanolamine, brain phosphatidylserine (PS), liver phosphatidylinositol (PI), brain phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A stock solution of lipids in chloroform was mixed in a 20-ml pear-shaped glass flask. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator or nitrogen purging. The lipid film was resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated for 10 min with a water bath type sonicator. The lipid suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed in a water bath at 30 °C, and vortexed for 30 s, a process that was repeated five times. The final suspension was extruded through a 50-nm pore-sized polycarbonate filter with a miniextruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) 21 times. The liposome was stored at 4 °C and diluted with 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl to 0.5 mm just prior to use. The liposome composition was based on a background neutral lipid consisting of phosphatidylcholine (30–60%), phosphatidylethanolamine (20%), and cholesterol (20%). When indicated, anionic lipids such as PS, PG, PA, and PI were included at 30% at the expense of phosphatidylcholine. Surface plasmon resonance was measured with a Biacore2000 instrument and Pioneer Sensor L1 chip (GE Healthcare). The L1 chip was cleaned by a 5-min injection with 20 mm CHAPS and by a 5-min injection with 40 mm n-octyl β-glucoside and then coated with liposomes at 0.5 mm for 12 min in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 containing 150 mm NaCl. These procedures were carried out at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The unattached liposomes were washed out of the chip with 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 0.2 min. Nonspecific binding was probed by a 5-min injection of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Purified proteins were diluted with a running buffer of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 containing 10 mm NaCl to the indicated concentration and perfused at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The sample was allowed to associate for 3 min and then was dissociated for 4 min. The sensor surface was regenerated by 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 0.1 min. The protein concentration in each sample was measured with a Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar) in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. For Western blotting, the samples in a gel after SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then treated with 5% skim milk, and the transferred proteins were probed with proper antibodies and visualized on Fuji Medical film (Fujifilm) with an enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare). Band intensity for images of Western blotting was determined by using NIH ImageJ 1.43r. 3W. S. Rasband (1997–2009), ImageJ, National Institutes of Health. We have recently determined the crystal structure of C-PMT, which exhibits intracellular toxicity (23Kitadokoro K. Kamitani S. Miyazawa M. Hanajima-Ozawa M. Fukui A. Miyake M. Horiguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5139-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and found that it was composed of three distinct domains, respectively named C1, C2, and C3. A DALI search of the database of protein three-dimensional structures (30Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) indicated significant structural homology between the N-terminal four helices (residues 590–670) of the C1 domain in C-PMT (C1(4H)) and the N-terminal first four helices (residues 1–100) of C. difficile toxin B (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a PSI-BLAST search revealed that C1(4H) shares homology with the N-terminal regions of large clostridial cytotoxins including C. difficile toxin B with about 25% identity and about 40% similarity (Fig. 1B and Table 1).TABLE 1Homology between C1 domain of C-PMT and large clostridial cytotoxinsAccession no.IdentitySimilarity%%Toxin BCAA635621940Lethal toxinCAA579591836Toxin AA370522341TpeLBAF461252547α-ToxinCAA855652637 Open table in a new tab Among large clostridial cytotoxins, Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and C. difficile toxin B were reported to have the ability to associate with anionic phospholipids through their N-terminal regions (31Mesmin B.

This feature facilitated the enzymatic reactions of the toxins with the target molecule, hydrophobic geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases on the liposomes (31Mesmin B. Robbe K. Geny B. Luton F.

Biol. 2005; 351: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To examine whether the C1 domain, which is homologous to toxin B, has a similar ability, we constructed expression plasmids for C-PMT and a mutant C-PMT lacking the first four helices of the C1 domain (C-PMT ΔC1(4H), residues 672–1285) and localized the expressed proteins in 293T cells (Fig. 2). C-PMT but not C-PMT ΔC1(4H) was localized to the plasma membrane, which was labeled by the antibody against CD46, a typical plasma membrane protein. The same results were obtained in CHO-K1 cell-based experiments (supplement Fig. S2). Furthermore, Western blotting clearly showed the recruitment to the plasma membrane of C-PMT but not C-PMT ΔC1(4H) (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3). We further fractionated the plasma membrane and checked the distribution of C-PMT. C-PMT was not found in the fraction containing flotillin, a typical protein in the raft microdomain (data not shown). These results indicate that the C1 domain possesses a signal to lead the toxin molecule to the cell membrane excluding the raft microdomain. Next we examined whether the first four helices of C-PMT and the N terminus of large clostridial toxins lead a protein other than C-PMT to the plasma membrane. We prepared cells expressing EGFP tagged with C1(4H) (C1(4H)-EGFP) or the corresponding region of toxin B (TcdB(N4H)-EGFP) (Fig. 3A). Both proteins were co-localized with CD46 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). The measurements of fluorescence intensity for C1(4H)-EGFP and TcdB(N4H)-EGFP showed maximum signals at cell-cell junctions compared with EGFP alone (supplemental Fig. S4). To know which of the four helices in C1(4H) is responsible for the membrane localization, we constructed six variants of C1(4H)-EGFP as shown in Fig. 4A and examined their distribution. When expressed in 293 cells, C1(4H)-EGFP but no other variant was localized to the membrane (Fig. 4B and supplemental Figs. S5 and S6). These results indicate that the plasma membrane-targeting function is not attributable to a specific helix in the C1 domain, and the overall structure of the four helices may be needed. Moreover, respective substitutions of eight of nine amino acid residues conserved between the C1 domain and the large clostridial cytotoxin family (Fig. 1B, asterisks) with other amino acids (alanine for Leu596, Tyr611, Ile614, Leu615, Leu618, Ser651, and Arg653 and glycine or valine for Ala656) abolished the membrane-targeting property (data not shown). These results also indicate that the overall structure of C1(4H) is presumably critical for the targeting of the plasma membrane. To understand the role of the C1 domain in the actions of PMT, we compared toxic activities of C-PMT and C-PMT ΔC1(4H). For this purpose, we performed a luciferase reporter assay with serum response factor and NFAT, transcription factors that are known to be activated by PMT through the heteromeric GTPases Gq and G12/13. C-PMT was active when ectopically expressed in the cells, consistent with our previous finding that recombinant C-PMT stimulated transcription of the reporters when introduced into the cytosol by HVJ liposomes (23Kitadokoro K. Kamitani S. Miyazawa M. Hanajima-Ozawa M. Fukui A. Miyake M. Horiguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5139-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, C-PMT ΔC1(4H) did not show activity (Fig. 5A). Phospholipase assays also revealed the inactivity of C-PMT ΔC1(4H) (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicate that C1(4H) plays some role in the toxicity probably through its membrane-targeting activity. To elucidate this, we constructed a variant of C-PMT ΔC1(4H) tagged with an N-myristoylation peptide, which functions as a membrane-targeting signal, and examined whether it is substitutable for C1(4H). As expected, the N-myristoylation peptide tag conferred the membrane-targeting characteristics on the tagged proteins (supplemental Fig. S7). In addition, the N-myristoylation peptide tag, but not its unmyristoylated analogue, G2A, made C-PMT ΔC1(4H) active when produced in the cells (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S8). Thus, C1(4H) is considered to function as the membrane-targeting signal for PMT.FIGURE 6N-Myristoylation peptide tag can functionally compensate for deletion of C1(4H). The effect of the N-myristoylation peptide-tagged C-PMT ΔC1(4H) on the NFAT-luciferase assay of 293T cells is shown. 293T cells were co-transfected with C-PMTs and NFAT-luciferase. The luciferase activity in the cells was determined 48 h after the transfection as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each data point represents the mean of at least triplicate measurements; the error bar shows S.D. Representative results from three independent experiments are shown.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To detect the direct binding of the C1 domain to phospholipids, which compose the plasma membrane, we applied the recombinant C-PMT and C-PMT ΔC1(4H) to surface plasmon resonance analyses with the liposome-coated sensor chips. It was shown that C-PMT directly bound to various phospholipids, whereas C-PMT ΔC1(4H) did not (supplemental Fig. S9). GST-tagged C1(4H) (GST-C1(4H)) but not GST also bound to the liposomes as well as C-PMT. Both C-PMT and GST-C1(4H) bound to the liposomes containing PS, PG, PA, or PI more apparently than those containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylcholine without PS, PG, PA, or PI (Fig. 7, upper panel, and supplemental Fig. S9). In this study, we found that C1(4H) of the C1 domain functions as a membrane-targeting signal to recruit the PMT molecule to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. C1(4H) was also essential for intoxicating target cells. These results indicate that PMT, after entering the cytoplasm, needs to be delivered by C1(4H) beneath the plasma membrane where its target molecules should reside. Recently, it was reported that the toxin directly targets and deamidates Gαi and Gαq, the α subunits of heterotrimeric GTPases (15Orth J.H. Preuss I. Fester I. Schlosser A. Wilson B.A. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because the α subunits are known to be located on the cell membrane and transduce signals from the heptahelical transmembrane receptors to downstream pathways, it is conceivable that C1(4H) recruitment of PMT to the plasma membrane is essential for the actions of the toxin. This is supported by the finding that the N-myristoylation peptide tag could substitute for C1(4H), a result that also suggests that C1(4H) is not involved in the intoxication process other than in the membrane targeting. C1(4H) shows homology with the N termini of C. difficile toxin B and related large clostridial cytotoxins in amino acid sequence (Fig. 1). Notably, the tertiary structures of C1(4H) and the N terminus of toxin B are quite similar. The N-terminal four helices of toxin B, like C1(4H), serve as the plasma membrane-targeting signal. Substitutions of amino acid residues conserved among C1(4H) and large clostridial cytotoxins abolished the membrane-targeting property of C1(4H). These results imply that C1(4H) and the large clostridial cytotoxins exert their membrane-targeting ability through the same mechanism. Of the large clostridial cytotoxins, C. sordellii lethal toxin (LT) was intensively analyzed for its ability to bind phospholipids, the major components of the biomembrane (31Mesmin B. Robbe K. Geny B. Luton F. Brandolin G. Popoff M.R. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49876-49882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mesmin et al. (31Mesmin B. Robbe K. Geny B. Luton F. Brandolin G. Popoff M.R. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49876-49882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal region of LT bound to anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine better than to neutral lipids. They presumed that the specificity for phosphatidylserine, which is more abundant in the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes, could be advantageous to LT for targeting its substrates, the membrane-associated small GTPases. In addition, they suggested that the basic residues in the N-terminal 18-amino acid region of LT were important for interaction with the anionic phospholipids. However, toxin B, which also has small GTPases as substrates, did not show a clear preference for phosphatidylserine probably because its N terminus is less basic than that of LT. In this study, C1(4H), like toxin B, was found to bind almost equally to any phospholipid and to be essential for the intracellular toxicity of PMT. Thus, in the case of PMT and toxin B, specificity in binding phosphatidylserine does not seem to be important. The N-terminal 18 amino acids of LT that were reported to be essential for the interaction with phospholipids correspond to the first helix of the N termini of the large clostridial cytotoxins and the C1 domain of PMT. We demonstrated that the other three helices were also necessary for the membrane targeting: deletion mutants in which any helices of C1(4H) were missing lost the membrane-targeting property. Therefore, it is likely that the overall structure of C1(4H) is necessary for the membrane targeting. This may be the case for the large clostridial cytotoxins. C1(4H) and the N terminus of toxin B form the typical four-helix bundle. This characteristic structure per se may function to associate with phospholipids. Previously, we demonstrated that the crystal structure of C-PMT is intracellularly active and revealed that it consists of three distinct domains, C1, C2, and C3. We evidenced that the C3 domain with a thiol protease-like catalytic triad organizes the enzymatic core, the nature of which was recently found to be a deamidase for the α subunits of heterotrimeric GTPases (15Orth J.H. Preuss I. Fester I. Schlosser A. Wilson B.A. Aktories K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7179-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that the C1 domain functions as the membrane-targeting signal for PMT. However, the function of the C2 domain remains unknown. The C2 domain is composed of two α/β-folds, the structure of which is known to provide a biochemically active site in various functional proteins. Because C-PMT is considered to represent the unit necessary and sufficient for the intracellular action of PMT, the C2 domain should play some role in the target cells. In general, it is known that toxins modifying intracellular target molecules bind to their receptors on the cell surface, are internalized into the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, enter the cytoplasm crossing the membrane of the endocytotic vesicles, and eventually reach substrate molecules. During these procedures, the C2 domain may exert its function. For example, it was reported that Vibrio cholerae RTX (repeats-in-toxin) and C. difficile toxins A and B underwent autoproteolytic cleavage to deliver their catalytic domains into the cytosol of target cells (33Sheahan K.L. Cordero C.L. Satchell K.J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Reineke J. Tenzer S. Rupnik M. Koschinski A. Hasselmayer O. Schrattenholz A.

Chem. 2007; 282: 25314-25321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These autocleavages were accomplished by specific domains in the toxin molecules. Although it is unknown whether this is the case for PMT, it may be that any autocleavage of PMT is conducted by the C2 domain. To elucidate the true function of the C2 domain, we are now dissecting its tertiary structure in detail. The N-terminal region of PMT is believed to be responsible for binding to an unidentified cell surface receptor. The domain that translocates at least the C-terminal catalytic domain from the endocytotic vesicles to the cytosol was reportedly located in the region spanning residues 402–457 (16Baldwin M.R. Lakey J.H. Lax A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence demonstrating the role of each domain of the N-terminal region of PMT is not sufficient. We are also trying to determine the crystal structure of the full-length PMT, which should provide a complete understanding of the structure-function relationship of the toxin. We greatly appreciate the gift of p15xNFAT(MCIP1)-luc plasmids from Dr. Eric Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). We thank Tomoko Suzuki for secretarial assistance.

Although both their data and ours demonstrate the membrane-targeting function of the domains, its mechanism remains unknown.

Recently, we identified a motor protein, myosin X, that identifies bundled actin filaments for transport. These bundles direct myosin X to a unique destination, the tips of cellular filopodia. Because the structural and kinetic features that drive bundle selection are unknown, we employed a domain-swapping approach with the nonselective myosin V to identify the selectivity module of myosin X. We found a surprising role of the myosin X tail region (post-IQ) in supporting long runs on bundles. Moreover, the myosin X head is adapted for initiating processive runs on bundles. We found that the tail is structured and biases the orientation of the two myosin X heads because a targeted insertion that introduces flexibility in the tail abolishes selectivity. Together, these results suggest how myosin motors may manage to read cellular addresses.

Together, these results suggest how myosin motors may manage to read cellular addresses. The essential role of cytoskeletal motor proteins in organizing cellular compartments and cargoes is widely accepted (1Ross J.L. Ali M.Y. Warshaw D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, many of the molecular details of the overall transport and organization process are poorly understood. These essential features include how motors engage cargoes at their source, how motors are activated once they engage cargo, how they choose the correct set of cytoskeletal tracks, how they disengage from cargo at their destination, and how they return to sources of cargo. Clearly, errors at any of these stages would lead to faults in cellular organization and misplaced cargoes. To begin to address these questions we have focused on a particular motor protein, myosin X, due to its ability to navigate to a precise location within the cell (2Sousa A.D. Cheney R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Myosin X is found at the mitotic and meiotic spindle, where it sets the orientation of the spindle relative to the substrate and influences spindle length (3Woolner S. O'Brien L.L. Wiese C. Bement W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 4Wühr M. Mitchison T.J. Field C.M. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R912-R914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, myosin X is more commonly found in interphase cells at the tips of filopodia (5Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These long, slender projections at the leading edge of migrating cells are involved in cell motility and environmental sensing. Myosin X transports components such as Ena/VASP and integrins that are found in the filopodial tip complex (2Sousa A.D. Cheney R.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 6Tokuo H. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The early work by Berg et al. (5Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) demonstrated that myosin X reaches filopodial tips under its own power. Recently, we found that myosin X identifies filopodia by recognizing the fascin-bundled actin filaments found in the filopodial core (7Nagy S. Ricca B.L. Norstrom M.F. Courson D.S. Brawley C.M. Smithback P.A. Rock R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9616-9620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Myosin X takes long processive runs along these tightly bundled actin filaments while largely ignoring isolated actin filaments found throughout the cell. In contrast, myosin V does not distinguish between single actin filaments and bundled actin filaments when taking processive runs. Here, we seek to identify the “selectivity module” that allows myosin X to recognize bundled actin filaments. Our first approach is to swap similar domains between the selective myosin X and the nonselective myosin V. In this approach, we are aided by the fact that both myosin V and myosin X have clearly recognizable lever arms, composed of repeating IQ domains that bind calmodulins. These lever arms are mechanical elements that are known to reorient and amplify smaller motions in the catalytic head domains of myosins during stepping. Because crystal structures of isolated lever arms are available, the ends of this domain are easy to recognize. In fact, many engineering studies of myosins alter the length of these lever arms or even replace them entirely with artificial, rigid structures (8Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L.

Thus, we were reasonably confident that we could generate functional myosins with altered selectivity properties through a domain swapping approach, where our cut points are located at each end of the lever arms. We show through these domain swaps that the myosin X tail (post-IQ) is the most important contributor to selectivity. In fact, we find that every one of our chimeras with a myosin X tail has an enhanced run length on bundled actin filaments. This is a surprising result because the tail domains should be distant from the actin filaments where bundle recognition occurs. To address the role of this critical tail domain, we inserted a flexible polypeptide linker to disrupt its structure. We found that this targeted insertion abolishes bundle selectivity in myosin X. Our results point toward the presence of a novel tail domain structure, which positions the two motor domains of myosin X at the correct spacing and orientation to recognize an actin filament bundle. Moreover, we found a separate role for the myosin X head in the successful initiation of processive runs. Together, this work uncovers some of the structural features that allow molecular motors to select distinct tracks and ultimately arrange cellular contents with high fidelity. Fascin was prepared as previously described (11Vignjevic D. Kojima S. Aratyn Y. Danciu O. Svitkina T. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Fascin-actin bundles were created by incubating 8 μm F-actin with 3 μm fascin for 2 days (4 °C, in F-buffer) to ensure fully formed and ordered bundles.

The myosin X HMM forced dimer construct was inserted into InsectDirect pBiEx3 vector (Novagen) modified to include the pBlueScript multiple cloning site (pBiEx3-BS), transfected into Sf9 insect cells, and purified by FLAG affinity chromatography. All constructs containing the myosin X IQ domains were coexpressed with the myosin X-specific light chain CALML3; constructs containing the myosin V IQ domains were coexpressed with MLC-1sa (both in pBiEx3-BS). Myosin X with a C tag (12Huang J. Nagy S.S. Koide A. Rock R.S. Koide S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11834-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was similarly expressed and purified. This construct was used only for the single molecule three-bead trapping experiments because the affinity clamp serves as a superior handle compared with anti-GFP.

Head, IQ, and tail chimeras between myosin X and myosin V were constructed with overlap extension PCR, using the forced dimer HMM DNAs as templates, to produce the desired combinations. Thus, all constructs here contain GCN4 at the C terminus of the coiled-coil domains (Leu-920 for myosin X tails and Ile-1107 for myosin V tails). Myosin X sequences used were: head domain to Glu-741, IQ from Val-742 to Ala-817, and tail from Ala-813. Myosin V sequences used were: head domain to Lys-766, IQ from Leu-767 to Lys-910, and tail from Ile-911. The constructs were inserted into pBiEx3-BS, transfected into Sf9 cells, and FLAG purified. Forward and reverse primers encoding the (GSG)2 sequence (GGTAGTGGTGGTAGTGGT) were used for overlap extension PCR, introducing the six-amino acid flexible linker into the molecule at the desired location either before or after the single α-helix (SAH) domain. The SAH domain was designated to begin at Glu-818 where the VXV and XXV chimeras were spliced and end at Glu-861, 13 residues after previously identified SAH (13Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to retain more charged residues RAQQEEAARKQRE that may contribute to the motif. The constructs were inserted into the pBiEx3-BS vector, transfected into Sf9 cells, and FLAG-purified as for myosin X. All of the myosin constructs described here were verified by DNA sequencing of the pBiEx3-BS vector. Expressed myosins were initially characterized by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1A), their ability to bind to actin in cosedimentation assays (supplemental Fig. 1B), and their actin-activated ATPase activity (supplemental Fig. 2 and supplemental Table 2). Motility assays were performed in flow chambers constructed of a glass slide, two strips of double-sided tape, and a nitrocellulose-coated coverslip. All reagents were prepared in assay buffer (AB) containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Reagents were added to the flow chamber in 10-μl volumes in the following order: 50 ng/μl anti-GFP (Qbiogene), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, myosin (variable concentration), AB, 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin actin, AB, and motility buffer. Motility buffer contains 2 mm ATP, 2 μm calmodulin, 0.86 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.14 mg/ml catalase, and 9 mg/ml glucose in AB. Actin filaments were imaged in epifluorescence on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 by an Andor Luca CCD. Images were analyzed in ImageJ by manually tracking the leading or trailing ends of moving filaments. We imaged myosin motility using a custom-built objective-type TIRF microscope. Images were collected with a 100×, 1.65 NA objective (Olympus) and an EMCCD camera (iXon; Andor Technologies). Frames were collected at 2 Hz. We prepared tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments by mixing biotinylated G-actin (at Cys-374) with unbiotinylated G-actin at a 1:9 ratio before polymerization (14Rock R.S. Rief M. Mehta A.D. Spudich J.A. Methods. 2000; 22: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Flow chambers were coated with neutravidin (0.5 mg/ml) and then blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). We applied to the flow cell either single filaments or fascin bundles and immobilized them through the biotin-neutravidin interaction. We applied motility buffer (as above) containing nanomolar myosin with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1% Triton X-100 to further block nonspecific adsorption. Actin was imaged for four to six frames, then excitation was switched to the GFP channel to image motility. Overlaying the first few frames with the rest of the movie facilitated the identification of bundle ends. Construction and analysis of kymographs along the actin axis were used to track movement of single myosins. Data for spots that moved <200 nm or 1.5 s were discarded from analysis to eliminate misidentified diffusive events. We used a custom-built optical trapping/TIRF microscope, modeled after similar instruments previously described (15Visscher K. Gross S. Block S. IEEE J. Selected Topics Quantum Elect. 1996; 2: 1066-1076Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar), with bead position detection performed in the condenser back focal plane. Detector responses were calibrated by raster scanning the bead through the detection area and calculating a fifth-order, two-dimensional polynomial response function (16Lang M.J. Asbury C.L. Shaevitz J.W. Block S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We decorated 0.5-μm-diameter beads with myosin X via anti-GFP antibodies. We introduced these beads into a flow chamber that had surface-attached fascin-actin bundles. The myosin density was chosen such that 10% of the beads bound or moved on surface attached fascin-actin bundles, establishing single-motor conditions. As the myosin engaged with actin undergoing forward motion, the trap position was adjusted to maintain a 1-pN force on the bead-myosin-actin interaction. The bead position trace represents the motion of the molecule along an actin bundle. A step-finder algorithm (17Kerssemakers J.W. Munteanu E.L. Laan L. Noetzel T.L. Janson M.E. Dogterom M. Nature. 2006; 442: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) was used to identify step-like transitions within the bead position trace. We also used previously described optical trapping protocols and reagents (14Rock R.S. Rief M. Mehta A.D. Spudich J.A. Methods. 2000; 22: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Mehta A.D. Finer J.T. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 436-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in a three-bead geometry (19Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Briefly, a flow cell made with bead-coated coverslips (1.5-μm-diameter silica; Bangs Labs) was incubated with the affinity clamp protein (12Huang J. Nagy S.S. Koide A. Rock R.S. Koide S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 11834-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) followed by bovine serum albumin and nanomolar myosin X. The flow cell was washed with AB, and motility buffer was flowed in. Motility buffer contains 10 μm ATP, 2 μm calmodulin, 0.086 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.014 mg/ml catalase, 0.09 mg/ml glucose, biotinylated fascin-actin bundles stabilized with tetramethylrhodamine-phalloidin, 1-μm neutravidin beads (0.02% solids), and 1 μm phalloidin (Sigma). At the myosin densities used in these experiments ∼10% of beads or platforms showed motor activity. For this experiment the instrument generated multiple traps by rapidly chopping (20-kHz) trap position using a pair of orthogonal acoustooptical deflectors (Intraaction). Bead positions were detected with back focal plane detection (15Visscher K. Gross S. Block S. IEEE J. Selected Topics Quantum Elect. 1996; 2: 1066-1076Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar), using two fiber-coupled laser diodes (785 and 850 nm) as probe beams and two spectrally separated duolateral position-sensitive diodes placed in planes conjugated to the back focal plane of the condenser. Bead positions were low pass antialias filtered at 1 kHz with a custom 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at 2 kHz. Because myosin X prefers bundled actin for processive motility and seems to function by straddling two actin filaments within the bundle (7Nagy S. Ricca B.L. Norstrom M.F. Courson D.S. Brawley C.M. Smithback P.A. Rock R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 9616-9620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we expect that this myosin has specific structural or functional features which allow the leading head to recognize an adjacent filament while disfavoring binding along the same actin filament. One such feature is the lever arm. Each myosin family member has a variable number of IQ motifs that form the light chain-binding sites for calmodulin that comprise the lever arm (20Holmes K.C. Geeves M.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Myosin V produces long working strokes with its long lever, and truncations produce working strokes in proportion to the lever arm length (8Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Myosin X has a short, three-IQ lever arm, which is half of the six-IQ lever arm of the canonically processive myosin V. Part of this difference may be compensated by a SAH motif (13Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that could extend the lever arm. To dissect the domains responsible for selectivity, a combinatorial chimera design strategy was adopted. The experimental intent here was to convert myosin V HMM into a bundle-selective myosin and to abolish selectivity in myosin X HMM molecule by exchanging the head, the IQ, or tail (post-IQ through coiled-coil) domains. Using this strategy, six chimeric constructs were generated. The domain boundaries for these constructs were chosen to be immediately before the first and after the last IQ domains, which are easily identified within the sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). The bovine myosin X IQs span from Val-742 to Ala-817, and the chicken myosin V IQ spans from Leu-767 to Lys-910. To produce these recombinant myosins, the InsectDirect system was used to transiently transfect insect cells with the construct DNAs for accelerated production (21Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Each of the six chimeras was successfully expressed and purified, and all of them moved actin filaments in the gliding filament assay (Fig. 1C), demonstrating that they have intact motor activity. The velocities measured in the gliding filament assay reflect the nature of the constructs. The two that are significantly slower than the others, VXV and XXV, contain a particularly poor combination of structural elements: myosin X IQ domains followed not by a SAH, but by a myosin V coiled-coil. This observation is in line with previous work where versions of myosin V with truncated lever arms are essentially nonprocessive (8Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Moore J.R. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As we show below, these two slower chimeras have additional motility defects. In the following three sections, we illustrate how each myosin domain affects the run length along single actin filaments versus bundles, a phenomenon that we call run length selectivity. In all cases, run lengths were determined using a TIRF motility assay (Fig. 2); selectivity was established by comparing run lengths along single filaments with bundled actin filaments. Here, we consider the possibility that the motor domain, defined as the N-terminal segment ending at the first IQ motif, may be specifically tuned via its kinetic cycle, actin binding properties, or power stroke geometry to favor processive runs on bundled filaments. The chimeras used to test this possibility are VXX and XVV, where the motor domains of the two myosins were exchanged. We find that VXX is selective for bundled actin, although it is also processive on single filaments. The run length on fascin-actin bundles is almost double that on single filaments, 0.49 ± 0.02 μm versus 0.29 ± 0.01 μm (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, XVV had similar run lengths on both single actin filaments and fascin-actin bundles (0.27 ± 0.02 μm and 0.31 ± 0.02 μm, respectively; Fig. 2D). This indicates that the myosin X head alone does not impart selectivity on the molecule. The next set of chimeras, VXV and XVX, tested the role of the number of IQ domains in run length selectivity. When we extend the lever arm of myosin X by three IQ motifs to generate XVX, we find that the run length selectivity for bundles remains intact. Although we obtained XVX run lengths of 0.21 ± 0.01 μm along fascin-actin bundles, only two runs were observed on single actin filaments, both of which fell below our minimum reliable detection threshold (200 nm; Fig. 2E). These results clearly indicate that the overall reach of myosin X is unimportant in its selectivity. For VXV, we generated a motor that reduced the lever arm of myosin V by three IQ motifs. Although VXV is a functional myosin that glides filaments (Fig. 1C), it is rendered entirely nonprocessive on both types of actin structures (Fig. 2F). This result is consistent with previous truncation studies of myosin V, where a 2IQ domain construct was nonprocessive with a short power stroke (8Purcell T.J. Morris C. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14159-14164Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 10Moore J.R. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, we can conclude that myosins with a shorter reach do not automatically select the bundled geometry. By the process of elimination, we arrive at the suggestion that the myosin X tail is responsible for run length selectivity. To establish the conclusion that the post-IQ region of myosin X is the “selectivity cassette,” we constructed two more chimeras, XXV and VVX. Replacing the myosin X tail region with the coiled-coil tail of myosin V (XXV) eliminates processivity of the molecule on both types of actin (Fig. 2G). This result suggests that some portion of the myosin X tail acts to extend the reach of the molecule, in line with the previously proposed role for the SAH domain following the IQ motifs of myosin X (13Knight P.J. Thirumurugan K. Xu Y. Wang F. Kalverda A.P. Stafford 3rd, W.F. Sellers J.R. Peckham M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34702-34708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The key role of the myosin X tail domain in run length selectivity is further confirmed by VVX, which is a myosin V molecule with the myosin X post-IQ region. This construct is almost twice as processive on bundled actin as on single filaments, 0.76 ± 0.02 μm versus 0.45 ± 0.02 μm (Fig. 2H). Until now, we have considered how the relative run lengths on actin filaments versus bundles are altered in each of our chimeras. These run lengths are determined by the probability of terminating an already established processive run after each forward step. Here, we consider the probability that our chimeras successfully initiate a processive run. Surprisingly, we find that this initiation selectivity is a separate property that requires the myosin X head, rather than the tail. To facilitate these comparisons, we define “initiation selectivity” as a relative landing rate: the rate at which myosins land (with detectable processive movement) on bundles, divided by the landing rate on single filaments (Fig. 3). We use identical motor concentrations in these experiments, as we compare motility on single filaments and bundles as a matched pair using a single split stock of TIRF motility buffer and myosin. Thus, our measure of initiation selectivity is not compromised by errors in our motor stock concentration. Although there is a maximum of 20–25 actin filaments in fascin-actin bundles, we find that myosin V is only 3.5 times more likely to initiate a processive run per μm of bundles, relative to single actin filaments. This difference is expected, as there are many inaccessible myosin-binding sites in an actin bundle; many filaments are buried in the interior of the bundle, some sites are inaccessible because they face the coverslip surface, and other sites on the bundle surface are inaccessible due to the close spacing of the bundle filaments (see “Discussion”). Because myosin V shows no run length selectivity for bundles, it appears that it does not detect the higher local concentration of binding sites within the bundle. Therefore, we use myosin V as our reference for initiation selectivity. To this end, we divide our relative initiation rates by 3.5, to account for these structural differences between actin filaments and bundles. Initiation selectivities >1 indicate a myosin that prefers to start processive runs on bundles compared with myosin V, whereas initiation selectivities <1 likewise indicate a preference for single filaments. We find that all constructs with a myosin X head prefer to initiate runs on bundles, with initiation selectivities >1 (Fig. 3). Likewise, all motors with a myosin V head prefer to initiate runs on single filaments, with initiation selectivities <1. The most bundle-selective motor is the wild type myosin X, or perhaps XVX. Because we were unable to measure a run length for XVX on single filaments, its initiation selectivity is an undetermined value that is >1. When we combine this information with the run lengths determined in Fig. 2, to yield an effective transport distance along bundled actin relative to single filaments, we find that myosin X is the most successful at such selective transport. To obtain these relative distances, we multiplied the initiation selectivities by the ratio of bundle to single actin run lengths obtained in Fig. 2. Evidence from the myosin V/myosin X chimeras implicates the post-IQ region of the molecule to be responsible for bundle selectivity in myosin X. The most prominent and unique feature of the myosin X tail domain is the SAH motif as mentioned earlier. We believe that this domain plays a major role in the myosin X selectivity of bundled actin. This domain may impose a structural constraint that hinders the second head from binding straight ahead along the same filament, instead biasing it to search for a binding site on a neighboring filament. To determine the role of a structured region in imparting selectivity, free swivel mutants were designed. In these constructs a flexible linker either preceding or following the SAH domain was inserted (Fig. 4A). Such an approach was previously used to break the myosin V lever arm after the second IQ domain (9Sakamoto T. Wang F. Schmitz S. Xu Y. Xu Q. Molloy J.E. Veigel C. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29201-29207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The linker of choice was (GSG)2 as it has been previously used on anchoring domains on myosin VI (21Bryant Z. Altman D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The introduction of flexibility into the system is motivated by myosin V, which contains a free swiveling joint between the two lever arms and before the coiled-coil domain, allowing for a spherical search for the most favorable binding site (1Ross J.L. Ali M.Y. Warshaw D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 22Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer 3rd, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These swivel mutants will disrupt any structurally rigid elements in myosin X and, if our model is valid, result in a motor domain that is allowed to freely search for the next binding site. From the TIRF motility assays of the two constructs (Fig. 4D), it is clear that selectivity has essentially been abolished with similar run lengths on single filaments as on bundles (pre-SAH, 0.19 ± 0.01 μm and 0.27 ± 0.01 μm; and post-SAH, 0.23 ± 0.01 μm and 0.22 ± 0.03 μm, respectively). These constructs travel for much shorter distances than obse"

We tested whether the quasi-irreversible receptor-binding of ET-1 (i) limits reversing effects of the antagonists and (ii) can be selectively dissociated by an endogenous counterbalancing mechanism. Methodology/Principal findings In isolated rat mesenteric resistance arteries, ETA-antagonists, endothelium-derived relaxing factors and synthetic vasodilators transiently reduced contractile effects of ET-1 but did not prevent persistent effects of the peptide. Stimuli of peri-vascular vasodilator sensory-motor nerves such as capsaicin not only reduced but also terminated long-lasting effects of ET-1. This was prevented by CGRP-receptor antagonists and was mimicked by exogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy in vital intact arteries, capsaicin and CGRP, but not ETA-antagonism, were observed to promote dissociation of pre-existing ET-1/ETA-receptor complexes. Conclusions Irreversible binding and activation of ETA-receptors by ET-1 (i) occur at an antagonist-insensitive site of the receptor and (ii) are selectively terminated by endogenously released CGRP. Hence, natural stimuli of sensory-motor nerves that stimulate release of endogenous CGRP can be considered for therapy of diseases involving ET-1."
https://openalex.org/W1999665897,"Genotyping platforms such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are powerful tools to study genomic aberrations in cancer samples. Allele specific information from SNP arrays provides valuable information for interpreting copy number variation (CNV) and allelic imbalance including loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) beyond that obtained from the total DNA signal available from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) platforms. Several algorithms based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been designed to detect copy number changes and copy-neutral LOH making use of the allele information on SNP arrays. However heterogeneity in clinical samples, due to stromal contamination and somatic alterations, complicates analysis and interpretation of these data.We have developed MixHMM, a novel hidden Markov model using hidden states based on chromosomal structural aberrations. MixHMM allows CNV detection for copy numbers up to 7 and allows more complete and accurate description of other forms of allelic imbalance, such as increased copy number LOH or imbalanced amplifications. MixHMM also incorporates a novel sample mixing model that allows detection of tumor CNV events in heterogeneous tumor samples, where cancer cells are mixed with a proportion of stromal cells.We validate MixHMM and demonstrate its advantages with simulated samples, clinical tumor samples and a dilution series of mixed samples. We have shown that the CNVs of cancer cells in a tumor sample contaminated with up to 80% of stromal cells can be detected accurately using Illumina BeadChip and MixHMM.The MixHMM is available as a Python package provided with some other useful tools at http://genecube.med.yale.edu:8080/MixHMM."
https://openalex.org/W2012587917,"Capping protein (CP) is a ubiquitously expressed, heterodimeric 62-kDa protein that binds the barbed end of the actin filament with high affinity to block further filament elongation. Myotrophin (V-1) is a 13-kDa ankyrin repeat-containing protein that binds CP tightly, sequestering it in a totally inactive complex in vitro. Here, we elucidate the molecular interaction between CP and V-1 by NMR. Specifically, chemical shift mapping and intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments reveal that the ankyrin loops of V-1, which are essential for V-1/CP interaction, bind the basic patch near the joint of the alpha tentacle of CP shown previously to drive most of the association of CP with and affinity for the barbed end. Consistently, site-directed mutagenesis of CP shows that V-1 and the strong electrostatic binding site for CP on the barbed end compete for this basic patch on CP. These results can explain how V-1 inactivates barbed end capping by CP and why V-1 is incapable of uncapping CP-capped actin filaments, the two signature biochemical activities of V-1."
https://openalex.org/W2002620815,"The replication of DNA in Archaea and eukaryotes requires several ancillary complexes, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor C (RFC), and the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex. Bacterial DNA replication utilizes comparable proteins, but these are distantly related phylogenetically to their archaeal and eukaryotic counterparts at best.While the structures of each of the complexes do not differ significantly between the archaeal and eukaryotic versions thereof, the evolutionary dynamic in the two cases does. The number of subunits in each complex is constant across all taxa. However, they vary subtly with regard to composition. In some taxa the subunits are all identical in sequence, while in others some are homologous rather than identical. In the case of eukaryotes, there is no phylogenetic variation in the makeup of each complex-all appear to derive from a common eukaryotic ancestor. This is not the case in Archaea, where the relationship between the subunits within each complex varies taxon-to-taxon. We have performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of these relationships in order to better understand the gene duplications and divergences that gave rise to the homologous subunits in Archaea.This domain level difference in evolution suggests that different forces have driven the evolution of DNA replication proteins in each of these two domains. In addition, the phylogenies of all three gene families support the distinctiveness of the proposed archaeal phylum Thaumarchaeota."

Herein we describe the first x-ray structure determination of bacterial biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase (CANSDC) to 2.3- and 2.0-Å resolution, solved as product complexes with agmatine and norspermidine. Despite low overall sequence identity, the monomeric and dimeric structures are similar to other enzymes in the family, with the active sites formed between the β/α-barrel domain of one subunit and the β-barrel of the other. ADC contains both a unique interdomain insertion (4-helical bundle) and a C-terminal extension (3-helical bundle) and it packs as a tetramer in the asymmetric unit with the insertions forming part of the dimer and tetramer interfaces. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies confirmed that the ADC solution structure is a tetramer. Specificity for different basic amino acids appears to arise primarily from changes in the position of, and amino acid replacements in, a helix in the β-barrel domain we refer to as the “specificity helix.” Additionally, in CANSDC a key acidic residue that interacts with the distal amino group of other substrates is replaced by Leu314, which interacts with the aliphatic portion of norspermidine. Neither product, agmatine in ADC nor norspermidine in CANSDC, form a Schiff base to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, suggesting that the product complexes may promote product release by slowing the back reaction.

This family of PLP-dependent enzymes functions on a broad range of basic amino acid substrates required for polyamine biosynthesis (l-ornithine, l-arginine, l-lysine, carboxynorspermidine, and carboxyspermidine) in both eukaryotes and bacteria (ODC, ADC, L/ODC, CANSDC), and lysine biosynthesis (meso-diaminopimelate) (DAPDC) in bacteria and archaea (4Grishin N.V.

Some bacteria also contain aspartate aminotransferase fold-type decarboxylases that are involved in polyamine biosynthesis, but these enzymes are structurally unrelated to the β/α-barrel-fold basic amino acid decarboxlyase family and are restricted to activity on l-Orn, l-Lys, and l-Arg (8Momany C.

Comparison of the available structures identified the helix (termed “specificity helix”) (Fig. 2), which sits at the back of the substrate-binding site at the 2-fold axis of the dimer, as a key specificity element (5Lee J. Michael A.J. Martynowski D. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27115-27125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Shah R. Akella R. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Substrates of different size are accommodated by changes in the distance from this helix to PLP, whereas variation in its amino acid composition provides specificity of interaction with the range of substrates. Two functional classes within the family, however, remain structurally uncharacterized, including bacterial/plant ADC and CANSDC. The bacterial ADCs contain a long insertion between the N-terminal β/α-barrel domain and a C-terminal β-barrel domain, both of which are novel within the family, and the function of which was unknown. Furthermore, the structural basis for substrate specificity in the bacterial ADCs cannot be deduced by sequence analysis alone. Determination of the x-ray structure of a bacterial ADC has been of long standing interest as evidenced by the number of crystallization reports that have been published (25Liu X.Y. Lei J. Liu X. Su X.D. Li L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 26Song J. Zhou C. Liu R. Wu X. Wu D. Hu X. Ding Y. Mol. Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite this significant effort, solution of the structure remained elusive until now. CANSDC catalyzes the decarboxylation of carboxynorspermidine and carboxyspermidine, both substrates are considerably larger than the substrates utilized by other enzymes in the family, and structural data are needed to elucidate how the enzyme accommodates these larger substrates. Herein we report the first x-ray structure determination of the two remaining functional enzyme types in the β/α-barrel-fold basic amino acid decarboxlyase family: bacterial ADC (V. vulnificus; VvADC) and bacterial CANSDC (Campylobacter jejuni; CjCANSDC). These studies round out the structural analysis of the five characterized substrate specificity types (Table 1) in the β/α-barrel decarboxylase-fold. Taken together with previous structural analysis of enzymes from this family, these studies provide a comprehensive example of how enzymes evolve to generate novel function through gene duplication and divergence. The gene for CjCANSDC was cloned from C. jejuni 81116 by PCR using genomic DNA as the template followed by cloning into the pET100 expression vector. The original clone of CjCANSDC contained a spontaneous single nucleotide mutation at amino acid residue 184 resulting in Glu (GAA) to Lys (AAA) mutation. This mutation was not observed in any other sequenced strain of CjCANSDC and led to loss of activity. Lys184 was mutated to Glu by QuikChangeTM mutagenesis (5′-gctgttttaaaggtctttgaagagaaatttggtaaatgg-3′) and the corrected clone was used for further study including kinetic analysis and protein crystallization. The pET-22b expression vector for V. vulnificus CMCP6 arginine decarboxylase (VvADC) was previously described (5Lee J. Michael A.J. Martynowski D. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27115-27125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Native proteins of CjCANSDC and VvADC were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using Ni2+-affinity and gel filtration chromatography as previously described (5Lee J. Michael A.J. Martynowski D. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27115-27125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine (SeMet) derivatives of CjCANSDC and VvADC were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the Met pathway inhibition method as previously described (29Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 nm reached 0.6–0.7. Cells were induced with 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 4 h after the addition of SeMet stock solution (Athena Enzyme Systems, Baltimore, MD) and the feedback inhibition amino acids (100 mg/liter each of l-Thr, l-Lys, and l-Phe, and 50 mg/liter each of l-Leu, l-Ile, and l-Val). Harvested cells were lysed and proteins were purified as above in the presence of 20 mm dithiothreitol. ESI-MS analysis of the purified proteins (Protein Technology Center, UT Southwestern Medical Center) revealed that all Met sites in each protein (14 sites in VvADC and 13 sites in CjCANSDC) were replaced with SeMet (data not shown). Substrates were synthesized previously as described (13Lee J. Sperandio V. Frantz D.E. Longgood J. Camilli A. Phillips M.A. Michael A.J. J. Biol.

Steady-state kinetic analysis was performed utilizing a coupled enzyme assay that links decarboxylation to the oxidation of NADH through the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase as previously described (13Lee J.

Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine kcat and Km using Prism (GraphPad). SeMet-substituted crystals of CjCANSDC were co-crystallized with 10 mm NSpd in hanging drops containing 1.5 μl of protein (20 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% Brij, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution (2.75 m AmSO4, 0.1 m Bicine, pH 8.5). Rod shape crystals appeared after 4–5 days at 20 °C and grew to 80 μm thick × 600 μm long by 2 weeks. Crystals were cryoprotected in 2.7 m AmSO4, 0.1 m Bicine, pH 8.5, 0.3 m NaCl, and 17% glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. SAD data were collected at beamline 19ID of Advanced Photon Source. Crystals of SeMet-substituted CjCANSDC exhibited the symmetry of space group P43212 with unit cell parameters of a = b = 144.2 Å and c = 79.9 Å. They contained two molecules per asymmetric unit and diffracted isotropically to a dmin of 1.9 Å when exposed to synchrotron radiation. SeMet-derivative crystals of VvADC were co-crystallized with 5 mm l-Arg in sitting drops containing 2 μl of protein (2.5 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% Brij, and 0.5 mm EDTA), 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 m MgCl2, 12% PEG-4000), and 0.4 μl of 1 m NaI. Crystals were cryoprotected in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m MgCl2, 15% PEG-4000, 0.1 m NaI, 0.3 m NaCl, and 25% glycerol. Crystals of SeMet-substituted VvADC exhibited the symmetry of space group P21 with unit cell parameters of a = 101.6 Å, b = 119.4 Å, c = 121.8 Å, and β = 96.3°, contained four molecules of VvADC per asymmetric unit and diffracted isotropically to a dmin of 2.30 Å when exposed to synchrotron radiation.

The structure was refined to a Rwork of 0.179 and a Rfree of 0.218 (Table 2). The final model contains two CjCANSDC monomers in the asymmetric unit; molecule A includes residues 2–129, 140–382, PLP, and NSpd, and whereas molecule B contains residues 6–129, 140–382, and PLP.

The amino acid sequences of VvADC and CjCANSDC were aligned with other sequences in the family for which x-ray structural data are available, including a representative of each substrate specificity type: TbODC (PDB code 1F3T), PBCVADC (PDB code 2NVA), VvL/ODC (PDB code 2PLK), MjDAPDC (PDB code 1TWI). The sequence alignment was generated from the x-ray structure alignment using the program PROMALS3D (42Pei J. Tang M. Grishin N.V.

Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-1 with An-50 Ti rotor, charcoal-filled dual sector centerpiece, and sapphire windows. The wavelength of the absorbance optics was set at 280. Experiments were performed at 45,000 rpm and at 20 °C. Three data set were collected using 3 VvADC concentrations (0.1, 0.4, and 0.8 OD280, respectively), 1 OD280 = 0.93 mg/ml in buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine), and a total volume per cell of 0.4 ml.

Solvent density (1.0083 g/ml), partial specific volume (0.7324 ml/g), and viscosity (0.010473 g/s/cm) were calculated using the SEDNTERP program. VvADC and CjCANSDC were expressed and purified from E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Steady-state kinetic analysis of VvADC was described previously (5Lee J. Michael A.J.

Steady-state kinetic analysis for CjCANSDC was performed using both carboxyspermidine (Km = 4.1 ± 0.36 mm and kcat = 0.24 ± 0.0077 s−1) and carboxynorspermidine (CANS) (Km = 2.1 ± 0.13 mm and kcat = 0.58 ± 0.013 s−1) as substrates. CjCANDC has similar activity on both CANS and carboxyspermidine, whereas VvCANSDC has evolved as higher activity on CANS (13Lee J. Sperandio V. Frantz D.E. Longgood J. Camilli A.

We have previously shown that p190 protein levels are cell cycle-regulated, decreasing in mitosis, and that this decrease is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In addition, overexpression of p190 results in decreased RhoGTP levels at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, p190 and the RhoGEF Ect2 play opposing roles in cytokinesis, and sustained levels of p190 in mitosis are associated with cytokinesis failure, all findings that suggest but do not directly demonstrate that completion of cytokinesis is dependent on reduced levels of p190. Here we report, using an RNAi reconstitution approach with a degradation-resistant mutant, that decreased p190 levels are required for successful cytokinesis. We also show that the multinucleation phenotype is dependent on p190 RhoGAP activity, determine that the N-terminal GBDS1 region is necessary and sufficient for p190 mitotic ubiquitination and degradation, and identify four N-terminal residues as necessary for the degradation of p190 in mitosis. Our data indicate that in addition to activation of RhoGEF(s), reduction of RhoGAP (p190) is a critical mechanism by which increased RhoGTP levels are achieved in late mitosis, thereby ensuring proper cell division. p190RhoGAP-A (p190) is a GTPase-activating protein known to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics by decreasing RhoGTP levels through activation of Rho intrinsic GTPase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2075449486,"The transcription factor NF-kappaB is crucial for numerous cellular functions such as survival, differentiation, immunity, and inflammation. A key function of this family of transcription factors is regulation of osteoclast differentiation and function, which in turn controls skeletal homeostasis. The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which contains IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and IKKgamma, is required for activation of NF-kappaB, and deletion of either IKKalpha or IKKbeta resulted with defective osteoclast differentiation and survival. We have recently investigated the details of the mechanisms governing the role of IKKbeta in osteoclastogenesis and found that constitutively active IKKbeta in which serine residues 177/181 were mutated into negatively charged glutamic acids instigates spontaneous bona fide receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-independent osteoclastogenesis. To better understand and define the functional role of IKKbeta domains capable of regulating the osteoclastogenic activity of IKK, we investigated key motifs in the activation T loop of IKKbeta, which are potentially capable of modulating its osteoclastogenic activity. We discovered that dual serine (traditional serine residues 177/181) and tyrosine (188/199) phosphorylation events are crucial for IKKbeta activation. Mutation of the latter tyrosine residues blunted the NF-kappaB activity of wild type and constitutively active IKKbeta, and tyrosine 188/199-deficient IKKbeta inhibited osteoclastogenesis. Thus, tyrosines 188/199 are a novel target for regulating IKKbeta activity, at least in osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W2150243549,"Approach and avoidance behavior provide a means for assessing the rewarding or aversive value of stimuli, and can be quantified by a keypress procedure whereby subjects work to increase (approach), decrease (avoid), or do nothing about time of exposure to a rewarding/aversive stimulus. To investigate whether approach/avoidance behavior might be governed by quantitative principles that meet engineering criteria for lawfulness and that encode known features of reward/aversion function, we evaluated whether keypress responses toward pictures with potential motivational value produced any regular patterns, such as a trade-off between approach and avoidance, or recurrent lawful patterns as observed with prospect theory.Three sets of experiments employed this task with beautiful face images, a standardized set of affective photographs, and pictures of food during controlled states of hunger and satiety. An iterative modeling approach to data identified multiple law-like patterns, based on variables grounded in the individual. These patterns were consistent across stimulus types, robust to noise, describable by a simple power law, and scalable between individuals and groups. Patterns included: (i) a preference trade-off counterbalancing approach and avoidance, (ii) a value function linking preference intensity to uncertainty about preference, and (iii) a saturation function linking preference intensity to its standard deviation, thereby setting limits to both.These law-like patterns were compatible with critical features of prospect theory, the matching law, and alliesthesia. Furthermore, they appeared consistent with both mean-variance and expected utility approaches to the assessment of risk. Ordering of responses across categories of stimuli demonstrated three properties thought to be relevant for preference-based choice, suggesting these patterns might be grouped together as a relative preference theory. Since variables in these patterns have been associated with reward circuitry structure and function, they may provide a method for quantitative phenotyping of normative and pathological function (e.g., psychiatric illness)."
https://openalex.org/W2075102188,"Background Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder associated with the lack of intramural ganglion cells in the myenteric and sub-mucosal plexuses along varying segments of the gastrointestinal tract. The RET gene is the major gene implicated in this gastrointestinal disease. A highly recurrent mutation in RET (RETR114H) has recently been identified in ∼6–7% of the Chinese HSCR patients which, to date, has not been found in Caucasian patients or controls nor in Chinese controls. Due to the high frequency of RETR114H in this population, we sought to investigate whether this mutation may be a founder HSCR mutation in the Chinese population. Methodology and Principal Findings To test whether all RETR114 were originated from a single mutational event, we predicted the approximate age of RETR114H by applying a Bayesian method to RET SNPs genotyped in 430 Chinese HSCR patients (of whom 25 individuals had the mutation) to be between 4–23 generations old depending on growth rate. We reasoned that if RETR114H was a founder mutation then those with the mutation would share a haplotype on which the mutation resides. Including SNPs spanning 509.31 kb across RET from a recently obtained 500 K genome-wide dataset for a subset of 181 patients (14 RETR114H patients), we applied haplotype estimation methods to determine whether there were any segments shared between patients with RETR114H that are not present in those without the mutation or controls. Analysis yielded a 250.2 kb (51 SNP) shared segment over the RET gene (and downstream) in only those patients with the mutation with no similar segments found among other patients. Conclusions This suggests that RETR114H is a founder mutation for HSCR in the Chinese population."

We have applied this procedure to define the steady states of a classic CRN that exhibits instability, and to a model of programmed cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2099810055,"How can we compute a segregation or diversity index from a three-way or multi-way contingency table, where each variable can take on an arbitrary finite number of values and where the index takes values between zero and one? Previous methods only exist for two-way contingency tables or dichotomous variables. A prototypical three-way case is the segregation index of a set of industries or departments given multiple explanatory variables of both sex and race. This can be further extended to other variables, such as disability, number of years of education, and former military service.We extend existing segregation indices based on Euclidean distance (square of coefficient of variation) and Boltzmann/Shannon/Theil index from two-way to multi-way contingency tables by including multiple summations. We provide several biological applications, such as indices for age polyethism and linkage disequilibrium. We also provide a new heuristic conceptualization of entropy-based indices. Higher order association measures are often independent of lower order ones, hence an overall segregation or diversity index should be the arithmetic mean of the normalized association measures at all orders. These methods are applicable when individuals self-identify as multiple races or even multiple sexes and when individuals work part-time in multiple industries.The policy implications of this work are enormous, allowing people to rigorously test whether employment or biological diversity has changed."
https://openalex.org/W2057000043,"Background Plague is an ectoparasite-borne deadly infection caused by Yersinia pestis, a bacterium classified among the group A bioterrorism agents. Thousands of deaths are reported every year in some African countries. Tetracyclines and cotrimoxazole are used in the secondary prophylaxis of plague in the case of potential exposure to Y. pestis, but cotrimoxazole-resistant isolates have been reported. There is a need for additional prophylactic measures. We aimed to study the effectiveness of lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug known to alleviate the symptoms of sepsis, for plague prophylaxis in an experimental model. Methodology Lovastatin dissolved in Endolipide was intraperitoneally administered to mice (20 mg/kg) every day for 6 days prior to a Y. pestis Orientalis biotype challenge. Non-challenged, lovastatin-treated and challenged, untreated mice were also used as control groups in the study. Body weight, physical behavior and death were recorded both prior to infection and for 10 days post-infection. Samples of the blood, lungs and spleen were collected from dead mice for direct microbiological examination, histopathology and culture. The potential antibiotic effect of lovastatin was tested on blood agar plates. Conclusions/Significance Lovastatin had no in-vitro antibiotic effect against Y. pestis. The difference in the mortality between control mice (11/15; 73.5%) and lovastatin-treated mice (3/15; 20%) was significant (P<0.004; Mantel-Haenszel test). Dead mice exhibited Y. pestis septicemia and inflammatory destruction of lung and spleen tissues not seen in lovastatin-treated surviving mice. These data suggest that lovastatin may help prevent the deadly effects of plague. Field observations are warranted to assess the role of lovastatin in the prophylaxis of human plague."
https://openalex.org/W1989005754,"Background In order to understand how biological systems function it is necessary to determine the interactions and associations between proteins. Gene fusion prediction is one approach to detection of such functional relationships. Its use is however known to be problematic in higher eukaryotic genomes due to the presence of large homologous domain families. Here we introduce CODA (Co-Occurrence of Domains Analysis), a method to predict functional associations based on the gene fusion idiom. Methodology/Principal Findings We apply a novel scoring scheme which takes account of the genome-specific size of homologous domain families involved in fusion to improve accuracy in predicting functional associations. We show that CODA is able to accurately predict functional similarities in human with comparison to state-of-the-art methods and show that different methods can be complementary. CODA is used to produce evidence that a currently uncharacterised human protein may be involved in pathways related to depression and that another is involved in DNA replication. Conclusions/Significance The relative performance of different gene fusion methodologies has not previously been explored. We find that they are largely complementary, with different methods being more or less appropriate in different genomes. Our method is the only one currently available for download and can be run on an arbitrary dataset by the user. The CODA software and datasets are freely available from ftp://ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/pub/gene3d_data/v6.1.0/CODA/. Predictions are also available via web services from http://funcnet.eu/."
https://openalex.org/W2114846897,"Background The W-curve was originally developed as a graphical visualization technique for viewing DNA and RNA sequences. Its ability to render features of DNA also makes it suitable for computational studies. Its main advantage in this area is utilizing a single-pass algorithm for comparing the sequences. Avoiding recursion during sequence alignments offers advantages for speed and in-process resources. The graphical technique also allows for multiple models of comparison to be used depending on the nucleotide patterns embedded in similar whole genomic sequences. The W-curve approach allows us to compare large numbers of samples quickly. Method We are currently tuning the algorithm to accommodate quirks specific to HIV-1 genomic sequences so that it can be used to aid in diagnostic and vaccine efforts. Tracking the molecular evolution of the virus has been greatly hampered by gap associated problems predominantly embedded within the envelope gene of the virus. Gaps and hypermutation of the virus slow conventional string based alignments of the whole genome. This paper describes the W-curve algorithm itself, and how we have adapted it for comparison of similar HIV-1 genomes. A treebuilding method is developed with the W-curve that utilizes a novel Cylindrical Coordinate distance method and gap analysis method. HIV-1 C2-V5 env sequence regions from a Mother/Infant cohort study are used in the comparison. Findings The output distance matrix and neighbor results produced by the W-curve are functionally equivalent to those from Clustal for C2-V5 sequences in the mother/infant pairs infected with CRF01_AE. Conclusions Significant potential exists for utilizing this method in place of conventional string based alignment of HIV-1 genomes, such as Clustal X. With W-curve heuristic alignment, it may be possible to obtain clinically useful results in a short time—short enough to affect clinical choices for acute treatment. A description of the W-curve generation process, including a comparison technique of aligning extremes of the curves to effectively phase-shift them past the HIV-1 gap problem, is presented. Besides yielding similar neighbor-joining phenogram topologies, most Mother and Infant C2-V5 sequences in the cohort pairs geometrically map closest to each other, indicating that W-curve heuristics overcame any gap problem."
