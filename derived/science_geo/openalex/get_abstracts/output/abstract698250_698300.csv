https://openalex.org/W4289783427,"Recent advances in cancer characterization have consistently revealed marked heterogeneity, impeding the completion of integrated molecular and clinical maps for each malignancy. Here, we focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B cell neoplasm with variable natural history that is conventionally categorized into two subtypes distinguished by extent of somatic mutations in the heavy-chain variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IGHV). To build the 'CLL map,' we integrated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data from 1,148 patients. We identified 202 candidate genetic drivers of CLL (109 new) and refined the characterization of IGHV subtypes, which revealed distinct genomic landscapes and leukemogenic trajectories. Discovery of new gene expression subtypes further subcategorized this neoplasm and proved to be independent prognostic factors. Clinical outcomes were associated with a combination of genetic, epigenetic and gene expression features, further advancing our prognostic paradigm. Overall, this work reveals fresh insights into CLL oncogenesis and prognostication."

https://openalex.org/W4289968706,"Nucleotide metabolism supports RNA synthesis and DNA replication to enable cell growth and division. Nucleotide depletion can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, but how cells sense and respond to changes in the relative levels of individual nucleotides is unclear. Moreover, the nucleotide requirement for biomass production changes over the course of the cell cycle, and how cells coordinate differential nucleotide demands with cell cycle progression is not well understood. Here we find that excess levels of individual nucleotides can inhibit proliferation by disrupting the relative levels of nucleotide bases needed for DNA replication and impeding DNA replication. The resulting purine and pyrimidine imbalances are not sensed by canonical growth regulatory pathways like mTORC1, Akt and AMPK signalling cascades, causing excessive cell growth despite inhibited proliferation. Instead, cells rely on replication stress signalling to survive during, and recover from, nucleotide imbalance during S phase. We find that ATR-dependent replication stress signalling is activated during unperturbed S phases and promotes nucleotide availability to support DNA replication. Together, these data reveal that imbalanced nucleotide levels are not detected until S phase, rendering cells reliant on replication stress signalling to cope with this metabolic problem and disrupting the coordination of cell growth and division."

https://openalex.org/W4289783361,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in childhood (childhood ADHD); two-thirds of affected individuals continue to have ADHD in adulthood (persistent ADHD), and sometimes ADHD is diagnosed in adulthood (late-diagnosed ADHD). We evaluated genetic differences among childhood (n = 14,878), persistent (n = 1,473) and late-diagnosed (n = 6,961) ADHD cases alongside 38,303 controls, and rare variant differences in 7,650 ADHD cases and 8,649 controls. We identified four genome-wide significant loci for childhood ADHD and one for late-diagnosed ADHD. We found increased polygenic scores for ADHD in persistent ADHD compared with the other two groups. Childhood ADHD had higher genetic overlap with hyperactivity and autism compared with late-diagnosed ADHD and the highest burden of rare protein-truncating variants in evolutionarily constrained genes. Late-diagnosed ADHD had a larger genetic overlap with depression than childhood ADHD and no increased burden in rare protein-truncating variants. Overall, these results suggest a genetic influence on age at first ADHD diagnosis, persistence of ADHD and the different comorbidity patterns among the groups. Analyses of the polygenic architecture of childhood, persistent and late-diagnosed attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a Danish population-based case–cohort sample identify differences among ADHD subgroups with respect to common and rare variants."

We tested whether messages designed to address these beliefs and concerns might promote intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Method We conducted an online survey fielded between March 8–23, 2021 with US Veteran ( n = 688) and non-Veteran ( n = 387) respondents. In a between-subjects experiment, respondents were randomly assigned to a control group (with no message) or to read one of two intervention messages: 1. a fact-box styled message comparing the risks of getting COVID-19 compared to the vaccine, and 2. a timeline styled message describing the development process of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Results Most respondents (60%) wanted a COVID-19 vaccine. However, 17% expressed hesitancy and 23% did not want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The fact-box styled message and the timeline message did not significantly improve vaccination intentions, F (2,358) = 0.86, p = .425, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = .005, or reduce the time respondents wanted to wait before getting vaccinated, F (2,306) = 0.79, p = .453, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = .005, compared to no messages. Discussion In this experimental study, we did not find that providing messages about vaccine risks and the development process had an impact on respondents’ vaccine intentions. Further research is needed to identify how to effectively address concerns about the risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines and the development process and to understand additional factors that influence vaccine intentions."

Two core subunits, Rictor and mSin1, distinguish it from the related mTORC1 and support context-dependent phosphorylation of its substrates. mTORC2 structures have been determined previously; however, important questions remain, particularly regarding the structural determinants mediating substrate specificity and context-dependent activity. Here, we used cryo-EM to obtain high-resolution structures of the human mTORC2 apo-complex in the presence of substrates Akt and SGK1. Using functional assays, we then tested predictions suggested by substrate-induced structural changes in mTORC2. For the first time, we visualized in the apo-state the side chain interactions between Rictor and mTOR that sterically occlude recruitment of mTORC1 substrates and confer resistance to the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Also in the apo-state, we observed that mSin1 formed extensive contacts with Rictor via a pair of short α-helices nestled between two Rictor helical repeat clusters, as well as by an extended strand that makes multiple weak contacts with Rictor helical cluster 1. In co-complex structures, we found that SGK1, but not Akt, markedly altered the conformation of the mSin1 N-terminal extended strand, disrupting multiple weak interactions while inducing a large rotation of mSin1 residue Arg-83, which then interacts with a patch of negatively charged residues within Rictor. Finally, we demonstrate mutation of Arg-83 to Ala selectively disrupts mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of SGK1, but not of Akt, supporting context-dependent substrate selection. These findings provide new structural and functional insights into mTORC2 specificity and context-dependent activity.

The function of mTORC2 has received increasing attention during recent years. The representative downstream effectors of mTORC2 are mainly members of the AGC kinase family, including Akt (also known as protein kinase B), PKC, and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinases (SGK1 and SGK3) (13Wu Y.T.

Rep. 2015; 515193Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In part, because it was discovered first and in part due to its inhibition by rapamycin, functional and structural research on mTORC1 has outpaced mTORC2. Cryo-EM and X-ray crystallographic structural studies of mTORC1 have substantially elucidated its structural features, in most domains at the atomic level. Important structural determinants of substrate specificity and rapamycin sensitivity have been elucidated. Notably, a domain within mTOR close to the catalytic cleft, termed the FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain, binds both rapamycin (in complex with the endogenous FK-506 binding protein, FKBP12) and key mTORC1 substrates, 4EBP1 and S6-kinase (29Yang H. Rudge D.G. Koos J.D. Vaidialingam B. Yang H.J. Pavletich N.P. mTOR kinase structure, mechanism and regulation.Nature. 2013; 497: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). mTORC2 structures have been determined by cryo-EM as well, but multiple key structural features, most notably those that confer context-dependent substrate phosphorylation, remain to be elucidated. Comparison of published structures indicates that the common subunits, mTOR and mLST8, assume very similar conformations in both mTORC1 and mTORC2, suggesting that specificity determinants lie elsewhere. Chen et al. used cross-linking mass spectrometry coupled with a 4.9 Å cryo-EM structure to identify interactions between the mTOR FRB domain and mTORC2 components, mSin1 and Rictor (30Chen X. Liu M. Tian Y. Li J. Qi Y. Zhao D. et al.Cryo-EM structure of human mTOR complex 2.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Their data suggested that both of these mTORC2-specific subunits closely interacted with the FRB domain in a manner that could block binding of FKBP12-rapamycin, as well as that of the substrates, 4EBP1 and S6-kinase. However, structural detail was lacking. Scaiola et al. (31Scaiola A. Mangia F. Imseng S. Boehringer D. Berneiser K. Shimobayashi M. et al.The 3.2-A resolution structure of human mTORC2.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eabc1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published a higher resolution structure, which provided greater insight into the FRB domain, as well as clarifying the position and interactions of mSin1 with Rictor and mLST8. Furthermore, they showed that mSin1 did not interact directly with mTOR but rather provided an important link between Rictor and mLST8. However, significant detail of the structure of the mSin1 N-terminal region was not visualized. This is particularly important in the context of recruitment of specific substrates. Prior functional and biochemical studies had identified two distinct substrate interaction domains in mSin1: one in the N-terminal region of mSin1 was found to be specific for SGK1 and did not interact with Akt or PKC (32Lu M. Wang J. Ives H.E. Pearce D. mSIN1 protein mediates SGK1 protein interaction with mTORC2 protein complex and is required for selective activation of the epithelial sodium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30647-30654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues within the core of this domain disrupted mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of SGK1 but not Akt or PKC. A second domain, the CRIM (conserved region in the middle) domain, was found to be required for binding and activation of all three of these substrates (14Cameron A.J. Linch M.D. Saurin A.T. Escribano C. Parker P.J. mTORC2 targets AGC kinases through Sin1-dependent recruitment.Biochem. J. 2011; 439: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The role of the CRIM domain was further elucidated in an NMR-based study (33Tatebe H. Murayama S. Yonekura T. Hatano T. Richter D. Furuya T. et al.Substrate specificity of TOR complex 2 is determined by a ubiquitin-fold domain of the Sin1 subunit.Elife. 2017; 6e19594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal region has not been further characterized. Structural insights into the N-terminal region and CRIM domain have been elusive. In this study, we present a representative cryo-EM structure of human mTORC2 apo-complex at overall resolution of 3.2 Å together with structures in the presence of Akt and SGK1. We describe the characteristic assembly that provides a basis for modeling local structural information including recognition of side chains in multiple regions. The structure reveals the basis for mTORC2 insensitivity to rapamycin, demonstrating specific side chain interactions through which Rictor occludes the mTOR FRB domain. Structural determinants of substrate preferences of mTORC1 and mTORC2 are also revealed. Of particular note, new insight into the structural basis for mTORC2 context-dependent regulation of SGK1 and Akt is revealed: in the presence of SGK1, but not Akt, the conformation of the mSin1 N-terminal region is altered, resulting in a large rotation of mSin1/Arg-83 to form a salt bridge with Rictor Asp-1679. The functional importance of this newly recognized structural feature is demonstrated in cell-based phosphorylation experiments. In order to obtain purified mTORC2 core complex for cryo-EM, Spycatcher003-mTOR, Flag-Rictor, HA-mLST8, and mSin1-HA (all of human origin) were coexpressed in Expi293F cells. The complex was purified using one-step flag pull-down, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. S1, A–C), and finally subjected to on-grid affinity binding using a new adaptation of the Spycatcher-Spytag system (34Wang F. Liu Y. Yu Z. Li S. Feng S. Cheng Y. et al.General and robust covalently linked graphene oxide affinity grids for high-resolution cryo-EM.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2020; 117: 24269-24273Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), before cryo-EM analysis. This combined approach allowed high quality cryo-EM samples to be obtained without needing large-scale expression and purification approaches. Our principal sample was prepared in the apo-state without small molecule additives or peptide substrates. The biochemical activities of purified mTORC2 were tested and verified (Fig. S1D). After 2D and 3D data analysis, approximately 200,000 particles were selected and used for the final refinement and reconstruction (Fig. S2). Based on the density map data, a model was built for the mTORC2 apo-state (Fig. S1E). Similar structures were solved for co-complexes of mTORC2 with two of its principal substrates, Akt and SGK1. We focused on these two substrates in light of their interconnected importance in regulating ion and solute transport, electrolyte and energy metabolism, and impact on renal disease and diabetes (3Fu W.

Physiol. 2021; 11: 2017-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The mTORC2 structure comprises eight subunits consisting of two heterotetramers showing a 2-fold symmetry, similar to a prior report (30Chen X. Liu M. Tian Y. Li J. Qi Y. Zhao D. et al.Cryo-EM structure of human mTOR complex 2.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The overall shape of the apo-complex is that of a rhomboid with a hollow center and a dimension of 220 × 160 × 140 (Å3) (Fig. 1, A and B). Each of the heterotetramers consists of mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, and mSin1 with a stoichiometry of 1:1:1:1. The two mTOR subunits form a dimer that serves as the foundation of the complex. mLST8 and Rictor sit in close proximity on its two distal ends. The structures of mLST8 and mTOR as well as their mutual interaction pattern are quite similar to that in mTORC1 (29Yang H. Rudge D.G. Koos J.D. Vaidialingam B. Yang H.J. Pavletich N.P. mTOR kinase structure, mechanism and regulation.Nature. 2013; 497: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 36Aylett C.H. Sauer E. Imseng S. Boehringer D. Hall M.N. Ban N. et al.Architecture of human mTOR complex 1.Science. 2016; 351: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The kinase loop of mTOR is located in the cleft between mLST8 and Rictor. Interestingly, as further addressed below, mSin1 forms a long bridge-like structure connecting mLST8 and Rictor, which has an extended α-helix that crosses over the deep cleft harboring the mTOR active site. 3D variability analysis showed that mTORC2 is not a rigid complex, and the two halves were found to “breathe” in two modes, mainly twisting or squeezing toward the geometric core of the complex (Fig. 1B). Both movements result in the altering of the interaction between the two symmetric mTOR subunits, as shown dynamically in supplemental movies (Movie S1 and S2). In the apo-complex, the two mTOR subunits are anchored to each other, forming the core of the complex and having a conformation quite similar to that in mTORC1 (Fig. 1A). The structure of Rictor includes three HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, and the yeast kinase TOR) helical repeat (HR) clusters termed HR1, HR2, and HR3 (Fig. 2A), all of which make direct contacts with mTOR. HR1 and HR2 also interact with mSin1. Consistent with previous biochemical and lower resolution cryo-EM results, Rictor and mLST8 do not directly interact, but rather are held together by mSin1. In Figure 2B, the FRB domain of mTOR is highlighted in red to call attention to its interaction with Rictor. In mTORC1, this domain is adjacent to both the kinase active site and to the Raptor N-terminal conserved) domain, which plays a central role in substrate recruitment (S6-Kinase and 4EBP (29Yang H. Rudge D.G. Koos J.D. Vaidialingam B. Yang H.J. Pavletich N.P. mTOR kinase structure, mechanism and regulation.Nature. 2013; 497: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar)), and is involved in binding the FKBP12-rapamycin inhibitory complex (36Aylett C.H. Sauer E. Imseng S. Boehringer D. Hall M.N. Ban N. et al.Architecture of human mTOR complex 1.Science. 2016; 351: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In mTORC2, the FRB domain is similarly located adjacent to the mTOR kinase active site, but also interacts with both HR1 and HR2 of Rictor. Importantly, HR1 of Rictor sterically prevents the FRB domain from interacting with the FKBP12-rapamycin complex (Fig. 2C), while in mTORC1, the FRB domain remains accessible (Fig. S6). This steric occlusion also prevents mTORC2 interaction with mTORC1-specific substrates and shielding a key interaction residue, Thr-2098 (37Yang H. Jiang X. Li B. Yang H.J. Miller M. Yang A. et al.Mechanisms of mTORC1 activation by RHEB and inhibition by PRAS40.Nature. 2017; 552: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Rictor/Ser-1624 and Ser-1625 were observed in close proximity to mTOR/Thr-2098, likely contributing to the interaction of Rictor HR1 and the FRB domain through hydrogen bond formation, and hence to the differential specificities of mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, mTOR/Ser-2035, which was previously shown to play an important functional role in substrate recognition by mTORC1 (29Yang H. Rudge D.G. Koos J.D. Vaidialingam B. Yang H.J. Pavletich N.P. mTOR kinase structure, mechanism and regulation.Nature. 2013; 497: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 38McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Lin T.A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr., J.C. The rapamycin-binding domain governs substrate selectivity by the mammalian target of rapamycin.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 7428-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), is spatially shielded by Rictor, although there is no direct interaction between them (Fig. 2D). Finally, neither SGK1 nor Akt had any observable effect on the relationship of Rictor and mTOR. Based on functional and biochemical data, mSin1 contains four principal domains: an N-terminal domain, CRIM domain, Ras-binding domain, and PH (pleckstrin homology) domain (39Frias M.A. Thoreen C.C. Jaffe J.D. Schroder W. Sculley T. Carr S.A. et al.mSin1 is necessary for Akt/PKB phosphorylation, and its isoforms define three distinct mTORC2s.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1865-1870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). For the present apo-complex, we solved the major structure of the N-terminal domain, while the other three domains are invisible in the current density map likely due to their flexibility, as has been noted in prior publications (30Chen X. Liu M. Tian Y. Li J. Qi Y. Zhao D. et al.Cryo-EM structure of human mTOR complex 2.Cell Res. 2018; 28: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Scaiola A. Mangia F. Imseng S. Boehringer D. Berneiser K. Shimobayashi M. et al.The 3.2-A resolution structure of human mTORC2.Sci. Adv. 2020; 6eabc1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the nonvisualized domains, the CRIM domain, has been implicated in binding of all three major mTORC2 substrates, Akt, SGK, and PKC. The N-terminal domain (aa 1–137) contains three distinct sections: a Rictor-interacting section, a bridge section connecting Rictor and mLST8, and an elongated section wrapping around mLST8 (Fig. 3A). The Rictor-interacting section includes a pair of short α-helices nestled between HR1 and HR2 of Rictor, followed by an extended strand, which runs along the periphery of HR1, making multiple weak contacts (Fig. 3, A and B). This region, which we have termed the string (SGK-Targeting, Rictor-InteractING) domain has not been visualized in prior density maps, which is notable in light of the role it plays in substrate binding. Gln-68, in particular, was previously shown to be necessary for SGK1—but not Akt or PKC—interaction with and phosphorylation by mTORC2 (32Lu M. Wang J. Ives H.E. Pearce D. mSIN1 protein mediates SGK1 protein interaction with mTORC2 protein complex and is required for selective activation of the epithelial sodium channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30647-30654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the apo-complex, the Gln-68 side chain is well resolved and seen to reach toward Rictor/Arg-105, consistent with a stabilizing interaction (Fig. 3C). At the C-terminal end of the string domain, we see Thr-86 embedded in a negatively charged pocket of the Rictor C-terminal region and specifically interacting with Rictor/Glu-1675. Interestingly, Thr-86 lies within the sequence RRRSNT, which conforms to the consensus substrate peptide for AGC kinase (sequence: RXRXXS/T), and has been shown previously to be phosphorylated by Akt and S6-kinase (40Liu P. Gan W. Inuzuka H. Lazorchak A.S. Gao D. Arojo O. et al.Sin1 phosphorylation impairs mTORC2 complex integrity and inhibits downstream Akt signalling to suppress tumorigenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1340-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); however, in the present structures (including co-complexes), it is unphosphorylated. Downstream of the string domain, an α-helical “bridge” begins immediately C-terminal to Thr-86 and crosses the deep cleft harboring the mTOR catalytic site. After this traverse, mSin1 engages in extensive interactions with mLST8, beginning with a short complementary β-strand, followed by an extended section, which wraps approximately ¾ of the way around the peripheral surface of mLST8, and finally the whole visible part of mSin1 ends in a short α-helix before merging into the nonvisualized CRIM domain (Fig. 3A). In the co-complexes with Akt and SGK1, the substrates themselves were not clearly resolved, likely due to movement and flexibility of the substrate-binding domains themselves or as a consequence of freezing. Although extra densities consistent with substrates were seen in the co-complexes after low pass filter at 8 Å in order to remove the noise from high frequency, these densities could not be clearly distinguished from densities seen in the apo-complex under similar conditions (not shown). Hence, it is also possible that the extra densities are part of downstream domains of mSin1, such as the CRIM or PH domains (which were not resolved in the high resolution structures). In contrast, biochemical data demonstrated the physical interaction of the substrates with mTORC2 (Fig. S3) and, although the overall volume and shape of the co-complexes were similar to the apo-complex (Figs. S4 and S5), the detailed relationship of the mSin1 N-terminal domain with Rictor was markedly altered in the SGK1 co-complex. First, the string domain upstream of Arg-83 including Gln-68 becomes unobservable, likely due to increased flexibility. Akt, in contrast, had no such effects: the string domain in its presence looks very similar to the apo-complex (Fig. 3E, second panel). Second, the Arg-83 side chain shows a large rotation toward a negatively charged patch of Rictor HR3, coming into close proximity to Asp-1679, with which it appears to form a salt bridge (Fig. 3D, middle and lower panel). In order to explore the functional role of Arg-83 in differential regulation of SGK1 and Akt, we tested the ability of mSin1/Arg-83-Ala to support mTORC2 kinase activity by using mSin1-deficient HEK-293T cells (41Gleason C.E.

https://openalex.org/W4289869237,"There is solid evidence of the beneficial effect of photobiomodulation (PBM) with low-power near-infrared (NIR) light in the NIR-I window in increasing bioavailable nitric oxide (NO). However, it is not established whether this effect can be extended to NIR-II light, limiting broader applications of this therapeutic modality. Since we have demonstrated PBM with NIR laser in the NIR-II window, we determined the causal relationship between NIR-II irradiation and its specific biological effects on NO bioavailability. We analyzed the impact of NIR-II irradiation on NO release in cultured human endothelial cells using a NO-sensitive fluorescence probe and single-cell live imaging. Two distinct wavelengths of NIR-II laser (1064 and 1270 nm) and NIR-I (808 nm) at an irradiance of 10 mW/cm2 induced NO release from endothelial cells. These lasers also enhanced Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at Ser 1177, and endothelial cell migration. Moreover, the NO release and phosphorylation of eNOS were abolished by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that Akt activation caused by NIR-II laser exposure involves mitochondrial retrograde signaling. Other inhibitors that inhibit known Akt activation pathways, including a specific inhibitor of PI3K, Src family PKC, did not affect this response. These two wavelengths of NIR-II laser induced no appreciable NO generation in cultured neuronal cells expressing neuronal NOS (nNOS). In short, NIR-II laser enhances bioavailable NO in endothelial cells. Since a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction is suppressed eNOS with concomitant NO deficiency, NIR-II laser technology could be broadly used to restore endothelial NO and treat or prevent cardiovascular diseases."

In SARS-CoV-2 infections, hydroxychloroquine sulphate (HCQ) administered as dry powder via inhalation could be safer than oral HCQ allowing higher and therefore more effective pulmonary concentrations without dose limiting toxic effects.To assess the local tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters of HCQ inhalations in single ascending doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg using the Cyclops dry powder inhaler.Twelve healthy volunteers were included in the study. Local tolerability and safety were assessed by pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram and recording adverse events. To estimate systemic exposure, serum samples were collected before and 0.5, 2 and 3.5 h after inhalation.Dry powder HCQ inhalations were well tolerated by the participants, except for transient bitter taste in all participants and minor coughing irritation. There was no significant change in QTc-interval or drop in FEV1 post inhalation. The serum HCQ concentration remained below 10 μg/L in all samples.Single doses of inhaled dry powder HCQ up to 20 mg are safe and well tolerated. Our data support that further studies with inhaled HCQ dry powder to evaluate pulmonary pharmacokinetics and efficacy are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4289967252,"Background Pneumothorax has been increasingly observed among patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, specifically in those patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this study, we sought to determine the incidence and potential risk factors of pneumothorax in critically ill adults with COVID-19. Method This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to one of the adult intensive care units of a tertiary, academic teaching hospital from May 2020 through May 2021. Results Among 334 COVID-19 cases requiring ICU admission, the incidence of pneumothorax was 10% (33 patients). Patients who experienced pneumothorax more frequently required vasopressor support (28/33 [84%] vs. 191/301 [63%] P = 0.04), were more likely to be proned (25/33 [75%] vs. 111/301 [36%], P&lt;0.001), and the presence of pneumothorax was associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation; 21 (1–97) versus 7 (1–79) days, p&lt;0.001 as well as prolonged hospital length of stay (29 [9–133] vs. 15 [1–90] days, P&lt;0.001), but mortality was not significantly different between groups. Importantly, when we performed a Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model of multivariate parameters, we found that administration of tocilizumab significantly increased the risk of developing pneumothorax (HR = 10.7; CI [3.6–32], P&lt;0.001). Conclusion Among 334 critically ill patients with COVID-19, the incidence of pneumothorax was 10%. Presence of pneumothorax was associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay. Strikingly, receipt of tocilizumab was associated with an increased risk of developing pneumothorax."

We assessed whether usage of telehealth was associated with differential primary care utilization at a large, urban public healthcare system. Using electronic health record data from 23 primary care clinics, we categorized patients as telehealth users and non-users. Then, we compared the number of visits per patient between groups using Welch’s t-tests while stratifying by comorbidity count. We used multivariable Poisson regression to test for associations between telehealth usage and visit count while controlling for other demographic factors. Compared with telehealth non-users, telehealth users had approximately 1 more primary care visit per patient over the year regardless of comorbidity count or other patient characteristics. Availability of telehealth services may be associated with increased primary care utilization in a safety-net setting, though further research on outcomes, costs of care, and patient and clinician experiences is needed to better inform decisions regarding provision and reimbursement of telehealth services."

Using an online survey, we collected both qualitative and quantitative data relating to individuals’ experiences. While the majority of participants perceived workplace adjustments to be important, many were not receiving them. Analysis of open-ended text responses highlighted specific challenges that autistic people face in requesting and receiving adjustments. Specifically, participants felt the onus fell on them to ( 1 ) identify their need for adjustments; ( 2 ) establish the specific adjustments that would be beneficial and ( 3 ) request adjustments from their employer. Yet, they reported struggling with this process. Participants also highlighted a range of social and organisational barriers to the successful implementation of workplace adjustments. Unsurprisingly, the lack of successfully implemented adjustments had far-reaching impacts on participants’ wellbeing as well as the choices they made about their future employment. These findings highlight the need for employers to take a more active role in the identification and implementation of workplace adjustments, as well as a need for more understanding and inclusive working environments that truly allow autistic employees to thrive in the workplace."
https://openalex.org/W4289869186,"DCBLD2 is a neuropilin-like transmembrane protein that is up-regulated during arterial remodeling in humans, rats, and mice. Activation of PDGFR-β via PDGF triggers receptor phosphorylation and endocytosis. Subsequent activation of downstream signals leads to the stimulation of phenotypic conversion of VSMCs and arterial wall proliferation, which are common pathological changes in vascular remodeling diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and restenosis after angioplasty. In this study, we hypothesized that DCBLD2 regulates neointimal hyperplasia through the regulation of PDGFR-β endocytosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through Caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Compared with wild-type (WT) mice or control littermate mice, the germline or VSMC conditional deletion of the Dcbld2 gene resulted in a significant increase in the thickness of the tunica media in the carotid artery ligation. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, VSMCs were isolated from the aorta of WT or Dcbld2-/- mice and were stimulated with PDGF. Western blotting assays demonstrated that Dcbld2 deletion increased the PDGF signaling pathway. Biotin labeling test and membrane-cytosol separation test showed that after DCBLD2 was knocked down or knocked out, the level of PDGFR-β on the cell membrane was significantly reduced, while the amount of PDGFR-β in the cytoplasm increased. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that after DCBLD2 gene knock-out, the binding of PDGFR-β and Cav-1 in the cytoplasm significantly increased. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that PDGFR-β accumulated Cav-1/lysosomes earlier than for control cells, which indicated that DCBLD2 gene knock-down or deletion accelerated the endocytosis of PDGF-induced PDGFR-β in VSMCs. In order to confirm that DCBLD2 affects the relationship between Cav-1 and PDGFR-β, proteins extracted from VSMCs cultured in vitro were derived from WT and Dcbld2-/- mice, whereas co-immunoprecipitation suggested that the combination of DCBLD2 and Cav-1 reduced the bond between Cav-1 and PDGFR-β, and DCBLD2 knock-out was able to enhance the interaction between Cav-1 and PDGFR-β. Therefore, the current results suggest that DCBLD2 may inhibit the caveolae-dependent endocytosis of PDGFR-β by anchoring the receptor on the cell membrane. Based on its ability to regulate the activity of PDGFR-β, DCBLD2 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."

Statistically significant factors associated with moderate-to-extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress included being female, chronic illness, and experiencing financial stress. Employment during COVID-19 –specifically essential services workers or unemployed—was associated with higher levels of anxiety and stress, with only essential workers being a predictor of higher stress severity. Factors that provided psychological protection included being older and having children. Conclusion This study is one of the first to explore the impact COVID-19-related international travel restrictions have had on the financial status and psychological health of affected individuals. It highlights the significant human cost associated with the restrictions and identifies psychologically vulnerable populations. These results will help the design of targeted health and social policy responses."

In this first German nationwide expert survey, we addressed the responsible university teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology departments and investigated their experiences during the pandemic as well as their opinions on future developments, especially with regard to the broader implementation of e-learning in the standard curriculum.The questionnaire included 42 items and was disseminated among teaching coordinators at all 41 departments of obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitals via an email that included a weblink to the online survey provider. Responses were collected between 19 April and 7 June 2021.In total, 30 responses were collected from 41 departments across Germany and their respective teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology. The general opinion of the medical teaching provided during the pandemic was positive, whereas the teaching quality in practical skills was considered inferior and not equivalent to the standard face-to-face curriculum. Lectures and seminars had to be substituted by remote-learning alternatives, while clinical clerkships were reduced in length and provided less patient contact. Students in their final year experienced only a few differences in the clinical and teaching routine. Teaching coordinators in obstetrics and gynecology stated that they intend to incorporate more e-learning into the curriculum in the future.The medical educators' views presented here may help to complement the already-thoroughly investigated experiences of students under the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical educators in obstetrics and gynecology at German university hospitals have successfully established online and hybrid teaching alternatives to their standard face-to-face courses. Building on recent experiences, digitalization could help to improve future medical education."
https://openalex.org/W4289335873,"During reverse cholesterol transport, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries excess cholesterol from peripheral cells to the liver for excretion in bile. The first and last steps of this pathway involve the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI). While the mechanism of SR-BI-mediated cholesterol transport has not yet been established, it has long been suspected that cholesterol traverses through a hydrophobic tunnel in SR-BI's extracellular domain. Confirmation of a hydrophobic tunnel is hindered by the lack of a full-length SR-BI structure. Part of SR-BI's structure has been resolved, encompassing residues 405 to 475, which includes the C-terminal transmembrane domain and its adjacent extracellular region. Within the extracellular segment is an amphipathic helix (residues 427-436, referred to as AH(427-436)) that showed increased protection from solvent in NMR-based studies. Homology models predict that hydrophobic residues in AH(427-436) line a core cavity in SR-BI's extracellular region that may facilitate cholesterol transport. Therefore, we hypothesized that hydrophobic residues in AH(427-436) are required for HDL cholesterol transport. Here, we tested this hypothesis by mutating individual residues along AH(427-436) to a charged residue (aspartic acid), transiently transfecting COS-7 cells with plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant SR-BI, and performing functional analyses. We found that mutating hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, residues in AH(427-436) impaired SR-BI bidirectional cholesterol transport. Mutating phenylalanine-430 was particularly detrimental to SR-BI's functions, suggesting that this residue may facilitate important interactions for cholesterol delivery within the hydrophobic tunnel. Our results support the hypothesis that a hydrophobic tunnel within SR-BI mediates cholesterol transport."

These conditions have been associated with a wide range of chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. In Ethiopia, the literature regarding the burden of central (abdominal) obesity is scarce. This study aimed to fill this gap by assessing the prevalence and risk factors associated with central obesity among adults in Ethiopia.From May to July 2021, a community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 694 adults aged ≥18 years in administrative towns of Bale zone, Southeast Ethiopia. Multi-stage sampling followed by systematic random sampling was employed to identify study participants. Waist and hip circumferences were measured using standard protocols. The World Health Organization STEPS wise tool was used to assess risk factors associated with central obesity. Bi-variable and multi-variable binary logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with central obesity. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) have been reported to estimate the strength of associations.The overall prevalence of central obesity using waist circumference was 39.01% [(95% CI: 35.36-42.76; 15.44% for men and 53.12% for women)]. Multi-variable binary logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex (AOR = 12.93, 95% CI: 6.74-24.79), Age groups: 30-39 years old (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.59-4.94), 40-49 years (AOR = 7.66, 95% CI: 3.87-15.15), 50-59 years (AOR = 4.65, 95% CI: 2.19-9.89), ≥60 years (AOR = 12.67, 95% CI: 5.46-29.39), occupational status like: housewives (AOR = 5.21, 95% CI: 1.85-14.62), self-employed workers (AOR = 4.63, 95% CI: 1.62-13.24), government/private/non-government employees (AOR = 4.68, 95% CI: 1.47-14.88), and skipping breakfast (AOR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23-0.9) were significantly associated with central obesity.Abdominal obesity has become an epidemic in Bale Zone's towns in Southeastern Ethiopia.

Currently, there are no effective regenerative therapies that can fully reverse such gland hypofunction due to the lack of reproducible in vitro aging models or organoids required to develop novel treatments for multi-omic profiling. Previously, our research group successful developed three-dimensional (3D) bioassembly nanotechnologies towards the generation of functional exocrine gland organoids via magnetic 3D bioprinting platforms (M3DB). To meet the needs of our aging Asian societies, a next step was taken to design consistent M3DB protocols to engineer LG and SG organoid models with aging molecular and pathological features. Herein, a feasible step-by-step protocol was provided for producing both LG and SG organoids using M3DB platforms. Such protocol provided reproducible outcomes with final organoid products resembling LG or SG native parenchymal epithelial tissues. Both acinar and ductal epithelial compartments were prominent (21 ± 4.32% versus 42 ± 6.72%, respectively), and could be clearly identified in these organoids. Meanwhile, these can be further developed into aging signature models by inducing cellular senescence via chemical mutagenesis.

https://openalex.org/W4289975195,"Aquatic insects in the order Trichoptera are extremely diverse in number of species and their trophic roles. However, their distribution and diversity patterns are poorly known in the Neotropics, including the species restricted to tropical mountain ecosystems. Recent studies in tropical mountains have shown high levels of endemism of aquatic insects and changes in the composition of communities over short distances. Still, the incidence of environmental filters that explain such patterns has not been addressed quantitatively. Given the relevance of understanding Trichoptera spatial diversity patterns to prioritize conservation areas for freshwaters, as well as to obtain baseline information to predict changes in aquatic communities facing global environmental changes, we assessed the species distribution and assemblages of caddisflies along an elevational gradient from 600 to 3,600 m a.s.l. on the equatorial Andes. In this area, we had long-term continuous climate data with hourly resolution. We collected adult caddisflies in seven localities along this gradient using light traps. We sampled each locality for two hours after sunset for three consecutive days. All specimens collected were identified to species or morphospecies. Our results showed an increase in species and genera numbers with decreasing altitude, albeit no significant. Minimum air temperature is the main environmental variable explaining Trichoptera community assemblages. β-diversity (taxon turnover among sites), as opposed to species richness, increased with altitude and showed a bimodal distribution along the elevation gradient for both genera and species assemblages, which resulted in a significant shift in community composition of species and genera at 2,000 m a.s.l. Our null-models confirm the observed patterns of B-diversity are non-random and suggest a strong environmental filtering of tropical caddisflies community assemblies and turnover. Geographic distance coupled with changes in environmental conditions along the elevation gradient explained a high percentage of community variance, as documented for other taxa (e.g., vascular plants), suggesting the importance of securing habitat connectivity along the altitudinal gradient to protect aquatic insect diversity effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4289987104,"Background In the wake of the severe impact of COVID-19 on the food security of the vulnerable groups in rural areas, the issue of how to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 2 aims to “Zero Hunger” (SDG 2) and ensure the food safety of farmers has drawn unprecedented attention. Nutritional intake is generally used as an important indicator to reflect family food security. Under the background that Chinese farmers have gradually changed from the traditional diversified production mode to the specialized production of crops, the main purpose of this article is to explore what are the impact of crop specialization on farmers’ nutritional intake? Could the specialization of crop production be taken as an important measure to ensure the food safety of farmers and achieve the SDG 2? Methods Based on the micro-survey data from 866 farmer households in China, this paper using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions model, Group Regression model and Mediating Effect model to analyze the average and heterogeneous effects of crop specialization on the nutritional intake of farmers, as well as the mediating effect of income. In addition, robustness test and endogenous treatment were performed by using alternative explanatory variables and IV-2SLS method was used to estimate the results. Results After correcting for endogenous bias, crop specialization had a significant negative impact on energy intake and fat intake of farmers at the statistical level of 5% and 1% respectively, especially for farmers in mountainous areas. Household income played a mediating effect on the effect of crop specialization on farmers’ energy and fat intake, and the proportion of the masking effect was 8.43% and 8.96% respectively. In addition, household financial capital and social capital have a significant positive impact on farmers’ nutritional intake. Conclusions Crop specialization cannot guarantee the food safety of farmers in terms of nutritional intake. However, when the development trend of crop specialization is irreversible, more attention should be paid to improving the level of various livelihood capital of farmers, especially those in mountainous areas, and to continuously increasing their income to ease and ultimately eliminate the negative impact of crop specialization on farmers’ nutritional intake, which finally make everyone realize the SDG 2."

Here, a nanomedicine, which can reach the vascular injury site, based on polymeric micelles was applied to deliver miR146a-5p in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model. In vitro studies using inflammation-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) was performed. Results showed anti-inflammatory response as an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway and VSMC migration, suppression of reactive oxygen species production, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in VSMCs. A single systemic administration of miR146a-5p attenuated NIH and vessel remodeling in a carotid artery balloon injury model in both male and female rats in vivo. MiR146a-5p reduced proinflammatory cytokine gene expression in injured arteries and monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the vascular wall. Therefore, miR146a-5p delivery to the injury site demonstrated therapeutic potential against NIH after revascularization."
https://openalex.org/W4289950948,"Extracting water bodies from remote sensing images is important in many fields, such as in water resources information acquisition and analysis. Conventional methods of water body extraction enhance the differences between water bodies and other interfering water bodies to improve the accuracy of water body boundary extraction. Multiple methods must be used alternately to extract water body boundaries more accurately. Water body extraction methods combined with neural networks struggle to improve the extraction accuracy of fine water bodies while ensuring an overall extraction effect. In this study, false color processing and a generative adversarial network (GAN) were added to reconstruct remote sensing images and enhance the features of tiny water bodies. In addition, a multi-scale input strategy was designed to reduce the training cost. We input the processed data into a new water body extraction method based on strip pooling for remote sensing images, which is an improvement of DeepLabv3+. Strip pooling was introduced in the DeepLabv3+ network to better extract water bodies with a discrete distribution at long distances using different strip kernels. The experiments and tests show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of water body extraction and is effective in fine water body extraction. Compared with seven other traditional remote sensing water body extraction methods and deep learning semantic segmentation methods, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method reaches 94.72%. In summary, the proposed method performs water body extraction better than existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W4289970253,"It is an increasingly accepted idea that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society. By reducing biomass fluctuation, biodiversity could mitigate the impact of changing environmental conditions on rural incomes as long as people exploits a diverse set of natural assets. This effect is analogous to the risk-spreading function of financial portfolios. This paper presents evidence of the portfolio effect for an open-access artisanal fishery in an estuarine ecosystem, located in a Colombian Biosphere Reserve. Using catch statistics from 2002 to 2018, we evaluate the contribution of catch diversity to the stabilization of fishing income. We find that changes in catch composition are related to seasonal and interannual variations in salinity conditions. The portfolio effect arises from asynchronous fluctuations of fish species due to fluctuating environmental conditions. Catch diversification, instead of specialization, help achieve resilient fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W4289314228,"B-Myb is a highly conserved member of the vertebrate Myb family of transcription factors that plays a critical role in cell-cycle progression and proliferation. Myb proteins activate Myb-dependent promoters by interacting specifically with Myb-binding site (MBS) sequences using their DNA-binding domain (DBD). Transactivation of MBS promoters by B-Myb is repressed by its negative regulatory domain (NRD), and phosphorylation of the NRD by Cdk2-CyclinA relieves the repression to activate B-Myb-dependent promoters. However, the structural mechanisms underlying autoinhibition and activation of B-Myb-mediated transcription have been poorly characterized. Here, we determined that a region in the B-Myb NRD (residues 510-600) directly associates with the DBD and inhibits binding of the DBD to the MBS DNA sequence. We demonstrate using biophysical assays that phosphorylation of the NRD at T515, T518, and T520 is sufficient to disrupt the interaction between the NRD and the DBD, which results in increased affinity for MBS DNA and increased B-Myb-dependent promoter activation in cell assays. Our biochemical characterization of B-Myb autoregulation and the activating effects of phosphorylation provide insight into how B-Myb functions as a site-specific transcription factor."

https://openalex.org/W4289874807,"Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reported to regulate follicular development and reproductive disease pathogenesis, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, lncRNA expression profiling of different-sized healthy follicles from Hu sheep with different prolificacy revealed 50 613 lncRNAs. Numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed among different comparison groups. This study characterized one novel transcript, lncRNA-412.25 (from healthy follicles with a diameter of >5 mm), which was predominantly expressed in the high prolificacy group and localized to the cytoplasm of granulosa cells (GCs). LncRNA-412.25 knockdown promoted and inhibited Hu sheep GC apoptosis and proliferation, respectively. Interestingly, lncRNA-412.25 could directly bind to miR-346, which can target the gene of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Knockdown of lncRNA-412.25 promoted GC apoptosis by downregulating LIF expression, where this effect was attenuated by miR-346. Moreover, the miR-346 inhibitor mitigated the lncRNA-412.25 knockdown-induced downregulation of phosphorylated protein of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which was validated using immunofluorescence analysis. Our results demonstrated that lncRNA-412.25 regulates GC proliferation and apoptosis in Hu sheep by binding to miR-346 and then activating the LIF/STAT3 pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying prolificacy in sheep."
https://openalex.org/W4289952174,"Background Older adults with multimorbidity experience frequent care transitions, particularly from hospital to home, which are often poorly coordinated and fragmented. We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test the implementation and effectiveness of Community Assets Supporting Transitions (CAST), an evidence-informed nurse-led intervention to support older adults with multimorbidity and depressive symptoms with the aim of improving health outcomes and enhancing transitions from hospital to home. This trial was conducted in three sites, representing suburban/rural and urban communities, within two health regions in Ontario, Canada. Purpose This paper reports on facilitators and barriers to implementing CAST. Methods Data collection and analysis were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework. Data were collected through study documents and individual and group interviews conducted with Care Transition Coordinators and members from local Community Advisory Boards. Study documents included minutes of meetings with research team members, study partners, Community Advisory Boards, and Care Transition Coordinators. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Findings Intervention implementation was facilitated by: (a) engaging the community to gain buy-in and adapt CAST to the local community contest; (b) planning, training, and research meetings; (c) facilitating engagement, building relationships, and collaborating with local partners; (d) ensuring availability of support and resources for Care Transition Coordinators; and (e) tailoring of the intervention to individual client (i.e., older adult) needs and preferences. Implementation barriers included: (a) difficulties recruiting and retaining intervention staff; (b) difficulties engaging older adults in the intervention; (c) balancing tailoring the intervention with delivering the core intervention components; and (c) Care Transition Coordinators’ challenges in engaging providers within clients’ circles of care. Conclusion This research enhances our understanding of the importance of considering intervention characteristics, the context within which the intervention is being implemented, and the processes required for implementing transitional care intervention for complex older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4289953303,"The burial rates of males and females in early modern central London were compared to investigate a possible bias towards male mortality in the plague years of 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625 and 1665. The burial records of sixteen parishes were examined and compared with the five-year periods immediately preceding each plague year when recorded burials were substantially less. A markedly higher burial rate for males was detected in each plague year but this can be partly attributed to a general preponderance of males in the central London population since there was a similar but lesser bias in non-plague years. In the plague years the difference between the frequency of male and female adult burials appears to have been enhanced by the preferential migration of women of childbearing age out of the city since fewer births were recorded in months when plague was rife. Furthermore, when a sample of households was investigated, husbands were significantly more likely to have been buried than their wives. These findings were largely applicable to the plague years of 1603, 1625 and 1665 but were far less apparent in 1563 and 1593. In general, there were more burials of boys than girls in non-plague years which is the expected consequence of their greater vulnerability to childhood diseases. This difference diminished in plague years so that the burials of girls and boys approached parity at a time when burials of children of both sexes were significantly increased. Possibly, plague did not discriminate between the sexes and this characteristic tended to mask the usual vulnerability of boys."
https://openalex.org/W4289953720,"This study aimed to analyze the relationship among different evaluative reactions of the intergroup attitudes and contact in Spanish adolescents evaluating different ethnic minorities and in immigrant-background adolescents evaluating Spanish youth. This study was based on psychosocial models of great impact in the study of intergroup relations such as the Stereotype Content Model and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes Map, and incorporated a new approach to the study of attitudes: psychological networks. In total, 1122 Spanish adolescents and 683 adolescents with an immigrant background (Moroccan, Romanian or Ecuadorian origin) participated in the study, aged from 12 to 19 years. They answered a questionnaire with measures of stereotype dimensions (morality, immorality, sociability and competence), emotions (positives and negative), behavioral tendencies (facilitation and harm) and contact (quantity and quality). The results show similar structural patterns in the six studied groups, with emotions acting as links between stereotypes and behavioral tendencies. Moreover, positive and negative stereotype dimensions appeared as independent dimensions that were part of different processes: sociability and morality, and competence to a lesser extent, were related to facilitation behaviors through positive emotions, while immorality was related to harm behaviors through negative emotions. This could indicate that, to achieve successful intergroup relations involving cooperation and the development of friendly relationships, it would be appropriate to intervene in parallel in these two pathways. Due to the centrality of positive emotions (and sociability and immorality) and, therefore, their capacity to affect the entire network, focusing interventions on these variables could be an appropriate strategy to achieve overall positive attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W4289954721,"Considering the scarcity of normal and strabismic images, this study proposed a method that combines a meta-learning approach with image processing methods to improve the classification accuracy when meta-learning alone is used for screening strabismus.The meta-learning approach was first pre-trained on a public dataset to obtain a well-generalized embedding network to extract distinctive features of images. On the other hand, the image processing methods were used to extract the position features of eye regions (e.g., iris position, corneal light reflex) as supplementary features to the distinctive features. Afterward, principal component analysis was applied to reduce the dimensionality of distinctive features for integration with low-dimensional supplementary features. The integrated features were then used to train a support vector machine classifier for performing strabismus screening. Sixty images (30 normal and 30 strabismus) were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and its classification performance was assessed by computing the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity through 5,000 experiments.The proposed method achieved a classification accuracy of 0.805 with a sensitivity (correct classification of strabismus) of 0.768 and a specificity (correct classification of normal) of 0.842, whereas the classification accuracy of using meta-learning alone was 0.709 with a sensitivity of 0.740 and a specificity of 0.678.The proposed strabismus screening method achieved promising classification accuracy and gained significant accuracy improvement over using meta-learning alone under data scarcity."

However, due to its negative effects, the search for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become one of the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feed additive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance. However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated. Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum (EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) to evaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and its metabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups (n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were as follows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 15 ml/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumen pectinase (P<0.05) and lipase (P<0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota (P<0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produced a total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolites remaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metabolites were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism in cancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and protein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumen microbiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme activities."
https://openalex.org/W4289972000,"Purpose Available but insufficient evidence shows that changes may occur in the immune system following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study aimed at evaluating immunological changes in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia compared with the control group. Method The present study was performed on 95 patients with COVID-19 (32 severe and 63 moderate cases) and 22 healthy controls. Relationship between immune cells, disease severity and lung involvement was assessed. Binary logistic regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis. Results A significant decrease was observed in CD20 + cell counts of the patients. To differentiate patients from healthy individuals, the cutoff point for the CD4 + cell count was 688 /μL, sensitivity 0.96, and specificity 0.84. An increase in CD4 + cells reduces the odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.82, P = 0.047) and death (odds ratio = 0.74, P = 0.029). CD4 + cells play a pivotal role in the severity of lung involvement (P = 0.03). In addition to CD4 + cells, Fc gamma receptor III (FcγRIII) (CD16) also played a significant prognosis (odds ratio = 0.55, P = 0.047). In severe cases, C-reactive protein, Blood urea nitrogen, and Creatine phosphokinase levels, as well as neutrophil counts, were significantly higher than those of moderate ones whereas lymphocyte count in severe cases was lower than that of moderate ones. Conclusion The number of total T-cells and B-cells in patients with COVID-19 was lower than that of controls; however, their NK cells increased. FcγRIII and CD4 + cells are of great importance due to their association with COVID-19 prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4289991545,"Macrophomina phaseolina is a soil-borne pathogenic fungus that infects a wide range of crop species and causes severe yield losses. Although the genome of the fungus has been sequenced, the molecular basis of its virulence has not been determined. Identification of up-regulated genes during fungal infection is important to understand the mechanism involved in its virulence. To ensure reliable quantification, expression of target genes needs to be normalized on the basis of certain reference genes. However, in the case of M . phaseolina , reference genes or their expression analysis have not been reported in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate 12 candidate reference genes for the expression analysis of M . phaseolina genes by applying three different fungal growth conditions: a) during root and stem infection of soybean, b) in culture media with and without soybean leaf infusion and c) by inoculating a cut-stem. Based on BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder algorithms, CYP1 was identified as the best recommended reference gene followed by EF1β for expression analysis of fungal gene during soybean root infection. Besides Mp08158, CYP1 gene was found suitable when M . phaseolina was grown in potato-dextrose broth with leaf infusion. In the case of cut-stem inoculation, Mp08158 and Mp11185 genes were found to be most stable. To validate the selected reference genes, expression analysis of two cutinase genes was performed. In general, the expression patterns were similar when the target genes were normalized against most or least stable gene. However, in some cases different expression pattern can be obtained when least stable gene is used for normalization. We believe that the reference genes identified and validated in this study will be useful for gene expression analysis during host infection with M . phaseolina ."
https://openalex.org/W4289341753,"Neurite outgrowth is an integrated whole cell response triggered by the cannabinoid-1 receptor. We sought to identify the many different biochemical pathways that contribute to this whole cell response. To understand underlying mechanisms, we identified subcellular processes (SCPs) composed of one or more biochemical pathways and their interactions required for this response. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were obtained from bulk transcriptomics and proteomic analysis of extracts from cells stimulated with a cannabinoid-1 receptor agonist. We used these differentially expressed genes and proteins to build networks of interacting SCPs by combining the expression data with prior pathway knowledge. From these SCP networks, we identified additional genes that when ablated, experimentally validated the SCP involvement in neurite outgrowth. Our experiments and informatics modeling allowed us to identify diverse SCPs such as those involved in pyrimidine metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, and mRNA splicing and stability, along with more predictable SCPs such as membrane vesicle transport and microtubule dynamics. We find that SCPs required for neurite outgrowth are widely distributed among many biochemical pathways required for constitutive cellular functions, several of which are termed 'deep', since they are distal to signaling pathways and the key SCPs directly involved in extension of the neurite. In contrast, 'proximal' SCPs are involved in microtubule growth and membrane vesicle transport dynamics required for neurite outgrowth. From these bioinformatics and dynamical models based on experimental data, we conclude that receptor-mediated regulation of subcellular functions for neurite outgrowth is both distributed, that is, involves many different biochemical pathways, and deep."
https://openalex.org/W4289346139,"During obesity, tissue macrophages increase in number and become proinflammatory, thereby contributing to metabolic dysfunction. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes triglyceride in lipoproteins, is secreted by macrophages. However, the role of macrophage-derived LPL in adipose tissue remodeling and lipoprotein metabolism is largely unknown. To clarify these issues, we crossed leptin-deficient Lepob/ob mice with mice lacking the Lpl gene in myeloid cells (Lplm-/m-) to generate Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice. We found the weight of perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) was increased in Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice compared with Lepob/ob mice due to substantial accumulation of both adipose tissue macrophages and collagen that surrounded necrotic adipocytes. In the fibrotic epidydimal WAT of Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice, we observed an increase in collagen VI and high mobility group box 1, while α-smooth muscle cell actin, a marker of myofibroblasts, was almost undetectable, suggesting that the adipocytes were the major source of the collagens. Furthermore, the adipose tissue macrophages from Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice showed increased expression of genes related to fibrosis and inflammation. In addition, we determined Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice were more hypertriglyceridemic than Lepob/ob mice. Lplm-/m-;Lepob/ob mice also showed slower weight gain than Lepob/ob mice, which was primarily due to reduced food intake. In conclusion, we discovered that the loss of myeloid Lpl led to extensive fibrosis of perigonadal WAT and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition to illustrating an important role of macrophage LPL in regulation of circulating triglyceride levels, these data show that macrophage LPL protects against fibrosis in obese adipose tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4289783418,"Cell-to-cell signaling, or quorum sensing (QS), in many Gram-negative bacteria is governed by small molecule signals (N-acyl-l-homoserine lactones, AHLs) and their cognate receptors (LuxR-type proteins). The mechanistic underpinnings of QS in these bacteria are severely limited due to the challenges of isolating and manipulating most LuxR-type proteins. Reports of quantitative direct-binding experiments on LuxR-type proteins are scarce, and robust and generalizable methods that provide such data are largely nonexistent. We report herein a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay that leverages (1) conserved tryptophans located in the LuxR-type protein ligand-binding site and synthetic fluorophore–AHL conjugates, and (2) isolation of the proteins bound to weak agonists. The FRET assay permits straightforward measurement of ligand-binding affinities with receptor—either in vitro or in cells—and was shown to be compatible with six LuxR-type proteins. These methods will advance fundamental investigations of LuxR-type protein mechanism and the development of small molecule QS modulators. A FRET-based assay using the conserved tryptophans of bacterial quorum-sensing LuxR-type proteins and synthetic fluorophore-acyl-homoserine lactone conjugates enables measurement of ligand-binding affinities either in vitro or in cells."
https://openalex.org/W4289950918,"Transcranial electrically stimulated motor-evoked potentials (tcMEPs) are widely used to evaluate motor function in humans and animals. However, the relationship between tcMEPs and the recovery of paralysis remains unclear. We previously reported that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells to a spinal cord injury (SCI) rat model resulted in various degrees of recovery from paraplegia. As a continuation of this work, in the present study, we aimed to establish the longitudinal electrophysiological changes in this SCI rat model after mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. SCI rats were established using the weight-drop method. The model rats were transvenously transplanted with two types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), one derived from rat cranial bones and the other from the bone marrow of the femur and tibia bone, 24 h after SCI. A phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group that received only PBS was also created for comparison. The degree of paralysis was evaluated over 28 days using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale and inclined plane task score. Extended tcMEPs were recorded using a previously reported bone-thinning technique, and the longitudinal electrophysiological changes in tcMEPs were investigated. In addition, the relationship between the time course of recovery from paralysis and reappearance of tcMEPs was revealed. The appearance of the tcMEP waveform was earlier in MSC-transplanted rats than in PBS-administered rats (earliest date was 7 days after SCI). The MEP waveforms also appeared at approximately the same level on the BBB scale (average score, 11 points). Ultimately, this study can help enhance our understanding of the relationship between neural regeneration and tcMEP recording. Further application of tcMEP in regenerative medicine research is expected."

A total of 305 patients who had been tested for plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were identified. Patients with incomplete results of PAC and PRA and those who had an established diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome or pheochromocytoma were excluded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors and to create predictive model of PA.PA was diagnosed in 128 of the patients (41.96%). Significant predictive factors for PA were age >60 years (OR 2.12, p = 0.045), female (OR 1.65, p<0.001), smoking (OR 2.79, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (OR 2.29, p<0.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OR 1.50, p = 0.017), systolic blood pressure >160 mmHg (OR 1.15, P<0.001), serum potassium <3 mEq/L (OR 3.72, p = 0.030), fasting blood glucose >126 mg/dL (OR 0.48, p = 0.001) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73m2 (OR 1.79, p = 0.001). Predictive model was created with a total score ranged from 0 to 42. A score above 7.5 indicated a higher probability of having PA with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 70%. The diagnostic performance of the predictive model based on area under the curve was 71%.The clinical and biochemical predictive factors including predictive model identified in this study can be employed as an additional tool to help identify patients at risk of having PA and could help reduce the number of screening and confirmation tests required for PA."

Due to the very high seed-setting rate of the hybridization of Hippeastrum , the large population of hybrid progeny and the existence of superparent inheritance, it is difficult to trace the origin of the varieties collected from the market during breeding. In this study, we analyzed the chloroplast genomes of Hippeastrum ‘Milady’, H . alberti , and H . reticulatum using the Illumina NovaSeq sequencing platform and generated full-length sequences of 158,067, 158,067, and 158,522 bp, respectively. All three genomes had the typical tetrad structure. The large single copy, small single copy, and inverted repeat regions of H . reticulatum were observed to be respectively 277, 138, and 20 bp longer than the corresponding regions of H . ‘Milady’ and H . alberti . The results of comparative analysis of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), Ka/Ks ratios, codon preferences, and complete sequences of chloroplasts of these three taxa and 14 other plant species were as follows. First, the chloroplast genomes of H . ‘Milady’, H . alberti , and H . reticulatum contain 209, 209, and 211 SSR sites, respectively, most of which (123, 123, and 122, respectively) are single nucleotide repeats. Second, leucine, arginine, and serine are the most frequently used amino acids in the three chloroplast genomes. Third, H . ‘Milady’, H . alberti , and H . reticulatum are more closely related to Lycoris and Narcissus than to Allium and Agapanthus .

https://openalex.org/W4289963168,"Making decisions is an important aspect of people’s lives. Decisions can be highly critical in nature, with mistakes possibly resulting in extremely adverse consequences. Yet, such decisions have often to be made within a very short period of time and with limited information. This can result in decreased accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we explore the possibility of increasing speed and accuracy of users engaged in the discrimination of realistic targets presented for a very short time, in the presence of unimodal or bimodal cues. More specifically, we present results from an experiment where users were asked to discriminate between targets rapidly appearing in an indoor environment. Unimodal (auditory) or bimodal (audio-visual) cues could shortly precede the target stimulus, warning the users about its location. Our findings show that, when used to facilitate perceptual decision under time pressure, and in condition of limited information in real-world scenarios, spoken cues can be effective in boosting performance (accuracy, reaction times or both), and even more so when presented in bimodal form. However, we also found that cue timing plays a critical role and, if the cue-stimulus interval is too short, cues may offer no advantage. In a post-hoc analysis of our data, we also show that congruency between the response location and both the target location and the cues, can interfere with the speed and accuracy in the task. These effects should be taken in consideration, particularly when investigating performance in realistic tasks."

Women with spine fracture or spine surgery before pregnancy were compared with women without previous spine fracture or surgery. We calculated incidences of spine fracture, spine fracture surgery and fusion surgery for other reasons with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate CS and neonatal health. Results are reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR).The main finding of our study was the increasing incidence (156%) of spine fusion surgeries for other reasons in fertile-aged women. A total CS rate (including elective and unplanned CS) in the spine fracture group was 19.7% (AOR 1.26, CI 1.17-1.34), in fusion surgery for other reasons group 25.3% (AOR 1.37, CI 1.30-1.49) and 15.9% in the control group.

https://openalex.org/W4289972945,"With the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, text detection is widely used in the real world. In text detection, due to the limitation of the receptive field of the neural network, most existing scene text detection methods cannot accurately detect small target text instances in any direction, and the detection rate of mutually adhering text instances is low, which is prone to false detection. To tackle such difficulties, in this paper, we propose a new feature pyramid network for scene text detection, Cross-Scale Attention Aggregation Feature Pyramid Network (CSAA-FPN). Specifically, we use a Attention Aggregation Feature Module (AAFM) to enhance features, which not only solves the problem of weak features and small receptive fields extracted by lightweight networks but also better handles multi-scale information and accurately separate adjacent text instances. An attention module CBAM is introduced to focus on effective information so that the output feature layer has richer and more accurate information. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Fusion Module (AFM), which weights the output features and pays attention to the pixel information to further refine the features. Experiments conducted on CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, and MSRA-TD500 have demonstrated the superiority of this model."

Prediction of mortality in multimorbid people would be clinically useful but there is no mortality risk index designed for this population. Our objective was therefore to develop and internally validate a 1-year mortality prognostic index for older multimorbid adults. Methods We analysed data of the OPERAM cohort study in Bern, Switzerland, including 822 adults aged 70 years or more with multimorbidity (3 or more chronic medical conditions) and polypharmacy (use of 5 drugs or more for &gt; 30 days). Time to all-cause mortality was assessed up to 1 year of follow-up. We performed a parametric Weibull regression model with backward stepwise selection to identify mortality risk predictors. The model was internally validated and optimism corrected using bootstrapping techniques. We derived a point-based risk score from the regression coefficients. Calibration and discrimination were assessed by the calibration slope and C statistic. Results 805 participants were included in the analysis. During 1-year of follow-up, 158 participants (20%) had died. Age, Charlson-Comorbidity-Index, number of drugs, body mass index, number of hospitalizations, Barthel-Index (functional impairment), and nursing home residency were predictors of 1-year mortality in a multivariable model. Using these variables, the 1-year probability of dying could be predicted with an optimism-corrected C statistic of 0.70. The optimism-corrected calibration slope was 0.93. Based on the derived point-based risk score to predict mortality risk, 7% of the patients classified at low-risk of mortality, 19% at moderate-risk, and 37% at high-risk died after one year of follow-up. A simpler mortality score, without the Charlson-Comorbidity-Index and Barthel-Index, showed reduced discriminative power (optimism-corrected C statistic: 0.59) compared to the full score. Conclusion We developed and internally validated a mortality risk index including for the first-time specific predictors for multimorbid adults. This new 1-year mortality prediction point-based score allowed to classify multimorbid older patients into three categories of increasing risk of mortality. Further validation of the score among various populations of multimorbid patients is needed before its implementation into practice."
https://openalex.org/W4289974512,"Conservation biogeography, which applies principles, theories, and analyses of biodiversity distribution patterns to address conservation challenges, can provide valuable insight and guidance to policy making for protection of biodiversity at multiple scales. The temperate and tropical ecosystems of the Nearctic-Neotropical transition in the small western state of Colima, Mexico, support a mosaic of remarkably diverse fauna and flora and provide a rare opportunity to determine spatial distribution patterns of terrestrial vertebrate species, assess human-induced threats, and identify potential conservation strategies. We analyzed the spatial distribution patterns and correlated them with the current land cover and extent of the protected areas. Despite its limited geographic extension, 29% (866) of all vertebrates, and almost a quarter of both endemic and threatened species in Mexico, live in Colima. Our analysis identified clear high-richness concentration sites (i.e., ""hotspots"") coincident for all groups and that elevation and both temperate and tropical ecosystems composition exert significant influence on richness patterns. Furthermore, current species´ distribution also showed significant correlation with natural and disturbed landcover. Significant hotspots for all species groups coincided poorly with the limited protected areas in the state (only 3.8%). The current state of natural land cover (less than 16%) in the state, coupled with its remarkable biological importance, highlights the need for further complementary conservation efforts including expansion and creation of new protected areas, significant restoration efforts and other conservation measures to maintain this uniquely biogeographic and biological diverse region of the country."
https://openalex.org/W4289987180,"Health care professionals working in primary and specialized care typically search for medical information from Internet sources. In Finland, Physician's Databases are online portals aimed at professionals seeking medical information. As dosage errors may occur when prescribing medication to children, professionals' need for reliable medical information has increased in public health care centers and hospitals. Influenza continues to be a public health threat, with young children at risk of developing severe illness and easily transmitting the virus. Oseltamivir is used to treat children with influenza. The objective of this study was to compare searches for children's oseltamivir and influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care, and to determine if the searches could aid detection of influenza outbreaks.We compared searches in Physician's Databases for children's oral suspension of oseltamivir (6 mg/mL) for influenza diagnoses of children under 7 years and laboratory findings of influenza A and B from the National Infectious Disease Register. Searches and diagnoses were assessed in primary and specialized care across Finland by season from 2012-2016. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) calculated seasonal starts and ends, and paired differences in the mean compared two indicators. Correlation was tested to compare seasons.We found that searches and diagnoses in primary and specialized care showed visually similar patterns annually. The MEM-calculated starting weeks in searches appeared mainly in the same week. Oseltamivir searches in primary care preceded diagnoses by -1.0 weeks (95% CI: -3.0, -0.3; p = 0.132) with very high correlation (τ = 0.913). Specialized care oseltamivir searches and diagnoses correlated moderately (τ = 0.667).Health care professionals' searches for children's oseltamivir in online databases linked with the registers of children's influenza diagnoses in primary and specialized care. Therefore, database searches should be considered as supplementary information in disease surveillance when detecting influenza epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W4289997605,"In China, industrial pollution has become an urgent problem for policy makers and enterprise managers. To better support industrial development, we need to determine the effectiveness of policies through efficiency evaluation. China’s provincial industrial system consists of two stages: production and emission reduction. The emission reduction stage is composed of three parallel sub stages: solid waste treatment, waste gas treatment and wastewater treatment. In this process, the treatment capacity of industrial wastewater treatment facilities can be used as carry forward variable, which is not only the desirable output of the previous emission reduction stage, but also the input of the current emission reduction stage. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic hybrid two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model for eco-efficiency evaluation of industrial systems, and applies it to a case study of Chinese regional industry. Applying the data collected from 2011 to 2015 to the model, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) During the whole survey period, the average eco-efficiency was 0.9027. The overall eco-inefficiency of China’s provincial industrial system during the study period is mainly due to low efficiency of solid waste treatment and waste gas treatment. (2) The average eco-efficiency of provincial industrial system increased steadily from 2011 (0.6448) to 2014 (0.6777), but decreased slightly in 2015 (0.5908). (3) The carry forward treatment capacity of industrial wastewater treatment facilities has a remarkable impact on provincial industrial system efficiency scores, especially at the wastewater treatment stage (0.6002 vs 0.3691). (4) Provincial industrial system exists distinct geographical characteristics of low efficiency. This study has important guiding significance for policy makers and enterprise managers who are concerned about industrial pollution control."
https://openalex.org/W4290014204,"Objective To explore the relationship between physical activity and prosocial behavior in college students, and to examine whether self-perception and gender may play mediating and moderating roles, respectively, in that relationship. Methods The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-long form, Prosocial Tendencies Measure, and Self-perception Scale were used to survey 647 college students in Yangzhou, China. Internal consistency testing, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) across physical activity levels, exploratory factor analysis, correlation testing, mediation effect testing (independent variable, physical activity; mediating variable, self-perception; dependent variable, prosocial behavior), bootstrap testing and moderated mediation testing were conducted. Results Physical activity level was not found to be a direct predictor prosocial behavior in college students. Self-perception was found to play a mediating role between physical activity and prosocial behavior. Conclusion Physical activity is not directly predictive college students’ prosocial behavior tendencies, but it is indirectly predictive through self-perception. This study explores the relationship between the three variables and the path of the relationship, deepening the research related to the relationship between physical activity and prosocial behavior, providing ideas for fostering prosocial behavior in Chinese universities, as well as providing a theoretical basis for possible future empirical research."
