In addition, phase II enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protect cells against diverse toxins and oxidative stress. In this work, we describe a link between these defense systems at the level of transcriptional regulation of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1. The herb-derived phenol carnosol induced HO-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that carnosol targeted the mouse ho1 promoter at two enhancer regions comprising the antioxidant response elements (AREs). Moreover, carnosol increased the nuclear levels of Nrf2, a transcription factor governing AREs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and luciferase reporter assays with a dominant-negative Nrf2 mutant indicated that carnosol increased the binding of Nrf2 to ARE and induced Nrf2-dependent activation of the ho1 promoter. While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for HO-1 induction, we observed that carnosol activated the ERK, p38, and JNK pathways as well as the survival pathway driven by PI3K. Inhibition of PI3K reduced the increase in Nrf2 protein levels and activation of the ho1 promoter. Expression of active PI3K-CAAX (where A is aliphatic amino acid) was sufficient to activate AREs. The use of dominant-negative mutants of protein kinase Cζ and Akt1, two kinases downstream from PI3K, demonstrated a requirement for active Akt1, but not protein kinase Cζ. Moreover, the long-term antioxidant effect of carnosol was partially blocked by PI3K or HO-1 inhibitors, further demonstrating that carnosol attenuates oxidative stress through a pathway that involves PI3K and HO-1.

High levels of reactive oxygen species cause damage to cells and are involved in several human pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (1Klein J.A. Ackerman S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Cooke M.S. Evans M.D. Dizdaroglu M. Lunec J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1195-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). Therefore, the use of compounds with antioxidant properties may help prevent or alleviate diseases in which oxidative stress is a primary cause (3Lim G.P. Chu T. Yang F. Beech W. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J Neurosci. 2001; 121: 8370-8377Crossref Google Scholar). Carnosol, a diterpene derived from the herb rosemary, is a representative member of a family of plant-derived phenols, which also include curcumin, carnosic acid, phenylethyl isothiocyanate, epigallocatechin gallate, and other green tea polyphenols. These bioactive phytochemicals exhibit Michael acceptor function and therefore behave as antioxidants (4Lo A.H. Liang Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Ho C.T. Lin J.K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, being themselves xenobiotic compounds, they activate a xenobiotic response in the target cells affecting the expression of phase II enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, aldoketoreductase, glutathione S-transferase, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione synthetase, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ARE, antioxidant response element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; ZnPPIX, zinc-protoporphyrin IX; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; PKC, protein kinase C.

Heme oxygenase isozymes (HO-1 and HO-2) catalyze the stepwise degradation of heme to release free iron and equimolar concentrations of carbon monoxide and the linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase (8Maines M.D. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Noisy-le-Grand). 2000; 46: 573-585PubMed Google Scholar). The HO-1 isozyme is a phase II enzyme that is transcriptionally regulated by a large variety of stimuli. These include its substrate, heme (9Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn-Katz S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Many reports have demonstrated the potent antioxidant activity of the heme-derived metabolites generated by HO-1 catalysis (biliverdin and bilirubin) and the cytoprotective actions of carbon monoxide on vascular endothelium and nerve cells (17Chen K. Gunter K. Maines M.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 18Mazza F. Goodman A. Lombardo G. Vanella A. Abraham N.G. Exp. Biol.

J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, both HO-1-deficient mice (21Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) and a human case of genetic HO-1 deficiency (22Saikawa Y. Kaneda H. Yue L. Shimura S. Toma T. Kasahara Y. Yachie A. Koizumi S. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 178-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) exhibit a serious impairment of iron metabolism, leading to liver and kidney oxidative damage and inflammation. Therefore, it is now widely accepted that induction of HO-1 expression represents an adaptive response that increases cell resistance to oxidative injury. The signaling mechanisms used to activate transcription of phase II genes such as HO-1 are poorly defined. Most studies have focused on the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) related to cell growth and stress response. In vertebrates, the three major MAPK pathways are represented by kinase cascades leading to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 (for a review, see Ref. 23Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). All three pathways appear to be involved to some extent in the up-regulation of HO-1 expression in response to diverse stimuli. For instance, in rat hepatocytes, sodium arsenite appears to regulate HO-1 expression via activation of Ras and the JNK pathway, but not the ERK pathway (24Kietzmann T. Samoylenko A. Immenschuh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17927-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). On the other hand, arsenite induces HO-1 expression via the ERK and p38 pathways in LMH chicken hepatoma cells (25Shan Y. Pepe J. Lu T.H. Elbirt K.K. Lambrecht R.W. Bonkovsky H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 380: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ischemia-reperfusion in the lung activates HO-1 through JNK and p38 (26Ohlmann A. Giffhorn-Katz S. Becker I. Katz N. Immenschuh S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 584-589Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, regarding phytophenols, curcumin up-regulates HO-1 through the p38 pathway in porcine renal epithelial cells (27Balogun E. Hoque M. Gong P. Killeen E. Green C.J. Foresti R. Alam J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). However, the role of the survival signaling pathway represented by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in the regulation of HO-1 expression is still not defined. An initial study by Lee et al. (28Lee J.M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) suggested a role for PI3K in the regulation of the phase II enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we previously showed that nerve growth factor induces the expression of HO-1 by a still unknown PI3K-dependent mechanism (13Salinas M. Diaz R. Abraham N.G. Ruiz de Galarreta C.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13898-13904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is accepted that induction of HO-1 expression is mediated through cis-regulatory DNA sequences located in their promoter region. Among the large variety of putative regulatory sites found in the promoter 5′-flanking region of human, rat, mouse, and chicken HO-1 genes (29Elbirt K.K. Bonkovsky H.L. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), most investigations have focused on those that exhibit inducible responses to oxidative signals (30Hill-Kapturczak N. Thamilselvan V. Liu F. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F851-F859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several AP-1-binding sites have been shown to be involved in the transcriptional induction of HO-1 by MAPKs, cyclic nucleotides, protein phosphatase inhibitors, and the polyphenol curcumin (31Gong P. Stewart D. Hu B. Vinson C. Alam J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Maeshima H. Sato M. Ishikawa K. Katagata Y. Yoshida T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2959-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Kiemer A.K. Bildner N. Weber N.C. Vollmar A.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, a new class of AP-1-related sites has been shown to mediate oxidative stress responsiveness of phase II genes. These regions are termed stress response elements or antioxidant response elements (AREs) and are tightly regulated by the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) (34Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the Cap’n’Collar family of transcription factors (35Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Under non-stimulated conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to Keap1, an actin-binding protein (36Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Several stimuli, including oxidative stress, lead to the disruption of this complex, freeing Nrf2 for translocation to the nucleus and dimerization with basic leucine zipper transcription factors such as Maf and Jun family members (37Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Nrf2 is liberated from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex remains controversial, but probably involves phosphorylation and stabilization of Nrf2 protein (38Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 39Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), which otherwise has a half-life of just 30 min and is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (39Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4536-4541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 40Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of carnosol on expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1, and we dissected the signaling pathways leading to HO-1 regulation. Our results indicate that carnosol activates HO-1 expression probably by increasing Nrf2 protein levels in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. Therefore, in addition to its intrinsic antioxidant nature, carnosol activates the PI3K/Akt survival pathway and up-regulates expression of HO-1. supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% horse serum, an experimental condition that does not compromise viability in our PC12 cells (13Salinas M.

LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nerve growth factor and carnosol were purchased from Calbiochem, and hemin, LY294002, PD98059, SB203580, SP600125, and MG132 were from Sigma. These drugs were dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final vehicle concentration of <0.2%. Analysis of mRNA Levels by Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Cells were plated on 60-mm dishes, and total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Equal amounts (1 μg) of RNA from the different treatments were reverse-transcribed for 75 min at 42 °C using 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of 20 units of RNasin (Promega). Amplification of cDNA was performed in 25 μl of PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 9.0) containing 0.6 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 30 pmol of synthetic gene-specific primers for HO-1 (forward, 5′-AAGGCTTTAAGCTGGTGATGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGCGGTGTCTGGGATGAACTA-3′). To ensure that equal amounts of cDNA were added to the PCR, the β-actin gene was amplified using synthetic oligonucleotides (forward, 5′-TGTTTGAGACCTTCAACACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-CGCTCATTGCCGATAGTGAT-3′). After an initial denaturation step for 4 min at 94 °C, amplification of each cDNA was performed for the minimal number of cycles that allowed detection of basal HO-1 mRNA levels in control cells (data not shown), 19 cycles for β-actin and 24 cycles for HO-1, using a thermal profile of 1 min at 94 °C (denaturalization), 1 min at 58 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (elongation). The amplified PCR products were resolved by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed with 20 ng of cDNA obtained as described above in 25 μl containing 0.5 μm primers (HO-1, 5′-GCCTGCTAGCCTGGTTCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCGGTGTCTGGGATGAACTA-3′ (reverse); and β-actin, 5′-GCCTCACTGTCCACCTTCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCGGCCTGAGTAGCATGA-3′ (reverse)) and the nucleotides, buffer, and Taq polymerase included in SYBR Green I Mastermix (PE Applied Biosystems). Amplification was conducted in an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. HO-1 expression was estimated in duplicate samples and was normalized to β-actin expression levels. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—PC12 cells (5 × 106) were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was carefully resuspended in 3 pellet volumes of cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.15 mm EDTA, 0.015 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 20 min, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min, nuclei were resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of hypertonic cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. Nuclear debris was removed by centrifugation at 900 × g for 20 min at 4 °C; one part of the supernatant was resolved by SDS-PAGE and submitted to immunoblot analysis using anti-Nrf2 and anti-Sp1 antibodies. The rest of the supernatant was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Protein concentration was determined with the Dc protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). EMSAs—The double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotide used as the Nrf2 probe was 5′-TTTTATGCTGTGTCATGGTT-3′. The complementary strand was annealed by incubation at a concentration of 250 ng/μl in STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) at 80 °C for 2 min. The mixture was then slowly cooled to 4 °C with a thermal profile of 1 °C/min in a thermal incubator. Annealed oligonucleotides were diluted to 25 ng/μl in STE buffer. The 5′-end labeling was performed with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) using 25 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The labeled probes were purified using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The binding reaction mixture contained 5 μg of nuclear extract in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet-40, 1% dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI)·poly(dC) in a total volume of 20 μl. Anti-Nrf2 antibody (2 μg) or unlabeled competitor probe (25 ng) was added as indicated, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Labeled DNA (0.25 ng) was added to the mixture and submitted to an additional 20-min incubation at 25 °C. Samples were resolved at 4 °C on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Immunoblotting—30 μg of cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). Blots were analyzed with the appropriate antibodies: anti-Cys20 Akt1 (1:500), anti-ERK2 (1:1000), anti-p38 (1:1000), anti-Nrf2 (1:16000), and anti-Sp1 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt1 (1:1000), anti-phospho-ERK2 (1:1000), and anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA); anti-phospho-JNK (1:1000) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (kind gift of Dr. González Castaño, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid); and anti-HO-1 (1:1000) and anti-HO-2 (1:1000) (Stressgen Biotech Corp., Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) were used to detect the proteins of interest by enhanced chemiluminescence. Flow Cytometry—A FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze intracellular reactive oxygen species with the fluorescence probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, The Netherlands), which passively diffuses into the cell and is cleaved and oxidized to 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (band pass 530/25 nm). Cells were submitted to carnosol, zinc-protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), LY294002 (as indicated for each experiment), and H2O2 (5 min); detached mechanically from the plates; washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline; and analyzed immediately. Three independent samples of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each experimental condition. Statistics—Student’s t test was used to assess differences between groups. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. All luciferase and flow cytometry experiments were performed at least three times using triplicate or quadruplicate samples per group. The values in graphs correspond to the mean ± S.E. of at least three samples. Densitometric analyses were performed with NIH Image Version 2.51 software on representative immunoblots from experiments that were repeated two to five times. Carnosol Induces Expression of HO-1—We investigated the possibility that carnosol, a natural diterpene derived from the herb rosemary, might alter the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1. PC12 cells were maintained for 16 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and 7.5% horse serum (high serum medium) or with 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% horse serum (low serum medium). Under both growing conditions, cells retained a similar viability as determined by cytometric analysis of propidium iodide incorporation and annexin V-phyroerythrin staining, at least within the time frame of these experiments (data not shown and Ref. 42Martin D. Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Serrano E. Recuero M. Cuadrado A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with 10 μm carnosol for 6 h or with an equivalent volume of Me2SO vehicle (final concentration of <0.2%) and analyzed for the amount of HO-1 protein. In agreement with a recent study (44Liu H. Nowak R. Chao W. Bloch K.D. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1553-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), cells grown in low serum medium exhibited a slight decrease in HO-1 protein levels compared with cells grown in high serum medium (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, carnosol induced a significant increase in HO-1 protein levels that was more evident in cells submitted to low serum conditions. To further study the effect of carnosol on induction of HO-1 expression, PC12 cells were maintained in low serum medium for 16 h and then treated for 6 h with carnosol concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μm. Real-time PCR (Fig. 1B) indicated that carnosol induced a maximal increase (>200-fold) in HO-1 mRNA at 10 μm. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1C, semiquantitative PCR also evidenced a dose-dependent increase in HO-1 mRNA levels. This increase was not as high as that found with real-time PCR because amplicon size and primers were different (see “Experimental Procedures”) and because, to detect basal mRNA levels in the carnosol-untreated cells, it was necessary to increase PCR cycles over the linear range in the carnosol-induced cells. In addition, carnosol also produced a parallel increase in HO-1 protein levels, whereas HO-2 levels corresponding to the other isozyme constitutively expressed in these cells remained without significant alteration (Fig. 1D). Consistent with these data, 10 μm carnosol also induced a time-dependent increase in HO-1 mRNA levels that was apparent as early as 2 h after treatment and was followed by a robust increase in HO-1 protein levels at 4 h (Fig. 1, E and F). Similar results were obtained in other cell lines of human and mouse origin (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that carnosol specifically up-regulates expression of the inducible HO-1 isozyme. Carnosol Activates HO-1 through the AREs—The mouse ho1 promoter contains two AREs that might represent potential targets of regulation by carnosol. To investigate this possibility, PC12 cells were transfected with luciferase expression vectors carrying the wild-type 15-kb mouse promoter or deletion mutant versions lacking either the proximal (ΔE1) or distal (ΔE2) ARE regulatory sequence or both regulatory sequences (ΔE1+ΔE2). Cells were maintained in low serum medium for 16 h and then stimulated with 10 μm carnosol for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 2, deletion of ARE sequence E1 or E2 resulted in 30 and 36% decreases in carnosol induction, respectively. Interestingly, deletion of both AREs abolished the response to carnosol. Therefore, these results suggest that carnosol activates HO-1 expression through both AREs. Carnosol Increases the Levels of the Nrf2 Transcription Factor—Several transcription factors have been reported to interact with AREs. However, considering that induction of HO-1 expression by several inducers requires de novo protein synthesis (45Chen K. Maines M.D. Cell. Mol. Biol.

PC12 cells were maintained in low serum medium for 16 h and then stimulated for 3 h with the carnosol concentrations indicated in Fig. 3A. As a control, cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. In agreement with previous studies (39Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Tristetraprolin (TTP) binds to the 3′-untranslated region of tumor necrosis factor mRNA and regulates its fate. We identified in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation sites in TTP using nanoflow high pressure liquid chromatography microelectrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and novel methods for direct digestion of TTP bound to affinity matrices (GSH-beads or anti-Myc linked to magnetic beads). MK2Δ3B, activated in Escherichia coli by p38α, phosphorylates TTP in vitro at major sites Ser52 and Ser178 (>10-fold in abundance) as well as at several minor sites that were detected after enriching for phosphopeptides with immobilized metal affinity chromatography. MK2 phosphorylation of TTP creates a functional 14-3-3 binding site. In cells, TTP was phosphorylated at Ser52, Ser178, Thr250, and Ser316 and at SP sites in a cluster (Ser80/Ser82/Ser85). Anisomycin treatment of NIH 3T3 cells increased phosphorylation of Ser52 and Ser178. Overexpression of MK2 sufficed to increase phosphorylation of Ser52 and Ser178 but not Ser80/Ser82/Ser85 or Thr250. Thus, Ser52 and Ser178 are putative MK2 sites in vivo.

Cellular studies show deficits in motility, chemotaxis, and cytokine production. Macrophages taken from MK2 (–,–) mice exhibit normal TNF mRNA induction in response to endotoxin but do not release TNF protein. Cellular TNF protein was markedly decreased in MK2 (–,–) macrophages, suggesting a block in production of TNF from TNF mRNA (2Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D.

Evidence chiefly comes from mRNA stabilization caused by transfection of mutationally activated MEK3/MEK6 or by the addition of agents that activate p38 MAPK and conversely from destabilization caused by the addition of a p38α,β MAP kinase inhibitor. Since p38α,β is required to activate MK2, these experiments do not dissect contributions from MK2. Studies in MK2 (–,–) cells suggest that MK2 regulates stability of some cytokine mRNAs (2Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.D. Gaestel M. Nat.

TTP (for a review, see Ref. 8Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc.

Phosphorylation occurs at more than one site evident by the appearance of two distinct slower migrating forms of TTP on gels after stimulation that are reversed by phosphatase treatment (7Mahtani K.R.

TTP undergoes detectable gel shifts between ∼1 and 1.5 h, and the shifts persist for several hours (7Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol.

Ser178 mutation in human TTP causes loss of the ability to bind 14-3-3, suggesting that Ser178 is a phosphorylation site (15Johnson B.A. Stehn J.R. Yaffe M.B. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18029-18036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but the responsible kinase(s) have not been identified. We studied phosphorylation of TTP by potently active, recombinant MK2Δ3B produced in E. coli as well as in situ phosphorylation of Myc-TTP expressed in cells. We identified two major (Ser52 and Ser178) and several minor MK2 sites. Description as major sites reflects abundance of phosphopeptide and estimated stoichiometry in peptides recovered with the methods we describe. Minor sites detected are not excluded as candidates for functionally significant sites. We show that the major sites (Ser52 and Ser178) phosphorylated by MK2 are phosphorylated in vivo, and their phosphorylation can be altered by manipulating the p38 pathway in vivo. Furthermore, phosphorylation of TTP by MK2 confers the ability to bind 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation(s) of TTP may provide biological switches to regulate its dynamic life cycle and/or its functions to control mRNA stability and translation.

Commercially acquired reagents were as follows: horseradish peroxidase-linked antigoat antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); tosylactivated Dynabeads® (Dynal Biotech); γ-bind Sepharose plus, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences); anisomycin, SB203580, and microcystin LR (Calbiochem); and BHK-21 cells and NIH 3T3 (ATCC). Plasmids for Expression of Active MK2Δ3B—A bicistronic plasmid (pTYB4 His6p38α-HA1MEK6EE) was created by moving the coding region of His6-tagged WT p38α with the ribosomal binding site engineered after the stop codon (17Khokhlatchev A.

HA-tagged MKK6EE (excised from the pcDNA3 parent vector with NotI and BglII followed by Klenow fill-in) was bluntcloned into the p38-pTYB4 construct at the NruI site. PCR was used to create an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible MK2 expression vector with a p15A origin of replication (pAC-pET MK2Δ3B), similar in overall strategy to construction of pAC-pET RSK2CTD (21Chrestensen C.A.

All constructs were verified by sequencing. Protein Production and Purification—BL21 E. coli were transformed with pAC-pET MK2Δ3B with or without pTYB4 His638α-HA1MEK6EE using appropriate antibiotic selections. Transformed cells were grown and induced, lysates were prepared, and proteins were purified as described (21Chrestensen C.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27733-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST-TTP was expressed and purified as in Ref. 22Worthington M.T. Pelo J.W.

Purified proteins were quantified with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay™ and with SDS-PAGE analysis. Phosphocellulose paper assays were used to monitor kinase activity of the purified GST or His6-tagged proteins. The kinase reactions contained (final, in 40 μl) 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼4000 cpm/pmol), 50 μm peptide substrate and were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. TTP Phosphorylation—Reactions to phosphorylate TTP in vitro for site identification by MS/MS (see below) used the same kinase mixture minus [γ-32P]ATP and usually omitted bovine serum albumin. GST-TTP (2 μg in a 20-μl final volume) was phosphorylated with 60 ng of MK2Δ3B for 1 h (30 °C). A parallel reaction was always performed that included [γ-32P]ATP. Initially, in vitro kinase reactions were stopped with sample buffer and run on 4–20% gradient minigels. Phosphorylation of TTP could also be visualized by gel shift on minigels when separation times were extended so as to run lower molecular weight species off the gel. Details are provided in the figure legends. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Lysates—NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. BHK cells were grown similarly, substituting 5% fetal bovine serum for calf serum. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) under normal serum conditions, essentially as directed by the manufacturer using 32 μg of DNA/15-cm dish (16 μg of TTP and either 16 μg of MK2 or pCDNA3.1 plasmids). Post-transfection (∼24 h), the cells were treated as described in the figure legends. Cell lysates were made as described (23Poteet-Smith C.E. Smith J.A. Lannigan D.A. Freed T.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22135-22138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, at 4 °C, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 μm PefaB-lock (Roche Applied Science), 200 μm Na3VO4, and 1 μm microcystin LR. The lysates were either processed immediately or quick frozen in liquid N2 for later use. Immunoprecipitation Using Magnetic Beads—Tosylated Dynabeads® (Dynal Biotech) were covalently attached to pure monoclonal Myc antibody as directed by the manufacturer. Conjugated anti-Myc IgG beads (1 × 108 of Dynabeads®) were incubated with cleared cellular lysates for 2 h. After incubation, the beads were magnetically concentrated, and the lysate was removed. The beads were washed three times with PBS (Invitrogen) or for higher stringency once with PBS, twice with PBS containing 0.1 m NaCl, and once with PBS. A portion of the immunoprecipitate was taken for Western blot analysis, and the remainder was washed three times with 0.1 m NH4HCO3. These NH4HCO3-washed samples were then subjected to digestion and MS/MS analysis (see below). Sample Preparation for Analysis with Mass Spectrometry—After experimentation with gel-based methods that were found to be problematic (see “Results” and “Discussion”), we devised a new scheme to be termed “on-beads” digestion. Kinase reactions were terminated by adding cold GSH-Sepharose beads (20 μl of a 1:1 slurry), placing the tubes on ice, and washing several times with cold PBS to remove ATP (necessary for immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)). ATP removal was monitored for sufficiency by following the loss of 32P from a parallel hot reaction. Then the beads were washed three times with 100 mm NH4HCO3 and resuspended in 50 μl. Bound TTP was reduced with dithiothreitol (5 mm final, for 1 h at 51 °C) followed by iodoacetamide alkylation (15 mm final, 45 min at room temperature, dark). Sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was then added (1:20 ratio) with agitation for 12 h at room temperature. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, where acetic acid was used to lower the pH to 3.5. To generate samples for in vivo phosphorylation, the above on-beads digestion procedure was repeated for the TTP immmunoprecipitated with Dynabeads®, except sample reduction and alkylation were omitted (C18) to minimize antibody digestion. Also, the digestion time was reduced to 6 h for the same reason. Mass Spectrometry—The samples were analyzed by reverse phase nanoflow HPLC micro-ESI tandem mass spectrometry on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ™ Deca or XP ion trap (San Jose, CA) operating in either data-dependent or targeted mode. IMAC was performed according to Ref. 24Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, except the peptides were not reacted to form methyl esters, and the elution was done with 7 μl of 500 mm ascorbic acid. A gradient consisting of 0–60% B in 50 min, 60–100% B in 10 min (A = 100 mm acetic acid (Sigma) in water, B = 70% acetonitrile (Mallinkrodt), 100 mm acetic acid in water) was used to elute peptides from the reverse phase column to the mass spectrometer through an integrated electrospray emitter tip with a flow rate of ∼60 nl/min. Spectra were acquired with the instrument operating in the data-dependent mode throughout the HPLC gradient. In this mode, every ∼10 s, the instrument cycled through acquisition of a full-scan mass spectrum and five MS/MS spectra (3-Da window; precursor m/z ±1.5 Da, collision energy set to 35%, dynamic exclusion time of 1 min) recorded sequentially on the five most abundant ions present in the initial MS scan. For the in vivo KD and WT MK2 samples, analysis was performed in the data-dependent mode and run in duplicate. Because this sample was more complex than the in vitro sample, the gradient was changed to 0–15% B in 7 min, 15–25% B in 20 min, 25–60% B in 35 min, and 60–100% B in 10 min. This allowed for better resolution of the TTP peptides. In addition, these particular in vivo samples were subjected to a time-segmented targeted analysis in order to obtain the most data points per peptide peak of interest. Four peptides and their corresponding phosphorylated forms were chosen for this analysis. In targeted mode, the instrument was instructed prior to the run to repeat a cycle consisting of a full MS scan followed by a targeted MS/MS scan of the (M + 2H)2+ ion for each pair of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides based on their retention times (collision energy set to 35%) (see Fig. 6C). Peptide Identification—All MS/MS spectra acquired were searched against either a GST- or Myc-TTP protein database by using the SEQUEST algorithm (25Eng J. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5444) Google Scholar). Search parameters included a differential modification of +80 Da (presence or absence of phosphate) on serine, threonine, or tyrosine and a static modification of +57 Da (alkylated Cys for the in vitro analysis only). All possible enzymatic cleavage sites were considered. Peptide hits were manually confirmed. Calculations—Estimated stoichiometries were calculated by dividing the sum of the area under the curve from the phosphopeptide in all of its charge states and modified forms by the total peptide signal. In a single sample, this is an approximation, because phosphopeptides and their nonphosphorylated forms generally do not ionize with the same efficiency. In addition, we estimated changes in stoichiometry of site phosphorylation by ratios of the estimated stoichiometries. Provided that this comparison is confined to the same phospho- and dephosphopeptide in the two conditions, we can make direct comparisons of the relative change in stoichiometry between two conditions with greater confidence. Selective Activation of GST-MK2Δ3B by p38α in E. coli—To activate MK2Δ3B, we created a GST-MK2Δ3B expression plasmid with a p15A origin of replication (see “Experimental Procedures”) that would be compatible with the bicistronic vector expressing both constitutively active MEK1 and WT ERK2 (17Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This co-expression system was used previously in our laboratory to activate GST-RSK CTD (21Chrestensen C.A. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27733-27741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and ERK2 has been reported to activate MK2 (26Ben-Levy R. Leighton I.A. Doza Y.N. Attwood P. Morrice N. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5920-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For this reason, we co-expressed MK2Δ3B with active ERK2, but this resulted in no activation of MK2Δ3B. The two proteins also showed no detectable interaction, demonstrated by lack of ERK2 retention on the affinity column (Fig. 1A, panels 1–4). We designed a new bicistronic plasmid expressing constitutively active HA-MEK6 and WT His-tagged p38α. When MK2Δ3B is expressed in E. coli with active p38α produced from this bicistronic plasmid, the kinase cascade was reconstituted. MK2Δ3B was phosphorylated, demonstrated by reduced mobility of the protein in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1, A and B) and increased peptide kinase activity (Fig. 1C). In contrast to ERK2, p38α was retained on the affinity column, and binding to GST-MK2Δ3B was disrupted by washes with 2 m LiCl, consistent with an electrostatic interaction (Fig. 1A, panels 5 and 6). Phosphorylated MK2Δ3B is dramatically more active than the mutant MK2EEΔ3B (Fig. 1C). To identify sites in MK2Δ3B whose phosphorylation was induced by p38α in E. coli, a tryptic digest of the activated, purified GST-MK2Δ3B was analyzed with liquid chromatography MS/MS. Phosphorylation of two of three Ser/Thr-Pro sites, at Thr222, Ser272, and Thr334 in human MK2, are required for activation (26Ben-Levy R. Leighton I.A. Doza Y.N. Attwood P. Morrice N. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5920-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thr222 is within the activation loop, Ser272 is located in the C-lobe of the kinase domain (27Meng W. Swenson L.L. Fitzgibbon M.J. Hayakawa K. Ter Haar E. Behrens A.E. Fulghum J.R. Lippke J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37401-37405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and Thr334 is adjacent to an autoinhibitory helix. Our analysis showed that the equivalent three sites are phosphorylated on MK2Δ3B activated by p38α in E. coli (data not shown). Phosphorylation at the equivalent of Thr338, a presumed autophosphorylation site in human MK2 (26Ben-Levy R. Leighton I.A. Doza Y.N. Attwood P. Morrice N. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5920-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), was also detected in the purified active enzyme. These same sites were not detectably phosphorylated in MK2Δ3B co-expressed with active ERK2 (data not shown). MK2Δ3B Phosphorylates Recombinant GST-TTP—GST-TTP protein was phosphorylated by MK2Δ3B in a time-dependent manner similarly to the known in vivo substrate HSP27, whereas GST alone was either minimally or not at all phosphorylated (Fig. 2A; data not shown). MK2 phosphorylation sites in TTP were initially analyzed using peptides recovered from silver-stained SDS-PAGE bands of phosphorylated TTP (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). An example of a gel run for this analysis is shown in Fig. 2B. Phosphorylation of TTP causes a mobility shift of TTP that can be resolved with increased electrophoresis. Analyses of TTP from gels were problematic due to multiple phosphorylated bands, co-migration of the most gel-shifted band with bovine serum albumin, and poor recovery that precluded IMAC to identify minor sites. On-beads Digestion of TTP Increases Both Coverage and Recovery—To resolve these problems, we devised on-beads digestion methodologies of general utility for future MS/MS analyses. We purified the GST-TTP from the kinase reaction with GSH-Sepharose beads. While still bound, TTP was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. TTP peptides in the supernatant were analyzed by reverse phase and IMAC MS/MS (Fig. 3). Sample from on-beads digestion was found to have increased protein coverage (70%) compared with the in-gel digested sample (49%). On-beads digestion allows for better protein recovery, eliminates the possibility of selection bias in excision of gel bands, and provides more material for repeated analyses from a given sample. Ser52 and Ser178 Are Major in Vitro Sites for MK2—Reverse phase MS/MS (Fig. 3) allowed us to compare m/z intensities for both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides and to calculate an estimate of the percentage of TTP phosphorylated at a particular residue of interest (Table I). The ability to enrich for phosphopeptides on an Fe3+ POROS 20 IMAC column (Fig. 3) significantly increased our ability to detect phosphopeptides, allowing us to identify four additional in vitro phosphorylation sites. The calculated percentage of phosphorylation from the reverse phase analysis corresponds well with peptide intensity signals from the IMAC analysis. Because these calculations of stoichiometry are semiquantitative, we will describe the TTP residues we have defined as sites of MK2Δ3B phosphorylation as “major” and “minor” phosphosites.Table ISummary of in vitro MK2 phosphorylation sites on TTPPhosphopeptideSignal for nonphosphorylated C18aThe signals for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides are the sum of peak intensities for all detected charge states.

https://openalex.org/W2148331882,"Ageing is associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, a deficit in force generation, an increased susceptibility to contraction-induced injury, and a permanent force deficit following severe injury. Muscles of young mice adapt rapidly following exercise by an increase in the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), whereas muscles of old mice show a severely diminished response. We hypothesized that overexpression of HSP70 in muscle throughout life would reduce age-related changes in function. The maximum tetanic force of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of adult and old wild-type (WT) and HSP70 overexpressor transgenic mice was determined. EDL muscles were subjected to damaging lengthening contractions and the ability to generate force was assessed for up to 28 days following the contractions. Overexpression of HSP70 in muscles of old transgenic mice prevented the specific force deficit observed in muscles of old WT mice. The complete recovery of muscles of old HSP70 transgenic mice by 14 days following the contraction protocol was in contrast to the 44% force deficit, which remained in muscles of old WT mice at 28 days following the protocol. These data indicate that a diminished production of HSP70 in muscles of old mammals has a major effect on age-related functional deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2070297535,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is emerging as an important cytoprotective enzyme system in a variety of injury models. To optimize future therapeutic applications of HO-1, it is necessary to delineate the precise functions and mechanisms as well as modes of externally regulating HO-1 expression. Investigations have been limited by difficulties with the generation of HO-1 null mice and the lack of specific HO-1 inhibitors. Lung ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury is the inciting event in acute lung failure following transplantation, surgery, and shock. To study the function of HO-1 in I-R-induced lung injury, we designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences that effectively suppress HO-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo in an organ-specific manner. In this study we show that there is enhanced apoptosis, via increased Fas expression and caspase 3 activity, in the presence of HO-1 siRNA in endothelial cells and mouse lung during I-R injury, whereas HO-1 overexpression attenuates apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that lung-specific siRNA delivery can be achieved by intranasal administration without the need for viral vectors or transfection agents in vivo, thereby obviating potential concerns for toxicity if siRNA technology is to have clinical application in the future.

HO-1 expression is induced in multiple cell types and organs in response to injury. This induction is postulated to have protective properties; however, the mechanisms remain elusive (1Otterbein L.E.

HO-2 is primarily constitutive and has been found to be important in the central nervous system (5Dore S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Synthetic heme analogues such as protoporphyrins that competitively inhibit the activity of all HO isoforms are commonly used to study HO-1 function but are limited by the lack of specificity and can have the paradoxical effect of up-regulating HO-1 protein expression (6Jozkowicz A.

The recent emergence of siRNA technology to silence mammalian genes allows for highly specific analysis of gene function and has potential clinical application. Among the limited number of reports on siRNA administration in vivo, all use systemic delivery, transfection chemicals, or viral vectors, and none have been organ-specific to the best of our knowledge (9Hasuwa H.

We demonstrate that intranasal siRNA delivery, without a vector or transfection agent, has lung specificity and that HO-1 potently regulates lung apoptosis. Lung-specific siRNA will not only be a useful tool to study gene function but may have therapeutic applications for a wide range of lung diseases. Furthermore, HO siRNA may become the basis of modulating severe hyperbilirubinemia of newborns and the severe jaundice of Crigler-Najjar type I patients where there is excessive bilirubin formation and for whom specific therapy does not currently exist. PAEC Anoxia-Reoxygenation (A-R) and Mouse Lung I-R Models— Primary rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 0.1% gentamycin (Invitrogen). Dr. Troy Stevens, University of Alabama, generously provided the PAEC. All data using PAEC were collected before passage 20. PAEC were exposed to anoxia (95% N2, 5% CO2) in a sealed modular chamber (Billup-Rothberg, Del Mar, CA) with continuous monitoring and automated adjustments to maintain <0.5% O2 (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY) for 24 h, as described previously (14Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For anoxia-reoxygenation, the media were changed after 24 h of anoxia, and cells were exposed to normoxia at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 1 h. For mouse lung I-R, after an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (180 mg/kg of body weight), the mice were intubated via tracheostomy and ventilated with a Harvard ventilator (respiratory rate, 120/min; tidal volume, 0.5 cm). A left hilar clamp was placed for 30 min of unilateral ischemia to the left lung, and the clamp was then released for 2 h of reperfusion as described previously (14Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All of the mouse experiments used male C57Bl/6J mice at 6-8 weeks of age weighing 20-25 g as purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University approved this protocol in accordance with their guidelines. siRNA Design and Preparation—The design of siRNAs was based on the characterization of siRNA by Elbashir et al. (15Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2658) Google Scholar, 16Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). siRNAs were synthesized in 2′-deprotected, duplexed, desalted, and purified form by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sense and antisense strands of rat and mouse HO-1 siRNA were: sequence 1, 5′-AAGGACAUGGCCUUCUGGUAUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUACCAGAAGGCCAUGUCCUUdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 2, 5′-AAUGAACACUCUGGAGAUGACdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUCAUCUCCAGAGUGUUCAUUdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 3, 5′-AAGACCAGAGUCCCUCACAGAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCUGUGAGGGACUCUGGUCUUdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 4, 5′-AAGCCACACAGCACUAUGUAAdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UUACAUAGUGCUGUGUGGCUUdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 5, 5′-AAGCCGAGAAUGCUGAGUUCAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UGAACUCAGCAUUCUCGGCUUdTdT-3′ (antisense). The sense and antisense strands of human heme oxygenase-1 siRNA were: sequence 1, 5′-GGAGAUUGAGCGCAACAAGdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CUUGUUGCGCUAAAUCUCCdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 2, 5′-UGAUAGAAGAGGCCAAGACdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GUCUUGGCCUCUUCUAUCAdTdT-3′ (antisense); sequence 3, 5′-CUGCGUUCCUGCUCAACAUdTdT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUGUUGAGCAGGAACGCAGdTdT-3′ (antisense). 5′-Biotin-labeled rodent HO-1 siRNA sequence 4 and nonspecific siRNA scrambled duplex (sense, 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGAAUCCUACAAAGCGCGCdTdT-3′) were also synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. Nonspecific 5′-fluorescein-labeled siRNA (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′) was synthesized by Qiagen (Germantown, MD) and used to determine transfection efficiency. Transfection of siRNA Duplexes in Vitro and in Vivo—PAEC were seeded into 6- or 12-well plates 1 day prior to transfection using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. At the time of transfection with siRNA, the cells were 50-60% confluent. Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used as the transfection agent, and cells were then incubated for 6 h. Next, 30% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’ medium was added to reach a final concentration of 10% fetal bovine serum in the wells. Cells were exposed to A-R 24 h after transfection. For in vivo studies, each mouse was anesthetized with methoxyflurane and then given intranasal HO-1 siRNA (2 mg/kg of body weight) or equivalent doses of nonspecific control siRNA duplex or recombinant adenovirus containing rat HO-1 cDNA (Ad-HO-1, a generous gift from Dr. Leo Otterbein, University of Pittsburgh) or the recombinant adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene (Ad-X-LacZ, purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech) in a volume of 50 μl. Generation of Stable PAEC Cell Line Overexpressing Human HO-1— The human HO-1-expressing replication-deficient retrovirus vector LSN-HHO-1 has been described previously (17Quan S. Yang L. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12203-12208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Yang L. Quan S. Abraham N.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L127-L133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing PA317 packaging cells were used for transfection and preparation of viral particles. Individual G418-resistant clones were selected, and initial viral titer assays were measured by infecting NIH-3T3 cells as described previously (18Yang L. Quan S. Abraham N.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L127-L133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PA317/LSN-HHO-1 and the empty viral control cells, PA317/LXSN, were grown until subconfluence was reached. The supernatants were harvested and used to infect PAEC. After selection with G418 a stably transfected cell line of PAEC overexpressing human HO-1, designated LSN/HO-1, and a retroviral vector control cell line, LXSN, were obtained. Western Blot Analysis—As described previously (14Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) protein was extracted from cell or lung tissue lysates, electrotransferred, and immunoblotted with monoclonal HO-1 antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). Detection was performed with a Phototope-horseradish peroxidase Western detection system (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Equivalent sample loading was confirmed by stripping membranes with blot restore membrane rejuvenation solution (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) and reprobed with anti-β-tubulin antibody. Apoptosis Assays—We used a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to detect annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate labeling (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, after PAEC were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), a solution containing 1 × 105 cells was transferred to a 5-ml tube, and 5 μl each of annexin V and propidium iodide were added. Binding buffer was then added to each tube and analyzed by FACS (BD Biosciences). The annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate signal was detected by FL1 (fluorescein isothiocyanate detector) at 518 nm, and the propidium iodide signal was detected by FL2 (phycoerythrin fluorescence detector) at 620 nm. Mouse lung sections were subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (19Zhang X.

Fas Expression and Caspase 3 Activity—For Fas expression PAEC were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing Fas (1:100 dilution) or control rat IgG (1:100 dilution) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and incubated on ice for 45 min. The cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing anti-rat fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:50 dilution) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde prior to FACS analysis. Caspase 3 activity was measured with colorimetric assays using the CaspACE assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). PAEC lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with colorimetric substrate, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Ac-DEVD-pNA). The release of p-nitroanilide from Ac-DEVD-pNA was measured at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. and analyzed by Student’s t test. The significant difference was accepted at the p < 0.05 level. HO-1 siRNA Inhibits A-R-induced HO-1 Protein Expression in PAEC—We have shown previously (14Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that mouse lungs subjected to I-R injury or endothelial cells exposed to A-R induce HO-1 expression. However, the function of HO-1 during lung I-R injury is unknown. To delineate the role of HO-1 in lung I-R injury, we sought to knock down HO-1 induction in vitro and in vivo using HO-1 siRNA. We designed five siRNA sequences (1Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Otterbein L.E. Kolls J.K. Mantell L.L. Cook J.L. Alam J. Choi A.M.

Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar), and transfected them into PAEC. We determined that sequence 4 was the most effective in inhibiting A-R-induced HO-1 protein expression (Fig. 1A). The silencing effect of sequence 4 on HO-1 protein induction during A-R was dose-dependent, whereas incremental doses of nonspecific siRNA had no effect on HO-1 expression (Fig. 1B). Using 5′-biotin-labeled HO-1 siRNA, we demonstrated the efficient entry of the siRNA into PAEC as denoted by the diffuse brown staining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). We also quantitated transfection efficiency to be greater than 88%, using 5′-fluorescein-labeled siRNA detection by FACS (data not shown). All subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies utilized sequence 4 HO-1 siRNA. HO-1 siRNA Inhibits I-R-induced HO-1 Protein Expression in Mouse Lung—We tested the efficacy of the HO-1 siRNA in the mouse lung by intranasal administration. A time course of HO-1 siRNA delivery prior to subjecting the mouse to lung I-R injury shows that HO-1 siRNA has maximal effect in attenuating HO-1 protein induction if given 16 h prior to I-R injury (Fig. 2A, lane 5) and persists for at least 72 h (data not shown). Therefore, intranasal HO-1 siRNA was given for 16 h prior to I-R lung injury in the subsequent mouse experiments. Lung I-R injury causes HO-1 protein induction in other organs such as the kidney, liver, and heart, but intranasal siRNA administration is lung-specific (Fig. 2B, lane 3). As expected, intranasal administration of nonspecific siRNA, at the same dose, had no effect on I-R-induced HO-1 expression in the lung or other organs (Fig. 2B, lane 4). We confirmed lung delivery of the siRNA by intranasally administering a 5′-biotin-labeled HO-1 siRNA that confers a brown stain to cells that have incorporated the siRNA. We detected brown-stained cells diffusely in the airway and lung parenchyma as early as 4 h and persisting to 16 h (Fig. 2C). HO-1 Overexpression in PAEC and Mouse Lung—To contrast the effects of HO-1 siRNA with HO-1 overexpression, we used a human HO-1 gene in a replication-defective retroviral vector, which has been described previously (18Yang L. Quan S. Abraham N.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L127-L133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to stably transfect PAEC. We achieved significantly increased HO-1 protein expression in the HO-1 overexpressors (LSN/HO-1) compared with empty vector transfection (LXSN) in room air (Fig. 3A). We used intranasal administration of rat HO-1 adenovirus (Ad-HO-1) to achieve HO-1 overexpression in mouse lungs. We determined HO-1 protein levels at 48 h, 72 h, 5 days, and 1 week after administration of Ad-HO-1 and observed increased HO-1 protein after 48-72 h (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, the empty vector (Ad-X-LacZ) had no effect on HO-1 induction in the mouse lung (Fig. 3B, lower panel, lane 3). To effectively silence the human HO-1 gene in the stably transfected PAEC, we designed three human HO-1 siRNA sequences (1Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Otterbein L.E. Kolls J.K. Mantell L.L. Cook J.L. Alam J. Choi A.M. J. Clin.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6798-6802Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments revealed that all three siRNA sequences, especially at higher doses, inhibited HO-1 expression in HO-1 overexpressing PAEC if given for 24-72 h (Fig. 3C). At 72 h of siRNA transfection, lower doses (300 nm) of siRNA appeared to be less effective in suppressing HO-1 protein, which is likely because of siRNA degradation. Sequence 1 at 600 nm for 24 h was used in subsequent experiments with human HO-1-overexpressing PAEC (LSN/HO-1). HO-1 Modulates Apoptosis in PAEC and Mouse Lung during A-R and I-R Injury, Respectively—Apoptosis is a pivotal mechanism of I-R-induced organ injury (21Stammberger U. Gaspert A. Hillinger S. Vogt P.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4802-4806Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We demonstrated the biological effect of HO-1 on apoptosis in PAEC during A-R and in mouse lung during I-R. When we knocked down HO-1 expression in PAEC with siRNA directed against rodent HO-1, there was a dramatic increase in A-R-induced apoptosis in PAEC (quantitated by FACS analysis) to 33.8 ± 2.2% during anoxia alone and 41.3 ± 1.4% during A-R compared with wild type controls and cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). Given that the absence of HO-1 induction during A-R was deleterious, we expected that HO-1 overexpression would attenuate apoptosis. HO-1-overexpressing cells (LSN/HO-1) subjected to A-R exhibited significantly less apoptosis (8.6 ± 0.2%) during A-R compared with wild type controls and cells that express empty vector (LXSN) (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 4, and 5). This effect on apoptosis appeared to be specific to HO-1, because we were able to reverse the anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1 overexpression by introducing HO-1 siRNA directed against the human HO-1-overexpressing vector (Fig. 4A, lane 6). However, given that the HO-1 siRNA was directed against the exogenously transfected human HO-1 gene and considering our previous demonstration that there was endogenous induction of rat HO-1 in PAEC (a rat cell line) during A-R injury (14Zhang X. Bedard E.L. Potter R. Zhong R. Alam J. Choi A.M. Lee P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L815-L829Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we proceeded to simultaneously inhibit both rodent and human HO-1. Notably, the presence of both rodent and human siRNA led to more apoptosis than human siRNA alone (41.4 ± 2.4 versus 26.8 ± 0.7%) (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively). This was likely because of the fact that even in the presence of human siRNA, which only silenced the transfected human HO-1 gene expression, endogenous HO-1 induction in the PAEC overexpressors continued to have an anti-apoptotic effect. Only when both the exogenous human HO-1 and the endogenous HO-1 induction were silenced did apoptosis reach the levels seen in wild type PAEC treated with rodent HO-1 siRNA (Fig. 4A, lane 3). Nonspecific siRNA transfection at equivalent doses had no effect on A-R-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrated the species specificity of the siRNA sequences and highlighted the anti-apoptotic effect of HO-1. We proceeded to correlate our in vitro findings with in vivo studies by subjecting mice to lung I-R injury and assessing TUNEL staining. HO-1 siRNA significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared with naïve mice, mice subjected to I-R alone, and mice with nonspecific siRNA subjected to I-R (Fig. 4B, A-D). On the other hand, mice that overexpressed HO-1 in the lung (Ad-HO-1, Fig. 4B, F) exhibited significantly less TUNEL staining during lung I-R compared with mice subjected to I-R alone and mice given empty vector (Ad-X-LacZ) (Fig. 4B, B and E, respectively). The quantitation of TUNEL positive cells paralleled the PAEC results in that HO-1 siRNA in vivo caused significantly increased lung apoptosis, whereas HO-1 overexpression with intranasal administration of HO-1 adenoviral vector decreased apoptosis during lung I-R (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data indicate that in both endothelial cells and mouse lung, HO-1 expression has profound anti-apoptotic properties during A-R and I-R injury, respectively. HO-1 Modulates Apoptosis via Fas and Caspase 3-dependent Mechanisms in PAEC during A-R Injury—We have demonstrated previously (24Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that Fas/FasL expression and caspase 3 activity are increased in PAEC during A-R. To delineate potential mechanisms of HO-1-modulated apoptosis, we investigated the effects of HO-1 siRNA and overexpression on Fas and caspase 3 expression in PAEC during A-R. Fig. 5A is a representative FACS analysis of Fas expression in PAEC during A-R, which demonstrated that HO-1 siRNA increased A-R-induced Fas expression, whereas stable HO-1 overexpression decreased Fas expression. An antibody to rat IgG was used as a negative control. Fig. 5B is a graphical representation of three independent FACS analyses of Fas expression. The y axis depicts the percentage of cells compared with the total that express Fas during the various conditions. In the presence of HO-1 siRNA (Fig. 5B, lane 3), there was significantly increased Fas expression (50.2 ± 2.3%) compared with the wild type control cells (31.6 ± 0.9%) and cells transfected with nonspecific siRNA (30.4 ± 1.6%) during A-R. However, in the presence of stable HO-1 overexpression using the human HO-1 gene (LSN/HO-1), there was a dramatic attenuation of A-R-induced Fas expression to 16.9 ± 1.3% compared with cells stably transfected with empty vector (LXSN) (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 5). We were able to reverse the effects of HO-1 overexpression on Fas expression by transfecting the HO-1 overexpressors with siRNA directed against the human HO-1 vector (Fig. 5B, lane 6). In parallel with our apoptosis studies in PAEC (Fig. 4A), the silencing of both the human HO-1 overexpression vector and the endogenous rodent HO-1 induction in PAEC resulted in even greater Fas expression in PAEC during A-R (Fig. 5B, lane 7). In addition to Fas, HO-1 also modulated caspase 3 activity during A-R. HO-1 overexpression significantly attenuated A-R-induced caspase 3 activity in PAEC (1.6 ± 0.1%) (Fig. 5C, lane 5). On the other hand, HO-1 siRNA, especially if directed against both the exogenous human HO-1 vector and endogenous rodent HO-1, dramatically increased caspase 3 activity in PAEC during A-R (4.6 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 5C, lane 7).Fig. 5HO-1 siRNA increased whereas HO-1 overexpression decreased Fas expression and caspase 3 activity in PAEC during A-R. PAEC were untransfected (control), transfected with nonspecific siRNA (nonspecific siRNA), transfected with HO-1 siRNA directed against rodent siRNA (siRNA), stably transfected with empty retroviral vector (LXSN), stably transfected with human HO-1-overexpressing retroviral vector (LSN/HO-1), HO-1 overexpressors transfected with HO-1 siRNA directed against human HO-1 (LSN/HO-1/Human siRNA), or HO-1 overexpressors transfected with HO-1 siRNAs directed against both human and rodent HO-1 (LSN/HO-1/Double siRNA), and then the cells were exposed to room air (RA), 24-h anoxia (24A) or 24-h anoxia followed by 1-h reoxygenation (A-R).

HO-1 overexpression by gene transfer successfully attenuated I-R-induced apoptosis and may potentially have therapeutic value in I-R-induced lung injury for which specific therapies do not currently exist. Lung I-R injury is critical to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury during lung transplantation/surgery, pulmonary embolism, and re-expansion pulmonary edema. The inhibition of apoptosis during I-R injury in other organ systems has been shown to be cytoprotective and to promote organ survival (25Chanalaris A. Sun Y. Latchman D.S. Stephanou A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 257-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Yaoita H. Ogawa K. Maehara K. Maruyama Y. Circulation. 1998; 97: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying genes that modulate I-R-induced apoptosis would have potential therapeutic relevance to a variety of organ systems. In addition, we demonstrate that lung-specific siRNA delivery, without the presence of viral vectors or transfection agents, is biologically effective and may have significant implications for future therapeutic interventions. Our data show that the transfer of exogenous human HO-1 cDNA to endothelial cells or adenovirally-mediated HO-1 overexpression in mouse lung dramatically attenuates A-R- and I-R-induced apoptosis. Conversely, specific knockdown of HO-1 expression using siRNA in vitro and in vivo significantly increased A-R- and I-R-induced apoptosis, respectively. Furthermore, we use HO-1 overexpression vectors and HO-1 siRNA to demonstrate that HO-1 specifically modulates endothelial cell apoptosis by attenuating A-R-induced Fas expression and caspase 3 activity. Thus far, most investigations into the consequences of HO-1 deficiency have utilized synthetic heme analogues such as the protoporphyrins, which are not specific for HO-1 and have the paradoxical effect of inducing HO-1 expression (6Jozkowicz A. Dulak J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2003; 50: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 7Sardana M.K. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Reports using HO-1-deficient mice have been limited, likely because of breeding difficulties, and dominant-negative constructs have not been effective. The use of HO-1 siRNA will greatly facilitate the precise identification of the HO-1 gene function. We show that HO-1 siRNA has biologic functions both in vitro as well as in vivo and can be effective in an organ-specific manner. RNA interference mediated by siRNA is a powerful technology that allows the silencing of genes with great specificity and potency. Although it is used extensively in plants, nematodes, and Drosophila to determine gene function, until recently RNA interference was not applicable in mammalian cells. The discovery that transfection of short 21-23-nucleotide siRNA into mammalian cells specifically interferes with gene expression and does not induce nonspecific responses opened this technique to the study of mammalian gene function and may have potential therapeutic applications (20Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8015) Google Scholar). There are increasing reports on the use of siRNA in vitro (27Shen C. Buck A.K. Liu X. Winkler M. Reske S.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deglon N. Pralong W. Aebischer P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 2197-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However the in vivo use of siRNA has been limited. Researchers have found that systemic delivery of caspase 8 siRNA or Fas siRNA into mice protects against liver injury (13Zender L. Hutker S. Liedtke C. Tillmann H.L. Zender S. Mundt B. Waltemathe M. Gosling T. Flemming P. Malek N.P. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kuhnel F. Kubicka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 31Song E. Lee S.K. Wang J. Ince N. Ouyang N. Min J. Chen J. Shankar P. Lieberman J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Similarly, McCaffrey et al. (32McCaffrey A.P. Nakai H. Pandey K. Huang Z. Salazar F.H. Xu H. Wieland S.F. Marion P.L. Kay M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) showed that the administration of hepatitis B virus siRNA effectively inhibited hepatitis B virus replication in cultured cells and mouse liver, indicating that siRNA could be useful in the treatment of viral liver diseases. Subretinal siRNA can also be achieved using a chemical transfection agent (11Reich S.J. Fosnot J. Kuroki A. Tang W. Yang X. Maguire A.M. Bennett J. Tolentino M.J. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 210-216PubMed Google Scholar), and transgenic approaches as well as viral constructs have been used to deliver siRNA in vivo (9Hasuwa H. Kaseda K. Einarsdottir T. Okabe M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). The reports thus far of siRNA in vivo utilize systemic delivery of the siRNA and/or require the use of a transfection chemical or viral vector, which potentially raises concerns for toxicity if used clinically. Furthermore, although systemically delivered siRNA can be detected in multiple organs, including the lung, it is clear that the biologic activity of systemically administered siRNA is not equally effective in all organs. For example, systemic injection of caspase 8 siRNA, although detected in most organs, inhibited Fas-induced liver apoptosis but not lung or kidney apoptosis (13Zender L. Hutker S. Liedtke C. Tillmann H.L. Zender S. Mundt B. Waltemathe M. Gosling T. Flemming P. Malek N.P. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kuhnel F. Kubicka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7797-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In our present study, intranasal administration of HO-1 siRNA, in the absence of transfection agents, had significant lung-specific effects in modulating apoptosis. We observed the presence of HO-1 siRNA diffusely in the lung airway and alveoli. In the near future the use of tissue-specific siRNA may become feasible (with polymerase II rather than polymerase III promoters), opening up the possibility of targeting specific lung cell types. The ability to apply siRNA in an organ or cell-specific manner will be of paramount interest not only for lung diseases but also for a broad range of clinical processes."

Holbrook N. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). However, unchecked and excessive production of ROS may result in severe damage to cellular components including DNA, proteins, and lipids, causing oxidative stress or injury. Oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of human diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (1Martindale J. Holbrook N. J. Cell.

Thus, understanding how cellular signaling pathways respond to oxidative insults such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may lead to novel strategies for therapeutic interventions. Accumulating evidence suggests that apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) plays a pivotal role in mediating the H2O2-induced stress response. ASK1 is a multifunctional serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes, including cell differentiation and apoptosis (2Takeda K. Matsuzawa A.

These lines of evidence suggest that ASK1 is a key player in apoptotic signaling, and in particular, ASK1 may function as a pivotal mediator of H2O2-induced stress response. However, the molecular mechanism by which ASK1 transmits H2O2 signals remains a subject of intense investigation. Because of its important role in cell death signaling, the activity of ASK1 is tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation, oligomerization, and protein-protein interactions. Phosphorylation of ASK1 at Ser-845 appears to be required for activity because dephosphorylation at this site by PP5 leads to ASK1 inactivation (13Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser-83 by Akt/protein kinase B, on the other hand, attenuates ASK1 activity (14Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that intramolecular interaction, probably between the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of ASK1, may be required to maintain ASK1 in its inactive state (15Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), whereas oligomerization of its COOH-terminal domains is correlated with ASK1 activation (6Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The most commonly observed means of ASK1 regulation, however, is through protein-protein interactions. Numerous proteins have been shown to bind ASK1 to exert their regulatory function. For example, binding of TRAF2 (16Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) or Daxx (15Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) promotes ASK1 function, whereas the kinase and proapoptotic activities of ASK1 are inhibited by many other associated proteins, including reduced thioredoxin (7Saitoh M.

A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It seems probable that ASK1 is suppressed from promoting apoptosis under normal survival or proliferative conditions by specific phosphorylation and regulated protein-protein interactions but becomes proapoptotic when suppression is relieved. One mechanism that mediates the H2O2 effect appears to involve redox-regulated dissociation of ASK1 from bound thioredoxin, leading to ASK1 oligomerization and activation (6Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H.

The inhibitory effect of bound thioredoxin on ASK1, however, may be redox-independent, as shown in an endothelial cell system (23Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Among ASK1 regulatory events, the interaction of ASK1 with 14-3-3 proteins is particularly intriguing because this complex formation is controlled by phosphorylation at Ser-967 (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 belongs to a family of phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-binding molecules that recognize the motif Arg-Ser-X-pSer/pThr-X-Pro or its derivatives (pSer/pThr represents phosphorylated Ser or Thr, and X denotes any amino acid) (24Muslin A.J.

They can bind to many signaling molecules through specific pSer/pThr motifs, including the proapoptotic protein Bad (28Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar) and transcription factor FKLR1 (29Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M. Lin M. Juo P. Hu L. Anderson M. Arden K. Blenis J. Greenberg M. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). In fact, the control of 14-3-3/Bad binding by Akt/protein kinase B represents the first molecular link by which a major survival signaling pathway is coupled to the death machinery (30Datta S. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4920) Google Scholar). Functionally, the 14-3-3·Bad complex formation results in inhibition of Bad-mediated apoptosis (28Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar, 31Datta S.R. Katsov A. Hu L. Petros A. Fesik S.W. Yaffe M.B. Greenberg M.E. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1325-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Through such phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions, 14-3-3 plays an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell proliferation and survival signaling. We have demonstrated previously that 14-3-3 binding to ASK1 through phosphorylated Ser-967 effectively suppresses ASK1-induced apoptosis (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, how upstream signals control Ser-967 phosphorylation and ASK1·14-3-3 association remains elusive. Stress signals may utilize the sensitive kinase and phosphatase signaling network to control ASK1 function, achieving a balanced biological outcome such as cell suicide or survival. In this study, we have examined the dynamic regulation of ASK1 by H2O2 and uncovered a critical link between H2O2 signaling and the phosphorylation status of Ser-967. Our findings define a novel mechanism whereby H2O2 triggers the activity of an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase upstream of ASK1, resulting in dephosphorylation of Ser-967 and subsequent activation of ASK1-mediated stress pathways. Plasmids, Cell Culture, and DNA Transfection—Expression vectors for ASK1 and its mutants have been described (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with fetal bovine serum (10%; Mediatech, Washington, D. C.). Transfection was performed with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reagents—Hydrogen peroxide, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, catalase, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and cyclosporin A were obtained from Sigma. Calyculin and cyclosporin A were diluted in ethanol, and okadaic acid was prepared in methanol. All other reagents were diluted in water. Calf intestinal phosphatase was purchased from New England Biolabs. Generation of Phospho-specific pSer-967 Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing two rabbits with a synthetic phospho-peptide (keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled) corresponding to residues around Ser-967 of human ASK1. From each rabbit, antibodies were purified by protein A and a nonphospho-peptide affinity chromatography (antibodies 2 and 4). The flow-through of non-phosphopeptide chromatography, in which the non-phospho activity was depleted, was collected and applied to a phosphopeptide chromatography for final purification (antibodies 1 and 3). Western Blotting—COS7 cells (4 × 105) were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, prepared in SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) for Western blotting. The enzyme-linked immunoblotting procedures were performed essentially as described previously (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Corresponding secondary antibodies were used against each primary antibody: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for monoclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cross-reacting materials were visualized using the ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Pull-down Assays—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-ASK1 and His6-tagged-14-3-3γ as indicated. 40 h after transfection cells were treated with 1 mm H2O2 and 25 mm aminotriazole and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm PMSF, 60 mm imidazole, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). His6-tagged 14-3-3γ was immobilized on Ni2+-charged iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose 6B beads (33Zhang L. Wang H. Liu D. Liddington R. Fu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13717-13724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE (12.5%) for Western blotting with anti-ASK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-14-3-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of ASK1 was determined essentially as described previously (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 6Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). 40 h after transfection, media were replaced with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without serum for H2O2 treatment. Cells (4 × 105) were lysed with a β-glycerophosphate-containing lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF). After clarification by centrifugation, HA-ASK1 or endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated with anti-ASK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-JNK (Cell Signaling) and protein G-Sepharose. After washing the immunoprecipitates three times with the lysis buffer and once with a kinase assay buffer solution (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,2mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF), they were subjected to kinase assays. To measure the ability of ASK1 to phosphorylate p38, the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of His-tagged MKK6 before adding 2 μg of His-tagged kinase-inactive p38 as described previously (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). For the JNK assay, glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun was used as a substrate (5Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). After resolution on SDS-PAGE (12.5%), phosphorylation of ASK1, c-Jun, or p38 was visualized by a Typhoon PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant software version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Phosphorylation of ASK1 at Ser-967 in Vivo—We have shown previously that Ser-967 of ASK1 is harbored in a critical recognition motif for the pSer/pThr-binding protein 14-3-3 (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this residue enables ASK1 to bind 14-3-3, which leads to suppression of ASK1-induced apoptosis. Thus, Ser-967 of ASK1 may serve as an integration point that couples survival signaling pathways to this death-promoting kinase. To understand how Ser-967 of ASK1 is regulated, we developed antibodies that allow us to monitor the phosphorylation status of this critical site in vivo. Four batches of rabbit antisera were raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Ser-967-containing phosphopeptides from ASK1. Purified antibodies from these sera showed strong cross-reactivity with ASK1/WT expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1A). Two appeared to be specific to the phosphorylated Ser-967 (pSer-967) epitope in ASK1 because they were unable to recognize ASK1/S967A, a mutant of ASK1 which is unphosphorylatable at Ser-967. However, it is possible that the inability of the pSer-967 antibodies to recognize ASK1/S967A might be the result of mutation-induced conformational or structural changes of the epitope. To address this concern, we employed an alternative approach to dephosphorylate Ser-967 by treating ASK1/WT with a broad spectrum protein phosphatase, calf intestinal phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 1B, pSer-967 antibodies failed to recognize dephosphorylated ASK1/WT, confirming the specificity of the antibody for phosphorylated Ser-967. To define the utility of the pSer-967 antibody, we tested its sensitivity. A testament to its usefulness for the monitoring of Ser-967 phosphorylation in vivo, the anti-pSer-967 antibody could recognize pSer-967 when lysate with 0.25 μg of total protein was immunoblotted (Fig. 1C). This level of sensitivity is comparable with that of the pan-ASK1 antibody. Furthermore, antibody titration showed that the phospho-antibody can recognize phosphorylated Ser-967 with a 1:20,000 dilution (Fig. 1D). These experiments demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the antibody for pSer-967 of ASK1, providing us with a powerful tool for monitoring ASK1 phosphorylation under various physiological conditions. ROS Induce Dephosphorylation at Ser-967—The above tests also demonstrate that Ser-967 is phosphorylated in cells under growth conditions in the presence of serum (Fig. 1), which is consistent with its role in cell survival signaling. It is possible that the death promoting function of ASK1 is suppressed under growth conditions but becomes proapoptotic when suppression is relieved. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether the phosphorylation status of Ser-967 is responsive to stress signals. It has been well established that ASK1 plays an important role in the apoptotic response induced by ROS, in particular H2O2 (6Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 7Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 12Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cells derived from ASK1 knock-out mice are resistant to H2O2-induced apoptosis (12Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which ASK1 mediates the ROS effect remains unclear. It is possible that ROS induces ASK1 activation and cell death through dephosphorylation of Ser-967. To test this model, we monitored the in vivo phosphorylation status of Ser-967 in COS7 cells. Indeed, treatment of cells with a high (5 mm), intermediate (1 mm), or low (0.5 mm) dose of H2O2 resulted in marked dephosphorylation of Ser-967 (Fig. 2, A and C). In support of a role of ROS in inducing Ser-967 dephosphorylation, pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a ROS scavenger, effectively blocked the H2O2 effect (Fig. 2B). To explore whether phosphorylation of Ser-967 is a regulated process responsive to varying conditions in the cell, we tested the effects of H2O2 using a prolonged time course that allowed for the metabolic clearance of ROS. COS7 cells expressing ASK1 were treated with a low (0.5 mm) or intermediate (1 mm) dose of H2O2 for various times. We show that the dephosphorylation induced by ROS is reversible, with marked Ser-967 dephosphorylation after 30 min followed by increased phosphorylation as early as 60 min post-treatment (Fig. 2C). This reversibility suggests that phosphorylation at Ser-967 is a dynamic process, presumably regulated by a kinase(s) and phosphatase(s), and could be a major mode of ASK1 regulation. Ser-967 Dephosphorylation Is Correlated with Dissociation of 14-3-3—We discovered previously that ASK1 contains a recognition motif for 14-3-3, Arg-Ser-Ile-pSer967-Leu-Pro, in its COOH-terminal regulatory domain (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). ASK1 and 14-3-3 interact both in vitro and in vivo. Ser-967 was shown to be a critical component of the 14-3-3 interaction site of ASK1, and phosphorylation of this residue was proposed to be a major mode of regulation of 14-3-3 binding to ASK1 (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The availability of the pSer-967-specific antibodies allows us to test this hypothesis by directly monitoring Ser-967 phosphorylation and its relationship to 14-3-3 binding. COS7 cells expressing HA-ASK1 and His6-14-3-3γ were treated for various times with 1 mm H2O2 and 25 mm catalase inhibitor aminotriazole. By inhibiting the primary player in H2O2 degradation with aminotriazole, we were able to increase the longevity of H2O2-induced Ser-967 dephosphorylation. The 14-3-3γ protein complex was pulled down with Ni2+-charged Sepharose beads, and the presence of ASK1 was detected by immunoblotting. Significant dephosphorylation of ASK1 at Ser-967 was observed by 90 min after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3, upper panels). This dephosphorylation was correlated with dissociation of ASK1 from 14-3-3 (Fig. 3, lower panels). Interestingly, coexpression of His6-14-3-3γ with ASK1 appears to delay H2O2-induced Ser-967 dephosphorylation compared with COS7 cells transfected with HA-ASK1 alone (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 2A). The H2O2 signal apparently controls levels of Ser-967 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 association. Ser-967 Dephosphorylation Is Associated with Increased ASK1 Catalytic Activity—We demonstrated previously that disruption of the ASK1/14-3-3 interaction dramatically accelerated ASK1-induced cell death (21Zhang L. Chen J. Fu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8511-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this increased cell death occurred, however, remains unknown. Because the catalytic activity of ASK1 is required for its death promoting function, it is possible that removing 14-3-3 from ASK1 may relieve an inhibitory mechanism, leading to ASK1 activation and the subsequent activation of the JNK and p38 kinases. Thus, having established that Ser-967 dephosphorylation is correlated with dissociation of 14-3-3, we examined whether this H2O2-induced dephosphorylation affects the kinase activity of ASK1. COS7 cells were transfected with HA-ASK1/WT or HA-ASK1/K709R, a kinase-inactive mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2172288938,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is closely involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a highly vascularized solid tumor. Here we show that HBx increases the transcriptional activity and protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it also stimulates angiogenesis. HBx directly interacted with the bHLH/PAS domain of HIF-1alpha but not with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). HBx decreased the binding of pVHL to HIF-1alpha and prevented ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha. In HBx-transgenic mice, HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor were strongly detected in the dysplastic lesion, where HBx was also more highly expressed than in the non-neoplastic region of the liver. An immunohistochemical study showed that microvessels are more abundant in the dysplastic lesion than in the non-neoplastic region. Our data suggest that HBx stabilizes HIF-1alpha and leads to angiogenesis during hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018901423,"Skeletal muscle differentiation is a complex, highly coordinated process that relies on precise temporal gene expression patterns. To better understand this cascade of transcriptional events, we used expression profiling to analyze gene expression in a 12-day time course of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. Cluster analysis specific for time-ordered microarray experiments classified 2895 genes and ESTs with variable expression levels between proliferating and differentiating cells into 22 clusters with distinct expression patterns during myogenesis. Expression patterns for several known and novel genes were independently confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and/or Western blotting and immunofluorescence. MyoD and MEF family members exhibited unique expression kinetics that were highly coordinated with cell-cycle withdrawal regulators. Among genes with peak expression levels during cell cycle withdrawal were Vcam1, Itgb3, Itga5, Vcl, as well as Ptger4, a gene not previously associated with the process of myogenesis. One interesting uncharacterized transcript that is highly induced during myogenesis encodes several immunoglobulin repeats with sequence similarity to titin, a large sarcomeric protein. These data sets identify many additional uncharacterized transcripts that may play important functions in muscle cell proliferation and differentiation and provide a baseline for comparison with C2C12 cells expressing various mutant genes involved in myopathic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2089022581,"We investigated the influences of short-term and lifespan-prolonging long-term caloric restriction (LCR) on gene expression in white adipose tissue (WAT). Over 11,000 genes were examined using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays in four groups of 10- to 11-month-old male C57Bl6 mice that were either fasted for 18 h before death (F), subjected to short-term caloric restriction for 23 days (SCR), or LCR for 9 months and compared with nonfasted control (CO) mice. Only a few transcripts of F and SCR were differentially expressed compared with CO mice. In contrast, 345 transcripts of 6,266 genes found to be expressed in WAT were altered significantly by LCR. The expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism was increased by LCR. Further, many of the shifts in gene expression after LCR are known to occur during adipocyte differentiation. Selected LCR-associated alterations of gene expression were supported by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, histology, and histochemical examinations. Our data provide new insights on the metabolic state associated with aging retardation by LCR."
https://openalex.org/W2034438104,"Human alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (AAG) catalyzes the excision of a broad range of modified bases, protecting the genome from many types of alkylative and oxidative DNA damage. We have investigated how AAG discriminates against normal DNA bases, while accommodating a structurally diverse set of lesioned bases, by measuring the rates of AAG-catalyzed (kst) and spontaneous N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis (knon) for damaged and undamaged DNA oligonucleotides. The rate enhancements for excision of different bases reveal that AAG is most adept at excising the deaminated lesion hypoxanthine (kst/knon = 108), suggesting that enzymatic activity may have evolved in response to this lesion. Comparisons of the rate enhancements for excision of normal and modified purine nucleobases provide evidence that AAG excludes the normal purines via steric clashes with the exocyclic amino groups of adenine and guanine. However, methylated purines are more chemically labile, and only modest rate enhancements are required for their efficient excision. Base flipping also contributes to specificity as destabilized mismatched base pairs are better substrates than stable Watson-Crick pairs, and many of the lesions recognized by AAG are compromised in their ability to base pair. These findings suggest that AAG reconciles a broad substrate tolerance with the biological imperative to avoid normal DNA by excluding normal bases from the active site rather than by specifically recognizing each lesion. Human alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (AAG) catalyzes the excision of a broad range of modified bases, protecting the genome from many types of alkylative and oxidative DNA damage. We have investigated how AAG discriminates against normal DNA bases, while accommodating a structurally diverse set of lesioned bases, by measuring the rates of AAG-catalyzed (kst) and spontaneous N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis (knon) for damaged and undamaged DNA oligonucleotides. The rate enhancements for excision of different bases reveal that AAG is most adept at excising the deaminated lesion hypoxanthine (kst/knon = 108), suggesting that enzymatic activity may have evolved in response to this lesion. Comparisons of the rate enhancements for excision of normal and modified purine nucleobases provide evidence that AAG excludes the normal purines via steric clashes with the exocyclic amino groups of adenine and guanine. However, methylated purines are more chemically labile, and only modest rate enhancements are required for their efficient excision. Base flipping also contributes to specificity as destabilized mismatched base pairs are better substrates than stable Watson-Crick pairs, and many of the lesions recognized by AAG are compromised in their ability to base pair. These findings suggest that AAG reconciles a broad substrate tolerance with the biological imperative to avoid normal DNA by excluding normal bases from the active site rather than by specifically recognizing each lesion. DNA bases undergo spontaneous deamination and can be alkylated by reactive cellular metabolites and environmental mutagens (1Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). These damaged bases can block DNA-templated activities such as replication and transcription and cause mutations during replication. Failure to repair these inevitable modifications of DNA bases could lead to cancer or cell death, and thus, it is not surprising that there is an elaborate cellular machinery for the repair of DNA damage. Most DNA modifications affecting single bases are repaired via the base excision repair pathway. This pathway is initiated by one of many lesion-specific DNA glycosylases that survey the genome for damage and catalyze the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to release the lesioned base and generate an abasic site. In human cells a single enzyme, alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase (AAG, 1The abbreviations used are: AAG, human alkyladenine-DNA glycosylase; P, purine; 2AP, 2-aminopurine; 3MeA, 3-methyladenine; 7MeG, 7-methylguanine; ∈A, 1,N6-ethenoadenine; Hx, hypoxanthine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. also known as methylpurine-DNA glycosylase), is responsible for the recognition and excision of a diverse group of alkylated purine bases, including 3-methyladenine (3MeA), 7-methylguanine (7MeG), and 1-N6-ethenoadenine (∈A) (2Gallagher P.E.

AAG also removes hypoxanthine (Hx) from deoxyinosine-containing DNA, which is formed by the oxidative deamination of adenosine (6Hang B. Singer B. Margison G.P. Elder R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12869-12874Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Miao F. Bouziane M. O'Connor T.R.

A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This broad substrate specificity is unusual because most DNA glycosylases are specific for a single lesion (9Duncan B.K. Enzymes. 1981; 14: 565-586Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is difficult to identify the common structural features of lesioned bases that are recognized by AAG (Fig. 1). The methylated bases 3MeA and 7MeG are positively charged, whereas ∈A and Hx are neutral substrates. ∈A has a larger aromatic surface that is snugly accommodated in the active site (10Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), but Hx is essentially the same size as normal purines that are poor substrates. Indeed each lesioned base has more in common with the normal purines than with the other lesioned bases. This prompts the following question: what prevents AAG from attacking normal DNA? Pyrimidine bases are smaller than purine bases and would be difficult to exclude from the purine-binding pocket. Pyrimidines can bind to AAG, but they are not cleaved (11Biswas T. Clos III, L.J. SantaLucia Jr., J. Mitra S. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This strong discrimination against the excision of pyrimidines at the hydrolysis step can be explained by an acid-catalyzed mechanism that is optimized for purine excision (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of AAG bound to ∈A-containing DNA suggest molecular models for how lesioned bases might be bound by this enzyme, but paradoxes remain. For example, how are 3MeA and 7MeG selectively excised but not A or G? Functional data are required to evaluate the proposed interactions with these substrates (10Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To understand how AAG achieves its broad substrate specificity and yet discriminates against the normal undamaged DNA bases, we have determined the rate enhancements for AAG-catalyzed single turnover reactions with a variety of modified purines and with the normal purines found in DNA. The largest rate enhancement observed is for the excision of Hx, suggesting a biological selection for activity on this oxidative lesion. Alkylated purines are removed with similar rate enhancements despite differences in their shapes and charges, indicating a surprisingly tolerant active site pocket. Nevertheless this pocket does discriminate against the normal purines G and A through unfavorable interactions with their exocyclic amino groups. This barrier is overcome for 3MeA and 7MeG, which retain the exocyclic amino groups but are intrinsically more reactive than unmethylated purines. Although AAG provides similar rate enhancements toward methylated and unmethylated purines, the 104-fold greater stability of unmethylated bases ensures that they are only rarely excised, whereas methylated bases are rapidly removed (13Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). An additional layer of discrimination against normal Watson-Crick base pairs is provided at the base-flipping step. DNA substrates of the sequence 5′-CGATAGCATCCTXCCTTCTCTCCAT annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide 5′-ATGGAGAGAAGGYAGGATGCTATCG, in which lesion X is paired with base Y (X·Y), were prepared as described previously (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The 7MeG-containing oligonucleotide (7MeG·C) was synthesized by primer extension using Klenow DNA polymerase, and other oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized using the appropriate phosphoramidites (Glen Research) and then purified by denaturing PAGE as described previously (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of human AAG (Δ80) in which the N-terminal 80 amino acids have been deleted was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This domain has glycosylase activity identical to the full-length protein (4O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′ labeled with polynucleotide kinase, annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide, and subjected to AAG-catalyzed or spontaneous depurination. The hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond was followed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrates as described previously (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Enzymatic reactions were quenched with NaOH (0.2 m final), and nonenzymatic reactions were quenched by freezing. Apurinic DNA sites were cleaved with NaOH (0.2 m, 70 °C, 10 min), diluted with formamide loading buffer, and resolved by denaturing PAGE, and substrate and product bands were quantified with a phosphorimaging system (Fuji BAS1000). Enzymatic rate constants were obtained from exponential fits to the data (F = 1–e–k × t) in which F is the fraction of substrate cleaved, t is time, and k is the observed rate constant. To ensure single turnover conditions, the concentration of AAG was kept in excess of the concentration of labeled DNA (∼1 nm). For Km and kcat/Km determinations, the enzyme concentration was varied over a wide range. Although we refer to the K½ for maximal activity as Km, this value could differ from the Km value for multiple turnover because the latter can be affected by product release. For the determination of kst, the concentration of enzyme was varied over a range of 10–100-fold above the Km to ensure saturation. The inhibition constant (Ki) was measured for various DNA duplexes by inhibiting the Hx excision reaction under kcat/Km conditions (i.e. the concentration of enzyme was below the Km for Hx excision) with varying concentration of unlabeled competitor DNA duplexes. AAG-catalyzed reactions were measured at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and an ionic strength of 100 mm adjusted with NaCl. Although the pH optimum for the reaction of neutral substrates (∼pH 6.0) is below physiological pH, we previously determined that the alkaline limbs for the pH dependence of the AAG-catalyzed reactions are very similar to those of the uncatalyzed reactions (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The rates of the enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions decrease to a similar extent with increasing pH, and therefore the rate enhancements are predicted to be pH-independent above pH 6. The fastest nonenzymatic reactions (knon ≥ 1 × 10–4 min–1) were followed to completion and analyzed as described above. Rate constants for slower reactions (knon < 1 × 10–4 min–1) were obtained from the first 10% of the reaction using a linear fit (F = knon × t). The rate constants were measured at 37 °C whenever possible, but for the slower reactions it was necessary to measure the rate constants at higher temperatures and to extrapolate to 37 °C using the temperature dependence. To ensure that the 25-mer oligonucleotide substrates were in duplex form at 70 °C we used a relatively high ionic strength (0.5 m) and a high concentration (1–10 μm) of the complement oligonucleotide. Control reactions showed that the rates of spontaneous reactions were insensitive to the concentration or identity of the buffer, the ionic strength between 100 mm and 1 m, and the presence or absence of dithiothreitol (1 mm) or EDTA (1 mm). Control reactions in which single-stranded DNA was incubated under these reaction conditions revealed 10–30-fold greater rates of hydrolysis (data not shown). This observation is consistent with a previous study that utilized genomic DNA (14Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3610-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and it suggests that these short oligonucleotide duplexes were stable under our experimental conditions. The energetic contributions of individual purine substituents were expressed as ΔΔG‡ in kcal/mol [ΔΔG‡ = –RTln(RE1/RE2) in which R is the gas constant, T is temperature (310 K), and RE is the rate enhancement. A negative value of ΔΔG‡ indicates that a given substituent contributes to catalytic recognition by AAG (Reactions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).Reactions 5 and 6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction 7View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction 8View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Glycosylase Activity of AAG toward Damaged Purines with Diverse Structures—To investigate how AAG can accommodate a wide variety of damaged purines differing in shape, charge, and hydrogen-bonding potential, we examined the specificity expressed in the enzyme·DNA complex for cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond. Glycosylase reactions were carried out under single turnover conditions with enzyme in excess over the DNA substrate (kobs = kst; Reaction 1). The single turnover reaction includes all of the steps subsequent to formation of the initial AAG·DNA complex up to and including N-glycosidic bond cleavage. The E·S complex, in which the base is not yet flipped out, is considered to be at equilibrium (Kflip) with the E·S′ complex in which the base is flipped out into the active site pocket. Although AAG is likely to also sample other base pairs in the DNA, only the E·S complex that is on the pathway to excision is shown. We compared activity toward substrates representative of the different structural classes of known AAG substrates: Hx is a small, neutral substrate; ∈A is a bulky but uncharged alkylated substrate; and 7MeG is an alkylated substrate that bears a positive charge (Fig. 1). As the pH dependences of AAG-catalyzed excision of positively charged and neutral lesions are different, the enzymatic rates of excision were measured at the pH optimum for each substrate (12O'Brien P.J. Ellenberger T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12418-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At the pH optima, similar maximal rates of excision were observed for Hx and 7MeG, whereas a lower maximal rate was observed for ∈A (Table I). However, these rates alone do not reveal how well particular substrates are recognized in the transition state because these compounds have very different intrinsic reactivities as described below.Table IEnzymatic and nonenzymatic depurination in oligonucleotide duplexesBase releasedEnzymaticNonenzymaticRate enhancementiRate enhancement is defined as kst/knon.Catalytic proficiencyjCatalytic proficiency is defined as (kcat/Km)/kw in which kw is the bimolecular nonenzymatic rate constant for hydrolysis (kw = knon/55 m).KmaKm values were measured by varying the concentration of enzyme (see “Experimental Procedure”). or KibKi values were measured by inhibiting the Hx excision reaction under kcat/Km conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”).kcat/Kmckcat/Km values were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”, dIn some cases the analogous value of kst/Kd is reported instead.(kcat/Km)releValues of (kcat/Km)rel were calculated by dividing the kcat/Km value by that of 3MeA(T).kstfSingle turnover rate constants with saturating enzyme were measured at the pH optimum for each substrate.krelgValues of krel for AAG-catalyzed excision were calculated by dividing the kst value by that of 7MeG·T.knonkrelhValues of krel for nonenzymatic depurination were obtained by dividing the value of knon by that for excision of A.ΔH‡nmm-1s-1min-1min-1kcal/mol7MeG (T)30 ± 10aKm values were measured by varying the concentration of enzyme (see “Experimental Procedure”).1.7 × 107 ckcat/Km values were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”0.7431kpH 8.0.(1Lindahl T.

Open table in a new tab To more fully explore the structure-activity relationships that define the catalytic specificity of AAG, we examined the extent to which other purine analogs are accepted as substrates. Purine (P) has no exocyclic substitutions, and 2-aminopurine (2AP) is a guanine analog lacking the C-6 keto moiety (Fig. 1). Both bases are excised by AAG when opposite cytosine in DNA albeit with greatly reduced rates in comparison to the excision of alkylated bases (Table I). For example, the half-lives for excision of P and 2AP are ∼1 and ∼80 h, respectively, compared with a half-life of ∼4 s for the excision of Hx, 3MeA, and 7MeG. The above comparisons of the reactivities of different modified purine substrates bound in the active site identify the specific contacts with the functional groups of the substrate that affect catalysis. However, the discrimination between substrates competing for a single active site is given by the specificity constant kcat/Km and not simply the kcat value. This is because a given substrate can better compete either by more efficient binding (enhanced Km) or by more efficient reaction once bound (kcat). Therefore we measured Km and kcat/Km values for a variety of purine analogs in DNA (Table I). These specificity constants include all of the steps in the enzymatic reaction up to and including the first irreversible step (Reaction 1). Intriguingly AAG does not exhibit strong discrimination in binding to different DNAs with Km values of ∼10 nm observed for both mismatched, lesioned bases and normal unmodified base pairs under these experimental conditions (Table I and data not shown). The only notable exceptions were ∈A and P, which have an order of magnitude lower Km values (Table I). The similar Km values for most DNAs is consistent with AAG being a nonspecific enzyme, and it indicates that much of the available binding energy is provided by nonspecific interactions with the DNA. AAG Is Sensitive to the Disruption of Base Pairing Interactions—DNA glycosylases gain access to their substrate bases by the process of base flipping whereby they distort the DNA duplex to extrude the target nucleoside into the active site (15Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that substrates might have different propensities for base flipping (Kflip; Reaction 1). AAG has been shown to catalyze the removal of unmodified guanine residues from DNA albeit at low rates (13Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Connor E.E. Wyatt M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We detected very low levels of activity toward both G and A in normal Watson-Crick base pairs, 2Activity toward normal purines was very low, but control experiments provide strong evidence that AAG is the mismatch-specific glycosylase in our assays: the pH dependence for excision of unmodified purines is similar that of modified purines; ∈A-containing DNA was a strong inhibitor; and catalytically inactive AAG mutants, E125Q and E125A (10Lau A.Y.

Although the excision of G and A from mismatches is several orders of magnitude slower than the excision of damaged bases, glycosylase activity toward mismatches represents substantial catalysis over the nonenzymatic rates (Table I). These opposing base effects could indicate a specific recognition of the orphaned base; however, the relative rates of A and G excision opposite different bases are consistent with the known base pairing stabilities (Table II) and not the identity of the orphaned base with unstable pairings exhibiting correspondingly higher rates of reaction. The decreased activity toward G·G, relative to G·T, is consistent with the observation that a G·G base pair is relatively stable (17Peyret N. Seneviratne P.A. Allawi H.T. SantaLucia Jr., J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3468-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Only an upper limit could be obtained for the activity toward a Watson-Crick A·T base pair, but adenine was removed from the least stable mismatch (A·C) at least 10-fold more efficiently than from an A·T base pair (Table II).Table IIEffect of the opposing base on the AAG-catalyzed glycosylase reactionPairedGaSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 37 °C.AaSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 37 °C.7MeGbNaMOPS, pH 8.0; 4 °C.2APaSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 37 °C.PaSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 37 °C.∈AaSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 37 °C.HxcSodium acetate, pH 6.0; 21 °C.Thymine(1Lindahl T.

Open table in a new tab The magnitude of opposing base effects (up to 50-fold) on the rates of excision of normal bases by AAG indicates that base pairing markedly contributes to substrate selection (Table II). A disruption of base pairing at the site of a lesion could serve as a signal to aid in flipping out damaged bases and thereby contribute to specificity for damaged bases. AAG has been shown to bind specifically to distorted DNAs containing pyrimidine·pyrimidine mismatches (11Biswas T. Clos III, L.J. SantaLucia Jr., J. Mi"
https://openalex.org/W2129170329,"Innate immune cells express toll-like receptor-9 (TLR9) and respond to unmethylated, CG dinucleotide motif-rich DNA released from bacteria during infection or endogenous cells during autoimmune tissue injury. Oligonucleotides containing CG dinucleotide (CpG-DNA) mimic the effect of unmethylated DNA and stimulate TLR9. CpG-DNA was cytotoxic to neurons in organotypic brain cultures. Neurotoxicity of CpG-DNA was mediated via microglial cells and started primarily from neurites as determined by time-lapse imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-transfected neurons. Cultured brain microglial cells expressed TLR9 and responded to CpG-DNA by production of the inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Blockade of NO synthase and TNF-alpha prevented damage of neurites and neurotoxicity of CpG-DNA. The data suggest that stimulation of microglia via TLR9 and subsequent release of NO and TNF-alpha is a major source of neurotoxicity in bacterial and autoimmune brain tissue injury."

Replacement of that glutamic residue by a glutamine did not modify the spectroscopic properties of the enzyme but cancelled the catalytic activity except the para-H2/ortho-H2 conversion. This mutation impaired the fast proton transfer from the active site that allows high turnover numbers for the oxidation of hydrogen. Replacement of the glutamic residue by the shorter aspartic acid slowed down this proton transfer, causing a significant decrease of H2 oxidation and hydrogen isotope exchange activities, but did not change the para-H2/ortho-H2 conversion activity. The spectroscopic properties of this mutant were totally different, especially in the reduced state in which a non-photosensitive nickel EPR spectrum was obtained.

Many microorganisms use molecular hydrogen in their metabolic routes as an energy source or for evacuating an excess of electrons. The enzymes that catalyze reversibly the conversion of molecular hydrogen to two electrons and two protons are known as hydrogenases. Although this is the simplest chemical reaction, the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes is quite complicated, and its details are still a matter of debate (1Cammack R. Cammack R. Frey M. Robson R. Hydrogen as a Fuel. Taylor & Francis, London, New York2001: 159-180Google Scholar). Hydrogen isotope exchange experiments indicate that the H2 cleavage reaction is heterolytic; thus, a hydride and a proton are formed in the first step (2Yagi T. Tsuda M. Inokuchi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Krasna A.I. Rittenberg D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 3015-3020Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the second step, the two electrons of the hydride are extracted, and a second proton is formed. Subsequently, the two electrons have to be transported, via the intramolecular electron transfer chain, from the active site to the redox partner of the hydrogenase (a redox protein or NAD+(P)) in vivo, or a redox dye in vitro; the two protons have to be transferred to the protein environment as well. These steps are reversed in the case of H2 production activity (1Cammack R. Cammack R. Frey M. Robson R. Hydrogen as a Fuel. Taylor & Francis, London, New York2001: 159-180Google Scholar). How do all these steps take place in hydrogenases? These proteins are metalloenzymes that all contain iron, and in many cases, also nickel.

Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) have been obtained by x-ray diffraction studies. In both types of enzymes, the active site is a deeply buried bimetallic center, in which the metals are bridged by thiol groups and have CO and CN- as ligands. This type of coordination favors the binding of molecular hydrogen or hydride to the active site (1Cammack R. Cammack R. Frey M. Robson R. Hydrogen as a Fuel. Taylor & Francis, London, New York2001: 159-180Google Scholar, 8Darensbourg M.Y. Lyon E.J. Smee J.J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2000; 206-207: 533-561Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The crystal structures also indicate that Fe-S clusters are located between the active site and the protein surface, which are thought to form the intramolecular electron pathway in the H2 production/oxidation mechanism (9Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). In [NiFe] hydrogenases, one nickel and one iron atom form the bimetallic center. The nickel is coordinated to four cysteine ligands via their thiol groups. Two of them are terminal ligands, and the other two are bridging ligands that also coordinate the iron atom (7Volbeda A.

The redox chemistry of [NiFe] hydrogenases is very rich, and at least seven redox states of the active site are detected by FTIR (15de Lacey A.L. Hatchikian E.C. Volbeda A. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Fernandez V.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7181-7189Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Three of these states are EPR-active due to paramagnetic properties of the nickel. These states are named Ni-A or unready (an inactive oxidized state that needs a long activation period to catalyze H2 oxidation), Ni-B or ready (an inactive oxidized state that can be quickly activated upon reduction), and Ni-C or active (an active reduced state) (16Moura J.J.

The EPR-silent states are named SU (an unready reduced state), SI (a silent active state, which has two species in acid-base equilibrium), and R (the super-reduced state) (15de Lacey A.L.

As indicated before, the identification of the electron transfer pathway in hydrogenases is quite straightforward from the crystallographic structure. In standard [NiFe] hydrogenases, it is formed by two [4Fe4S] clusters and one [3Fe-4S] cluster (7Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), but the relative value of their midpoint potential raised questions about their influence on the electron transfer kinetics (18Bertrand P.

However, the distances between these redox clusters are adequate for fast electron transfer through the protein (9Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic channel that connects the protein surface with the active site for H2 transport has also been detected by x-ray diffraction studies in Desulfovibrio fructosovorans [NiFe] hydrogenase (20Montet Y. Amara P. Volbeda A. Vernede X. Hatchikian E.C. Field M.J. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). There is much less evidence regarding the proton transport pathway. Protons are transported inside proteins via motions of water molecules and amino acid residues with acid-base properties, such as histidine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid (21Williams R.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 643Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Several routes have been proposed for [NiFe] hydrogenases, and most likely, proton transport during catalysis does not stick to a single one (7Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M.

Therefore, most probably, this cysteine is the starting point, or the ending point in the case of H2 production activity, of the proton transport pathway. A glutamic acid residue conserved in [NiFe] hydrogenases (Glu-25 in D. fructosovorans and Glu-18 in Desulfovibrio gigas hydrogenases) is H-bonded to the mentioned terminal cysteine bound to nickel. Thus, it is a potential candidate for the next step of the proton transport pathway (14Garcin E. Vernede X. Hatchikian E.C. Volbeda A. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Structure Fold.

In this work, we report the spectroscopic and kinetic characterization of mutants produced at the Glu-25 position of D. fructosovorans [NiFe] hydrogenase, demonstrating that this residue has an important role in hydrogenase catalysis. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli strain DH5α, F-, endA1, hsdR17 (rK- mK+), supE44, thi-1, λ-, recA1, gyrA96, relA1, Δ (argF- lacZYA) U169, φ80dlacZΔM15 was used as a host in the cloning of recombinant plasmids. The bacterium was routinely grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Ampicillin at 100 μg/ml or gentamycin at 20 μg/ml was added when cells harbored pUC18 or pBGF4 derivatives, respectively. The pBGF4 plasmid, which is a new shuttle vector of the pBM family, reporting the gentamycin resistance gene (33Rousset M. Casalot L. Rapp-Giles B.J. Dermoun Z. de Philip P. Belaich J.P. Wall J.D. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was used in this study to carry the [NiFe] hydrogenase operon from D. fructosovorans as described previously (19Rousset M.

Wall J.D. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Large culture volumes were performed as described previously (19Rousset M. Montet Y. Guigliarelli B. Forget N. Asso M. Bertrand P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Hatchikian E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11625-11630Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Kanamycine at 50 μg/ml was present routinely, and 50 μg gentamycin/ml were added only when cells harbored the plasmid pBGF4. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used to generate point mutations in the large subunit gene hynB. The PstI-AatII fragment from pBGF4 was subcloned into pUC18 to generate pUCbn that was used as a template in mutagenesis experiments. After mutagenesis, the PstI-AatII fragment was fully sequenced and inserted in the PstI-AatII-digested pBGF4. The recombinant plasmid was introduced into D. fructosovorans MR400 by electrotransformation (33Rousset M. Casalot L. Rapp-Giles B.J. Dermoun Z. de Philip P. Belaich J.P. Wall J.D. Plasmid. 1998; 39: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—The Strep tag II sequence (IBA Gmbh, Göttingen, Germany) was introduced in the hydrogenase genes, and the tagged protein was purified in one step on a Strep-Tactin® column (IBA Gmbh). The yield of purification was in a range between 0.3 and 0.5 mg of pure hydrogenase/liter of culture. Activity Measurements—H2 uptake activity was measured with 1 mm methyl viologen as described (35Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Cammack R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 209: 69-79Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) modified as follows for pH dependence. pH was titrated between 6 and 11 with HCl or NaOH in a buffer containing 100 mm MES/Tris/CAPS and 2 mm methyl viologen as mediator. Oxygen was removed under vacuum, and the cuvette was flushed with argon. Enzyme (10 μg for wild type and E25D and 1 mg for E25Q) was allowed to activate for 1 h under H2 in the buffer at pH 8. The activity was measured in an H2-flushed UV-cuvette, containing 1 ml of buffer, in which residual oxygen was eliminated by adding 1 μl of a 1 m dithionite solution. The reaction was started by the addition of 5-30 μl of activated enzyme, and the kinetics of the reduction of methyl viologen was measured at 604 nm in a UV 1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) at 30 °C. H+/D+ exchange activity was measured as described (36De Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Rousset M. Cavazza C. Hatchikian E.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Para-ortho hydrogen conversion was measured as described (37De Lacey A.L. Santamaria E. Hatchikian E.C. Fernandez V.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Molecular hydrogen consisting of 50% para hydrogen and 50% ortho hydrogen was prepared as described by Hartman et al. (38Hartmann G.C. Santamaria E. Fernandez V.M. Thauer R.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 446-450Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Redox Titration and EPR Spectroscopy—The redox titrations of the wild type and mutant enzymes were carried out in a specially designed anaerobic cell at 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes buffer at pH = 8.0 under an argon atmosphere. The redox potentials were measured with a combined Pt-Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 m) microelectrode in the presence of the following mediators at 5 μm each: 1,2 naphtoquinone, methylene blue, phenazine methosulfate, phenosafranin, neutral red, methyl viologen. The reductive titration was conducted by stepwise additions of small quantities of 20 mm sodium dithionite in the same buffer. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 helium flow cryostat. When necessary, sample illumination was performed directly in the EPR cavity by using a fiber optic and a 250-watt quartz-tungsten-iodine lamp. FTIR Spectroscopy—The infrared experiments were done in a spectroelectrochemical cell as described (39De Lacey A.L. Stadler C. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Fan H.J. Li S. Hall M.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Biochemical Properties—The activity of the mutants was measured by three different assays, which give complementary information. H2 uptake in the presence of a redox dye involves the steps of H2 splitting at the active site as well as the steps of hydron and electron transfer. Isotopic exchange reactions involve both the splitting of H2 (or its isotopes) and the hydron transfer steps but not the electron transfer step. Finally, conversion of para-H2 to ortho-H2 involves only the step of splitting and recombination of H2 at the active site. Fig. 1 shows the pH dependence of the H2 uptake activity values for wild type hydrogenase and the mutants E25D and E25Q. E25D has a similar pH profile to wild type enzyme, and its activity is roughly half of the native hydrogenase activity. Instead, the other mutant, E25Q has only residual activity (less than 0.1% of the wild type one). Rather similar results were obtained when comparing the D2/H+ exchange activity of the hydrogenase mutants with the wild type one (Fig. 2). Virtually no activity could be detected with E25Q, whereas E25D had activity values that were 30-60% of those of the wild type at acidic and neutral pH. In all measurements, the rate of evolution of the double exchange product (H2) was significantly lower than the rate of evolution of the single exchange product (HD), which is the typical behavior of standard [NiFe] hydrogenases (40Fauque G. Peck Jr., H.D. Moura J.J. Huynh B.H. Berlier Y. DerVartanian D.V. Teixeira M. Przybyla A.E. Lespinat P.A. Moura I. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 299-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting result is that at basic pH, the D2/H+ exchange activity of E25D drops down, whereas the H2 uptake activity maintains high values at pH 8 and 9. To determine whether this discrepancy was due to an isotopic effect or to a change in a rate-limiting step at high pH, the D2 uptake activities of the wild type and E25D mutant were compared, and the H2 production activity of the wild type and mutant enzyme was tested at pH 9.0. The D2 uptake activity values of 63 and 36 units/mg, respectively, were very similar to those obtained with H2 uptake activity, but the H2 production activity of the mutant exhibited a 80% decrease at pH 9.0 relative to the wild type enzyme (not shown). The results indicate that the different pH profiles for the D2/H+ exchange probably originate from the H2 production step becoming rate-limiting at high pH in the E25D mutant. The E25Q mutant had negligible activity in these assays. The ortho-para hydrogen conversion experiments show that the mutations had little effect on this activity assay (Fig. 3). After a 200-min reaction, the two mutants and wild type hydrogenase reached similar levels of hydrogen conversion, whereas the blank measurement hardly gave hydrogen conversion (O2 traces cause a small increase of the ortho-H2/para-H2 ratio). EPR Spectroscopy—To investigate the influence of Glu-25 mutations on the active site of the enzyme, the various paramagnetic states of the [NiFe] center were studied by EPR spectroscopy. The two mutants were titrated anaerobically, and the [NiFe] EPR signals were compared with those given by the wild type enzyme poised at the same potentials. In the oxidized state, the EPR spectra of E25Q are composed of a mixture of the Ni-A (g = 2.31, 2.24, 2.01) and Ni-B (g = 2.33, 2.16, 2.01) signals identical to those of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4, a and b). The total amount of Ni-A + Ni-B signals represents 0.8 spin/mol of enzyme in E25Q preparations, with a proportion of the Ni-B signal corresponding to 40% of the total nickel signal, a value slightly higher than those usually found for the wild type enzyme. In the oxidized E25D mutant, the nickel EPR signal is mainly composed of the usual Ni-A signal (50-55%), but a new species with g = 2.286, 2.238, 2.01 is also present (Fig. 4c). This species, which we termed Ni-A′, corresponds to about 40% of the total nickel signal, which represents typically 0.3-0.4 spin/mol of enzyme. The rest of the spectrum is composed of a minor fraction (5-10%) of Ni-B signal. In both mutants, all these nickel signals disappear upon reduction and are replaced by other nickel signals in the -350 mV to -400 mV potential range (Fig. 5). The reduced E25Q mutant gives the usual Ni-C signal (Fig. 5b), which is split at low temperature (<8 K) by the magnetic coupling with the proximal [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster (Fig. 5c) (41Guigliarelli B. More C. Fournel A. Asso M. Hatchikian E.C. Williams R. Cammack R. Bertrand P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4781-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Spin intensity measurements performed at 30 K showed that this Ni-C signal corresponds to 0.12 spin/mol of enzyme. A careful comparison of the split Ni-C signal in E25Q and in the wild type enzyme shows a small variation of the line splitting that likely arises from a small decrease of the intercenter exchange interaction (Δ J/J ∼ 10%) in the mutant. As in the wild type enzyme, the E25Q Ni-C signal is light-sensitive and is changed into the well known Ni-L2 and Ni-L1 signals (42Dole F. Medina M. More C. Cammack R. Bertrand P. Guigliarelli B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16399-16406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) upon illumination (not shown). By contrast, the reduced E25D mutant exhibited very different spectroscopic features. At 30 K, this mutant gave a complex EPR spectrum (Fig. 5d), suggesting the presence of a mixture of several paramagnetic species or a marked change of the magnetic coupling with the proximal [4Fe-4S]1+ center or of hyperfine interactions. No change of this spectrum was observed when the E25D sample was prepared in D2O or by varying the pH between pH 5 and 9. Moreover, the spectrum shape did not change upon variation of the microwave power and of the temperature in the 10-70 K range. These observations and the small variations of the line amplitude between preparations clearly indicated the presence of several nickel species in the reduced E25D mutant. By making differences between spectra given by various preparations, we identified three different species, one with g values at gX = 2.228, gY = 2.097, gZ = 2.039, the two others giving lines at gX = 2.242 and 2.193, gY = 2.09 and 2.071, gZ = 2.048 and 2.027, but the two sets of g components could not be attributed. The total amount of these nickel signals corresponds to 0.1 spin/mol. It is worth noting that these species are not photosensitive, even after a long time illumination (>1 h). Interestingly, at very low temperature (< 4 K), this complex EPR spectrum exhibits additional splitting (Fig. 5e), which reveals the magnetic coupling between the [NiFe] center and the proximal [4Fe-4S]+1 center. This coupling is much smaller than that observed for the split Ni-C signal (Fig. 5c) and leads to the larger splitting on the gY type lines. These features are similar to those found for the Ni-L species where the intercenter exchange interaction with the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is cancelled, and the magnetic coupling results from dipolar coupling only (42Dole F. Medina M. More C. Cammack R. Bertrand P. Guigliarelli B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16399-16406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the new nickel species found in the reduced E25D mutant are reminiscent of the Ni-L species; they show a similar g-tensor rhombicity and weakness of the spin-coupling with the proximal [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster. For the two Glu-25 mutants, the EPR signals of the FeS clusters are unaffected by mutation (not shown).Fig. 5EPR spectra of hydrogenase Glu-25 mutant in the reduced state. a, wild type enzyme poised at -359 mV. b and c, E25Q mutant poised at -370 mV. d and e, E25D mutant poised at -400 mV.

The spectra of the oxidized samples of both mutants show the intense band at 1947 cm-1, corresponding to the stretching vibrational mode of the CO ligand in the Ni-A state of D. fructosovorans [NiFe] hydrogenase (39De Lacey A.L. Stadler C. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Fan H.J. Li S. Hall M.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At 2096 and 2084 cm-1, the less intense bands appear due to the CN- ligands in the same state. The shoulders at 2091 and 2081 cm-1 correspond without doubt to the CN- bands of the Ni-B state. These later ones are more evident for the E25Q mutant, which is in agreement with the EPR results. The frequencies of the bands are equal to those of wild type enzyme (39De Lacey A.L. Stadler C. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Fan H.J. Li S. Hall M.B. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The shoulder that is clearly observed at 1953 cm-1 for E25D could correspond to the CO band of the Ni-A′ state or to an EPR-silent state, which is in high proportion in the oxidized state, as the EPR spectrum indicates. This shoulder often appears, although in lower proportion, in some native samples of [NiFe] hydrogenases (15de Lacey A.L. Hatchikian E.C. Volbeda A. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Fernandez V.M. J.

Thus, it probably corresponds to an EPR-silent state that is sometimes present in their oxidized samples. Fig. 6 also shows the FTIR spectra of the mutants after the reducti"

These base-modified DNA lesions have been shown to trap DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) into covalent cleavage complexes. In this study, we have investigated the role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide toxicity. We showed that ectopic expression of TOP1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae conferred sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and this sensitivity was dependent on RAD9 checkpoint function. Moreover, in the mammalian cell culture system, hydrogen peroxide-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were shown to be partly TOP1-dependent as evidenced by a specific increase in resistance to hydrogen peroxide in TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 murine leukemia cells as compared with their TOP1-proficient parental cell line P388. In addition, hydrogen peroxide was shown to induce TOP1-DNA cross-links. These results support a model in which hydrogen peroxide promotes the trapping of TOP1 on oxidative DNA lesions to form TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes that contribute to hydrogen peroxide toxicity.

There are a spectra of DNA lesions generated by ROS, with the most abundant being a base modification to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) (5Chatgilialoglu C. O'Neill P. Exp.

Conversion of guanine to 8-oxoG causes a selective mis-incorporation of adenine opposite to 8-oxoG that can lead to G-T transversions in the DNA (8Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M.

Topoisomerase I (TOP1) is a nuclear enzyme involved in the removal of superhelical tension on chromosomal DNA during replication and transcription (13Liu L.F. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar). It catalyzes this topological transformation reaction by forming a transient reaction intermediate in which the 3′-phosphoryl end of the broken DNA strand is covalently linked to its active site tyrosine through a tyrosyl phosphate linkage (13Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). The anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) is known to stabilize this transient covalent TOP1-DNA intermediate, often referred to as the reversible TOP1-DNA cleavable or cleavage complex (13Liu L.F.

In addition to CPT, many xenobiotics, DNA adducts (e.g. UV adducts and the carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adducts), and aberrant DNA structures (e.g. nicks, mismatches, abasic sites, and AraC-substituted DNA), are now known to trap TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes (20Meng L.H.

In this study, we have investigated the role of TOP1 in oxidative DNA damage both in yeast and cultured mammalian cells using hydrogen peroxide, an ROS known to cause oxidative DNA damage primarily through the hydroxyl radical that results from the Fenton reaction (26Imlay J.A.

We found that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ectopic expression of TOP1 sensitized cells to hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, in the mammalian system, TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 murine leukemia cells exhibited an increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide in both growth inhibition and apoptosis assays as compared with their TOP1-proficient parental P388 cells. These results, coupled with the demonstration of TOP1-DNA cross-links in HeLa cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, suggest a potential role for TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity.

After galactose induction, cells were diluted and treated with hydrogen peroxide for 1 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, diluted samples were plated in duplicate and clonogenic survival was assayed by counting the number of viable colonies. MTT Assay—Growth inhibition was determined using the MTT assay as described previously (42Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). The MTT assay was performed using 96-well microtiter plates. For determination of IC50, cells were exposed continuously to varying drug concentrations, followed by MTT assays at the end of the fourth day. DNA Fragmentation Assay—For detection of apoptosis, chromosomal DNA fragments released from nuclei during apoptosis were measured as described previously (43Khelifa T. Beck W.T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1247-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells were treated with the appropriate drug for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted and lysed in 0.4 ml lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation to remove nuclei, chromosomal DNA in the supernatant (including both high molecular weight DNA and nucleosomal DNA fragments) were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with 1:10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in TE buffer containing 100 μg/ml RNaseA. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, DNA was electrophoresed in 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. In Vivo Complex of Enzyme (ICE) Assay—The ICE assay was used to monitor the amount of covalent protein-DNA complexes in cells (44Subramanian D. Kraut E. Staubus A. Young D.C. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2097-2103PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 HeLa cells per sample were treated with drug for 30 min. Cells were then collected and lysed with 1 ml of 1% Sarkosyl. The lysates were passed through a 26-gauge needle five times. Two milliliters of each CsCl solution (1.82, 1.72, 1.50, and 1.37 g/ml) were layered successively in a polyallomer tube to generate the step CsCl gradient. The volume of the lysate was adjusted with 1% Sarkosyl to 2 ml and layered gently on top of the gradient. The samples were centrifuged at 20 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 31,000 rpm for 24 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and 100 μl of each fraction was diluted with 100 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and then spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a slot-blot apparatus. The membrane was washed with sodium phosphate buffer and immunoblotted with anti-TOP1 antibodies. Immunoblotting Analysis—Treated cells were lysed directly with 2X SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated in a 7% SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with Ponceau to confirm protein loading. Immunoblotting of the membrane was performed using human anti-TOP1 scleroderma antibodies (45Shero J.H. Bordwell B. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1986; 231: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). FACS Analysis for Activated Caspase in Apoptotic Cells—Caspase activity was measured using the CaspACE FITC-VAD-fmk in situ marker from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 106 cells were stained with 25 μm FITC-VAD-FMK at 37 °C in the dark for 40 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). FACS analysis of cells was performed with excitation of 488 nm and emission of 525–550 nm. Hydrogen Peroxide Sensitivity of Yeast top1 Mutant Strains—To examine the role of TOP1 on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, we determined the effect of TOP1 underexpression on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. Four top1 mutant strains together with their isogenic wild-type strains (see Table I) were used in a clonogenic survival assay. As shown in Fig. 1, top1 mutants TG107 and RS190 were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide as compared with their corresponding isogenic wild-type strains, CH335 and W3031-a, respectively. These results suggest that TOP1 contributes to hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in these strains. However, the other two top1 mutant yeast strains, JCW27 and EKY3, exhibited about the same sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as the corresponding wild-type strains, JCW25 and FY250, respectively. These results indicate that the strain background is important in conferring TOP1-dependent sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Ectopic Expression of TOP1 Confers Sensitivity to Hydrogen Peroxide—To further examine the role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, we determined the effect of TOP1 overexpression on hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. The yeast TOP1 deletion strain JN2–134 was transformed with a plasmid carrying the yTOP1 gene under a GAL-inducible promoter. As a control, JN2–134 cells were transformed with either the vector alone or the vector carrying the mutated yTOP1 gene (the active site tyrosine mutant, yTOP1Y727F). The yeast cells were grown in selective media and subsequently induced with galactose overnight. After hydrogen peroxide treatment, cells were plated and assayed for colony formation. The results are shown in Fig. 2A. The ectopic expression of yTOP1 conferred sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in a dose-dependent manner as compared with cells expressing the vector alone or cells expressing mutant yTOP1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the same result was obtained using a different top1 mutant strain, RS190 (see Fig. 1), which was shown to be resistant to hydrogen peroxide. Introduction of the yTOP1 gene to RS190 conferred sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as compared with the cells bearing plasmids with the active site yTOP1Y727F mutant or vector alone (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also obtained for another top1 mutant stain, TG107 (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that overexpression of TOP1 confers hydrogen peroxide sensitivity to yeast with different genetic backgrounds. Hydrogen Peroxide Sensitivity in tdp1 and rad9 Mutant Yeast—Tdp1p is a yeast tyrosine-DNA phosphodiesterase that has been implicated in the repair of TOP1 cleavable complexes (37Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 46Pouliot J.J. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutations in TDP1 sensitize cells to TOP1 poisons such as camptothecin (CPT) (37Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This sensitivity to TOP1 poisons is also significantly increased in a rad9 mutant background defective in the G2 checkpoint (37Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 47Toh G.W. Lowndes N.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 242-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to examine the potential role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, we determined the hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in tdp1 and rad9 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3A, the tdp1 mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and CPT (see the inset) than its corresponding wild-type strain. Similarly, the rad9 mutant (Fig. 3B) showed considerably more sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as compared with its wild-type strain. The hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in the rad9tdp1 and rad9top1 double mutants, and the rad9top1tdp1 triple mutant was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 3C, the rad9 and rad9tdp1 mutants showed increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide as compared with their top1 mutant strains, again suggesting that hydrogen peroxide sensitivity depends on TOP1. In addition, hydrogen peroxide sensitivity (Fig. 3C), like CPT sensitivity (Fig. 3D), was affected by the RAD9 status and to a lesser extent by the TDP1 status. These results demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide sensitivity mirrors CPT sensitivity in its TDP1 and RAD9 dependence. Selective Resistance of TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 Murine Leukemia Cells to Hydrogen Peroxide—We have also investigated the role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide sensitivity in mammalian cells. The mouse leukemia P388 cells and the subline P388/CPT45 selected for CPT resistance were used in the current study. The P388/CPT45 cells are highly resistant to CPT and do not express detectable levels of TOP1, but do express a low level of a high molecular weight TOP1 species (about 130 kDa, see the Fig. 4 inset). As shown in Fig. 4, the TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 cells were up to 6-fold more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than the TOP1-proficient P388 cells in the MTT assay. As controls, cells were also treated with the TOP1 poison CPT, the TOP2 poison VM-26, and the tubulin inhibitor vinblastine. As expected, the P388/CPT45 cells were highly resistant to CPT (over 45-fold). By contrast, these cells were not significantly more resistant to VM-26 or vinblastine as compared with their TOP1-proficient parental cell line P388 (Fig. 4). The IC50 (μm) values for the various drugs in these cells are listed in Table II.Table IIIC50 values (μM) for various drugs in P388 and P388/CPT45 cellsCell linesH2O2CPTVM-26VinblastineP3884.9 ± 0.070.036 ± 0.020.004 ± 0.0010.0047 ± 0.0006P388/CPT4527.0 ± 4.0>100.0012 ± 0.0050.006 ± 0.002 Open table in a new tab Apoptosis Induced by Hydrogen Peroxide Is Reduced in TOP1-deficient Cells—Hydrogen peroxide is known to induce both necrosis and apoptosis (48Nanavaty U.B.

Hinshaw D.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis by assaying two apoptotic endpoints, nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and caspase activation. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide were shown to induce nucleosomal DNA fragments indicative of apoptotic cell death in the P388 cells, but not in TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 cells, suggesting a role for TOP1 in mediating hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. As controls, cells were also exposed to a TOP1-specific drug, ARC-111 (topovale) (29Li T.K. Houghton P.J. Desai S.D. Daroui P. Liu A. Hars E.S. Ruchelman A.L. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8400-8407PubMed Google Scholar) and a TOP2-specific drug, VP-16 (etoposide). Similar to hydrogen peroxide, ARC-111 was shown to induce nucleosomal DNA fragments in the P388 cells, but not the P388/CPT45 cells. By contrast, VP-16 was shown to induce nucleosomal DNA fragments in both P388 and P388/CPT45 cells, confirming the specificity of TOP1-dependent resistance in P388/CPT45 cells to hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptosis. In addition to nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, apoptotic caspase activation was also monitored in the cell line pair upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Following treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cells were exposed to FITC-conjugated VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor that specifically binds to activated caspase), and then analyzed for FITC fluorescence by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide induced a significant increase in activated caspase in the parental P388 cells as compared with the TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 cells, as evidenced by a shift in FITC peak fluorescence. CPT (a TOP1 drug) and VM-26 (a TOP2 drug), which were used as controls, were also shown to induce apoptosis in the P388 cells, as demonstrated by the corresponding increase in activated caspase in these drug-treated cells. However, CPT-but not VM-26-induced caspase activation was reduced in the TOP1-deficent P388/CPT45 cells. This result suggests that the apoptotic pathway in TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 cells is not altered. Consequently, the specific resistance to hydrogen peroxide in P388/CPT45 cells is likely due to TOP1 alteration (i.e. TOP1 deficiency) rather than other genetic changes. Hydrogen Peroxide Traps TOP1-DNA Covalent Complexes in Cells—The ICE bioassay was used to demonstrate the trapping of TOP1-DNA covalent complexes by hydrogen peroxide in HeLa cells. Following treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cells were lysed in 1% Sarkosyl and subjected to CsCl gradient fractionation. Collected fractions were subsequently immunoblotted for TOP1 in order to detect TOP1-DNA covalent complexes. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Hydrogen peroxide (25 mm, 30 min) was able to trap a small amount of TOP1-DNA complexes (see fraction 2). As a positive control, the TOP1-specific poison CPT (25 μm, 30 min) was shown to trap TOP1-DNA covalent complexes as expected (see fractions 1 and 2). In the current work, we have demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide toxicity is increased in yeast expressing TOP1. In our experiments, ectopic expression of yTOP1 in S. cerevisiae sensitized cells to hydrogen peroxide while the catalytic inactive yTOP1Y727F mutant did not confer increased sensitivity, suggesting that the catalytic function of TOP1 is important in conferring hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. However, the phenotype resulting from the overexpression of a gene product could be due to a gain of function and may not reflect the physiological role of the gene product. Consequently, we investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide on cells that underexpress TOP1. Four isogenic pairs of top1 mutant strains were examined for their sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. Only two (i.e. TG107 and RS190) of the four top1 mutant strains exhibited increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that the TOP1-dependent lethality depends on the genetic background. In other words, TOP1-independent lethality can be the major pathway for hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity in certain genetic backgrounds. It should be pointed out that ectopic expression of wild-type yTOP1 was able to restore sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in the two top1 mutant strains (i.e. TG107 and RS190) that exhibited resistance to hydrogen peroxide, further supporting a role for yTOP1 in oxidative damage response. TDP1 has been suggested to be involved in the repair of TOP1 cleavage complexes (37Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 46Pouliot J.J. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, our studies with tdp1 mutants have failed to demonstrate a significant role for TDP1 in hydrogen peroxide sensitivity/resistance. This result is probably not surprising since several pathways are known to be involved in the repair of TOP1-DNA covalent complexes (46Pouliot J.J. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 50Liu C. Pouliot J.J. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14970-14975Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Among them, the RAD9 pathway has been implicated in TOP1-DNA covalent complex repair since rad9 mutants exhibit increased sensitivity to the TOP1-specific drug CPT (37Pouliot J.J. Yao K.C. Robertson C.A. Nash H.A. Science. 1999; 286: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). RAD9 is a S. cerevisiae DNA damage checkpoint gene responsible for damage-induced cell cycle arrest at G1 and G2 (47Toh G.W. Lowndes N.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 242-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide selectively causes RAD9-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2 (51Flattery-O'Brien J.A. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8564-8571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, increased sensitivity to oxidatively damaging agents such as hydrogen peroxide is S-phase-specific and depends on RAD9 function (52Leroy C. Mann C. Marsolier M.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2896-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our experiments with the rad9 top1 and rad9tdp1 double mutants have indeed demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity, like CPT cytotoxicity, is both TOP1- and RAD9-dependent, suggesting the potential involvement of TOP1 cleavage complexes. The strong dependence of hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity on TOP1 in rad9 mutant background further supports the notion that hydrogen peroxide, like CPT, kills cells through TOP1 cleavage complexes whose repair is defective in rad9 background. It should be noted that our results regarding hydrogen peroxide parallel those obtained by Nitiss et al. (53Nitiss J.L. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Waltman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26708-29714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using methyl methanesulfonate and other DNA-damaging agents (e.g. UV). They have shown that overexpression of yTOP1 confers sensitivity of yeast cells to these DNA-damaging agents. It is plausible that the underlying mechanism of TOP1-mediated lethality in both studies is the same (i.e. trapping of TOP1-DNA covalent complexes). We have also investigated the potential role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity in cultured mammalian cells. P388/CPT45 cells, which are derived from P388 murine leukemia cells by selecting for CPT resistance (over 1000-fold more resistant to CPT), are deficient in TOP1 (40Mattern M.R. Hofmann G.A. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5813-5816PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mattern M.R. Hofmann G.A. Polsky R.M. Funk L.R. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that P388/CPT45 cells were up to 6-fold more resistant to hydrogen peroxide than P388 cells as demonstrated by the MTT assay. This result suggests that hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity is partly TOP1-dependent. However, P388/CPT45 cells may contain mutations in other genes unrelated to the TOP1 defect, which may affect the DNA repair and apoptosis pathways. In order to rule out this possibility, other cytotoxic agents (i.e. VM-26 and vinblastine) were used in the current study. P388/CPT45 cells were shown to be specifically resistant to hydrogen peroxide and CPT, but not VM-26 (a TOP2-specific drug) or vinblastine (a tubulin-specific drug). Similar results in these cells were obtained using apoptosis assays. Hydrogen peroxide was shown to induce apoptosis in P388 cells as evidenced by both nucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase activation assays. Hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis was partially reduced in TOP1-deficient P388/CPT45 cells, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis is partly TOP1-dependent. The precise role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity is still unclear. It is possible that TOP1 may reduce the expression of certain genes involved in the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA. Consequently, top1 mutants or TOP1-deficient cells would become more resistant to hydrogen peroxide. The other possibility is that hydrogen peroxide may trap TOP1 into potentially lethal covalent complexes in mammalian cells as in yeast. Indeed, we have demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide induces TOP1-DNA cross-links in HeLa cells using the ICE bioassay, suggesting the formation of TOP1-DNA covalent complexes. We have also demonstrated that the TOP1-DNA cross-links are reversible upon removal of hydrogen peroxide, 2L. F. Liu and S. Desai, unpublished results. suggesting that they may reflect reversible TOP1 cleavage complexes. It is unclear how hydrogen peroxide may trap TOP1 into cleavage complexes. Previous studies using purified TOP1 have demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide does not directly trap TOP1 into covalent complexes (54Li T.K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, hydrogen peroxide may indirectly trap TOP1 into covalent complexes by generating oxidative DNA lesions (i.e. 8-oxoG) mediated by the hydroxyl radical through the Fenton reaction. Indeed, TOP1 has been shown to bind to sites of oxidatively damaged DNA to form TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes (24Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.J. Essigmann J.M. Bjornsti M.A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes are expected to cause S-phase-specific cytotoxicity (17Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 18Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). Like in yeast, TOP1-independent pathways are certainly important for hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity. P388/CPT45 cells are over 1000-fold more resistant to CPT (40Mattern M.R. Hofmann G.A. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5813-5816PubMed Google Scholar, 41Mattern M.R. Hofmann G.A. Polsky R.M. Funk L.R. McCabe F.L. Johnson R.K. Oncol. Res. 1993; 5: 467-474PubMed Google Scholar), but only 6-fold more resistant to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting the presence of TOP1-independent pathways for hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity. There are likely many TOP1-independent pathways contributing to hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity due to the nonspecific chemical reactivity associated with hydrogen peroxide. One of these pathways could involve TOP2. Previous studies have demonstrated that TOP2 can be directly trapped into cleavage complexes by high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and may thus contribute to hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity (54Li T.K. Chen A.Y. Yu C. Mao Y. Wang H. Liu L.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1553-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another possible pathway could involve telomeres since extensive telomere shortening has been demonstrated in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (55Ren J.G. Xia H.L. Just T. Dai Y.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 56Ramirez R. Carracedo J. Jimenez R. Canela A. Herrera E. Aljama P. Blasco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (1–10-2003): 836-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The importance of these various pathways in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity may depend on a variety of factors. For example, the role of TOP1 in hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity may be particularly important in proliferating cells since TOP1-mediated lethality is substantially S-phase-specific (17Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 18Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). In non-proliferating cells such as postmitotic neurons, TOP1-independent pathways may become more important. Clearly, further studies are necessary to elucidate the roles of various cytotoxic pathways in the cellular response to hydrogen peroxide. We thank Drs. James C. Wang, John Nitiss, and Howard Nash for providing us with various yeast strains, Dr. Mary-Ann Bjornsti for the TOP1 plasmids, and Drs. Michael R. Mattern and Randal K.

To learn more about the structure and function of eIF3 we have expressed and purified individual human eIF3 subunits or complexes of eIF3 subunits using baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of protein synthesis in a heat-inactivated yeast lysate derived from a conditional mutant of eIF3b (17Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purification of eIF3 using an oligohistidine-tagged eIF3b identified a core of five subunits associated with eIF5 (18Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.P. Greenberg J.R. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The five core subunits, eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3g, and eIF3i, are all essential for yeast growth and are conserved in mammalian eIF3. Recently, eIF3j has been shown to associate loosely with the core eIF3 complex in yeast (19Valasek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valaskova V. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 891-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to augment the stability of eIF3 and possibly play a role in the 40 S ribosomal subunit assembly pathway (20Valasek L. Hasek J. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43351-43360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Given the similarities between other yeast and mammalian initiation factors, the structural differences observed with eIF3 are somewhat surprising. These discrepancies may be due in part to subtle differences in the strengths of various protein-protein interactions. It is likely that the true subunit composition of eIF3 will not be resolved until a functional protein complex is reconstituted from separated subunits. To further understand the structure and function of mammalian eIF3, we have utilized the baculovirus expression system to prepare human eIF3 subunits that have orthologs in S. cerevisiae. In this study, we overexpressed different combinations of eIF3 subunits, including FLAG-tagged subunits, and affinity-purified the subcomplexes by anti-FLAG affinity beads. This approach allows assembly of human eIF3 components in vivo, recovery of stable subcomplexes and determination of their functions in in vitro assays for initiation. It also has the potential to generate structural information about subunit-subunit interactions and to identify specific functions of individual subunits. We focus here on the function of eIF3j in promoting the binding of core subcomplexes and purified eIF3 to 40 S ribosomal subunits and its reduced activity following cleavage by caspase-3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Biochemicals—Materials for tissue culture and DNA oligonucleotides are from Invitrogen; [35S]methionine is from ICN; DNA-modifying enzymes are from New England BioLabs; anti-FLAG affinity beads are from Sigma. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals are from Sigma.Cell Culture—Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells were grown in 100-ml spinner flasks at 27 °C in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen). For experiments, cells were seeded at 1 × 107 cells in 100-mm dishes prior to infection with the recombinant viruses described in individual figure legends.Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Baculoviruses allowing the expression of single subunits of human eIF3 were constructed in derivatives of the pFASTBAC1 vector (Invitrogen). DNA oligonucleotides were designed, annealed, and ligated into pFASTBAC1 to produce FLAG-FASTBAC1. This vector includes an NcoI site containing an AUG codon upstream of the FLAG-tag sequence followed by an in-frame AUG within an NdeI site. In addition, pET-28c (Novagen) was digested with BglII and XhoI and ligated into pFASTBAC1 digested with BamHI and XhoI to produce pFASTpET.Untagged eIF3 subunit expression constructs were created as follows. The cDNA for full-length eIF3i (GenBank™ nucleotide accession number U39067) (21Asano K Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was excised from an untagged construct in pET-28c by digesting with XbaI and XhoI and ligating into the equivalent sites of pFASTpET. Similarly, the eIF3g sequence (accession no. U96074) was released from pET-T7p44 (22Block K.L. Vornlocher H.P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by digesting with XbaI and XhoI and inserted into pFASTpET. The full-length cDNA of eIF3b (accession no. U62583), a kind gift from Nahum Sonenberg (McGill University), was modified by PCR to include NcoI and NdeI sites at the 5′-end of the construct by using the primer 5′-CCATGGGGCATATGCAGGACGCGGAGAACGT-3′. This allowed the creation of an untagged eIF3b coding sequence when ligated between NcoI and XhoI in FLAG-FASTBAC1. Full-length eIF3a (accession no. D50929) was modified by PCR so that the full-length coding sequence could be released by digestion with NdeI and SalI. The digestion of FLAG-FASTBAC1 containing untagged eIF3b with NdeI and XhoI allowed the ligation of eIF3a that had been digested with NdeI and SalI to result in untagged eIF3a.To create FLAG fusion proteins, constructs were generated as follows. eIF3g and eIF3j were excised from pET-NHp44 (22Block K.L. Vornlocher H.P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and pET-NHp35 (22Block K.L. Vornlocher H.P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) respectively, by digestion with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into FLAG-FASTBAC1 at the equivalent sites. eIF3i was subcloned from pGEXp36 (21Asano K Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) into pET-28c by digesting with NdeI and EcoRI and the resulting construct digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into FLAG-FASTBAC1 at the equivalent sites. The PCR-modified eIF3b sequence was digested with NdeI and XhoI and inserted into the same restriction sites of FLAG-FASTBAC1, while the PCR-modified eIF3a was digested with NdeI and SalI and inserted into the NdeI and XhoI sites of FLAG-FASTBAC1.The recombinant FASTBAC vectors above were recombined with baculovirus DNA using DH10BAC E. coli (Invitrogen) and the high molecular weight DNA (“bacmid”) purified according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Sf9 cells were transfected with bacmid DNA by using the calcium phosphate method (Promega) and viral stocks were prepared by three-step growth amplification according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. eIF3b-HMK-FLAG, eIF3j-HMK-FLAG, and His6-eIF3c-Myc viruses were kind gifts from Hiroaki Imataka, Shigenobu Morino, and Nahum Sonenberg (McGill University).Expression of eIF3 Subunits and Preparation of Cell Extracts—Sf9 cells (1 × 107) were infected with baculoviruses expressing a single FLAG-tagged subunit of eIF3 and/or untagged subunits of eIF3, as indicated in each experiment. The cells were grown for 24 h and then supplemented with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine for an additional 36 h. Cells were harvested after placing on ice, by washing once with phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl) and scraping in 1 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Following a 5-min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g in a cooled microcentrifuge. The supernatant was either used immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C.Immunoprecipitations and Western Blots—For isolation of FLAG-tagged proteins and associated proteins, Sf9 cell extracts were subjected to affinity purification on anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, cell extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG beads at 4 °C with gentle agitation for 30 min. The resin was washed four times with Buffer A, and protein was eluted by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min with FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol). A fraction of the recovered proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gel was analyzed either by Coomassie Blue staining, exposure to x-ray film overnight to detect radioactive bands, or transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) for Western blotting. eIF3 subunits were detected with polyclonal goat anti-eIF3 antiserum (1:2000), whereas eIF3c-Myc was probed with monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein bands were revealed by incubation with the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody.Purification of eIF3 and 40 S Ribosomal Subunits—eIF3 was purified from HeLa cells as described previously (23Brown-Luedi M.L. Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Yau M.-P.P. Corbett S. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, HeLa cell lysate from 200 g of cell pellet was passed through Q Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange media and eluted using a potassium chloride gradient. Fractions containing eIF3 were precipitated using ammonium sulfate and then passed through a Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fractions were then diluted and purified using cation exchange. The purity of eIF3 was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.Ribosomal subunits were isolated from HeLa cells as described (24Falvey A.K. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Purity of the ribosomal subunits was assessed by sucrose gradient centrifugation; quality was demonstrated by their efficient formation of 80 S ribosomes in 5 mm Mg(OAc)2 buffer (10Chaudhuri J. Chowdhury D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17975-17980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Falvey A.K. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).Assembly and Analysis of 40 S Ribosomal Complexes—40 S complexes were assembled by incubating purified 40 S ribosomal subunits (17 pmol) with either purified HeLa eIF3 (17 pmol), radiolabeled recombinant subcomplexes, or individual recombinant subunits isolated, and purified from insect cells. Following incubation for 3 min at 37 °C in Buffer B lacking glycerol, the reactions were chilled for 5 min on ice, layered over 10–40% (w/v) linear sucrose gradients containing buffer B, and centrifuged in a Beckman SW-40 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 3.5 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, each gradient was fractionated using an ISCO gradient fractionator, and the absorbance profile at 254 nm was monitored. Fractions were collected, precipitated with methanol, and the presence of eIF3 subunits determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and/or Coomassie Blue staining. Alternatively, the total radioactivity in each gradient fraction was determined by measuring trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in a scintillation counter.RESULTSExpression of Human eIF3 Subunits in Sf9 Cells and Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—Construction and production of baculoviruses expressing each subunit of human eIF3 that has a homolog in S. cerevisiae (subunits a, b, c, g, i, and j) were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, all but the eIF3c subunit was tagged at the N terminus with a FLAG peptide, allowing for more efficient purification. Extracts prepared from Sf9 cells infected with individual recombinant baculovirus strains were subjected to affinity purification by using anti-FLAG beads and proteins were eluted with the FLAG peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of the purified FLAG-tagged eIF3b, eIF3g, eIF3i, and eIF3j preparations exhibits a single major protein band, indicating that these proteins are stable as isolated subunits in insect cells (Fig. 1A). Each of the proteins has an apparent molecular weight equal or very close to the corresponding subunit derived from eIF3 purified from HeLa cells.eIF3a also was expressed in Sf9 cells but does not accumulate to a high level in the soluble fraction of cell extracts (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Instead, a large amount of eIF3a was found in the insoluble fraction (data not shown), which may be due to denaturation or an association of eIF3a with components of the cytoskeleton (25Pincheira R Chen Q Huang Z. Zhang J.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Palecek J. Hasek J. Ruis H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27Lin L. Holbro T Alonso G. Gerosa D. Burger M.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if coinfection of cells with other subunits of eIF3 might promote the solubility of eIF3a in cell extracts. Previously, both eIF3b and eIF3c have been shown to bind to eIF3a in mammalian (28Méthot N. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and yeast (29Valasek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) eIF3. While eIF3c did not affect the solubility of eIF3a in Sf9 cells (data not shown), when cells were coinfected with viruses expressing eIF3a and eIF3b (Fig. 1B, lane 2) a significant amount of eIF3a became soluble in these cell extracts. This presumably reflects an association of the two proteins in vivo.Our results show for the first time that the baculovirus overexpression system efficiently produces relatively large amounts of eIF3 subunits that generally are not proteolyzed, in contrast to what is seen when Escherichia coli is used to express the larger subunits (subunits a, b, and c). 2H-P. Vornlocher and K. Block, unpublished results. However, the expression of eIF3b in Sf9 cells does result in a minor amount of this protein being cleaved into at least two distinct fragments. The N-terminal fragment (∼70 kDa) is recovered on anti-FLAG beads by virtue of its FLAG tag, and is readily detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1A). However, the N-terminal fragment does not label efficiently with [35S]methionine (Fig. 2B), as it possesses only 3 of 16 methionines found in eIF3b. The extent of cleavage of eIF3b during its overexpression in Sf9 cells was found to vary between experiments, although the reasons for this variability are not clear.Fig. 2eIF3c associates weakly with a stable eIF3 core complex. Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculovirus strains expressing eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, eIF3g, and eIF3i and were grown in the presence of [35S]methionine between 24 and 60 h post-infection. A, cells were infected with viruses encoding either eIF3b tagged with a FLAG peptide linked to a heart muscle kinase phosphorylation peptide (HMK) (eIF3bFlag, lane 1), or untagged eIF3b (lane 2), together with a His6-Myc-tagged eIF3c and untagged eIF3a, eIF3g, and eIF3i subunits. eIF3b and associated proteins were recovered using anti-FLAG affinity beads, and the recovered proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained gel is shown. B, autoradiograph of the gel shown in A is presented. C, experiment was repeated, but recovered proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antiserum to identify eIF3c in the FLAG-tagged complex. Lanes 3 and 4 show the recovered proteins following elution from anti-FLAG beads in the presence of FLAG-HMK eIF3b (lane 3) and in the presence of untagged eIF3b (lane 4). Lanes 1 and 2 show 1% of the amounts of cell extract used for the affinity purifications shown in lanes 3 and 4, respectively. The migration position of eIF3c is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Complex Formation and Purification of Human eIF3 Subcomplexes—Following the observation that human eIF3 subunits are efficiently expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system, we sought to determine whether these subunits would form a stable subcomplex that resembles the S. cerevisiae eIF3 core complex. To this end, we coinfected Sf9 cells with 5 different recombinant baculovirus strains encoding the a, b, c, g, and i subunits of human eIF3. To allow for rapid purification of the resulting complex, eIF3b was expressed as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein, while the other subunits were expressed as untagged proteins. Efforts were made to adjust the amounts of viruses used during the coinfection so that each subunit would be expressed in approximately stoichiometric amounts. Purification with anti-FLAG beads results in a complex that possesses at least four of the eIF3 subunits (eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i), as observed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2A, lane 1) and autoradiography (Fig. 2B, lane 1). As a negative control, a similar coinfection was performed with untagged eIF3b; none of the eIF3 subunits binds to the FLAG beads (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 2). The finding that three subunits co-elute with FLAG-eIF3b in approximately stoichiometric amounts suggests that all four proteins are present together in a complex (but see “Discussion” below).Since eIF3b and eIF3c do not separate well by SDS-PAGE, it was important to determine whether eIF3c also associates with the complex. To answer this question, a His6-Myc-tagged eIF3c subunit was used during coinfections as described above. Immunoblotting with specific anti-Myc antibodies indicates that the cell extract contains soluble eIF3c prior to FLAG purification (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). However, only a very small amount (∼0.5%) of available eIF3c associates with the purified FLAG-tagged eIF3 subcomplex (Fig. 2C, lane 3), and no eIF3c is found in the control purification lacking the FLAG tag (Fig 2C, lane 4). In addition, immunoprecipitation of this particular coinfection with an anti-Myc affinity resin shows purification of His6-Myc-eIF3c without appreciable amounts of the other eIF3 subunits (data not shown). Therefore, eIF3c is able to associate with the four-subunit eIF3 subcomplex, but does so only weakly under these expression and purification conditions. We conclude that the tags on eIF3c are not the cause of its inability to bind stably, because untagged eIF3c also does not incorporate efficiently into the eIF3abgi subcomplex (data not shown). Similarly, the tag on eIF3b likely does not impede eIF3c incorporation into the complex, because the complex purified through a His6-tagged eIF3a instead of FLAG-eIF3b also is deficient in eIF3c (data not shown).Interactions between the Human eIF3 Core Subunits—Since the physical linkages among human eIF3 subunits have not been fully elucidated, we investigated subunit interactions in the eIF3 subcomplexes using the baculovirus expression system. By coexpressing combinations of the four eIF3 subunits in Sf9 cells and isolating complexes using a single FLAG-tagged subunit in each case, we have verified that the interactions between the human subunits resemble those in yeast eIF3 (29Valasek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subcomplexes were isolated that contain b-g, b-i, b-j, b-g-i, and b-i-j (Fig. 3). eIF3b appears to be a central scaffolding subunit to which most, if not all, of the other eIF3 core subunits bind, including eIF3a, eIF3g, eIF3i, and eIF3j (Figs. 1 and 3, and data not shown). Unfortunately, the low affinity of eIF3c to the four-subunit subcomplex in this system prevents us from determining its protein interactions at the present time. Interestingly, the binding of either eIF3g or eIF3i to eIF3b is enhanced by the presence of the other subunit (Fig. 3). Additionally, eIF3g and eIF3i are able to form a stable dimer, but do not bind individually or as a dimer to eIF3j (Fig. 3A, lane 5 and data not shown). These types of mapping experiments suggest that human and yeast eIF3 have similar core structures.Fig. 3Interactions of human eIF3 subunits.A, Sf9 cells were infected with combinations of baculovirus strains encoding eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i, together with either FLAG-HMK-tagged eIF3j (lanes 1–5) or untagged eIF3j (lane 6), as indicated below each lane. Cells were grown in the presence of [35S]methionine between 24 and 60 h post-infection. Extracts were prepared and treated with anti-FLAG beads. Recovered proteins were eluted from the beads using FLAG peptide and were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resulting autoradiograph of the gel is shown, and the bands corresponding to eIF3b, eIF3g, eIF3i, and FLAG-eIF3j are indicated. B, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus strains expressing either FLAG-tagged eIF3b (lanes 1–3) or untagged eIF3b (lane 4), together with eIF3g (lane 2), eIF3i (lane 1), or both eIF3g and eIF3i (lanes 3 and 4). Cells were grown in the presence [35S]methionine between 24 and 60 h post-infection, and FLAG-tagged eIF3b and associated proteins were recovered and analyzed as described in A. An autoradiograph of the gel is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)eIF3j Promotes the Stable Association of eIF3 Subcomplexes to the 40 S Ribosomal Subunit—In light of the above observations, we asked whether or not a subcomplex of human eIF3 composed of the eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3g, and eIF3i subunits (eIF3abgi) is sufficient to confer the ribosome binding function of eIF3. This seemed rather likely, as all the subunits have been identified as RNA-binding proteins except eIF3i, and purified mammalian eIF3 binds in vitro to 40 S ribosomal subunits with high affinity (Ref. 1Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3005-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). and data not shown). To test for 40 S ribosome binding, we purified the four-subunit subcomplex containing FLAG-tagged eIF3b that had been labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Note that in this preparation, the eIF3a subunit is substoichiometric. In vitro binding was tested by incubating the radiolabeled subcomplex with 40 S ribosomal subunits and analyzing the mixture by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Surprisingly, the four-subunit subcomplex does not stably associate with 40 S ribosomal subunits, although radioactivity between the top of the gradient and the 40 S peak indicates a weak interaction (Fig. 4B, lower panel). We then asked if the subcomplex required additional eIF3 subunits in order to bind 40 S ribosomes more tightly. A radiolabeled five-subun"

Although there are many intracellular strategies to address neurodegeneration, for example, which transgene to use, one fundamental criterion for the long-term survival of neurons may be their genetic modification. Here, we describe the generation and in vivo efficacy of helper-dependent canine adenovirus (CAV-2) vectors that preferentially transduced neurons and efficiently trafficked via axonal retrograde transport. We used a flexible strategy and the synergy between Cre/loxP and nonlethal packaging-defective helper vectors to generate high titer helper-dependent vector stocks. One year after striatal injections in the rat brain, we found stable, high-level expression in striatal neurons, ~50% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and the cholinergic neurons in the basal nuclei of Meynert. Due to the intrinsic properties of helper-dependent CAV-2 vectors (27-kb cloning capacity; low preexisting, innate, and induced immunogenicity; retrograde transport; and long-term transgene expression), they will aid fundamental and applied studies in neurobiology. Moreover, helper-dependent CAV-2 vectors may be clinically relevant for the treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases."

In the quiescent state they are characterized by desmin-positive but α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-negative staining (1Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Applegate T.L. Norton I.D. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1998; 43: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). When cultured in vitro, PSCs are autoactivated (autotransformed), changing their morphological and functional features (2Bachem M.G. Schneider E. Gross H. Weidenbach H. Schmid R.M. Menke A. Siech M. Beger H. Grunert A. Adler G. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). PSCs commence losing vitamin A containing lipid droplets, highly proliferating, increasing expression of α-SMA, and producing and secreting extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin. Namely, PSCs are autotransformed to myofibroblast-like cells. In vivo, PSCs are also activated during both human and experimental pancreatic fibrosis (3Haber P.S. Keogh G.W. Apte M.V. Moran C.S. Stewart N.L. Crawford D.H. Pirola R.C. McCaughan G.W. Ramm G.A. Wilson J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Therefore, PSCs are believed to play an important role in pancreatic fibrogenesis. TGF-β1 is one of major profibrogenic cytokines in various tissues. Recently, evidence for TGF-β participation in pancreatic fibrogenesis has been mounting. In this regard, it has been noted that transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β1 in islet cells develop fibrosis of exocrine pancreas (4Lee M.S. Gu D. Feng L. Curriden S. Arnush M. Krahl T. Gurushanthaiah D. Wilson C. Loskutoff D.L. Fox H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 42-52PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of TGF-β1 by anti-TGF-β1 antibody reduced extracellular matrix production in rat cerulein pancreatitis (5Menke A. Yamaguchi H. Gress T.M. Adler G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 295-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). TGF-β1 has also been shown to promote PSC activation and collagen production and to inhibit proliferation of PSCs in an autocrine manner (6Kruse M.L. Hildebrand P.B. Timke C. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Regul. Pept. 2000; 90: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Darby S.J. Rodgers S.C. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1999; 44: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In human chronic pancreatitis tissue, TGF-β1 expression was observed in acinar cells adjacent to areas of fibrosis and in spindle cells in fibrotic bands (3Haber P.S. Keogh G.W. Apte M.V. Moran C.S. Stewart N.L. Crawford D.H. Pirola R.C. McCaughan G.W. Ramm G.A. Wilson J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β1 is thought to promote pancreatic fibrosis, in part by modulating PSC functions. However, the intracellular signaling pathway(s) through which TGF-β1 regulates PSC functions is still uncertain. Sma- and Mad-related proteins (Smads) are a group of recently identified molecules that function as intracellular signaling mediators and modulators of TGF-β family members (8Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar, 9Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). Smads can be classified into three groups: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smad (Co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smad). In TGF-β signaling pathway, Smad2 and Smad3 function as R-Smads, Smad4 functions as a Co-Smad, and Smad7 functions as an I-Smad. Upon TGF-β binding to TGF-β type II receptor, the type II receptor kinase phosphorylates the GS domain of TGF-β type I receptor, leading to activation of the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor kinase phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3 (R-Smads) at two serine residues in the SSXS motif at their extreme C termini (10Macias-Silva M. Abdollah S. Hoodless P.A. Pirone R. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 1215-1224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 11Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 form oligomeric complexes with Smad4 (Co-Smad); the complexes then translocate into the nucleus. These complexes then activate the transcription of target genes. Thus, TGF-β intracellular signaling involves dual Smad-dependent pathways, namely, Smad2- and Smad3-dependent pathways. In addition to Smad-mediated signaling pathways, other signaling pathways have also been shown to mediate TGF-β signaling. For example, TGF-β activates Rho-GTPase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and protein kinase B (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). However, a direct link between these mediators and TGF-β receptors has not been demonstrated unequivocally (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Because TGF-β1 stimulus is transduced through the multiple intracellular pathways described above, the elucidation of the signaling pathways through which TGF-β1 regulates PSC functions is likely to provide new insights related to the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic fibrosis. We therefore conducted the present study to examine these pathways by applying adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3. However, because Smad2 and Smad3 compete with each other at the receptor and for Smad4-binding steps for their activation, overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 blocks endogenous Smad3 and Smad2 functions by competing at the binding steps to TGF-β receptor and Smad4. Thus, the possibility remains that the observed effects of Smad2 and Smad3 overexpression on PSC functions may result from the blockade of endogenous Smad3 and Smad2 function but may not result from the enhancement of Smad2 and Smad3 activity by their overexpression. To exclude this possibility, we investigated Smad2- and Smad3-specific roles in TGF-β1 regulation of PSC functions by co-expression of dominant-negative Smad2/3 with Smad2 or Smad3. Although the dominant-negative Smad2/3 mutant was generated by substituting Glu for Asp-407 of Smad3, which is defective in TGF-β receptor-dependent phosphorylation, this mutant possesses a dominant-negative effect on both Smad2 and Smad3 (13Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, we designated the mutant as dominant-negative Smad2/3. In this way, expression of dominant-negative Smad2/3 blocks both endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 functions at TGF-β receptor-dependent phosphorylation step. Therefore, the co-expression of Smad2 or Smad3 with dominant-negative Smad2/3 rescues only Smad2- or Smad3-dependent pathways, respectively. Thus, we can examine Smad2- and Smad3-specific signaling pathways. Using this method, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 activates PSCs through a Smad2-dependent pathway and inhibits their proliferation through a Smad3-dependent pathway. Moreover, TGF-β1 enhanced its own mRNA expression and peptide secretion of PSCs through an ERK-dependent pathway. Materials—Nycodenz, Pronase, and anti-α-SMA antibody were purchased from Sigma. DNase I and collagenase P were from Roche Applied Science. Anti-Smad2, anti-Smad3, anti-Smad4, and anti-ERK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphorylated ERK was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). PD98058 was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Isolation and Culture of Rat Pancreatic Stellate Cells—Rat pancreatic stellate cells were prepared as described (1Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Applegate T.L. Norton I.D. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1998; 43: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat pancreas was digested in Gey’s balanced salt solution supplemented with 0.05% collagenase P, 0.02% Pronase, and 0.1% DNase. After filtration through nylon mesh, the cells were centrifuged on a 13.2% Nycodenz gradient at 1400 × g for 20 min. PSCs were collected from the band just above the interface of the Nycodenz solution and the aqueous layer, washed, and resuspended in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. PSCs were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. All of the experiments were carried out using PSCs from passages 2 and 3. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (14Ohnishi H. Mine T. Shibata H. Ueda N. Tsuchida T. Fujita T. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out as described before (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I.

Adenovirus Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses containing recombinant Smad DNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Miyazono (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). For a single adenovirus infection, the cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus at a dose of 10 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell in the culture media described above. In the experiments using double adenovirus infection, the cells were infected with dominant-negative Smad2/3 adenovirus (AdDNSmad2/3) at a dose of 10 pfu/cell, simultaneously with Smad2 (AdSmad2) or Smad3 (AdSmad3) adenovirus at doses of 1, 5, or 10 pfu/cell. Subsequent experiments were performed 48 h after infection. An adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) was used as an infection control. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Yule D.I. Baker C.W. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

The samples were examined by epifluorescence microscopy (see Fig. 2) and confocal fluorescence microscopy (see Fig. 3) (Fluoview FV300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) using an Olympus BX51 microscope. The images were digitized and then processed using Photoshop 5.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA).Fig. 3Characterization of dominant-negative Smad2/3 expressed in PSCs.

[3H]Thymidine was added to the culture medium and incubated for 2 h, and the incorporation of radioactivity was measured as described previously (17Kanamaru C. Yasuda H. Takeda M. Ueda N. Suzuki J.

Measurement of TGF-β1 Peptide Secretion—TGF-β1 peptide secretion was examined by determining the concentration of TGF-β1 peptide in a culture medium of PSCs using a commercial kit from DRG International (Mountainside, NJ), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Competitive Reverse Transcription-PCR of TGF-β1 mRNA—Total RNA was obtained from PCS cells by using ISOGEN (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), followed with synthesis of double-stranded DNA as described previously (18Ohnishi H. Ohgushi N. Tanaka S. Mogami H. Nobusawa R. Mashima H. Furukawa M. Mine T. Shimada O. Ishikawa H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2304-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Competitive PCR of TGF-β1 mRNA was performed using the competitive PCR kit for rat TGF-β1 (Maxim Biotech Inc., San Francisco, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In this method, 189- and 250-bp PCR fragments are generated by amplifying a DNA competitor and rat TGF-β1 cDNA, respectively. Expression of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 Proteins in PSCs— We first examined the expression of R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) and Co-Smad (Smad4) in rat PSCs. To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation of Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 from crude extract of rat PSCs, using antibodies specific to each Smad. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the three Smads were immunoprecipitated from rat PSCs, suggesting that essential components of both Smad2- and Smad3-dependent TGF-β1 signaling pathways are present in PSCs. TGF-β Induced the Nuclear Accumulation of both Smad2 and Smad3 in PSCs—We next examined whether Smad2- and Smad3-dependent TGF-β1 signaling pathways are functioning in PSCs. Because the levels of endogenously expressed Smad2 and Smad3 are not sufficient to detect by immunochemistry using specific antibodies, we used adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 in PSCs. We first determined the infection efficiency by using AdLacZ infection and in situ staining with X-gal. As shown in Fig. 2, more than 98% of AdLacZ-infected PSCs expressed β-galactosidase (Fig. 2, A and B). In PSCs infected with AdSmad2 and AdSmad3, sufficient expression of Smad2 and Smad3 was observed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2, C and E). When treated with 10 pm TGF-β1, both Smad2 and Smad3 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 2, D and F). These data indicate that functional Smad2- and Smad3-dependent signaling pathways are present in PSCs. Infection Efficacy and Characterization of AdDNSmad2/3 in PSCs—We subsequently attempted to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways through which autocrine TGF-β1 modulates PSC functions using AdSmad2, AdSmad3, and AdDNSmad2/3. As described above, infection of AdSmad2 and AdSmad3 into cells resulted in expression of sufficient quantities of functional Smad2 and Smad3 proteins in PSCs, respectively. Thus, we next characterized AdDNSmad2/3 infection in PSCs with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In this experiment, we utilized anti-Smad3 antibody to identify dominant-negative Smad2/3 protein expression because AdDNSmad2/3 was generated by substituting Glu for Asp-407 of smad3. As shown in Fig. 3, AdDNSmad2/3 infection induced expression of sufficient quantities of dominant-negative Smad2/3 protein throughout the cytoplasm in PSCs (Fig. 3A). When stimulated with 10 pm TGF-β1, dominant-negative Smad2/3 did not accumulate in the nucleus but remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate that the expressed dominant-negative Smad2/3 protein is functionally defective in TGF-β signaling. In COS7 cells, the expression of dominant-negative Smad2/3 has been shown to inhibit both Smad2- and Smad3-dependent TGF-β signaling pathways by blocking Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation by TGF-β type 1 receptor (13Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thus performed the next experiments to confirm the dominant-negative nature of AdDNSmad2/3 infection in TGF-β signaling in PSCs. To this end, we investigated the effect of AdDNSamd2/3 and AdSmad2 double infection on Smad2 function in PSCs. When AdLacZ (10 pfu/cell) and AdSmad2 (1 pfu/cell) were co-infected, overexpressed Smad2 accumulated in the nucleus after stimulation with 10 pm TGF-β1 (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, when AdDNSmad2/3 (10 pfu/cell) was co-infected with AdSmad2 (1 pfu/cell) into PSCs, overexpressed Smad2 did not accumulate in the nucleus but remained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E and F). These data imply that dominant-negative Smad2/3 blocks Smad2 nuclear accumulation after TGF-β stimulation, indicating the dominant-negative effect of AdSmad2/3 infection on Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling pathway in PSCs. We further examined the effect of higher dose infection of AdSmad2 on the dominant-negative effect of AdSmad2/3 infection. When AdSmad2 was infected at the dose of 10 pfu/cell with AdDNSmad2/3 (10 pfu/cell), overexpressed Smad2 accumulated in the nucleus after stimulation with 10 pm TGF-β1, although it remained in the cytoplasm to some extent (Fig. 3, G and H). These data indicate that the Smad2- and Smad3-dependent signaling pathways attenuated by AdDNSmad2/3 infection can be rescued by higher doses of co-infected AdSmad2 or AdSmad3. Infection of AdSmad2, AdSmad3, or AdDNSmad2/3 Did Not Alter TGF-β1 mRNA Expression or TGF-β1 Peptide Secretion of PSCs—After the evaluation of the effects of infection of these adenoviruses on TGF-β signaling pathways in PSCs as described above, we examined whether their infection into PSCs alters TGF-β1 mRNA expression level and the amount of autocrine TGF-β1 peptide of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4, TGF-β1 mRNA expression level of PSCs was not altered by the infection of AdSmad2, AdSmad3, or AdDNSmad2/3. In addition, TGF-β1 peptide secretion from PSCs was not affected by their infection (Table I). These data indicate that we can observe the effect of these adenoviruses infections on diverse PSC functions modulated by autocrine TGF-β1, regardless of the effect of the infection on the amount of autocrine TGF-β1.Table ITGF-β1 peptide concentration (ng/ml) in the culture medium of PSCs infected with AdSmad2, AdSmad3, or AdDNSmad2/3LacZ2.65 ± 0.45Smad22.23 ± 0.22Smad32.55 ± 0.28DN-Smad2/32.26 ± 0.36 Open table in a new tab Effects of Smad2, Smad3, and Dominant-negative Smad2/3 Overexpression on PSC Activation—We examined involvement of Smad2 and Smad3 in PSC activation using adenovirus-mediated overexpression of the proteins. PSC activation was examined by determining the amount of α-SMA protein in PSCs with Western blotting. Overexpression of dominant-negative Smad2/3 inhibited PSC activation (Fig. 5), indicating that TGF-β1 activates PSCs through a Smad-dependent pathway. Moreover, overexpression of Smad2 but not Smad3 enhanced PSC activation, suggesting that TGF-β1 activates PSCs through a Smad2-dependent but not a Smad3-dependent pathway. However, because both Smad2 and Smad3 compete with each other for receptor and for Smad4 binding steps for the activation of their pathways as described above, the possibility remained that the positive effect of Smad2 overexpression on PSC activation may have resulted from inhibition of endogenous Smad3 function and not the involvement of Smad2-dependent pathway in TGF-β1 induced PSC activation. To exclude this possibility, we investigated Smad2- and Smad3-specific roles in TGF-β1-induced PSC activation by co-infection of AdDNSmad2/3 with AdSmad2 or AdSmad3. As shown in Fig. 5, AdSmad2 co-infection with AdDNSmad2/3 rescued PSC activation inhibited by AdDNSmad2/3. On the other hand, AdSmad3 co-infection with AdDNSmad2/3 did not alter PSC activation inhibited by AdDNSmad2/3. These data suggest that TGF-β1 activates PSCs through a Smad2-dependent pathway. Effects of Smad2, Smad3, and Dominant-negative Smad2/3 Overexpression on PSC Proliferation—We next examined the pathway through which TGF-β1 inhibits PSC proliferation. PSC proliferation was examined by determining DNA synthesis by means of [3H]thymidine incorporation. AdDNSmad2/3 infection enhanced PSC proliferation, whereas AdSmad3 infection inhibited it (Fig. 6), suggesting that TGF-β1 inhibits PSC proliferation through a Smad3-dependent pathway. Moreover, results of the co-infection method showed that AdSmad3 coinfection with AdDNSmad2/3 inhibited PSC proliferation enhanced by AdDNSmad2/3. On the other hand, AdSmad2 coinfection with AdDNSmad2/3 did not alter PSC proliferation augmented by AdDNSmad2/3 infection. These data suggest that TGF-β1 inhibits PSC proliferation through a Smad3-dependent pathway. TGF-β1 Enhanced TGF-β1 mRNA Expression of PSCs through an ERK-dependent Pathway—As described above, TGF-β1 mRNA expression of PSCs was not affected by the infection of AdSmad2, AdSmad3, or AdDNSmad2/3, suggesting that the regulation of TGF-β1 mRNA expression in PSCs is independent of Smad-dependent signaling pathways. Thus, we next attempted to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of TGF-β1 mRNA expression in PSCs. To this end, we first examined whether TGF-β1 modulates its own mRNA expression in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 7A, the addition of exogenous TGF-β1 into the culture medium of PSCs enhanced TGF-β1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating TGF-β1 autoinduction independent of Smad-mediated signaling. Because mitogen-activated protein kinases including ERKs are also TGF-β signaling mediators (12Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Science. 2002; 296: 1646-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), we examined the participation of ERK-dependent pathway in the autoinduction of TGF-β1 mRNA in PSCs. For this purpose, we blocked ERK activation by using the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. PD98059 pretreatment decreased TGF-β1 mRNA expression in PSCs (Fig. 7B, first and second lanes). Moreover, the addition of exogenous TGF-β1 into the culture medium could not enhance TGF-β1 mRNA expression in PSCs pretreated with PD98059 (Fig. 7B, first and second lanes). Consistent with these data, PD98059 pretreatment decreased TGF-β1 peptide secretion from PSCs (Fig. 7C). Finally, we confirmed that TGF-β1 activates ERK in PSCs (Fig. 7D, first and second lanes), and PD98059 pretreatment blocked ERK activation (Fig. 7D, third and fourth lanes). These data indicate that TGF-β1 autoinduction in PSCs is regulated through an ERK-dependent pathway. In this study, we demonstrated that TGF-β1 regulates various PSC functions through distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Adenovirus-mediated dominant-negative Smad2/3 expression inhibited PSC activation and enhanced their proliferation but did not alter TGF-β1 mRNA expression. Co-expression of Smad2 with dominant-negative Smad2/3 restored the PSC activation inhibited by dominant-negative Smad2/3 expression. In contrast, co-expression of Smad3 with dominant-negative Smad2/3 attenuated the proliferation enhanced by dominant-negative Smad2/3 expression. Moreover, exogenous TGF-β1 increased TGF-β1 mRNA expression in PSCs, and MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 blocked it. Accordingly, TGF-β1 enhances PSC activation, inhibits their proliferation, and increases their TGF-β1 mRNA expression through Smad2-, Smad3-, and ERK-dependent pathways, respectively. Although TGF-β signaling is mediated by both Smad2- and Smad3-dependent pathways, their functional difference has been uncertain. However, studies using targeted homozygous deletion of Smad2 and Smad3 genes in mice revealed their distinct functions in embryo development. Smad2 knockout mice are embryonic lethal because of the defects of left-right patterning and mesoderm induction (19Nomura M. Li E. Nature. 1998; 393: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 20Weinstein M. Yang X. Li C. Xu X. Gotay J. Deng C.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In contrast, Smad3 knockout mice are viable but are smaller than wild-type littermates and show forelimb malformation and die because of immune function defects (21Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, using hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) derived from the Smad3 knockout mice, Schnabl et al. (23Schnabl B. Kweon Y.O. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) recently elucidated the Smad3 specific role in cellular function. They reported that Smad3 is necessary for TGF-β-mediated inhibition of HSC proliferation but not for HSC activation, which is consistent with our data on Smad3 function in PSC proliferation. However, the specific role of Smad2 in HSC function has not yet been demonstrated. Recently, using fibroblasts derived from both embryos of Smad2 and Smad3 knockout mice, Piek et al. (24Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) reported that Smad2 and Smad3 mediated the transcription of distinct genes in fibroblasts stimulated by TGF-β. Indeed, these cell systems are useful for comparing the functions of Smad2 and Smad3 in cells derived from embryos of knockout mice. However, because Smad2 knockout is lethal to embryonic mice because of embryo development defects, it had been difficult to examine specific roles of Smad2 and Smad3 concurrently in fully differentiated cells derived from matured organs. In the present study, however, we have demonstrated specific roles of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-β1 regulation of PSC functions isolated from the mature pancreas by employing adenovirus-mediated co-expression of Smad2 or Smad3 with dominant-negative Smad2/3. It is noteworthy that this method can be widely applied for the study on TGF-β intracellular signaling pathway in a variety of mature organs because adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is highly effective in various cell types. Our present observations that TGF-β1 activates PSCs through a Smad2-dependent pathway and inhibits PSCs proliferation through a Smad3-dependent pathway provide a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic fibrosis. Because TGF-β1 is a key activator of PSCs (7Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Darby S.J. Rodgers S.C. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1999; 44: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and a main inducer of pancreatic fibrosis (4Lee M.S. Gu D. Feng L. Curriden S. Arnush M. Krahl T. Gurushanthaiah D. Wilson C. Loskutoff D.L. Fox H. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 42-52PubMed Google Scholar), the therapeutic effect of TGF-β1 stimulus inhibition on pancreatic fibrosis has been extensively studied. For example, Menke et al. (5Menke A. Yamaguchi H. Gress T.M. Adler G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 295-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of TGF-β1 by injection of neutralizing TGF-β1 antibody reduced extracellular matrix formation in pancreatitis in vivo. However, TGF-β1 is also an autocrine inhibitor of PSC proliferation (6Kruse M.L. Hildebrand P.B. Timke C. Folsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Regul.

If TGF-β1 stimuli on PSC activation could be selectively blocked without diminishing the TGF-β1 inhibitory effect on PSC proliferation, it could be a more potent therapeutic method for pancreatic fibrosis. In this respect, our present data indicate that selective blockade of the Smad2-dependent pathway without affecting the Smad3-dependent pathway can be a novel strategy for the treatment of pancreatic fibrosis. Our data on TGF-β1 mRNA expression and peptide secretion of PSCs are important. Because TGF-β1 mRNA expression and TGF-β1 peptide secretion of PSCs were not affected by overexpression of Smad2, Smad3, or dominant-negative Smad2/3, we could apply their overexpression and co-expression to observe Smad2- and Smad3-specific roles in the regulation of PSC function by autocrine TGF-β1. We also demonstrated that TGF-β1 enhanced its own mRNA expression through a Smad-independent but ERK-dependent pathway. To date, TGF-β1 has been shown to augment the expression of its own mRNA (25Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Roche N.S. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7741-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in both normal and transformed cells, and the promoter sequences of TGF-β1 gene responsive to the autoinduction have been identified (26Kim S.J. Jeang K.T. Glick A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7041-7045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Yue and Mulder (27Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) reported that MEK-ERK pathway activation is required for TGF-β1 expression induced by TGF-β3, a TGF-β isoform derived from a gene distinct from that of TGF-β1. However, the intracellular signaling pathway of TGF-β1 autoinduction has never been demonstrated. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first report that has elucidated the intracellular signaling pathway of TGF-β1 autoinduction. In conclusion, we showed that TGF-β1 regulates PSC activation, proliferation, and TGF-β1 mRNA expression through Smad2-, Smad3-, and ERK-dependent pathways, respectively. These observations provide new insights for understanding the mechanism of pancreatic fibrosis and developing a novel therapeutic strategy for its treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2092950215,"Pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin in response to changes in the extracellular glucose. However, prolonged exposure to elevated glucose exerts toxic effects on beta cells and results in beta cell dysfunction and ultimately beta cell death (glucose toxicity). To investigate the mechanism of how increased extracellular glucose is toxic to beta cells, we used two model systems where glucose metabolism was increased in beta cell lines by enhancing glucokinase (GK) activity and exposing cells to physiologically relevant increases in extracellular glucose (3.3-20 mm). Exposure of cells with enhanced GK activity to 20 mm glucose accelerated glycolysis, but reduced cellular NAD(P)H and ATP, caused accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative damage to mitochondria and DNA, and promoted apoptotic cell death. These changes required both enhanced GK activity and exposure to elevated extracellular glucose. A ROS scavenger partially prevented the toxic effects of increased glucose metabolism. These results indicate that increased glucose metabolism in beta cells generates oxidative stress and impairs cell function and survival; this may be a mechanism of glucose toxicity in beta cells. The level of beta cell GK may also be critical in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1989744091,"We report a multifrequency (9.6-, 94-, 190-, and 285-GHz) EPR study of a freeze-quenched intermediate obtained from reaction of substrate-free cytochrome P450cam (CYP101) and its Y96F and Y96F/Y75F mutants with peroxy acids. It is generally assumed that in such a shunt reaction an intermediate [Fe(IV)=O, porphyrin-π-cation radical] is formed, which should be identical to the species in the natural reaction cycle. However, for the wild type as well as for the mutant proteins, a porphyrin-π-cation radical is not detectable within 8 ms. Instead, EPR signals corresponding to tyrosine radicals are obtained for the wild type and the Y96F mutant. Replacement of both Tyr-96 and Tyr-75 by phenylalanine leads to the disappearance of the tyrosine EPR signals. EPR studies at 285 GHz on freeze-quenched wild type and Y96F samples reveal g tensor components for the radical (stretched gx values from 2.0078 to 2.0064, gy = 2.0043, and gz = 2.0022), which are fingerprints for tyrosine radicals in a heterogeneous polar environment. The measurements at 94 GHz using a fundamental mode microwave resonator setup confirm the 285-GHz study. From the simulation of the hyperfine structure in the 94-GHz EPR spectra the signals have been assigned to Tyr-96 in the wild type and to Tyr-75 in the Y96F mutant. We suggest that a transiently formed Fe(IV)=O porphyrin-π-cation radical intermediate in P450cam is reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from these tyrosines within 8 ms.

We suggest that a transiently formed Fe(IV)=O porphyrin-π-cation radical intermediate in P450cam is reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from these tyrosines within 8 ms. The superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes are heme-containing monooxygenases in various organisms that catalyze a number of reactions, such as aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylations, epoxidations, heteroatom oxidation, and N- and O-dealkylation (1Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar), by transfer of an activated oxygen atom from its heme iron-binding site to substrates. Cytochrome P450 (P450) plays a major role in biotransformation of xenobiotics and in the biosynthesis of various endogenous compounds in animals and humans (2Lewis D.F.V. Cytochromes P450-Structure, Function, and Mechanism. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1996Google Scholar). Understanding the reaction mechanism of this class of enzymes is therefore of considerable medical and pharmacological interest. The camphor-hydroxylating cytochrome P450cam 1The abbreviations used are: P450cam, cytochrome P450cam; cpd I, compound I; PA, peracetic acid; mCPBA, m-chloroperbenzoic acid; CPO, chloroperoxidase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; hf, hyperfine; W, watts; mT, millitesla. 1The abbreviations used are: P450cam, cytochrome P450cam; cpd I, compound I; PA, peracetic acid; mCPBA, m-chloroperbenzoic acid; CPO, chloroperoxidase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; hf, hyperfine; W, watts; mT, millitesla. (CYP101) from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida is the best studied P450 so far and is regarded to be a model protein for a large number of other P450s. It is assumed that during the P450 reaction cycle an iron-oxo intermediate, compound I (cpd I), is formed. In analogy to the heme cofactor in chloroperoxidase (CPO) from Caldariomyces fumago, which has the same proximal cysteine iron ligand as P450, a Fe(IV)=O porphyrin-π-cation radical system has been suggested for cpd I in P450cam. The Fe(IV)=O porphyrin-π-cation radical, as the electronic structure of cpd I in CPO, has been deduced from UV-visible spectroscopy (rapid-scan stopped-flow studies) that showed characteristic bands at ∼370 and ∼690 nm, from resonance Raman studies that revealed the Fe-O stretch vibration at ∼790 cm–1 (3Egawa T. Proshlyakov D.A. Miki H. Makino R. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and from EPR and Mössbauer measurements of freeze-quenched samples obtained by reaction with peracetic acid (4Rutter R. Valentine M. Hendrich M.P. Hager L.P. Debrunner P.G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4769-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that the iron is Fe(IV) and that the radical couples antiferromagnetically with the iron, indicating a porphyrin radical. For P450, artificial oxidants have been used in the shunt pathway to support substrate conversion and to characterize the iron-oxo intermediate by electronic absorption spectroscopy (5Wagner G.C.

Recently, a transient absorption spectrum was observed in stopped-flow studies on CYP119, a cytochrome P450 from the thermophilic bacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus, which reacted with mCPBA (8Kellner D.G. Hung S.-C. Weiss K.E. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9641-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The intermediate is formed to ∼3% under mCPBA-limiting conditions and revealed an absorption spectrum similar to cpd I of CPO. Thus, it could be expected that freeze-quenching the intermediate and analyzing the electronic structure by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopies in a manner analogous to the studies on CPO would prove the nature of the Fe(IV)=O porphyrin-π-cation radical for P450cam. However, as will be shown, our study reveals in contrast to CPO, no EPR signal of a porphyrin-π-cation radical in P450cam, although Fe(IV) has been detected by Mössbauer spectroscopy (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Instead, concomitant with the Fe(IV), a transient organic radical was detected using 9.6-GHz EPR spectroscopy, which we have tentatively assigned to a tyrosine radical and have proposed Tyr-96 to be the radical site (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Davydov et al. (10Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G.

They detected various intermediates within the reaction cycle via EPR and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopies by stepwise annealing of the reduced oxygen complex, increasing the temperature to ∼220 K. Although the formation of a hydroxylation product of camphor was observed, the proposed cpd I intermediate could not be identified. In addition, mixed flow transient resonance Raman studies with a reconstituted P450cam system under catalytic conditions revealed an O-O stretch vibration signal very similar to the simple dioxygen complex, but no Fe-O characteristic Raman signal at ∼790 cm–1 was observed (11Egawa T. Ogura T. Makino R. Ishimura Y. Kitagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10246-10248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient state x-ray crystallographic studies by Schlichting et al. (12Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) revealed an electronic density near the heme iron in one of the two P450cam molecules located in the unit cell after reduction of the dioxygen complex by x-ray irradiation, which is interpreted to reflect the (Fe-O) species. Thus, the nature of cpd I in P450 has to date not been clarified. Theoretical studies propose several different electron and spin distributions for cpd I in P450 (13Green M.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7939-7940Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Ogliaro F. de Visser S.P. Shaik S. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 554-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Guallar V. Baik M.-H. Lippard S.J. Friesner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Soc. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). From our first 9.6-GHz EPR and Mössbauer studies (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we suggested that an intramolecular electron transfer from a tyrosine to the heme may quench the porphyrin-π-cation radical. In order to prove this hypothesis and to unequivocally identify and assign the radical observed, we performed a detailed multifrequency EPR study (9.6, 94, 190, and 285 GHz) of the intermediate of wild type, Y96F mutant, and Y96F/Y75F double mutant P450cam in the time regime up to 40 ms, which is presented in this work. These studies show that the radical observed in wild type P450cam is indeed a tyrosine radical and originates from intramolecular electron transfer to a presumably transiently formed porphyrin-π-cation radical. It also strongly suggests that intramolecular electron transfer from tyrosines near the heme can generally occur in P450 as a possible competitive reaction to the decay of cpd I via substrate hydroxylation. This may be of functional importance for the whole P450 superfamily. Plasmids—pUS200 plasmid carrying the wild type P450cam gene from P. putida was used as described (16Unger B.P. Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1158-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid carrying the Y96F mutant gene was described previously (17Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18842-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Y96F/Y75F double mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using double-stranded DNA templates made with the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The 5.5-kb plasmid pUS200 with the wild type insert (16Unger B.P. Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1158-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as DNA template. In a first step, the mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pair, 5′-GAA GCC GGC GAA GCT TTC GAC TTC ATT CCC ACC-3′ and 5′-GGT GGG AAT GAA GTC GAA AGC TTC GCC GGC TTC-3′, was used to generate a nicked double-stranded plasmid DNA carrying the Y96F mutation by PCR. Parental DNA was digested using the restriction enzyme DpnI. The nicked plasmid DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue, which circularized the nicked DNA. In a second step, the plasmid having the Y96F mutation was used as template, together with the mutagenic primer pair, 5′-CTG ATC CGT GAG GCC TTC GAA GAT TAC CGC CAC-3′ and 5′-GTG GCG GTA ATC TTC GAA GGC CTC ACG GAT CAG-3′, to generate a mutated plasmid carrying the Y75F/Y96F double mutation. Amplified plasmid DNA from PCR and subsequent DpnI digestion was also transformed into E. coli strain XL1-Blue. The correctness of mutation was checked by sequencing the plasmid. Protein Expression—E. coli strain TB1 was used as expression host for the wild type as well as for the mutant proteins. Cells were grown in standard LB medium in a 22l fermentor as described previously (18Jung C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Schröder K.-L. Simon M. Doucet J.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 35: 12855-12863Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or in flasks. Protein Purification—The purification of the expressed wild type and mutant proteins followed the same protocol (18Jung C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Schröder K.-L. Simon M. Doucet J.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 35: 12855-12863Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The final purification step of the proteins was performed with fast protein liquid chromatography-anion exchange chromatography to get an absorbance ratio Q = 392 nm/280 nm of >1.4 for 100% high spin state content. The camphor-bound wild type protein has 100% high spin content, whereas the mutant proteins show a high spin content of ∼52% determined with the fit program described earlier (19Jung C. Ristau O. Rein H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which also allows us to recalculate the absorbance corresponding to 100% needed to estimate the Q value. Camphor was removed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 5% (v/v) glycerol, Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography and final dialysis against 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. The preparation of the 57Fe derivative by the 56Fe-heme replacement followed published protocols (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Wagner G.C. Perez M. Toscano Jr., W.A. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6262-6265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidants—PA (40% solution) and mCPBA (70% w/w) were from Fluka/Riedel-de-Haën. Preparation of Reaction Intermediates by Freeze-quench Experiments—Rapid freeze-quench experiments (21Ballou D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) after 8 or 40 ms of reaction time 2Initially a reaction time of 8 ms was chosen for wild type samples (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results of the experiments with 40- and 200-ms reaction time resemble those obtained after 8 ms except that higher yields of the radical signal are observed. Therefore, in this study 40-ms reaction time was used for the wild type P450cam. were performed with a System 1000 apparatus from Update Instruments by mixing an ∼1 mm wild type or mutant P450cam solution and a 5-fold excess of PA solution in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. For comparison, mCPBA was also used as oxidant with a wild type P450:mCPBA ratio of 1:1.5, analogous to the previous study on chloroperoxidase (22Rutter R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7958-7961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the 9.6-GHz EPR study, a quartz tube (4 mm outer diameter, 3 mm inner diameter) was connected to a funnel. The funnel was completely immersed into an isopentane bath at T = –110 °C. The reaction mixtures were quenched by spraying into the cold fluid isopentane, and the frozen material so obtained was packed at the bottom of the quartz tube using a packing rod made of Teflon. For the 190- and 285-GHz EPR measurements, a Teflon cup with 7 mm inner diameter and a volume of 200 μl was attached to a quartz tube, which was connected to a funnel. The preparation procedure was identical to that used for 9.6-GHz EPR. For the preparation of the samples for the 94-GHz EPR instrument, we have constructed the setup shown in Fig. 1. It allowed collection of freeze-quenched material in a fragile quartz sample tube (0.87 mm outer diameter, 0.70 mm inner diameter) at T = –110 °C by stabilizing the tube with an additional brass holder. The high heat capacity of the brass holder served to prevent rapid warming of the sample during preparation and transfer of the small sample. The brass sample holder was connected to the glass funnel in which the freeze-quenched material was collected. A channel of 1-mm diameter connected the supported quartz tube with the glass funnel. Thus it was possible to transfer fine sample grains into the small quartz tube and to collect them at the bottom of the tube. By carefully packing these grains with a stainless steel rod (0.5 mm diameter) in fluid isopentane (T = –110 °C), it was possible to obtain a filling height of 1–2 mm, corresponding to 1–2-μl sample volume, which was sufficient for the 94-GHz EPR instrument (see below). All manipulations were performed in the cold isopentane bath. After completion of the packing procedure, the quartz tube was immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen. EPR Spectroscopy at 9.6-GHz—EPR spectra were recorded with a conventional 9.6-GHz spectrometer (Bruker 200D SRC), equipped with a helium-flow cryostat (ESR 910, Oxford Instruments) at temperatures of 20 and 140 K. EPR spectra were simulated using effective g values and angular-dependent Gaussian line shapes according to the procedure described by Beinert and Albracht (23Beinert H. Albracht S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Thus the radical signals in the large scan EPR spectra, which showed no resolved hyperfine structure, were simulated by using an isotropic g value and Gaussian line shape. Spin quantification was performed by double integration of simulated absorption-derivative subspectra. Differences in g values were taken into account using the Aasa g factor (24Aasa R. Vånngard T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar) for corrections. We also performed double integration of the total experimental EPR signal and compared it to the area of the g = 2 radical signal. These results were about the same as those obtained by the simulations within an absolute experimental error of ±5%. High Frequency EPR Spectroscopy at 94 GHz—Continuous wave high frequency EPR measurements at 94 GHz were performed on a Bruker Elexsys 680 spectrometer equipped with a fundamental mode microwave resonator. Spectra were recorded at T = 80 K. Low microwave power, typically only a few microwatts, was used in order to avoid saturation effects. For determination of precise g tensor components, the microwave frequency was measured by a frequency counter, which was integrated in the spectrometer. The magnetic field was calibrated with a g standard (lithium in LiF, g = 2.002293(2), Ref. 25Stesmans A. van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) at two different frequencies (typically 93.8 and 94.2 GHz). All spectra were recorded in the “persistent mode” of the superconducting magnet, using the room temperature coils for the field sweep to ensure high linearity and stability of the field (maximum sweep width 800 G). The modulation amplitude was kept at 0.2 mT in order to avoid modulation broadening. The design of the 94-GHz EPR microwave resonator ensures high sensitivity and a small active sample dimension (0.7 mm diameter and ∼1.5 mm height). This leads to a high homogeneity of the field over the active sample volume (better than 5 ppm) and an instrumental limit for the absolute g resolution obtained for the narrow signal of the g tensor standard of ±0.000005 (lithium in LiF, approximate line width 0.01 mT). High Frequency EPR Spectroscopy at 190 and 285 GHz—Continuous wave high frequency EPR measurements at 190 and 285 GHz were performed at the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory with a setup described in detail elsewhere (26Barra A.L. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2001; 21: 619-628Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The spectrometer works in the transmission mode without a microwave resonator. This enables EPR spectra to be recorded at several frequencies with the same experimental setup and without removing the sample. For these measurements a Gunn oscillator with a fundamental frequency of 95 GHz was used together with a frequency doubler or tripler (Radiometer Physics, Meckenheim, Germany), thereby extending the EPR frequency to 285 GHz. The lower sensitivity resulting from the absence of a microwave resonator is partly compensated by a larger sample volume, typically 0.3 ml. The field homogeneity on the sample volume is about 50 ppm, which may mask some of the hyperfine structure of the radical. The absolute g values were obtained by using the gz value, as determined from the 94-GHz EPR spectrum of the same freeze-quenched material. Simulation of High Frequency EPR Spectra—The EPR spectra were analyzed using a software for simulating and fitting EPR spectra for S = 1/2 systems with anisotropic g and hf tensors described previously (27Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus the spectra are simulated by computing the resonant field position correct to second order at the given microwave frequency, dependent on the orientation of the g and hf tensors with respect to the external magnetic field (28Rieger P.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 50: 485-489Google Scholar, 29Mombourquette H.J. Weil J.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 99: 37-44Google Scholar). No restriction for the relative orientation of the principal axes of the different tensors is applied (27Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Wild Type P450cam—The 9.6-GHz EPR spectrum obtained from substrate-free 57Fe-P450cam, which reacted with PA within 40 ms, is shown in Fig. 2A. The spectrum does not show any signal due to a magnetically coupled cpd I species. Instead, the spectrum of the starting material is superimposed by a strong radical signal that accounts for 40 ± 5% of the total observable EPR intensity in the low spin Fe(III) EPR spectral range. EPR spectra of substrate-free 57Fe-P450cam obtained after 8-ms reaction time have been already published previously (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and resemble qualitatively the spectrum in Fig. 2A except that the corresponding radical yields are 15 ± 5%. 3The reported relative yields are based on the integration of the EPR spectra at 20 K. Because quantification of freeze-quenched EPR samples is generally unreliable due to packing effects, we have performed a quantification of the ferric low spin signal by Mössbauer spectroscopy and obtained a concentration of 405 μm after 8-ms and 330 μm after 40-ms reaction time. By using these values and the relative radical yields of 15 ± 5 and 40 ± 5%, we obtain 71 ± 24 μm for the radical concentration after 8-ms and 220 ± 28 μm after 40-ms reaction time, respectively. It should be noted that the radical signal obtained at 20 K has been simulated by means of an isotropic g value of g = 2. In order to resolve hyperfine structure of the radical, a spectrum of the g ∼2 region has been taken at 140 K (inset of Fig. 2A). The native ferric form of the heme cannot be observed at this temperature, and the hyperfine structure of the radical observed at 140 K is expected not to be influenced by line broadening due to dipole interaction with nearby paramagnetic centers. The hyperfine structure of the radical observed after 40-ms reaction time presented here is the same as that observed for the 8-ms reaction time (9Schünemann V. Jung C. Trautwein A.X. Mandon D. Weiss R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is independent of whether 57Fe or 56Fe is in the heme. The hyperfine pattern of the radical resembles that of tyrosine radical intermediates of turnip isoperoxidase-7 and bovine liver catalase (31Ivancich A. Mazza G. Desbois A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6860-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and is well reproduced by the simulation shown in the inset of Fig. 2A. The simulation has been calculated using the parameters obtained for Y96* by the analysis of the high frequency data presented below (see Table II and “Discussion”). The consistent analysis of the EPR data obtained at all frequencies presented in this study allowed a reliable determination of g and hyperfine parameters that are required to identify and assign the radical. In particular the g tensor values cannot be obtained from an analysis of the 9.6-GHz data alone.Table IIProton hyperfine tensor principal values (mT) for tyrosine radicals in different enzymesTyrosine radical/organismAx (3,5)aValues are from simulations of the 94-GHz EPR spectra (Fig. 4).

https://openalex.org/W2070326775,"Ribonucleotide reductase is essential for supplying a balanced pool of the four deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis and repair. The active enzyme consists of two non-identical subunits called proteins R1 and R2. There are multiple levels of regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity, which is highest during the S and G2 phases of an unperturbed cell cycle in mammalian cells. Previous reports in the literature have indicated that the S phase-specific transcription of the mammalian R2 gene is regulated by a transcriptional block, is dependent on the transcription factor E2F1, or is simply regulated by proteins that bind to promoter CCAAT boxes plus the TATA box. Here, we demonstrate that the S phase-specific transcription of the mouse R2 gene is dependent on an upstream promoter activating region (located at nucleotides (nt) -672 to -527 from the transcription start site) and one proximal promoter repressive element (located at nt -112 to -107) that binds E2F4. Binding to the E2F site is modulated by binding of nuclear factor-Y to an adjacent CCAAT element (nt -79 to -75). The upstream activating region is crucial for overall R2 promoter activity. Mutation of the E2F-binding site leads to premature promoter activation in G1 and increases overall promoter activity but only when the upstream activating region is present and intact. Therefore, E2F-dependent repression is essential for cell cycle-specific R2 transcription.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) 1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; NF, nuclear factor; nt, nucleotide(s).1The abbreviations used are: RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; NF, nuclear factor; nt, nucleotide(s). is essential for de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are required for DNA replication and repair (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The RNR-catalyzed reduction of ribonucleotides is the rate-limiting step in DNA precursor biosynthesis. Synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides is an extremely well regulated reaction. A failure in the control of the dNTP levels and/or their relative amounts leads to cell death or genetic abnormalities (2Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 3Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic RNRs are composed of two non-identical homodimeric subunits, a large subunit (R1) and a small subunit (R2), which are both required for activity. The R1 subunit contains the catalytic site and, in addition, allosteric sites that control both enzyme activity and specificity by binding nucleoside triphosphates. The R2 subunit contains a non-heme iron center, which generates a tyrosyl free radical essential for catalysis. In human and mouse cells, the genes encoding the R1 and R2 proteins are situated on different chromosomes (4Brissenden J.E. Caras I. Thelander L. Francke U. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 174: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Yang-Feng T.L. Barton D.E. Thelander L. Lewis W.H. Srinivasan P.R. Francke U. Genomics. 1987; 1: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The transcription of the R1 and R2 genes is cell cycle-regulated, with undetectable mRNA levels in G0/G1 phase cells and maximal levels in S phase cells (6Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The R1 protein has a long half-life, and its levels are almost constant and in excess in proliferating cells (7Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is therefore determined by R2 protein levels. The R2 protein is stable during S phase and is degraded in late mitosis. The degradation depends on a KEN box sequence recognized by the Cdh1·anaphase-promoting complex active in late mitosis and during G0/G1 (8Chabes A.L. Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3925-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The R2 protein is stabilized after DNA damage during S phase (9Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In resting cells, DNA damage induces transcription of the R1 (but not R2) gene. Instead, p53 induces the p53R2 gene encoding a homologous R2 protein, p53R2, capable of forming an active RNR together with the R1 protein (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 11Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Graäslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to allosteric regulation and transcriptional regulation, RNR activity is controlled by binding of a protein inhibitor, Sml1, to the R1 subunit in budding yeast and by an R2 transcriptspecific cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, Cid13, in fission yeast (12Saitoh S. Chabes A. McDonald W.H. Thelander L. Yates J.R. Russell P. Cell. 2002; 109: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Zhao X. Chabes A. Domkin V. Thelander L. Rothstein R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3544-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The S phase-specific transcription of the TATA-less mouse R1 gene is controlled by proteins that bind to four different promoter elements, β, α, Inr (initiator), and γ (14Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All elements are highly conserved in the human R1 gene promoter. The almost identical β and α elements control promoter strength, and one of the proteins that bind to these elements is the transcription factor YY-1. The cell cycle-specific expression of R1 is controlled by proteins that bind to the Inr element and the downstream γ element (14Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Less is known about the cell cycle-regulated transcription of the R2 gene, and there are no obvious sequence homologies to the R1 gene that could explain the common S phase-specific expression pattern. We have previously demonstrated that 1500 bp of the mouse R2 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene provides S phase-specific expression in transfected mouse cells (9Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We also know that mutating a proximal promoter NF-Y-binding CCAAT box decreases promoter strength by ∼80%, whereas mutating the non-canonical TTTAAA box decreases promoter strength by only 10–20%. Neither mutation affects the cell cycle-specific expression pattern. In the absence of the TTTAAA box, R2 transcription is directed by sequences downstream of the transcription start site interacting with TAFIIs (15Kotova I. Chabes A.L. Lobov S. Thelander L. Bjorklund S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1791-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 16Kotova I. Chabes A.L. Segerman B. Flodell S. Thelander L. Bjorklund S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4527-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Together with a number of other S phase-specific genes such as DNA polymerase-α and thymidylate synthase, the R2 gene was activated when quiescent cells were infected with an E2F1-overproducing adenoviral vector (17DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Therefore, R2 gene expression was reported to be controlled by E2F. However, expression of E2F1–3 in quiescent cells is sufficient to induce cells to re-enter the cell cycle (18Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the activation of R2 gene expression could simply be a consequence of cells entering the S phase and not a direct effect of E2F binding to the R2 promoter. The aim of this study was to identify protein-binding regions essential for promoter activity in the mouse R2 promoter. We also wanted to identify the mechanism regulating S phase-specific expression of the R2 gene. DNase I footprinting was used to identify protein-binding DNA elements in the mouse R2 promoter. We then assayed their functional importance for S phase-specific transcription using R2 promoter-luciferase constructs and transient transfections in logarithmically growing or serum-synchronized mouse cells as well as in serum-synchronized, stably transformed cells. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify essential transcription factors that bind to the R2 promoter. Our studies show that S phase-specific transcription of the R2 gene is controlled by an upstream activating footprint region in combination with a proximal promoter repressive E2F4-binding element. Deletion of the upstream activating region nearly inactivated the promoter, whereas mutation of the E2F4-binding site led to premature G1 phase promoter activation, but only in combination with an intact upstream activating region. RNR R2 Promoter-dependent Constructs—The wild-type R2 promoter-luciferase construct pAC10, a 1517-bp R2 promoter fragment (nucleotides (nt) -1500 to +17 relative to the major transcription start site) cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega) digested with EcoICRI and NcoI, has been described previously (9Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The pAC10 construct was used as a backbone for all of the following R2 promoter-luciferase constructs. Deletion of nt -1500 to -760 in the pAC10 plasmid was done by digestion with Acc651 and SmaI, isolation of the larger fragment, filling in the ends with the Klenow fragment, and religation. The internal deletion of the DNA fragment nt -760 to -470 upstream of the transcription start site (Δ760–470) was carried out by digestion of the pAC10 plasmid with SmaI and AgeI. The resulting 570-bp fragment was digested with RsaI. Finally, the 270-bp RsaI-AgeI fragment was ligated back into the SmaI- and AgeI-digested pAC10 plasmid. The internal deletion construct Δ760–130 was created by digestion of the pAC10 plasmid with SmaI and StuI. The 630-bp insert was removed, and then the digested pAC10 plasmid was religated. Deletions of nt -1500 to -470 and nt -1500 to -130 were made using Acc651 instead of SmaI. A pAC10 construct in which the entire region from nt -623 to -597 was replaced with an unrelated DNA sequence (nt -334 to -308 in the R2 promoter, antisense strand, reverse orientation) was made by overlap extension PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′ -CTTCTGTCAGT-TCCGCTGCACACTCGTCACCATCCTGT-3′ and 5′-GCGGAACTGA-CAGAAGTACAGGTCCAGTAGTCTAAAGA-3′ in combination with one sense 17-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the sequence upstream of the SmaI site (nt -760) and one antisense 17-mer oligonucleotide complementary to the 5′-end of the luciferase gene. The PCR product was digested with SmaI and NcoI and ligated into the pAC10 plasmid digested with the same enzymes. Mutation of all four putative E2F sites (mE2F-I–IV) was done by stepwise ligation of 10 oligonucleotides, creating a double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to nt -203 to +17 with an AgeI site in the 5′-end and an NcoI site in the 3′-end of the fragment. The oligonucleotides used were as follows (with mutated nucleotides shown in boldface): in the direct orientation, 5′-CCGGTTCCGGCCCGACTAGCGCT-GA-3′, 5′-GGCACCCGGCCGGCGCAGGCTCCTTAAAGGTCTTTGTG-CGGAAGGCCTGC-3′, 5′-GGCGCAACTCAAATCTCCGCATCTGGGC-GGCGAGCGGGGTCAGCGGCGTC-3′, 5′-CAATGGGAGGCGAGGCC-ACGCCCCCTCGGAGCGGCTAGTTGGGTGGCTCT-3′, and 5′-TTAA-AGGGCGCGGGCGCTGGCAGTCGGGGTGCACCGGATTCCAGC-3′; and in the reverse orientation, 5′-CATGGCTGGAATCCGGTGCACCG-CCGACTG-3′, 5′-CAGCGCCCGCGCCCTTTAAAGAGCCACCCAACT-AGCCGCTCCGAGGGGG-3′, 5′-CGTGGCCTCGCCTCCCATTGGAC-GCCGCTGACCCCGCTCGCCGCCCAGAT-3′, 5′-GCGGAGATTTGAG-TTGCGCCGCAGGCCTTCCGCACAAAGACCTTTAAGGA-3′, and 5′-GCCTGCGCCGGCCGGGTGCCTCAGCGCTAGTCGGGCCGGAA-3′. This product was amplified in a PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-TCCTA-ACCGGTTCCGGCCCGACTAGCGCTGA-3′ and 5′-AGGCGACCATG-GCTGGAATCCGGTGCACCGCCGACTG-3′ to again create an AgeINcoI fragment (nt -203 to +17). The fragment was cloned back into pAC10 digested with AgeI and NcoI. The pairwise mutated E2F constructs mE2F-I+mE2F-II and mE2F-III+mE2F-IV were created by digesting the mE2F-I–IV construct with SmaI and StuI, resulting in a 630-bp fragment containing the mutated E2F-III and E2F-IV sites and the backbone containing the mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites. pAC10 was then digested with SmaI and StuI, resulting in a 630-bp fragment with the wild-type E2F-III and E2F-IV sites and a backbone with the wild-type E2F-I and E2F-II sites. The backbone fragments were dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, followed by ligation of the fragment containing the wild-type E2F-III and E2F-IV sites into the backbone containing the mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites and of the fragment containing the mutated E2F-III and E2F-IV sites into the backbone containing the wild-type E2F-I and E2F-II sites. To create a pAC10 plasmid containing a deletion of the upstream footprint region (Δ760–470) plus mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites, the same procedure was used as described above for the construction of the Δ760–470 plasmid, but the starting plasmid was pAC10 containing mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites. Overlap extension PCR was used to introduce a CCAAT-to-CTAGT mutation (16Kotova I. Chabes A.L. Segerman B. Flodell S. Thelander L. Bjorklund S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4527-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) in pAC10 containing mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites. The same method was used to obtain pAC10 plasmids containing either a mutated E2F-I or E2F-II site. In the PCRs, the oligonucleotide pairs 5′-TCAAATCTCCCGCGCTGGGCGGCG-3′ plus 5′-CGCCGCCCAGC-GCGGGAGATTTGA-3′ and 5′-CCTCGGAGCGCGCGGTTGGGTG-GC-3′ plus 5′-GCCACCCAACCGCGCGCTCCGAGG-3′, respectively, were used with a DNA template consisting of pAC10 with mutated E2F-I and E2F-II sites. The upstream footprint region deletions were made by PCRs using the following oligonucleotides in the direct orientation (with the positions of the deletions shown with (_): Δ1, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCCGGG_CT-TTATCTCTGGTATC-3′; Δ2, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCCGGG_GGAAACTTGA-GTTCTT-3′; Δ3, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCCGGG_CAGGAATTTGCAGATTC-3′; Δ4, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCCGGG_GCCCAGAGTCGTAAAAT-3′; Δ5, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCCGGG_CTCGTCACCATCCTGTG-3′; Δ6, 5′-CGTTTCT-CCCCGGG_ATCGTCTGGCAGCTTTT-3′; and Δ7, 5′-CGTTTCTCCCC-GGG_GGGCAGGGTAGAAAGGA-3′. Oligonucleotide 5′-CATGGCTG-GAATCCGGTGCACCGCCGACTG-3′ was used in the reverse orientation. The PCR products were digested with XmaI and AgeI and ligated into pAC10 digested with XmaI and AgeI. All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of PCR-amplified regions. Cloning of the Guinea Pig R2 Promoter—The guinea pig R2 gene promoter was cloned from a guinea pig kidney λ genomic library (Stratagene 946110) using a 1100-bp PstI-EcoRI mouse R2 cDNA fragment as a probe. The GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number for the guinea pig R2 promoter sequence is AY209181. DNase I Footprinting—The pSBR2a plasmid used for DNase I footprinting of the proximal part of the R2 promoter was made by ligating an RsaI-PstI DNA fragment from the mouse R2 gene (nt -470 to +117) to the SmaI and PstI sites of the pUC18 polylinker. Construction of the pSBR2b plasmid used for DNase I footprinting of the distal part of the R2 promoter was done by ligation of a ClaI-RsaI DNA fragment from the R2 promoter (nt -1006 to -471) to the AccI and SmaI sites of the pUC18 polylinker. pSBR2a and pSBR2b were end-labeled at either the EcoRI or HindIII site in the pUC18 polylinker with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP. Isolation of the end-labeled fragments was done by separation on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and electroelution. Incubation of crude nuclear extracts and the DNA probes, DNase I digestion, and separation on 8 m urea and 6% polyacrylamide gels were as described by Ohlsson and Edlund (19Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mouse Ehrlich-Lettre ascites cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL77) were grown as spinner cultures in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) plus 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen). The cultures were maintained at a concentration of 0.1–1 × 106 cells/ml, representing a logarithmically growing culture. Crude nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described by Parker and Topol (20Parker C.S. Topol J. Cell. 1984; 36: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) with modifications (19Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was usually between 5 and 15 mg/ml. Transient Transfection Assays—To measure the promoter strength, mouse Balb/3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL163) were transiently cotransfected with R2 promoter-luciferase constructs and a control plasmid, pRLSV40 (Promega), by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (14Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum. The cells were harvested and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase (expressed by the R2 promoter-luciferase constructs) and Renilla luciferase (expressed by the pRLSV40 plasmid) were assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The firefly luciferase activities were then divided by the Renilla luciferase activities to normalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. The values obtained represent R2 promoter activity, where the activity of the 1500-bp promoter construct is called wild-type and was set to 100%. The activities of the different mutant promoter constructs were divided by the wild-type activity to obtain percent wild-type activity. The activity values are based on at least three experiments, and the S.E. is shown with error bars. To avoid saturation effects and to make certain that luciferase expression was proportional to the amount of transfected DNA, two to four different amounts of R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene DNA were used for each construct in each experiment (usually 2–10 μg of DNA). To study the expression of the various R2 promoter-luciferase constructs during the cell cycle, the cells were synchronized by serum starvation and release after the 14-h transfection by first incubating them in fresh medium containing 1% serum for 48 h and then in medium containing 20% serum. The cells were harvested in phosphatebuffered saline at different time points, and one-half of each sample was used for monitoring the cell cycle progression by flow cytometry as described previously (9Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The other half of each sample was prepared for luciferase activity measurements as described above. Stably Transformed Cells—Stably transformed mouse cells expressing the various R2 promoter-luciferase constructs were obtained by cotransfection with a pSV2neo plasmid using electroporation and selection with G418 as described (14Johansson E. Hjortsberg K. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29816-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—Logarithmically growing mouse Balb/3T3 cells were treated with formaldehyde, swelled, and lysed, and the nuclei were sedimented and lysed as described (21Wells J. Boyd K.E. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The resulting chromatin solution was sonicated; and after microcentrifugation, 1 ml of solution (corresponding to ∼6 × 107 cells) was precleared by incubation for 15 min at 4 °C with 90 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-agarose (Sigma). One μg of antibody was added to each aliquot of chromatin and incubated as described (21Wells J. Boyd K.E. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Antibodies against E2F4 (sc-866X) and E2F1 (sc-251X) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibody against NF-YB was kindly provided by Dr. Roberto Mantovani (Dipartimento di Biologia Animale, Università di Modena e Reggio, Modena, Italy); and antibody against transcription factor II-I was kindly provided by Dr. Ananda L. Roy (Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA). Immunoprecipitations of the antibody·protein·DNA complexes were carried out with 30 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-agarose/sample. Washing, elution, cross-link reversal, preparation of the samples for PCR analyses, and PCR analyses were as described (22Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang M.Q. Zhang T. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The following R2-specific oligonucleotide primers were used: 5′-CCTTGGCACCAACCTCAGCGGC-3′ (nt -281 to -260) and 5′-CAGCGGCGACAACTGCAGCTGC-3′ (nt +130 to +109); and 5′-ACCAGTTTAGCTGACATTGCTCTGC-3′ (intron 5) and 5′-ACGTAGCCTCTTTGTCCCCAATCC-3′ (exon 6). DNA-Protein Interactions in the Mouse R2 Promoter—An end-labeled RsaI-PstI R2 promoter DNA fragment (nt -470 to +117) and unfractionated nuclear extracts isolated from logarithmically growing Ehrlich-Lettre ascites carcinoma cells were used for DNase I footprint analyses of the region around the R2 transcription start site and the proximal region of the R2 promoter. Fig. 1A shows the partial DNase I digestion pattern of the RsaI-PstI fragment labeled at the 3′-end of the coding strand with (lane 2) and without (lanes 1 and 3) prior incubation with nuclear extract. One sequence of ∼38 nt (nt -93 to -56) containing a CCAAT box was specifically protected and is designated footprint α. This element was previously demonstrated to bind NF-Y (23Filatov D. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dideoxy-A and dideoxy-C sequencing reactions were run alongside as size markers (data not shown). Assays in which the RsaI-PstI fragment was labeled at the 5′-end showed no additional protected regions (data not shown). The distal part of the R2 promoter was analyzed for DNA-protein interactions by DNase I footprinting using a ClaI-RsaI DNA fragment (nt -1006 to -471) (Fig. 1B). Protection of three closely spaced regions was observed after labeling the 3′-end of the coding strand: nt -672 to -637, nt -623 to -597, and nt -584 to -527. Experiments with the same fragment labeled on the opposite strand showed no additional protected regions (data not shown). Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts and labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to DNA sequences within region -672 to -527 gave one specific major protein·DNA complex. No clear difference in pattern was observed when nuclear extracts from cells in different growth phases were used (data not shown). Functional Analyses of the Mouse R2 Promoter—Fig. 2A shows a schematic representation of the R2 promoter with the upstream footprint region (nt -672 to -527) and the α region with the CCAAT box (nt -93 to -56) and the TATA box (nt -29 to -24). We have previously shown that a 1500-bp mouse R2 promoter is sufficient for cell cycle-specific transcription of an R2 promoter-luciferase construct transfected into mouse cells (9Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To narrow down the regions needed for R2 promoter activity, we created a number of different R2 promoter deletion-dependent luciferase constructs, taking advantage of existing restriction endonuclease sites. The promoter strength of the different constructs was tested in transient transfection assays using logarithmically growing mouse Balb/3T3 cells and cotransfection with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene construct to monitor transfection efficiencies. A linear response was observed between luciferase activity and the amount of transfected DNA using 1–10 μg of DNA for each construct. Fig. 2A shows the promoter strength of these deletion constructs compared with that of the wild-type promoter. A 760-bp promoter still containing all identified footprint regions had full promoter activity compared with the 1500-bp wild-type promoter. In contrast, a promoter with a 290-bp fragment deleted between -760 and -470 bp upstream of the transcription start site (Δ760–470) showed only 30% of the wild-type promoter activity. This result shows that the region -760 to -470 bp upstream of the transcription start site, closely corresponding to the upstream footprint region, is needed for full R2 promoter activity. A promoter with a deletion all the way from nt -760 to -130, i.e. still containing the CCAAT and TATA boxes, showed even lower promoter activity (15% of the wild-type activity). The backbone vector of all constructs, the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega), showed almost no activity by itself in the luciferase assay. The cell cycle expression pattern of the different constructs was tested in experiments in which transiently transfected cells were synchronized by serum starvation, followed by readdition of serum. The cell cycle expression patterns and expression levels were the same for the wild-type promoter and the 760-bp promoter fragment (Fig. 2B). Again, the promoter activity was dramatically decreased in the Δ760–470 construct compared with the wild-type promoter, and the low activity made it difficult to clearly observe an S phase-specific expression pattern. The Δ760–130 construct showed no significant cell cycle-related expression pattern, and the promoter activity was very low. Very similar cell cycle expression patterns were observed for serum-synchronized Balb/3T3 clones stably transformed with the R2 promoter-luciferase constructs, confirming the relevance of the transient expression experiments (Fig. 2C). To analyze the function of region -760 to -470 in more detail, we constructed a series of stepwise deletions in our R2 promoter-luciferase construct starting -760 bp from the transcription start site (Fig. 3A). Deletion constructs Δ1 and Δ2 (covering nt -760 to -690) had no effect on promoter activity compared with the wild-type promoter. However, deletion constructs Δ3–7 (covering the region between nt -760 and -505) all showed decreased promoter activity (∼30% compared with the wild-type activity). This result indicates that the region important for promoter activity is located downstream of nt -690. Mutating the region from nt -623 to -597 by replacing it with a fragment of unrelated DNA resulted in a similar decrease in promoter activity (20% of the wild-type activity), underscoring the importance of region -690 to -470. The influence on the cell cycle expression pattern of two of the deletions affecting promoter activity is shown in Fig. 3B. Deletion constructs Δ4 and Δ6 were chosen as representatives of the affected deletion constructs and showed the same pattern as the Δ760–470 construct. Similar results were obtained with deletion constructs Δ3, Δ5, and Δ7 (data not shown). In contrast, but in accordance with the promoter strength results, deletion constructs Δ1 and Δ2 had the same pattern as the wild-type promoter (data not shown). Mutating region -623 to -597 almost abolished promoter activity. In conclusion, the functional analyses of the R2 promoter region strongly support the importance of the upstream footprint region (nt -672 to -527).

These diverse cellular responses are mediated by its associated G protein-coupled receptors. However, the mechanisms and specificity by which these LPA receptors mediate LPA actions are still poorly understood. Here we show that LPA stimulation promotes the interaction of the LPA2 receptor with a focal adhesion molecule, TRIP6 (thyroid receptor interacting protein 6)/ZRP-1 (zyxin-related protein 1). TRIP6 directly binds to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA2 receptor through its LIM domains. LPA-dependent recruitment of TRIP6 to the plasma membrane promotes its targeting to focal adhesions and co-localization with actin stress fibers. In addition, TRIP6 associates with the components of focal complexes including paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, c-Src, and p130cas in an agonist-dependent manner. Overexpression of TRIP6 augments LPA-induced cell migration; in contrast, suppression of endogenous TRIP6 expression by a TRIP6-specific small interfering RNA reduces it in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. Strikingly, the association with TRIP6 is specific to the LPA2 receptor but not LPA1 or LPA3 receptor, indicating a specific role for TRIP6 in regulating LPA2 receptor-mediated signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that TRIP6 functions at a point of convergence between the activated LPA2 receptor and downstream signals involved in cell adhesion and migration.

Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although the functions of LPA were recognized in the mid-1980s, its associated receptors have just been cloned and characterized in the past few years (1Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The first three LPA receptors that have been identified belong to the membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors, including the LPA1/EDG2, LPA2/EDG4, and LPA3/EDG7 receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene family (2Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3An S. Bleu T. Huang W. Hallmark O.G. Coughlin S.R. Goetzl E.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27776-27785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Most recently, the G protein-coupled orphan receptor, p2y9/GPR23, has been recognized as the fourth LPA receptor, which is structurally distinct from the other LPA receptors (5Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound LPA receptors couple to Gq, Gi/o, or G12/13 proteins and share similar functions in mediating LPA actions (1Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, LPA has recently been identified as an agonist of the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (6McIntyre T.M. Pontsler A.V. Silva A.R. St. Hilaire A. Xu Y. Hinshaw J.C. Zimmerman G.A. Hama K. Aoki J. Arai H. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, some of the LPA signaling pathways are probably differentially regulated by different LPA receptors.LPA modulates cell adhesion and migration in many cell types by inducing actin cytoskeletal rearrangement, the assembly of focal complexes, and the formation of focal adhesions through a Rho-dependent, integrin-mediated signaling pathway (7Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 8Panetti T.S. Magnusson M.K. Peyruchaud O. Zhang Q. Cooke M.E. Sakai T. Mosher D.F. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reciprocal activation of Rho and Rac coordinates the dynamic processes of cell migration (9Rottner K. Hall A. Small J.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The assembly of focal complexes requires focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src family kinases, paxillin, and p130cas (Crk-associated substrate) (10Seufferlein T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9345-9351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins form complexes with downstream signaling molecules, Grb2 and Crk, and trigger adhesion-induced cellular responses including mitogenic signaling, cell locomotion, and cell survival (11Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Thus far, the detailed mechanisms by which LPA receptors mediate LPA-induced cell migration are not clear and remain to be explored.Recently, members of the zyxin family have been shown to localize at focal adhesions and associate with the Cas family, p130cas and CasL/HEF1 (12Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The zyxin family members, including zyxin, LPP (lipoma preferred partner), and TRIP6/ZRP-1, contain three zinc finger LIM domains at their carboxyl terminus, a proline-rich region, and nuclear export signals at their N terminus (12Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Murthy K.K. Clark K.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The LIM domain (named by the initials of three homeodomain proteins, Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) has been demonstrated to be a protein-protein interaction motif that is critically involved in their functions (16Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Zyxin has been shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton and is postulated to function in integrin-mediated signaling (17Beckerle M.C. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These zyxin family members localize at focal adhesions but may shuttle between plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus and relay unidentified signals between focal adhesions and nucleus (18Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1593: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 19Petit M.M. Meulemans S.M. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 2001; 1538: 260-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since zyxin and TRIP6 associate with Cas family members, they may cooperate to regulate cell motility (12Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 receptors share high homology in amino acid sequences except for the carboxyl-terminal region, suggesting that the cytoplasmic tail of these receptors may specifically regulate their functions in LPA signaling. In an attempt to identify the molecules that specifically involve in the function and regulation of the LPA2 receptor, we used the carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA2 receptor as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening. Here we demonstrate that the LPA2 receptor, but not LPA1 or LPA3 receptor, associates with TRIP6 by LPA stimulation. The LPA-dependent recruitment of TRIP6 to the plasma membrane promotes its targeting to focal adhesions and co-localization with actin. TRIP6 then serves as an adaptor for the assembly of focal complexes, thereby regulating LPA-induced cell migration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The clones containing full-length cDNA sequences of the LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor, and TRIP6 were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). One guanine base near the 3′ end of the coding sequences of the LPA2 receptor, which was found deleted in the I.M. A.G.E. clone 755526 (21An S. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7906-7910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 22Contos J.J. Chun J. Genomics. 2000; 64: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), has been corrected by PCR. The full-length LPA3 receptor cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells as the template. To construct the mammalian expression vectors, different cDNA fragments encoding the LPA1–3 receptors, a LPA2 receptor mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal tail (aa 296–351), TRIP6 and different truncated TRIP6 mutants were amplified by PCR and inserted into pCMV-Tag2A (Stratagene), pCMV-Tag3A (Stratagene), pEGFP (Clontech), or pHcRed1 (Clontech), respectively, such that these proteins were tagged in-frame with a FLAG epitope, a Myc epitope, a green fluorescence protein (GFP), or a far red fluorescence protein (HcRed1) at their N termini. The entire sequences of each cDNA clone were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. For in vitro binding between TRIP6 and the LPA2 receptor, cDNA fragments encoding TRIP6 or the cytoplasmic tail of the LPA2 receptor (aa 296–351) (designated LPA2R-CT) were inserted inframe into pGEX-6P-3 and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively.To inhibit the expression of endogenous TRIP6, the pSUPER vector was constructed as described (23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) and was used to direct the expression of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) of TRIP6 (designated pSUPER-siTRIP6) in mammalian cells, which specifically targets the 19-nt sequences of TRIP6, 5′-GAAGCTGGTTCACGACATG-3′.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—For the yeast two-hybrid screening, a cDNA fragment encoding LPA2R-CT was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame at the 3′-end of Gal4 DNA binding domain of the pAS2–1 yeast shuttle vector (Clontech). The entire cDNA sequences of LPA2R-CT were verified by automatic DNA sequencing. This pAS-LPA2R-CT was used as the bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library (cDNA constructed in pGAD GH) (Clontech). After co-transformation of pAS-LPA2R-CT and the library plasmids into yeast strain Y190, cells were screened on the plates lacking tryptophan, leucine and histidine supplemented with 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole at 30 °C for 3–6 days. Histidine-positive colonies were further screened for positive interaction by β-galactosidase assays. Plasmids harboring cDNA were isolated from positive yeast colonies, transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 by electroporation, and further selected on M9 plates. The positive cDNA clones were sequenced. To construct pAS-LPA3R-CT, a cDNA fragment encoding LPA3R-CT (aa 294–353) was amplified by PCR, inserted into pAS 2-1, and verified by DNA sequencing. To construct pAS-LPA1R-CT, an EcoRI/SalI cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 301–364 of the LPA1 receptor was removed from pCMV-FLAG-LPA2R and inserted into pAS2-1.Cellular Co-immunoprecipitation and in Vitro GST Pull-down—To examine cellular interaction between TRIP6 and LPA receptors, the vector expressing GFP-tagged or Myc-tagged TRIP6 (wild-type or truncation mutants) was transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells without or with the FLAG-LPA receptor-expressing vector. After starvation in 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA)-containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium overnight, cells were incubated without or with 2 μm LPA for 10 min and harvested in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysates were briefly sonicated to partially disrupt membrane fractions. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The LPA receptors were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. The co-immunoprecipitated GFP-TRIP6 and Myc-TRIP6 (wild-type or mutants) were detected with an anti-GFP or anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Similar experiments were performed to examine co-immunoprecipitation of TRIP6 with paxillin, p130cas, Myc-FAK, or HA-c-Src in HEK 293T cells. To detect the interaction between endogenous TRIP6 and transfected LPA2 receptors, NIH/3T3 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-Tag3A or pCMV-Myc-LPA2R. After treatment or not with 2 μm LPA for 10 min, Myc-LPA2R from the whole cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Babco). Co-immunoprecipitated endogenous TRIP6 was detected with a TRIP6-specific polyclonal antibody against amino acids 403–417.To assess the direct binding of TRIP6 with LPA2R-CT in vitro, GST, GST-LPA2R-CT, and GST-TRIP6 were expressed in (BL21) (DE3) (LysS) E. coli and purified by immobilizing the proteins on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST-TRIP6 was further digested with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) to cleave GST. One μg of TRIP6 protein was incubated with 1 μg of GST or GST-LPA2R-CT in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for3hat4 °C. TRIP6 pulled down by GST proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected with a TRIP6-specific antibody (Transduction Laboratories).LPA-induced Haptotactic Cell Migration—The haptotactic migration assay was performed in 12-well modified Boyden chambers with 8 μm pore-sized PET track-etched membranes (Fisher). SKOV3 cells (American Type Culture Collection) at passages 20–40 were transiently transfected with the expression vector of GFP, GFP-TRIP6, GFP-TRIP6(CT3) (aa 398–476), GFP-TRIP6(ΔC1) (aa 1–278), or GFP-TRIP6(ΔC2) (aa 1–350). Cells were trypsinized and washed with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA to remove residual LPA. Cells at a density of 150,000/well were then placed in the upper chamber of the transwells. The membrane was coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin overnight. Two μm LPA was added or not in the lower chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h. The nonmigrated cells from the top surface were removed with cotton swabs. The filter was then fixed with 3% formaldehyde, cut out and mounted on the glass slide. GFP-positive cells on the whole filter were counted by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan 2; Zeiss). Meanwhile, an aliquot of cells was plated on the coverslips. GFP-positive cells in each field were counted to ensure comparable transfection efficiency among all of the samples. To assess the inhibition of TRIP6 function by siRNA, pEGFP was co-transfected with either pSUPER or pSUPER-siTRIP6 into SKOV3 cells. LPA-induced haptotactic cell migration was assayed as described above. Meanwhile, an aliquot of cells was harvested. The expression of GFP and endogenous TRIP6 in the whole cell lysates was determined by immunoblotting probed with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a TRIP6-specific monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), respectively.Immunocytochemistry—To examine LPA-induced co-localization of TRIP6 with the LPA2 receptor, SKOV3 cells were transiently co-transfected with the plasmids expressing HcRed1-TRIP6 and GFP-LPA2R. Cells were starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.1% BSA overnight and then treated without or with 2 μm LPA for 10 min. The images of GFP-LPA2R and HcRed1-TRIP6 were directly captured by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan 2; Zeiss). To examine LPA-induced co-localization of TRIP6 with actin or focal adhesion molecules, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts or SKOV3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant GFP-TRIP6 without or with Myc-FAK were plated on coverslips in 6-well plates. After serum starvation overnight, cells were treated without or with 2 μm LPA for 15–20 min and fixed in 3% formaldehyde. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, cells were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% BSA. To visualize actin cytoskeleton, NIH/3T3 cells were stained with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) for 30 min. For immunostaining of vinculin, paxillin, and Myc-FAK, SKOV3 cells were incubated with an anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-paxillin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, for 1 h, and then with the Texas Red-X anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for another 1 h.RESULTSThe Carboxyl-terminal Tail of the LPA2 Receptor, but Not LPA1 or LPA3 Receptor, Interacts with the LIM Domains of TRIP6—Among the amino acid sequences of all three LPA receptors, the carboxyl-terminal region of these receptors is much less homologous. The overall identity of the cytoplasmic tails is 27% between the LPA1 and LPA2 receptors and 17% between the LPA2 and LPA3 receptors. This diversity could account for the receptor specificity in mediating LPA signaling. In an attempt to identify the molecules that are specifically involved in LPA2 receptor-mediated signaling, a fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal tail (aa 296–351) of the LPA2 receptor (designated LPA2R-CT) and the Gal4 DNA binding domain was used as the bait to screen a HeLa cell cDNA library. A total of 4 million clones were screened, and 28 positive clones encoding the carboxyl sequences of TRIP6 (aa 220–476 and 308–476) were isolated (Fig. 1A). These two clones, designated TRIP6(ΔN1) and TRIP6(ΔN2), encode the carboxyl LIM domains 1–3 and LIM domains 2 and 3 of TRIP6, respectively. The interaction was further verified by selective growth of yeast cells co-expressing both LPA2R-CT and TRIP6(ΔN1) (Fig. 1B). We further examined the ability of the carboxyl-terminal tails of LPA1 and LPA3 receptors to bind to TRIP6. Strikingly, TRIP6 only interacted with the LPA2 receptor but not LPA1 or LPA3 receptor in yeast (Fig. 1B).Next, we examined whether TRIP6 directly interacts with the LPA2 receptor. In this experiment, a GST fusion protein of LPA2R-CT was used to pull down the purified full-length TRIP6 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2, TRIP6 was pulled down by GST-LPA2R-CT but not GST, indicating a direct interaction between TRIP6 and the carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA2 receptor.Fig. 2TRIP6 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal tail of the LPA2 receptor in vitro. One μg of purified TRIP6 was incubated with 1 μg of GST or GST-LPA2R-CT (aa 296–351) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TRIP6 pulled down by GST-LPA2R-CT was detected by immunoblotting (IB) with an anti-TRIP6 antibody. GST-LPA2R and GST were visualized by Ponceau S staining. The third lane shown is a 10% input of TRIP6 used in this experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the association of TRIP6 with different LPA receptors in cells, co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-TRIP6 with the FLAG-tagged LPA1, LPA2, or LPA3 receptor or a LPA2 receptor mutant lacking the cytoplasmic tail (designated LPA2R(ΔC)) was performed in HEK 293T cells, which express a barely detectable level of endogenous TRIP6. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPA stimulation for 10 min promoted co-immunoprecipitation of TRIP6 with the LPA2 receptor but not LPA1 or LPA3 receptor. In contrast, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal tail of LPA2R abolished its interaction with TRIP6 (Fig. 3A). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation of a Myc-tagged LPA2 receptor with endogenous TRIP6 in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. The result showed that endogenous TRIP6 associated with the transfected Myc-tagged LPA2 receptor in a LPA-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Taken together from cellular co-immunoprecipitation, yeast two-hybrid assays and in vitro GST pull-down experiments, it is clear that TRIP6 specifically binds to the LPA2 receptor but not other LPA receptors.Fig. 3The LIM domains of TRIP6 bind to the LPA2 receptor, but not LPA1R, LPA3R, or a LPA2R mutant lacking its carboxyl-terminal tail. A, the GFP-TRIP6 expression vector was transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells alone or with one of the vectors expressing FLAG-tagged LPA receptors (LPA1R, LPA2R, LPA3R, or LPA2R(ΔC) lacking its C-terminal tail). Cells were starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA overnight and then treated without or with 2 μm LPA for 10 min. The LPA receptors from the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG M2 mouse antibody-conjugated agarose beads, and the immunoblot (IB) was probed with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody to detect co-immunoprecipitated GFP-TRIP6. The same blot was then stripped and reprobed with an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody to detect immunoprecipitated receptors. Results shown are LPA receptor monomers (∼40 kDa) and multiple modified forms of LPA receptors (∼50–150 kDa). The bottom panel shows the expression of GFP-TRIP6 in the whole cell lysates. B, LPA-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRIP6 with transfected Myc-LPA2R in NIH/3T3 cells. NIH/3T3 cells were transiently transfected with either pCMV-Tag3A (mock) or pCMV-Myc-LPA2R. The LPA2 receptor was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads from the unstimulated cells and cells treated with 2 μm LPA for 10 min. The co-immunoprecipitated endogenous TRIP6 was detected with a TRIP6-specific polyclonal antibody. C, co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-LPA2R with GFP-TRIP6(CT2) (aa 339–476) or GFP-TRIP6(CT3) (aa 398–476), which contain LIM domains 2 and 3 and LIM3 domain, respectively. This experiment was carried out without or with LPA in HEK 293T cells as described above. D, co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-LPA2R with Myc-TRIP6 or Myc-TRIP6(ΔC1) (aa 1–278) lacking the entire LIM domains. A similar experiment was performed in HEK 293T cells as described above. Myc-tagged TRIP6 and TRIP6(ΔC1) were detected with an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The yeast two-hybrid screening identified two LPA2R-interacting TRIP6 clones, which encode LIM domains 1–3 and domains 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting that TRIP6 may associate with the LPA2 receptor through its LIM domains. To identify the receptor-binding domain of TRIP6 in cells, a number of vectors expressing different TRIP6 truncation mutants have been generated. Their molecular structures are depicted in Fig. 4E. Indeed, we found that TRIP6(CT2) mutant (aa 339–476), which contains LIM domains 2 and 3, was able to co-immunoprecipitate with the LPA2 receptor (Fig. 3C). Even the TRIP6(CT3) mutant (aa 398–476), containing the LIM3 domain alone, was capable of binding to the LPA2 receptor (Fig. 3C). However, we found that LPA still induced a weak but detectable binding between the LPA2 receptor and a TRIP6(ΔC2) mutant (aa 1–350), which lacks LIM domains 2 and 3 (data not shown). Thus, it appears that all of the LIM domains of TRIP6 contribute to its binding to the LPA2 receptor. Different from the wild-type TRIP6, these truncated LIM domains interact with the LPA2 receptor in an agonist-independent manner, suggesting that the N-terminal region of TRIP6 regulates this agonist-dependent receptor binding. We further examined the receptor binding ability of a TRIP6(ΔC1) mutant (aa 1–278) lacking the entire LIM domains. As shown in Fig. 3D, LPA stimulation for 10 min promoted co-immunoprecipitation of the LPA2 receptor with wild-type TRIP6 but not the TRIP6(ΔC1) mutant. The LPA2R binding ability of different TRIP6 mutants is summarized in Fig. 4E.Fig. 4LPA promotes co-localization of TRIP6 with the LPA2 receptor and TRIP6 targeting to focal adhesions. A, SKOV3 cells were co-transfected with the expression plasmids of GFP-LPA2R and HcRed1-TRIP6. After serum starvation overnight, cells were treated without or with 2 μm LPA for 10 min. The GFP fluorescence of LPA2R and the far red fluorescence of TRIP6 were visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy. B–D, SKOV3 cells transiently expressing GFP-TRIP6 alone or with Myc-FAK were treated without or with 2 μm LPA for 15 min. Cells were fixed, and GFP-TRIP6 was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The immunostaining of endogenous vinculin (B), Myc-FAK (C), and endogenous paxillin (D) was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E, the molecular structures of different TRIP6 truncation mutants and a summary of their capacity to bind to the LPA2 receptor and co-localize with vinculin. F, SKOV3 cells expressing GFP-TRIP6 mutants were starved overnight and treated with 2 μm LPA for 15 min. The endogenous vinculin was detected with an anti-vinculin antibody, and GFP-TRIP6 mutants were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LPA Induces Co-localization of TRIP6 with the LPA2 Receptor and Promotes TRIP6 Targeting to Focal Adhesions—To investigate the potential functional role of TRIP6 in LPA2 receptor-mediated signaling, localization of TRIP6 with the LPA2 receptor was first examined in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells expressing a GFP fusion protein of the LPA2 receptor and a HcRed1 fusion protein of TRIP6. The protein distribution was visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4A, GFP-LPA2R was diffusely present or formed small clusters on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm by serum starvation overnight. Similarly, HcRed1-TRIP6 was predominantly cytosolic with some aggregates in the unstimulated cells. However, the distribution of these TRIP6 aggregates did not co-localize with the LPA2R clusters. After exposure of cells to LPA for 10 min, a large portion of HcRed1-TRIP6 appeared in plasma membrane clusters that coincided precisely with the distribution of GFP-LPA2R, indicative of LPA-dependent translocation of TRIP6 to the receptor (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Strikingly, LPA-induced cell rounding was greatly enhanced by overexpression of the LPA2 receptor, consistent with previous reports for the role of the LPA2 receptor in LPA-induced morphological changes (24Ishii I.

https://openalex.org/W2022882207,"The 25.3 kDa “adaptor” protein, PspA (phage shock protein A), is found in the cytoplasm and in association with the inner membrane of certain bacteria. PspA plays critical roles in negatively regulating the phage shock response and maintaining membrane integrity, especially during the export of proteins such as virulence factors. Homologues of PspA function exist for thylakoid biogenesis. Here we report the first three-dimensional reconstruction of a PspA assembly from Escherichia coli, visualized by electron microscopy and single particle analysis to a resolution of 30 Å. The assembly forms a 9-fold rotationally symmetric ring with an outer diameter of 200 Å, an inner diameter of 95 Å, and a height of ∼85 Å. The molecular mass of the complex was calculated to be 1023 kDa by size exclusion chromatography, suggesting that each of the nine domains is likely to be composed of four PspA subunits. The functional implications of this PspA structure are discussed in terms of its interaction with the protein export machinery of the bacterial cell and its AAA+ protein partner, PspF.

The functional implications of this PspA structure are discussed in terms of its interaction with the protein export machinery of the bacterial cell and its AAA+ protein partner, PspF. Virtually all bacteria are able to export a range of proteins from the cytoplasm to the cell surface, the extracellular environment, or, in the case of pathogenic bacteria, into the host cell. Protein export fulfills a wide range of functions, including the induction of virulence through the transmission of virulence factors that can induce proteolysis, cytotoxicity, or hemolysis. At least four distinct secretion mechanisms (types I-IV) have been identified (1Koster M. Bitter W. Tommassen J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with the export process being mediated by complex protein assemblies. Determining the structural basis and function of export in bacterial pathogenesis has long held important implications, including the identification of potential antibacterial drug targets. Secretin Pores—Central to protein export in certain bacteria are the secretin pores (e.g. PulD in Klebsiella pneumoniae, YscC in Yersinea enterocolitica, and InvG in Salmonella typhimurium). These are essential for the export of virulence factors across the outer bacterial membrane. Misinsertion of the secretin pores can be harmful to the bacterium. To prevent misinsertion, orchestrated insertion mechanisms involving chaperones have evolved (e.g. the high-fidelity insertion of PulD in K. pneumoniae by the outer membrane-anchored lipoprotein, PulS). In Escherichia coli, products of the psp 1The abbreviations used are: Psp, phage shock protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EM, electron microscopy; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: Psp, phage shock protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; EM, electron microscopy; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. operon have been implicated in combating the effects of misinsertion. The psp operon is directly induced when PulD is misinserted (2Hardie K.R. Lory S. Pugsley A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and also when the YscC secretin of Y. enterocolitica is misinserted due to the absence of its chaperone protein, YscW (3Darwin A.J. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Induction of the psp operon also occurs when the Sec pathway, which is involved in the export of proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm across the inner membrane, becomes blocked and results in a loss of proton motive force (4Kleerebezem M. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Kleerebezem M. Crielaard W. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The inner membrane protein YidC functions to insert proteins into the inner membrane, either independently or cooperatively, with the Sec translocase. Interestingly, depletion of YidC results in the rapid induction of the psp response through a reduction in the proton motive force, possibly due to incorrect assembly of the cytochrome oxidase and F1F0 ATPase (6van Der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Jones S.E. Lloyd L.J. Tan K.K. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the products of the psp operon have at least three functions as follows: (i) to confer the ability to cope with misinserted secretins into the outer membrane; (ii) to protect against blockage of the Sec dependent pathway; and, finally, (iii) to prevent incorrect insertion of proteins into the inner membrane via YidC. All these effects may be linked by a need to maintain proton motive force. The psp operon has been identified in many pathogenic bacteria, including Y. enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio cholerae, and K. pneumoniae. These bacteria are responsible for causing diarrhea, bacillary dysentery, gastroenteritis, cholera, and pneumonia, respectively. In a recent DNA microarray study aimed at gaining a global understanding of gene regulation during pathogenesis in S. typhimurium, almost a quarter of the genes underwent a change in their level of expression (8Eriksson S. Lucchini S. Thompson A. Rhen M. Hinton J.C.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Of these, the phage shock psp operon of Salmonella bacteria was one of the top three most highly expressed operons during infection. This finding clearly suggests that the psp operon fulfills a protective role during the infection process (8Eriksson S. Lucchini S. Thompson A. Rhen M. Hinton J.C.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting the protective role of Psp proteins has emerged. In particular, the deletion of the pspC gene in Y. enterocolitica was reported to induce severe growth defects and the attenuation of virulence on the expression of YscC (9Darwin A.J. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The psp Operon, AAA+Proteins, and RNA Polymerase—In E. coli the psp operon pspABCDE has been used as a model system in the investigation of psp operon regulation and function (10Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The psp operon is transcribed by the RNA polymerase containing the σ54 subunit (σ54-RNA polymerase) and activated by an additional protein, PspF, which is a member of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities). PspF itself is divergently transcribed from the psp-ABCDE operon (10Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PspF is able to bind and hydrolyze ATP by using the derived energy to remodel the σ54-RNA polymerase. The PspA protein forms a complex with PspF, thereby inhibiting its function by stopping its ATPase activity, either by preventing nucleotide access to the active site or by inhibiting formation of the correct oligomeric form (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PspA has recently been classified as an “adaptor” protein working with PspF (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Dworkin J. Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14Dougan D.A. Mogk A. Zeth K. Turgay K. Bukau B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Notably, a homologue of PspA, VIPP1, is involved in the thylakoid biogenesis of Synechocystis spp. (15Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana (16Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Here we present the first three-dimensional structure of a macromolecular assembly of E. coli PspA determined by electron microscopy on negatively stained particles and discuss how it might relate to cytoplasmic adaptor and membrane-associated functions. Together, these data suggest that PspA has a role in membrane integrity and is essential for the adaptation to membrane stress imposed by the misinsertion of the components of the secretin pore. Preparation of the PspA Complex—Plasmids, DNA manipulations, protein purification, and related analyses by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting have been described previously (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Modification of the PspA purification protocol included the omission of 1.1% CHAPS from fractions prior to dialysis. Instead, these fractions were dialyzed for 2 h in buffer 1 (200 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaSCN, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and then transferred to storage buffer (50 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaSCN, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for a further 2 h. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein detection kit. In Vitro Assays—Protein binding assays were conducted in a 20-μl reaction volume using 2 μl of STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000) with 5 μm PspF-(1–275) and increasing concentrations of PspA (5,10, and 20 μm). Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and analyzed by 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm glycine at 4 °C). σ isomerization assays were conducted in 10-μl reaction volumes as described previously (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Essentially, STA buffer containing 16 nm32P end-labeled heteroduplex DNA (mismatched at –12/–11, consisting of the –60 to 28 Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter), 1 mm σ54, 4 mm dGTP, and1 μm PspF-(1–275) was pre-incubated with either storage buffer or increasing concentration of PspA (0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm) in 4 μl of TGED (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol) for 10 min at 30 °C. This mixture was subsequently added to the σ isomerization assay for 10 min and analyzed using a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm glycine at room temperature. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Purified PspA (100 μl at 0.75 mg/ml) in SEC buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 75 mm NaSCN) was analyzed on a Biosep SEC4000 column using a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min and a temperature of 4 °C. Fractions (0.75 ml) were collected between 2 and 15 min. Protein peaks were detected at 280 nm by a Beckman Coulter 166 Detector. The column was calibrated with the molecular mass standards of blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), all at 2.2 mg/ml in SEC buffer. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE (see Ref. 12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked for 1 h in TBS (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) with 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature and then incubated with α-PspA (E. coli), a kind gift from Louise Lloyd, Imperial College, at 1:10000 dilution in TBS with 5% nonfat dried milk. After washing in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, bound primary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Sigma) at 1:8000 dilution in TBS and 5% nonfat dried milk. Secondary antibody binding was detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and Biomax XR film (Kodak). Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Samples were negatively stained using 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate prior to imaging on a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 80 kV and a magnification of 51,500×. Twenty micrographs for each sample, displaying no discernible drift or astigmatism, were digitized at a step size of 10 μm using a Leafscan 45 densitometer. The resultant sampling frequency of 1.94 Å/pixel on the specimen scale was coarsened by a factor of 2 to increase the speed of all subsequent processing using Imagic-5 software (17Van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 18Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). No correction was made for the contrast transfer function, given that the first minimum of the power spectrum for each micrograph was observed to be in the 18–21 Å range. A data set of 4,500 particles was built by interactively selecting all possible single particles observed. The data set was analyzed by reference-free alignment coupled with multivariate statistical analysis (19Van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). A number of subpopulations within each data set were identified that displayed approximately top, side, or intermediate orientation. These numbered 1,100, 1,500, and 1,600 particles, respectively. Each of these subpopulations was treated de novo and iteratively refined to gain two-dimensional class averages with an improved signal-to-noise ratio (18Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Reprojections were taken from the best three-dimensional model obtained and used to identify additional atypical views and further refine the subpopulation class averages. For three-dimensional reconstruction, class averages from each subpopulation were used that ensured the broadest range of relative orientations. Eulerian angles were assigned a priori by angular reconstitution (20Van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) (see supplementary data in the on-line version of this article), and iterative refinements were implemented. The resolution of the final three-dimensional map, which was composed of ∼50 class averages from each subpopulation data set, was estimated by Fourier shell correlation (17Van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Surface-rendered views, where presented, are shown with a threshold of 5σ, providing for 1,178,224 cubic Ångstroms. Assuming a standard density of 0.844 Da/Å3, this equates to 1396 kDa. It should be noted, however, that proteins do differ in density, and the exact density of PspA remains unknown. Modeling studies were performed within the O software environment (21Jones T.A. Kieldgaard M. O Version 5.9, The Manual. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1993Google Scholar). Isolation and Purification of PspA Protein from E. coli— Crude CHAPS-solubilized extract containing His6-tagged PspA was applied to a nickel affinity column (Fig. 1a, lane 1). Subsequent elution with imidazole (250 mm) yielded essentially pure His6-tagged PspA as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1a, lane 2) and negative stain EM (Fig. 1b). In the latter, ring-like structures were evident. The activity of the PspA preparation was analyzed for its ability to form a complex with PspF-(1–275) and also inhibit σ isomerization. Indeed, it was able to do both (data not shown) (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To ensure that the His6 tags of the expressed PspA did not contribute to the organization of PspA oligomers into rings, the tags were enzymatically cleaved. Cleavage did not change the activity of PspA. No ring dissociation was observed, 2B. D. Hankamer, S. L. Elderkin, M. Buck, and J. Nield, unpublished data. confirming that the ring contacts were mediated by PspA and not the His6 tag. To determine the molecular mass of the components of the PspA sample, the preparation was analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC (Fig. 2). Three main peaks with elution times of 7.29, 8.79 and 12.30 min were resolved. The first of these eluted in the void volume and consisted of the aggregated rings seen in Fig. 1b. The 8.79 and 12.30 min peaks correspond to apparent molecular masses of 1,023 kDa and 69 kDa, respectively. EM (Fig. 1c) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1a; lane 3) of the 1023-kDa peak fraction confirmed that it consisted of PspA rings of similar structure. Given that the His6-tagged PspA monomeric unit has a molecular mass of 27.9 kDa, this suggests a composition of 36–37 PspA subunits. The 12.30 min peak of 69 kDa indicates a composition of either PspA dimers (55.8 kDa) or trimers (83.7kDa)Fig. 2HPLC elution profile. Peaks at 7.29, 8.79, and 12.30 min are highlighted, the former eluting in the void volume and the latter two corresponding to molecular masses of 1,023 and 69 kDa respectively. Inset, the standard curve (see “Methods and Materials”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Single Particle Image Analysis—The purified PspA complexes (see Fig. 3) were negatively stained, imaged and digitized to yield a 4,500-particle data set. Reference-free alignment and classification resolved particles into three populations, which were assigned to approximate top (1,100 particles), side (1,500 particles), and tilted (1,600 particles) views. The remainder of the single particle images (∼300), which clearly contained more than one complex or stain artifact, were removed. Each subpopulation was treated de novo, and further iterative multi-reference alignments improved their signal-to-noise ratio. Representative two-dimensional average views for top, side, and tilted populations are shown in Fig. 3, panels a, c, and d, respectively. The top view in Fig. 3a is unsymmetrized but reveals a ring with nine distinct domains and an outer diameter of 200 Å. At the center of the ring, the black, stain-filled region (diameter 50 Å) is surrounded by features of weak contrast arranged in a ring with a diameter of 95 Å. The strongest features, attributable to protein density, lie between 95 and 200 Å diameter. The top view is presented in a 9-fold rotationally symmetrized (C9) form in Fig. 3b and has a resolution of 29.6 Å as calculated by Fourier ring correlation. Given that the calculated molecular mass from HPLC (1023 kDa) is within 2% of the theoretical mass of a 9 × 4 oligomer (1004 kDa), it seems likely that the PspA ring is composed of 36 PspA subunits. This result also suggests that the SEC-resolved 69 kDa peak is composed of PspA dimers rather than trimers, because in the latter case a 9 × 3 oligomeric PspA ring would have a much lower theoretical mass of 753 kDa than that observed. Fig. 3c is a characteristic “side” view that displays a width of 200 Å and a thickness ranging between 80 Å and 110 Å. Fig. 3d concludes with a characteristic “tilted” view. Features of the Three-dimensional Map—Surface rendered views of the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli PspA ring complex, together with respective two-dimensional reprojections, are shown in Fig. 4. The three-dimensional map was low pass filtered to 30 Å, the overall resolution having been estimated to be in this range by Fourier shell correlation. The calculated map has a similar appearance to the two-dimensional averages and was verified as being C9 point group symmetric, i.e. containing nine sets of subunits. The protrusions observed on either surface are different, and, at this resolution, each domain appears to contain four subdomains, such as those features within each domain separated by a distance of 30 Å, which are shown starred (*) in Fig. 4c. Overall, the final three-dimensional map has maximum dimensions of 200 Å in diameter with a maximum measured thickness of 85 Å. The three-dimensional map is effectively an average of all its constituent two-dimensional characteristic views, and the reprojection side view shown (Fig. 4e) has crenulated horizontal edges that vary the overall thickness. It is also important to note that possible effects due to the use of negative stain, e.g. dehydration, may occur and that a relative lack of direct two-dimensional side views was observed. Bearing these in mind, we suggest that the thickness of the three-dimensional map should be considered to be in a range of 80 to 110 Å. We have calculated the first structural data for PspA. PspA was found to form a 9-fold symmetric ring having a HPLC-derived molecular mass of 1023 kDa. PspA is an important E. coli protein that plays a role in both the regulation of the psp operon through inhibition of the transcription activator AAA+ protein PspF and in the maintenance of the proton motive force and membrane integrity. Interactions with other Psp proteins are thought to be important for PspA functioning (5Kleerebezem M. Crielaard W. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PspA has recently been classified as an adaptor protein having modulation effects on the AAA+ protein PspF. Members of the adaptor protein family share no sequence homology, are structurally unrelated, but are generally small, with a common function in that they modulate the activity of AAA+ proteins. In this regard, it is of interest that we have found PspA to form a large macromolecular complex. The full biological significance of such a ring structure is unknown. Dimensions of a 200-Å diameter with ∼85-Å thickness in our final three-dimensional map may be compared with that of a typical AAA+ protein complex, the PspF hexamer ring, which has been suggested by cryo-EM to be dimeric with a diameter of ∼140 Å and thickness of 110 Å (23Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These dimensions are thought to be characteristic of other AAA+ proteins, such as those found by cryo-EM and modeling studies of p97 (24Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 25Beuron F.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). An oligomer assembly and/or disassembly may act as an on/off switch for PspA functions, one of which is inhibition of PspF (Fig. 5). We have shown that our PspA samples, which consisted predominantly of C9 symmetric rings, completely inhibit PspF-(1–275) activity at a ratio of 1 PspF/2.5 PspA subunits (12Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The PspF-(1–275)·ADP·AlFx complex is likely to be a dimer of hexamers (23Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), indicating that a 12:36 PspF·PspA complex might form. Such a complex seems likely to be associated with inhibition, although we do not know whether initial complexes between PspA and PspF oligomers lead to further complexes in which important changes in subunit structure have occurred. The above dimensions of PspF and PspA suggest that complex function is possible through the interaction of the PspA ring and a PspF double hexamer. PspA has a membrane-related function reported to be mediated through protein-protein interactions involving the Psp proteins PspB and PspC (10Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These proteins are integral membrane proteins, and the periplasmic domains of PspC are able to form a dimer under normal conditions (22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Alterations in the stability of the membrane and dissipation of the proton motive force may induce disassociation of the PspC dimer, which is then able to interact with PspB and form a complex that preferentially binds to PspA, either in the dimeric or ring-like form (Fig. 5) (22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Chaney M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Bordes P. Cannon W. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This would provide a method of regulation in that, under different cellular concentrations or conditions, PspA is more or less able to interact with PspB and PspC as opposed to PspF. The pIV secretin has been visualized by electron cryomicroscopy at a resolution of 22 Å, displaying dimensions of a 135-Å diameter and a length of 240 Å with a central pore diameter of 60–88 Å, and, being a D14 symmetric barrel-like structure, a dimer of two 14-multimer rings (27Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). How this secretin is able to induce induction of the psp response remains unknown. In one membrane-bound form, PspA may release PspF from its inhibited state, thereby allowing the transcription of the psp operon, the products of which have been reported to facilitate the stability of the membrane and proton motive force (10Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When membrane stability is no longer compromised, PspC may be free to dimerize, releasing PspB and PspA. Subsequently, PspA may again bind PspF, thereby acting in its inhibitory role and thus preventing further transcription of the psp operon. Evidence to support such a PspC monomer/dimer proposal originates from the Tim23 protein found in mitochondria, which is involved in the protein import machinery. It has a leucine zipper motif and forms a dimer in response to changes in membrane potential (22Adams H. Teertstra W. Demmers J. Boesten R. Tommassen J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The nonameric ring-like structure of PspA opens up the possibility of interaction with the F1 membrane-bound ATPase, where symmetry match and mismatch would become significant. In terms of subunit structure, it is also of note that PspA has a high sequence homology with the VIPP1 protein found in photosynthetic membranes. VIPP1 forms a coiled-coil structure, with a large coiled-coil region spanning residues 1–186 and a second smaller coiled-coil region spanning residues 187–222. VIPP1 plays an essential role in thylakoid biogenesis and has no known transcriptional regulatory functions or any role in modulating AAA+ proteins (15Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Kroll D. Meierhoff K. Bechtold N. Kinoshita M. Westphal S. Vothknecht U.C. Soll J. Westhoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4238-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although this indicates that VIPP1 is not a member of the adaptor protein family, its structure could potentially shed light on the membrane-bound form of PspA and the role it plays in the bacterial protein export process.

These structural, biochemical, and genetic results provide new insights into eIF2 ternary complex assembly. Translation initiation involves assembly of a large protein-RNA complex at the initiation codon of a mRNA in three main steps: binding of initiator Met-tRNA and mRNA with associated factors to the small ribosomal subunit, pairing of the anticodon of Met-tRNAiMet with the AUG start codon, and joining of the two ribosomal subunits to form the 80 S initiation complex. In eukaryotes, this process requires at least twelve distinct translation initiation factors (eIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SAD, single wavelength anomalous dispersion. and hydrolysis of two molecules of GTP (reviewed in Ref. 1Roll-Mecak A. Shin B.S. Dever T.E. Burley S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 705-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Translation initiation factor eIF2 is a heterotrimeric GTPase that delivers the Met-tRNAiMet to the small ribosomal subunit as part of a ternary complex with GTP. Pairing between the anticodon of the Met-tRNAiMet and the AUG start codon triggers hydrolysis of GTP by eIF2 and eIF2·GDP is released, leaving Met-tRNAiMet bound in the P site. eIF2·GDP cannot bind Met-tRNAiMet and is converted to eIF2·GTP by the heteropentameric exchange factor eIF2B (reviewed in Ref. 2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-245Google Scholar). eIF2 is a stable complex of three subunits (α, β, and γ), each essential for viability in yeast. Since their discovery, highly conserved eIF2 subunits have been identified in all eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 2Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-245Google Scholar) and also archaebacteria (3Kyrpides N.C. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3726-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic analyses have demonstrated that the three subunits have distinct activities during translation initiation. The γ-subunit binds GTP and Met-tRNAiMet (reviewed in Ref. 4Trachsel H. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 113-138Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis by the eIF2 ternary complex bound to the 40 S ribosomal subunit is stimulated by eIF5, which interacts with eIF2β (5Das S. Maiti T. Das K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31712-31718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The β-subunit also interacts with Met-tRNAiMet and has been reported to bind mRNA (6Laurino J.P. Thompson G.M. Pacheco E. Castilho B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 173-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the pivotal role eIF2 plays in eukaryotic translation initiation, it is not surprising that it represents an important target for regulation. In response to various environmental stressors (viral infection, amino acid starvation, heme deficiency, ER stress etc), the α-subunit is phosphorylated on Ser51, abolishing translation initiation by preventing eIF2B catalyzed GDP-GTP exchange. The γ-subunit of eIF2 belongs to the superfamily of GTP-binding proteins and is most closely related to the translation elongation factor eEF1A and its eubacterial counterpart EF1A (previously EF-Tu), which form ternary complexes with GTP and aminoacylated elongator tRNAs. eIF2γ sequences are conserved from archaebacteria to mammals (pairwise amino acid sequence identities, 43-59%; Fig. 1), suggesting that they share a common three-dimensional structure (7Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). The highest sequence conservation occurs within the G domain (pairwise identities, 46-69%). Mutations of residues implicated in GTP binding are lethal in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (8Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), confirming the functional importance of the G domain and, by inference, GTP hydrolysis in translation initiation. Here we present the x-ray structure of Methanococcus jannaschii eIF2γ at 2.4-Å resolution. Apo eIF2γ consists of three domains structurally homologous to those in EF1A and arranged in a closed configuration, similar to that seen in EF1A·GTP and not EF1A·GDP. A similar domain arrangement was observed in the structure of eIF2γ from Pyrococcus abyssi (9Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our structure of an archaeal eIF2γ from a different organism and in a different space group shows that the closed configuration is not due to crystal packing effects and confirms that domain coupling differs between eIF2γ and EF1A, despite high sequence identity. Interestingly, comparison of our structure with the published one reveals that domains II and III are rotated by 14° with respect to the G domain revealing a hinge point around the Switch 2 region of the G domain, around which domains II and III move as a rigid body. In addition, using structure-based mutational analyses combined with genetic and biochemical experiments we mapped on eIF2γ conserved and adjacent binding sites for the 3′-end of Met-tRNAiMet and eIF2α, providing new insights into the mechanism of ternary complex assembly. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—A pUC18 derivative (AMJBZ12) containing M. jannaschii genomic DNA encoding eIF2γ was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Inc. (Manassas, VA). DNA corresponding to residues 35-437 of M. jannaschii eIF2γ was amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce a 5′-BamHI site and a 3′-EcoRI site. Following digestion the DNA was inserted into the pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) expression vector generating the plasmid pC1399. The N-terminal 35 residues of eIF2γ are not conserved and the corresponding region in yeast was shown to be dispensable for function (10Erickson F.L. Harding L.D. Dorris D.R. Hannig E.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that the critical functional domains of eIF2γ are present in our construct. The resulting N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown to an OD600 of ∼0.8 in minimal medium containing 0.2 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and the expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-o-thiogalactoside. After 6 h of induction at 30 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm TrisCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm aprotinin, and disrupted using the French press. After centrifugation, the protein was loaded on a GST affinity column. Following cleavage of the GST tag with Precision protease, eIF2γ was further purified with heparin and gel filtration chromatography. Free enzyme crystals (native and Se-Met) were grown at room temperature via hanging drop vapor diffusion against 100 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10%(w/v) PEG 6000, 5%(v/v) methyl pentanediol, using a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. The crystals grow in the monoclinic space group P21 with one protein per asymmetric unit (unit cell: a = 52.8 Å, b = 52.4 Å, c = 74.1 Å, β = 92.5°, diffraction limit = 2.4-Å resolution). Crystal cryoprotection was achieved by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v).

Data were processed using DENZO/SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Because of radiation induced decay, diffraction data from two different crystals were merged in SCALEPACK. All seven possible selenium sites were found using SnB (14Weeks C. Miller R. J. Appl.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), giving a final figure of merit of 0.58 for accentric reflections (Table I). After density modification, 80% of the polypeptide chain could be built into the electron density map using O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The current refinement model of eIF2γ consists of residues 35-437, one zinc ion, and 182 water molecules. Two regions of the polypeptide chain (residues 63-71 and 206-213) were not well resolved in the electron density map, and are presumed disordered.

GST-M. jannaschii eIF2γ (35-437) fusions (wild-type and mutants) and GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as previously described, and dialyzed against binding buffer (25 mm TrisCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10%(v/v) glycerol). A pUC18 derivative (AMJIN75) encoding M. jannaschii eIF2α was obtained from ATCC, Inc. DNA encoding full-length M. jannaschii eIF2α was amplified by PCR using primers to insert a 5′-NdeI and a 3′-XhoI restriction site. The resulting product was subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) and expressed untagged in E. coli using the protocol described for eIF2γ. The protein was purified on a heparin Sepharose column followed by dialysis against binding buffer. For binding studies, GST and GST-eIF2γ (wild type and mutants) were each immobilized on 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences), and unbound protein removed by washing. 14 μg of eIF2α were added to 50 μl of GST-resin or GST-eIF2γ-resin mixture. Binding reactions were diluted to 100 μl with binding buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing twice with 500 μl of binding buffer for 20 min, the resin was harvested by centrifugation, and bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm TrisCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm reduced glutathione) and detected by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Assays—Yeast eIF2γ is encoded by the essential GCD11 gene. Yeast strains H117 (gcn2-101 gcn3-101 his1-29 ino1 ura3-52 <HIS-4-lacZ, URA3>) and H271 (gcd11-507 gcn2-101 gcn3-101 his1-29 ino1 ura3-52 <HIS-4-lacZ, URA3>) (19Harashima S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3990-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were printed to medium containing 5-flouroorotic acid to isolate the Ura- derivatives J208 (GCD11+) and J210 (gcd11-507), respectively. The high copy number URA3 plasmids carrying SUI2 (p925) and IMT4 (C50) were described previously (20Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The gcd11Δ strain J212 (MATα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 gcd11Δ::KanMX p[GCD11, URA3]) was isolated as a haploid segregant from the heterozygous diploid gcd11Δ/GCD11 strain obtained from the yeast genome deletion project. Plasmids encoding GCD11 under control of the native promoter were generated by amplifying a ∼2.5-kb GCD11 fragment from yeast genomic DNA using the primers GCD11-PstI: 5′-CTAGCTGCAGCAGATCCAACCGCGGGAAGTGGC and GCD11-EcoRI: 5′-ACGCGAATTCGTCTCCATGTACAAACCACCG. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and PstI and inserted into the single copy number URA3 and LEU2 yeast shuttle plasmids YCplac33 (pGCD11, URA3) and YCplac111, respectively. Yeast eIF2γ mutants were constructed using the Altered Sites II mutagenesis kit (Promega, Inc.) according to vendor’s protocols and the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: D403A, 5′-GCTCTACACAAGGTGGGAGCAACTTTAGTACCAACACC; Y161A, 5′-GATTTCTTTATCAGATTTGAAAGATCTAGCACAATCAGGTTCGGGACATG; G397I, 5′-CAAGGTAGGATCAACTTTGGTACCAACAATAATCAGACCACCGGG; R319D, 5′-CGATTTCAGCACCTGGCTTGTTAACATCAAATGAATCAATAACAATTAACCTTGGAG;and V402A, D403A, L406A, 5′-CGACAAGACGATCAGCTCTACACGCGGTGGGAGCAGCTTTAGTACCAACACCAATCAG. The mutant alleles (∼2.5kb) were transferred to the single copy number LEU2 plasmid YCplac111 by EcoRI-PstI digestion, and then introduced into the yeast strain J212. The resulting transformants were replica plated to medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to evict the URA3 plasmid encoding wild-type GCD11. This plasmid shuffling protocol (21Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) resulted in a set of isogenic strains carrying only the mutant GCD11 alleles on the LEU2 plasmid. Lethal GCD11 alleles were identified by the failure of transformants to grow on the 5-FOA medium. The high copy number HIS3 plasmid encoding SUI2 (pC1682) was generated by subcloning a ∼2.4-kb BamHI fragment from plasmid p1097 (22Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) to the vector pRS423. The high copy number HIS3 plasmid encoding IMT4 (pC1683) was generated by transferring a ∼0.8-kb SalI-BamHI fragment from the plasmid p1776 (20Dever T.E. Yang W. Astrom S. Bystrom A.S. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6351-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to the plasmid pRS423. Standard methods were used for culturing yeast strains (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar). Yeast growth analyses were performed by streaking purified transformants on S.D. minimal medium supplemented with essential nutrients or on YPD rich medium. Growth rates were qualitatively determined by comparing the size of isolated single colonies in the streaks after growth at 30 °C for 3 days. Crystallization and Structure Determination—M. jannaschii eIF2γ yielded high quality crystals containing one molecule/asymmetric unit (see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure of eIF2γ was determined via SAD (11Hendrickson W. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar, 12Rice L.M. Earnest T.N. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)(see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I for a complete description of the crystallographic structure determination and subsequent refinement.) Structural Overview—Fig. 2A shows the structure of eIF2γ, which consists of three domains (G, II, and III). Structure-based sequence alignments of various eukaryotic and archaeal homologs (Fig. 1) demonstrate that conserved residues map to the hydrophobic cores of each of the three domains, whereas insertions and deletions map to random coil portions of the structure. The remarkable level of sequence identity and the pattern of amino acid differences across phylogeny allow us to conclude that all known eIF2γs share the three-dimensional structure illustrated in Fig. 2A. The G domain (residues 1-226) consists of a β-sheet of mixed polarity flanked by 5 α-helices with overall dimensions of 36 × 44 × 29 Å and shows significant structural homology to other GTPases, with the conserved sequence elements characteristic of GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 1, G1/P loop, G2, G3, G4, and G5) (24Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Secondary structural elements are arranged in the order β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-β5-β6-α2-β7-α3-β8-α4-β9-α5 within the primary sequence. eIF2γ also contains a zinc ribbon (residues 84-107) that protrudes from the main body of the G domain, forming an overhang between the G domain and domain II. The zinc ribbon motif is formed by two β-hairpin turns, each contributing a pair of cysteines (Fig. 2B; Cys87 and Cys90; Cys99 and Cys102). The zinc ion appears to stabilize the relative positions of β-strands β3, β4, and β5, which do not make extensive hydrophobic contacts with one another. Mutation of invariant Cys155 to Ala in S. cerevisiae (corresponding to Cys87 in M. jannaschii) causes a severe slow growth phenotype (10Erickson F.L. Harding L.D. Dorris D.R. Hannig E.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of zinc ion binding. Interestingly, in mammals three of the four cysteines are mutated to Thr and Leu. Loss of zinc binding during evolution has also been observed among transcription factor zinc-containing motifs (25Krishna S.S. Majumdar I. Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 532-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In these cases, the integrity of the motif is preserved by main chain hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions among the hydrophobic amino acids replacing the cysteines, which may be the case for mammalian eIF2γs. Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds contribute to the positioning of the zinc ribbon with respect to the main body of the G domain (Fig. 2C). Conserved Tyr93 is sandwiched between the aliphatic side chains of conserved Lys86 and Lys219, with its backbone amide hydrogen bonded to the side chain of conserved Asp215. Mutation of Tyr161 in S. cerevisiae eIF2γ to Ala (corresponding to Tyr93 in M. jannaschii eIF2γ) causes a slow growth phenotype (data not shown), underscoring the importance of preserving the integrity of the interface between the zinc ribbon motif and the body of the G domain. Domain II (residues 236-344) is a β-barrel (overall dimensions 40 × 37 × 38 Å) consisting of ten antiparallel β-strands and two 310 helices, arranged in the order β10-α6-β11-β12-β13-β14-β15-β16-β17-α7-β18 (Figs. 1 and 2A). The β-barrel is structurally similar to domain II of EF1A (pairwise α-carbon root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 1.2 Å, 27% sequence identity) and domain IV of IF2/eIF5B (pairwise α-carbon r.m.s.d. = 2.8 Å; 14% sequence identity). Both domain II of EF1A and domain IV of IF2/eIF5B have been implicated in recognition of the 3′-ends of tRNA (26Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 27Spurio R. Brandi L. Caserta E. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Misselwitz R. Krafft C. Welfle K. Welfle H. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 103: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Domain III (residues 347-437) is also an antiparallel β-barrel (overall dimensions 35 × 25 × 31 Å) consisting of six β-strands, arranged in the order β19-β20-β21-β22-β23-β24 (Figs. 1 and 2A). The β-barrel is structurally similar to domain III of EF1A (pairwise α-carbon r.m.s.d. = 1.2 Å, 26% sequence identity). In all GTPases for which structures of the GDP and GTP-bound enzymes are available, significant conformational changes are restricted to two polypeptide chain segments denoted Switch 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Switch 1 is involved in interactions with effectors (in the case of eIF2, these could be Met-tRNAiMet, the ribosome and/or eIF5). Switch 1 lies at the interface between the G domain and domain II and interacts with residues from β-strand β17 stabilizing the relative orientation of the two domains. Part of Switch 1 (residues 63-71) is disordered in our structure. Switch 2 lies at the heart of the structure where it makes contacts with domains II and III. Similar Domain Arrangements in Apo eIF2γ and EF1A· GTP—Fig. 3, A and B illustrate the structures of EF1A·GTP (29Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and EF1A·GDP (30Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 721-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Residues Gly44-Gly59 of eIF2γ, forming the P loop and part of α-helix α1, are structurally similar to the corresponding regions of EF1A (pairwise α-carbon r.m.s.d. = 0.6-0.8 Å; Fig. 3D). In both cases, structural super-positions of these regions result in close overlap of the remaining nucleotide binding segments, with the exception of the switch regions. Fig. 3C also demonstrates that the spatial arrangement of the three domains in apo eIF2γ is similar to that seen in EF1A·GTP and not EF1A·GDP. In EF1A·GDP domain II is disengaged from the G domain, while in EF1A·GTP domain II is closely packed against the Switch 1 region of the G domain (Fig. 3, A and B). The orientation of the Switch 2 helix α2 of apo eIF2γ is identical to that seen in EF1A·GDP (Fig. 3D). When EF1A binds GTP (Fig. 3, A and B) the C terminus of α2 moves 7.5 Å and rotates 45°, causing domain II to rotate 90° and pack against the G domain. Thus domain coupling differs between eIF2γ and EF1A, despite high sequence conservation (22% identity; 42% similarity). The closed domain configuration of apo eIF2γ was initially seen in the structure of Pyrococcus abyssi (P. abyssi) eIF2γ (9Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) where it could have resulted from lattice packing effects (9Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our structure of another archaeal eIF2γ in a different crystal form confirms that apo eIF2γ adopts the closed domain configuration. We presume, therefore, that the conformational changes undergone by eIF2γ on nucleotide binding and hydrolysis differ from those seen for EF1A (Fig. 3, A-D). Domains II and III of the M. jannaschii and P. abyssi eIF2γ can be super-imposed with an r.m.s.d. of 1.2 Å (Fig. 3E). Following this superposition the G domain of M. jannaschii eIF2γ is rotated by 14° relative to its counterpart in P. abyssi, revealing a hinge region near the Switch 2 helix α2 around which domains II and III move as a rigid body. Differences in the orientation of the G domain with respect to domains II and III have also been observed among EF1A·GDP structures (31Andersen G.R. Thirup S. Spremulli L.L. Nyborg J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicating that this conformational plasticity is a common feature for these two GTPases. Interestingly, the structure of a mutant form of P. abyssi eIF2γ showed no domain rearrangements upon GTP binding (9Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), while its close homolog EF1A shows large domain movements (29Berchtold H. Reshetnikova L. Reiser C.O. Schirmer N.K. Sprinzl M. Hilgenfeld R. Nature. 1993; 365: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). This finding is surprising since it fails to explain the nucleotide dependence of the tRNA binding activity of this factor. One explanation put forth in the report describing the P. abyssi eIF2γ structures is that the other subunits of the complex are necessary for this activity (9Schmitt E. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, we have found that the mutation introduced in P. abyssi eIF2γ to obtain the structure of the GTP bound complex is lethal in S. cerevisiae (data not shown). Molecular Modeling and Functional Identification of the Met-tRNAiMet Binding Site on eIF2γ —Our structure of M. jannaschii eIF2γ provides a rational basis for directed studies of ternary complex formation. Fig. 4, B and D illustrate the solvent-accessible surface of eIF2γ color coded for amino acid conservation. The green portion of the molecular surface corresponds to surface residues that are invariant among the sequences of known eIF2γs (Fig. 1). The ventral surface of eIF2γ (Fig. 4B) shows a remarkably high level of conservation and is almost certainly responsible for interactions with conserved components of the translation machinery. The x-ray structure of EF1A in complex with GTP and Phe-tRNAPhe (26Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) revealed that domain II of EF1A contributes to recognition of the 3′-end of the tRNA acceptor helix. Given the marked similarity between domains II of EF1A and eIF2γ (Fig. 3C) it is reasonable to suggest that eIF2γ interaction with the tRNA 3′-end resembles that observed in the EF1A ternary complex. Superposition of domains II of eIF2γ and EF1A in the ternary complex places the 3′-end of the tRNA in a binding pocket between the G domain and domain II of eIF2γ, and results in few predicted steric clashes, the most notable being between Phe of the Phe-tRNAPhe of the EF1A ternary complex and Leu317 of eIF2γ. The predicted tRNA binding surface of eIF2γ (Fig. 5A) corresponds to a positively charged/hydrophobic surface (Fig. 4A) that could support phosphate and/or base recognition. This model enables us to have a clearer understanding of the phenotypes of previously identified mutants and identify new residues important for tRNA recognition. Deletion of the chromosomal GCD11 gene encoding eIF2γ in yeast is lethal; however, cell viability can be maintained by a plasmid-borne GCD11 allele. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we generated the gcd11Δ strain J212 in which the essential eIF2γ function is provided from a GCD11 gene on a plasmid also containing the URA3 gene. To test the impact of eIF2γ mutations on yeast cell growth, we engineered desired mutations into a GCD11 allele on a LEU2 plasmid and introduced these mutant alleles into the strain J212. Following plasmid-shuffling, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the GCD11 mutant allele on the LEU2 plasmid is the sole source of eIF2γ. Mutations that impair eIF2γ function will be identified as causing slow growth or lethal phenotypes following plasmid shuffling. In our model of Phe-tRNAPhe bound to M. jannaschii eIF2γ (Fig. 5, A and B), the terminal adenosine and Phe of Phe-tRNAPhe project into a pocket on the surface of domain II, with the amino acid stacking against invariant Tyr79 from Switch 1 (this residue is Tyr142 in yeast eIF2γ, and Hisin E. coli EF1A). Consistent with this model, Erickson and Hannig (8Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) previously showed that substitution of His for Tyr142 in yeast eIF2γ caused a slow growth phenotype that could be suppressed by overexpression of (tRNAiMet, and that purified yeast eIF2 containing the mutant eIF2γ-Y142H subunit showed decreased binding to Met-tRNAi. Invariant Gly319 in M. jannaschii eIF2γ, corresponding to Gly397 in yeast eIF2γ, lies at the bottom of this putative tRNA binding pocket (Fig. 5B). Mutation to a larger residue would be predicted to result in a steric clash with the ribose of A76 of the tRNA. Fortuitously, the yeast eIF2γ Gly397 to Ala mutation was isolated previously as a mutant that derepresses GCN4 mRNA translation (gcd11-507 mutation) (32Dorris D.R. Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The eIF2γ-G397A mutation causes a modest slow growth phenotype (32Dorris D.R. Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2239-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and here we show that this slow growth phenotype can be fully suppressed by overexpression of Met-tRNAi, but not eIF2α (Fig. 5, C and D, upper panel), consistent with the idea that the G397A mutation decreases Met-tRNAiMet binding affinity. Furthermore, we found that mutation of Gly397 in eIF2γ to the bulkier Ile is lethal in yeast (Fig. 5C). Finally, based on the modeled tRNA binding pocket (Fig. 5B), we propose that the conserved Arg242 of M. jannaschii eIF2γ (corresponding to S. cerevisiae Arg319) contributes to tRNA binding through phosphate neutralization. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that mutation of Arg319 in yeast eIF2γ to the negatively charged Asp is also lethal (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results provide strong in vivo evidence that domain II of eIF2γ plays a critical role in the binding of Met-tRNAiMet to eIF2. Identification of the eIF2α Binding Site on the Molecular Surface of eIF2γ Adjacent to the Met-tRNAiMet Binding Site—In an attempt to characterize binding sites on eIF2γ for the α- and β-subunits of eIF2, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of selected conserved surface residues. Leu256 and Asp325 form part of a conserved surface adjacent to the proposed Met-tRNAiMet binding site in M. jannaschii eIF2γ (Figs. 5B and 6B). Mutation of yeast eIF2γ Asp403 (corresponding to M. jannaschii Asp325) to Ala resulted in a pronounced slow growth phenotype that was suppressed by overexpression of eIF2α, but not Met-tRNAi, consistent with defects in eIF2α binding (Fig. 5, C and D, middle panel). To directly assess the impact of eIF2γ mutations on eIF2α binding, we expressed in E. coli and purified wild-type and mutant forms of M. jannaschii eIF2γ fused to GST, and then tested the fusion proteins for the ability to pull-down bacterially expressed and purified M. jannaschii eIF2α. Consistent with the yeast mutants results, M. jannaschii eIF2γ-D325A and -L256D mutants exhibited dramatic reductions in eIF2α binding (Fig. 6A; lanes 8, 12 versus 6, 10). To further define the eIF2α binding site on eIF2γ, we generated the M. jannaschii eIF2γ-N247A/K248A/G250A triple mutant (see Fig. 6B). This triple mutation, which altered residues between the mapped eIF2α and Met-tRNAiMet binding sites, only slightly impaired eIF2α binding (data not shown), indicating that the eIF2α binding site is localized to the side of eIF2γ. The locations of mutations that affected eIF2α binding are illustrated in Fig. 6B (labeled in magenta). Despite the close proximity of the tRNA and eIF2α binding sites on eIF2γ, mutation of residues in the putative tRNA binding pocket of M. jannaschii eIF2γ (Gly319 → Ile and Arg242 → Asp) did not affect binding to eIF2α (Fig 6B; lanes 14 and 16 versus 10). However, it is possible that eIF2α enhances Met-tRNAiMet binding, as yeast eIF2 complexes lacking eIF2α show lowered Met-tRNAiMet binding (33Nika J. Rippel S. Hannig E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1051-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the lethal phenotype associated with loss of eIF2α in yeast is partially suppressed by overproduction of Met-tRNAiMet, eIF2β, and eIF2γ (34Erickson F.L. Nika J. Rippel S. Hannig E.M. Genetics. 2001; 158: 123-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further supporting the idea that eIF2α contributes to Met-tRNAiMet binding by eIF2γ, we found that overexpression of either eIF2α or Met-tRNAiMet partially suppressed the slow growth phenotype of a yeast strain expressing the eIF2γ-V402A/D403A/L406A triple mutant (Fig. 5, C and D). As expected, the corresponding M. jannaschii eIF2γ-L324A/D325A/L328A triple mutation blocked the binding of eIF2α to GST-eIF2γ in the pull-down assay (data not shown). Thus, whereas mutation of Asp403 in yeast eIF2γ (Asp325 in M. jannaschii) solely impairs eIF2α binding, mutation of the nearby Val402 and Leu406 (Leu324 and Leu328 in M. jannaschii; see Fig. 6B) also impairs Met-tRNAiMet binding. These results reveal that the eIF2α and Met-tRNAiMet binding sites are in close proximity on the eIF2γ surface, and they provide additional suggestive evidence that eIF2α contributes to Met-tRNAiMet binding to eIF2. In conclusion, we have determined the crystal structure of an archaeal eIF2γ that serves as the foundation of the eIF2 ternary complex on which, the α- and β-subunits and Met-tRNAiMet assemble. A combination of in vivo and in vitro studies has allowed us to locate conserved, adjacent binding surfaces for eIF2α and tRNA. Our work provides a starting point for further systematic biochemical, genetic and structural studies, aimed at understanding interactions between the eIF2 subunits, tRNA, mRNA, and the small (40 S) ribosomal subunit.

https://openalex.org/W1981348906,"The 12/15-lipoxygenases (12/15-LOX) catalyze the stereo-specific oxygenation of arachidonic and linoleic acids into a complex series of signaling molecules, including the hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs). Our previous studies, using high density oligonucleotide microarrays, suggested a novel link between progesterone receptor (PR) signaling and 12/15-LOX-mediated fatty acid metabolism in preimplantation mouse uterus. In this paper, using PR knockout mice, we established that the transcripts encoding leukocyte-12/15-LOX (L-12/15-LOX) and epidermal-12/15-LOX (E-12/15-LOX) are indeed downstream targets of regulation by PR in the uterine surface epithelium. Maximal induction of both L- and E-12/15-LOX on the day of implantation resulted in a marked increase in the uterine levels of the eicosanoids, 12-HETE, 15-HETE, and 13-HODE. Mice with null mutation in L-12/15-LOX had significantly reduced uterine levels of arachidonic acid metabolites and exhibited a partial impairment in implantation. Complete blockade of uterine 12/15-LOX activity by a specific inhibitor led to greater than 80% reduction in a number of implantation sites relative to untreated controls. Cell-based assays indicated that 12-HETE, 15-HETE, and 13-HODE function as activating ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), suggesting that this nuclear receptor could be a downstream target of 12/15-LOX-derived metabolites in the preimplantation uterus. Consistent with this hypothesis, administration of rosiglitazone, a potent PPARγ-selective agonist, efficiently reversed inhibition of implantation by the 12/15-LOX-specific inhibitor. Rosiglitazone also induced a number of potential target genes of 12/15-LOX-derived metabolites in the pregnant uterus, indicating their regulation by PPARγ. Collectively, our results uncovered a novel signaling pathway in which progesterone-induced synthesis of the 12/15-LOX-derived lipid mediators activates PPARγ and its downstream gene networks, which in turn function as critical regulators of implantation in the mouse."

We now report that cleavage of Ln-5 by MT1-MMP occurs in vivo and affects epithelial tissue organization and probably Ln-5 turnover. In MT1-MMP knockout (KO) mice, the kidneys showed increased levels of total Ln-5 gamma2 subunit, but significantly reduced amounts of gamma2', an amino-terminal truncated proteolytic form of gamma2. The kidney tubular epithelia of KO animals were poorly differentiated, a phenotype reminiscent of human congenital mixed hypoplastic/dysplastic disorders. To establish a better link between Ln-5 proteolytic cleavage and epithelial morphology, MT1-MMP expression was reconstituted by transfection of MT1-MMP into a Ln-5 positive, MT1-MMP deficient epithelial cell line. MT1-MMP transfectants demonstrated increased levels of processed Ln-5 gamma2 chain and enhanced spreading on Ln-5, but not fibronectin. Recombinant MT1-MMP cleaved gamma2 constructs in vitro at a known in vivo gamma2 gamma2' processing site. These results strongly indicate that Ln-5 is a physiological substrate of MT1-MMP in vivo. Proteolytic processing of gamma2 subunit by MT1-MMP may influence Ln-5 turnover in epithelial basement membranes and affect epithelial morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2084618069,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by multiple endocrine and occasionally non-endocrine tumors. The tumor suppressor gene Men1, which is frequently mutated in MEN1 patients, encodes the nuclear protein menin. Although many tumor suppressor genes are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, it is unclear whether menin facilitates apoptosis. Here we show that ectopic overexpression of menin via adenoviruses induces apoptosis in murine embryonic fibroblasts. The induction of apoptosis depends on Bax and Bak, two proapoptotic proteins. Moreover, loss of menin expression compromises apoptosis induced by UV irradiation and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), whereas complementation of menin-null cells with menin restores sensitivity to UV- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, loss of menin reduces the expression of procaspase 8, a critical protease that is essential for apoptosis induced by death-related receptors, whereas complementation of the menin-null cells up-regulates the expression of procaspase 8. Furthermore, complementation of menin-null cells with menin increases the activation of caspase 8 in response to TNF-α treatment. These results suggest a proapoptotic function for menin that may be important in suppressing the development of MEN1.

This makes it challenging to identify how menin functions as a tumor suppressor. Menin interacts with a number of proteins, including the transcription factors JunD, NF-κB, Smad3, and Pem (16Agarwal S.K. Guru S.C. Heppner C. Erdos M.R. Collins R.M. Park S.Y. Saggar S.

The interaction between menin and JunD or NF-κB inhibits their activation of gene transcription (16Agarwal S.K. Guru S.C. Heppner C. Erdos M.R. Collins R.M. Park S.Y. Saggar S. Chandrasekharappa S.C.

Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3837-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of menin in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells inhibits cell proliferation (20Kim Y.S. Burns A.L. Goldsmith P.K. Heppner C. Park S.Y. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Collins F.S. Spiegel A.M.

Although inhibition of cell proliferation may be one way in which menin suppresses tumorigenesis, many tumor suppressor proteins, including p53 and BRCA1, regulate multiple cellular processes, including inhibition of growth, DNA repair, and apoptosis (21Levine A.J.

It is unclear whether menin plays a crucial role in apoptosis, although ectopic expression of menin in an insulinoma cell line increases the number of cells stained by annexin V, one marker for apoptosis (23Sayo Y. Murao K. Imachi H. Cao W.M. Sato M. Dobashi H. Wong N.C. Ishida T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2437-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The current studies investigate the potential role of menin in promoting apoptosis, which could contribute to suppression of the development of MEN1. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of menin via adenoviruses results in apoptosis that depends on the presence of Bax and Bak, two proapoptotic proteins (24Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A.

Moreover, we show that targeted deletion of menin causes increased resistance to both UV- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, menin induces the expression of caspase 8, an essential component in death-related receptor pathways (26Varfolomeev E.E. Schuchmann M. Luria V. Chiannilkulchai N. Beckmann J.S. Mett I.L. Rebrikov D. Brodianski V.M. Kemper O.C. Kollet O. Lapidot T. Soffer D. Sobe T. Avraham K.B. Goncharov T. Holtmann H. Lonai P. Wallach D.

In addition, cells complemented with menin display increased activation of caspase 8 in response to TNF-α treatment, consistent with their greater sensitivity to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that menin may suppress the development of MEN1, at least in part, by modulating apoptosis. Plasmid Construction—PCR-amplified menin was inserted into the BglII and NotI site of the adenoviral shuttle vector (pAdTrack-CMV) (27He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) to generate pAdTrack-menin. Plasmids for generating recombinant retroviruses were made by inserting PCR-amplified human menin cDNA into the BamHI/NotI site of the retroviral vector pMX-puro. The constructs were sequenced to verify the fidelity of the sequence. Production of Recombinant Adenoviruses and Retroviruses—Production of menin-expressing recombinant adenovirus is based on the pAdEasy system, a simplified method for generating recombinant adenovirus (27He T.C.

Adenoviral titers were determined by plaque assay as well as fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis for percentage of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells. Retroviruses were packaged using the Bosc23 packaging cell line as described previously (28Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Preparation of Immortalized Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—Men1ΔN3-8/+ mice (Men1+/-) heterozygous for the Men1 locus were maintained on a 129s6/SvEvTac background (Taconic, Germantown, NY) (15Crabtree J.S. Scacheri P.C. Ward J.M. Garrett-Beal L. Emmert-Buck M.R. Edgemon K.A. Lorang D. Libutti S.K. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Men1+/- male and female mice were mated, and 9.5 days after plugging the females were euthanized. The embryos were placed in gelatin-coated 12-well plates and dissociated into single cells by repeated pipetting in trypsin buffer. LXSN16E6E7 retroviruses that express the human papillomaviral E6 and E7 open reading frame (29Halbert C.L. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 473-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to infect the primary MEFs to immortalize the cells. The infected MEFs were subjected to selection with 500 μg/ml G418. Two pairs of menin-null and menin-expressing MEF cell lines (heterozygous and wild-type), each pair derived from littermates, were established. Establishment of Menin-complemented MEF Cell Lines—Immortalized Men1-/- cells (< passage 12 after isolation from embryos) were seeded in 6-well plates on day 0, infected with vector or menin-expressing retroviruses on day 1, and switched to fresh medium on day 2. Cells were subjected to selection with 2 μg/ml puromycin on day 5 (72 h after switching to fresh medium). Annexin V and Trypan Blue Staining—For annexin V staining of adenovirus-infected cells, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in a 6-well dish and allowed to attach for 5 h. After attachment, cells were infected with adenoviruses (day 0). On the next day (day 1) the medium with adenoviruses was aspirated, and fresh medium was added. On day 2 (24 h after switching to fresh medium), cells were processed for staining. Briefly, cells were collected, stained with annexin V-Cy5 as instructed by the manufacturer (MBL International Inc., Watertown, MA), and analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSR cytometer. The percentage of annexin V-positive cells was determined from gated GFP-positive cell populations. To examine apoptosis of the menin-null MEFs infected with either vector retroviruses or retroviruses expressing menin, the cells were passaged for ∼2 weeks after initial retroviral infection to obtain sufficient numbers of cells for experiments. For trypan blue staining to detect loss of membrane integrity, 8 × 104 cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, cells were treated with or without UV irradiation (100 mJ/m2) by a Spectrolinker XL-1000 (Spectronics Corporation, Westbury, NY) or with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)/cycloheximide (5.0 μg/ml, Sigma). On day 2 (24 h after the treatment), the cells were collected, stained with trypan blue (0.2%), and counted. Duplicate samples were examined for each data point. To provide an independent assessment of apoptosis in response to UV or TNF-α treatment, annexin V staining was measured at 16 h after respective treatments. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were seeded/100-mm dish on day 0, treated or not treated on day 1, and harvested 16 h after the treatment on day 2. Cells were collected and stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate from the MEBCYTO® apoptosis kit as instructed by the manufacturer (MBL International Inc.). Detection of Release of Free Nucleosomal DNA—Cells were harvested 24-30 h after infection with adenoviruses. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and their densities were adjusted to 105/ml using the cell lysis buffer from the cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was diluted 10-fold, and 100 μl was used to detect the release of free nucleosomal DNA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on instructions from the manufacturer. Western Blotting Analysis—To detect menin expression, whole cell lysates were prepared with whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (28Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The primary antibody against a human menin peptide (Ser593-Leu610) (30Jin S. Mao H. Schnepp R.W. Sykes S.M. Silva A.C. D'Andrea A.D. Hua X. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4204-4210PubMed Google Scholar) was raised in rabbits and was affinity-purified with the corresponding peptide-conjugated agarose beads. The bound primary antibodies were detected as described previously (31La P. Morgan T. Sykes S. Mao H. Schnepp R. Petersen C. Hua X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To detect procaspase 8 expression, whole cell lysates were prepared from freshly isolated cells using CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium o-vanadate, and 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) as described previously (32Salmena L. Lemmers B. Hakem A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Murakami K. Au P.Y. Berry D.M. Tamblyn L. Shehabeldin A. Migon E. Wakeham A. Bouchard D. Yeh W.C. McGlade J.C. Ohashi P.S. Hakem R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using a monoclonal antibody from Alexis (ALX-804-448; San Diego, CA). DNA Microarray and Northern Blotting Analysis—For the microarray, the vector or menin-complemented MEFs were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/100-mm dish on day 0. The cells were harvested on day 2 for isolation of RNA using the cesium chloride centrifugation method (33Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To increase the reproducibility of gene expression profiles, two independent preparations of RNA from each of the cell lines were analyzed. The RNA was processed to generate biotin-labeled RNA probes (34Golub T.R. Slonim D.K. Tamayo P. Huard C. Gaasenbeek M. Mesirov J.P. Coller H. Loh M.L. Downing J.R. Caligiuri M.A. Bloomfield C.D. Lander E.S. Science. 1999; 286: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9058) Google Scholar). The probes were hybridized to the Affymetrix murine GeneChip U74A array at the Penn Microarray Core Facility (Philadelphia, PA). Genes whose levels of expression varied 2-fold or more from the control were further analyzed by Northern blotting analysis, which was carried out as described previously (31La P. Morgan T. Sykes S. Mao H. Schnepp R. Petersen C. Hua X. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Caspase 8 Enzyme Activity Assay—To compare caspase 8 enzyme activities in vector-complemented and menin-complemented MEFs treated with TNF-α, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes on day 0. Starting on day 1, TNF-α (10 ng/ml)/cycloheximide (5 μg/ml) was added 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h prior to harvesting cells for analysis. Cells were harvested using CHAPS lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using BCA reagents (Pierce). The reaction mixtures consisted of the following components: 80 μl of caspase 8 assay buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol, supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol), 100 μg of whole cell lysates, 0.5 μl of Ac-IETD-FAC (Pharmingen), a highly specific caspase 8 substrate, in a final volume of 160 μl. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and measured on a fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 480-520 nm (Bio-Rad). The result from 0 h of TNF-α treatment was set to zero and used to normalize the other measurements. All time points were performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis and Quantitation—Standard error bars are noted for appropriate experiments, using Microsoft Excel. Quantitation was performed using either NIH Image 1.63 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or Imagequant software (Amersham Biosciences). Adenovirus-mediated Expression of Menin in MEFs Results in Apoptosis—To examine the biological effects of overexpression of menin, we generated menin-expressing adenoviruses (Ad-menin) and control adenoviruses (Ad-GFP). Ad-menin and Ad-GFP, each of which expresses GFP, were used to infect immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts. Fig. 1A shows that Ad-menin, but not Ad-GFP, causes the majority of infected cells to shrink and detach from the bottom of the plate, characteristic of apoptotic cells. The infection efficiency of Ad-menin and Ad-GFP was similar (Fig. 1A, bottom panels). These results suggest that overexpression of menin results in death of the MEFs. To examine whether Ad-menin induces apoptosis, the cells were infected with increasing multiplicities of infection (MOIs, from 0 to 20) of either Ad-menin or control Ad-GFP. The infected cells were stained with fluorescent-labeled annexin V, which specifically binds to phosphatidylserine residues that flip from the inner leaflet to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis (35van Engeland M. Nieland L.J. Ramaekers F.C. Schutte B. Reutelingsperger C.P. Cytometry. 1998; 31: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). The annexin V-stained cells were detected by FACS. Fig. 1B shows that infection of the cells with Ad-menin increases the percentage of the annexin V-stained cells from 7 to 58% (with MOIs from 0 to 20). In contrast, infection of the cells with Ad-GFP only slightly increases this percentage (from 10 to 18%). These results suggest that ectopic expression of menin results in apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of another marker of apoptosis, release of free nucleosomal DNA (36Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Lymphokine Res. 1986; 5: 289-299PubMed Google Scholar), confirms the above finding (Fig. 2A). The cells were infected with two independent clones of Ad-menin or Ad-GFP before analyzing the release of free nucleosomal DNA. Fig. 2A shows that Ad-GFP results in only a low level of release of free nucleosomal DNA (0.2-0.3 units), but Ad-menin leads to a marked enhancement of the release of free nucleosomal DNA (0.7-0.9 units). The expression of menin from Ad-menin in the cells was confirmed by immunoblotting using an antimenin antibody (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results indicate that overexpression of menin, but not GFP, leads to apoptosis in the infected cells. This is consistent with a recent report showing an increased number of annexin V-stained cells in an insulinoma cell line stably overexpressing menin (23Sayo Y. Murao K. Imachi H. Cao W.M. Sato M. Dobashi H. Wong N.C. Ishida T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2437-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ad-Menin Induces Apoptosis through a Bax/Bak-dependent Apoptotic Pathway—To identify the apoptotic pathway that menin activates and to rule out that overexpression of menin simply results in a nonspecific toxicity, we examined whether ablation of Bax and Bak, two proapoptotic proteins essential for multiple apoptotic pathways (37Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), blocks Ad-menin-mediated apoptosis. Immortalized wild-type and Bax-/-/Bak-/- double knock-out (DKO) MEFs (24Lindsten T. Ross A.J. King A. Zong W.X. Rathmell J.C. Shiels H.A. Ulrich E. Waymire K.G. Mahar P. Frauwirth K. Chen Y. Wei M. Eng V.M. Adelman D.M. Simon M.C. Ma A. Golden J.A. Evan G. Korsmeyer S.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1389-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) were infected with increasing MOIs of Ad-menin or Ad-GFP. In contrast to the shrinkage and detachment we observed in normal cells (Fig. 1A), we saw no such changes in the DKO MEFs (data not shown). To confirm the lack of apoptosis in the DKO cells, the infected cells were stained with annexin V. Analysis by flow cytometry shows that the background annexin V staining accounts for 2-4% of the control wild-type and DKO cells (Fig. 3A). Infection of the wild-type cells with increasing MOIs of Ad-menin markedly increases the percentage of apoptotic cells (54%), whereas Ad-GFP only slightly increases this percentage (14%, Fig. 3A). In contrast, even at the highest MOI, Ad-menin and Ad-GFP cause similar amounts of apoptosis in DKO cells (13%, Fig. 3A). In agreement with the above results, infection of wild-type cells with increasing MOIs of Ad-GFP only slightly increases the release of free nucleosomal DNA, from 0.3 to 0.5 units (Fig. 3B, columns 1-4). In contrast, Ad-menin increases the release of free nucleosomal DNA in the wild-type cells from 0.3 to 1.1 units (Fig. 3B, columns 1 and 5-7), indicating a role for menin in inducing apoptosis. Infection of the DKO cells with Ad-GFP does not increase the release of free nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3B, columns 8-11). In contrast to the wild-type cells, DKO cells infected with Ad-menin do not show cleavage of nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3B, columns 8 and 12-14), although both the wild-type and DKO cells express a similar level of menin after infection (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that menin-mediated apoptosis is dependent on Bax and Bak (25Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar) and that the Ad-menin-induced cell death is not a nonspecific cytotoxicity induced by overexpression of menin. Complementation of Menin-null MEFs with Menin Sensitizes the Cells to UV- and TNF-α-induced Apoptosis—Next, we determined whether loss of menin expression, which is similar to what occurs in tumors, affects cellular response to apoptosis. We introduced menin into the immortalized menin-null MEFs by retroviral infection, generating stable cell lines. Fig. 4A shows that menin is expressed in the menin-complemented cells but not in vector-complemented cells. The cells were then treated with UV irradiation, a well-known apoptotic signal, and stained with either trypan blue to detect disruption of cell membrane integrity or annexin V to detect phosphatidylserine translocation. Fig. 4B shows that only 11% of the menin-null cells die after UV treatment, whereas 31% of the menin-complemented cells undergo apoptosis under the same conditions. Levels of apoptosis in untreated cells are similar. Consistent with this, only 11% of the vector-complemented cells are stained positive for annexin V after UV irradiation, whereas 26% of the UV-treated menin-complemented cells are annexin V-positive (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that introduction of menin back into the menin-null cells renders the cells more sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis. To test whether menin might also be critical for maximal response to other apoptotic signals, we examined whether loss of menin affects the cellular response to TNF-α, which induces apoptosis by binding to death receptors (38Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). Vector-complemented cells and menin-complemented cells were treated with TNF-α and stained with either trypan blue or annexin V. Fig. 4D shows that only 17% of the vector-complemented cells die after TN"

Recently, dysbindin has been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles and is also a major schizophrenia susceptibility factor. Although dysbindin has been implicated in a number of different cellular processes, little is known about its function. To determine the function of dysbindin in muscle, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential interacting proteins. Here we show that dysbindin binds to a novel 413-kDa protein, myospryn, which is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle. The transcript encoding myospryn encompasses genethonin-3, a transcript that is down-regulated in muscle from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and stretch-responsive protein 553, which is up-regulated in experimental muscle hypertrophy. The C terminus of myospryn contains BBC, FN3, and SPRY domains in a configuration reminiscent of the tripartite motif protein family, as well as the dysbindin-binding site and a region mediating self-association. Dysbindin and myospryn co-immunoprecipitate from muscle extracts and are extensively co-localized. These data demonstrate for the first time that there are tissue-specific ligands for dysbindin that may play important roles in the different disease states involving this protein.

Dysbindin and myospryn co-immunoprecipitate from muscle extracts and are extensively co-localized. These data demonstrate for the first time that there are tissue-specific ligands for dysbindin that may play important roles in the different disease states involving this protein. Dysbindin is a small coiled coil-containing protein that was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with α- and β-dystrobrevin (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The dystrobrevins are components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) 1The abbreviations used are: DGC, dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex; DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; BLOC-1, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1; TRIM, tripartite motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.1The abbreviations used are: DGC, dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex; DMD, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; BLOC-1, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1; TRIM, tripartite motif; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation buffer; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum. that bind directly to the dystrophin and syntrophin families of proteins (2Newey S.E.

Disord. 2002; 12: S110-S117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutations in several of the components of the DGC cause different forms of muscle disease, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by the lack of dystrophin, and limb girdle muscular dystrophies, caused by mutations in the genes encoding the sarcoglycans (4Blake D.J. Weir A. Newey S.E. Davies K.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 291-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a targeted mutation in the gene encoding the α-dystrobrevins also have muscle disease (5Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that α-dystrobrevin may be involved in intracellular signaling, because α-dystrobrevin-deficient mice develop a mild muscular dystrophy without disrupting the assembly of the DGC or the integrity of the sarcolemma, as is commonly seen in the other diseases involving DGC components (5Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 6Bredt D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E89-E91Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One possible explanation of this phenotype is that an unknown protein linked to α-dystrobrevin or disruption of an unidentified signaling cascade may cause muscular disease in these mice. Previously, in an attempt to elucidate this unidentified pathway, we isolated dysbindin (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Dysbindin is a widely expressed protein that binds to both α- and β-dystrobrevin in muscle and brain, respectively. Furthermore, dysbindin is up-regulated in dystrophin-deficient muscle (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and at cerebellar glomerular synapses of the mdx mouse model of DMD (7Sillitoe R.V. Benson M.A. Blake D.J. Hawkes R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6576-6585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a role for dysbindin in intracellular signaling has yet to be proven, dysbindin has recently been shown to be involved in protein trafficking and organelle biosynthesis. Dysbindin is mutated in a patient with the bleeding and pigmentation disorder Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 7 (HPS7) and in the sandy (sdy/sdy) mouse that is a murine model of the disease (8Li W. Zhang Q. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Gautam R. O'Brien E.P. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. Spritz R.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Amato D. Roe B.A. Starcevic M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Elliott R.W. Mishra V. Kingsmore S.F. Paylor R.E. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These disorders are characterized by defects in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, including melanocytes and platelet-dense granules (9Swank R.T. Novak E.K. McGarry M.P. Zhang Y. Li W. Zhang Q. Feng L. Pigment Cell Res. 2000; 13: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Huizing M. Anikster Y. Gahl W.A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 823-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Lysosome-related organelles are membrane-bound structures that are found in several cell types, generally have an acidic luminal pH, and contain LAMPs (lysosomal-associated membrane proteins) but lack the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (11Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dysbindin is part of a soluble 200-kDa protein complex, the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1), and binds directly to the proteins pallidin and muted, which are encoded by genes mutated in two additional models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (8Li W.

Several groups have now found genetic linkage of schizophrenia to polymorphisms in the gene encoding dysbindin in different populations (15Harrison P.J. Owen M.J. Lancet. 2003; 361: 417-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although no mutations in the coding region of the dysbindin gene have been found, cis-acting factors have a significant influence on the levels of the dysbindin expression in different individuals (16Bray N.J. Buckland P.R. Owen M.J. O'Donovan M.C. Hum. Genet. 2003; 113: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although dysbindin has now been implicated in a number of different diseases, little is known about its function. To determine the role of dysbindin in skeletal muscle, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential dysbindin binding partners. In this study, we describe the cloning and characterization of myospryn, a 413-kDa tripartite motif (TRIM)-related protein expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Transcripts orthologous to myospryn show altered regulation in DMD and stretched, hypertrophic muscle. Yeast Two-hybrid Screens—PCR products encoding amino acids 1–189 and amino acids 1–88 of dysbindin (Table I) were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pHyblexA (Invitrogen). Dysbindin-(1–189) was used as a bait plasmid in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library (Invitrogen) as described previously (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E.

The myospryn expression construct MD7:pEGFP was produced by cloning the SalI fragment of MD7 (Fig. 1) into the XhoI site of pEGFPC2 (Clontech). The MD9:pCMVtag construct was made by cloning the SalI fragment of MD9 into the XhoI site of pCMVtag2C.

The anti-myospryn antibody des122 was produced from a PCR product spanning amino acids 2791–2913. The myospryn template was amplified using the primers des122f (5′-TGCTGTCCAGAAAAGGACGATAGCAAA-3′) and des122r (5′-CATACCTGGTCCATCATCGAT-3′) and ligated in-frame into the vector pQE30-UA (Qiagen). This construct was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue. 100 ml of culture containing the recombinant plasmid were grown for 3 h (A600 ∼ 0.5) and induced using 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, and a des122-His tag fusion protein was purified under soluble conditions using the TALON affinity resin (Clontech). Rabbit immunization was performed at Sigma Genosys. Affinity purification of des122 antibodies was performed using Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For double immunofluorescence studies, 2 mg of affinity-purified des122 was directly labeled with Cy3.5 using the CyDye™ antibody labeling kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Direct conjugation of Cy3.5 to des122 had no apparent effect upon the specificity and efficacy of antibody labeling (data not shown). Similar to the detection of dysbindin in immunoprecipitates and rabbit tissue, PA3111A was directly conjugated to biotin using the ECL protein biotinylation module (Biosciences). Biotinylated PA3111A was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Protein Pull-down Assay and Immunoprecipitation—PCR products corresponding to the C-terminal domains of myospryn were produced using the following primers: BBC domain, BBCF (5′-CACAAAGACCACGAGGTTTC-3′) and BBCR1 (5′-GGCAGGCATGTTCTCTAAGGA-3′); BBox′, des9718f (5′-GAATCAGTGACCGCTAAGACACAC-3′) and des 9880r (5′-CTCCTAATTGAACCTTAACAGC-3′); two-hybrid dysbindin-binding site, des9626f (5′-CAGGAGCTCACGAGTGAGGG-3′) and des10098r (5′GGTCATGCAGGAACTCCATC-3′). The PCR products were ligated into the EcoRI site of the thioredoxin fusion protein vector, pET32b (Novagen). These constructs were then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) to produce fusion proteins. Thioredoxin-tagged proteins were purified under denaturing conditions on Talon resin columns (Clontech). Proteins were washed while on the column in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8) containing decreasing concentrations of urea (8, 6, 4, and 2 m) to refold the protein prior to elution with sonication buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. GST-tagged dysbindin was produced by PCR amplification of the coding region using the primers m10Salf (5′-CTGTCGACGGGGACGGCGATGCTGGAG-3′) and m10Salr (5′-CTGTCGACAATGTCCTGAGTTGAGTCACA-3′). This product was ligated into pGemT (Promega) and excised using SalI. The SalI fragment was then cloned in frame into SalI cut pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). The m10-pGEX-4T3 recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli XL1 Blue, and a fusion protein was produced as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. The GST-dysbindin fusion protein was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). 50 μg of thioredoxin-tagged domains and GST-dysbindin were mixed at room temperature for 3 h in a total volume of 1 ml of binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20, 20 mm imidazole, and 1× protease inhibitors (Sigma). 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer were added to the protein mixture and incubated with shaking for 1 h. The beads were captured magnetically and washed 3× in binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted into 25 μl of binding buffer mixed with 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated on two 10% PAGE gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, whereas the other gel was Western blotted as described earlier (22Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Gorecki D.C. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mouse quadriceps muscle (3g) was homogenized in 15 ml of 0.25× RIPA buffer (37.5 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.125% sodium deoxycholate, and 250 μm EGTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the homogenate was clarified by centrifugation (141,000 × g for 45 min in a Beckman SW41 rotor). Proteins were immunoprecipitated using 4 μg of des122 or PA3111A antibody and analyzed as described previously (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol.

Muscle Immunocytochemistry and Subcellular Fractionation—8-μm transverse sections of rat quadriceps muscle were fixed in -20 °C acetone for 30 s and allowed to air dry for 5 min. The fixed sections were then stained as described previously (24Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Ruegg M.A. Davies K.E. Blake D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2595-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle microsomes were prepared from rabbit muscle as described by Chu et al. (25Chu A. Dixon M.C. Saito A. Seiler S. Fleischer S. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, a New Zealand White rabbit was sacrificed by cervical dislocation. 60 g of quadriceps muscle was minced in a meat grinder, resuspended in 250 ml of homogenization buffer (5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sucrose, 100 μm ZnSO4, and 1× EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science), and homogenized in a Waring blender for 1 min at full speed. This homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of homogenization buffer and re-homogenized. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through six layers of sterilized cheesecloth and then centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 60 min. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer and stored at -70 °C. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C to minimize protein degradation, and samples were taken at each stage. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce), and 20 μg of each was analyzed by PAGE gels or Western blotting. Dysbindin Binds to a Novel Protein in Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—To identify potential dysbindin-interacting proteins in skeletal muscle, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed on a mouse muscle cDNA library using amino acids 1–189 of dysbindin as the bait. Screening a total of 1.8 × 106 independent clones produced 87 interacting clones, 44 of which were overlapping clones derived from the same novel gene (Fig. 1A). We have named this new gene myospryn. The interaction between myospryn and dysbindin was confirmed in vitro by using a liquid phase β-galactosidase assay on a variety of bait and prey plasmids that were co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 (Table I). This assay also revealed that the binding site for myospryn is located within the coiled-coil region of dysbindin. The interaction between myospryn and dysbindin occurs only when the coiled-coil domain of dysbindin is present but does not occur in its absence. Reporter gene activation is not seen when myospryn is co-transformed with the empty bait plasmid pHyblexA or when the N-terminal constructs of dysbindin are co-transformed with the empty prey plasmid, pYesTrp2. A control experiment utilizing the well characterized β-dystrobrevin-α-syntrophin C terminus interaction (22Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Loh N.Y. Gorecki D.C. Davies K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The C terminus of myospryn contains the BBC, FN3, and SPRY domains in a configuration that is reminiscent of members of the TRIM protein family (27Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S.

A region with apparent homology to a BBox domain is present prior to the BBC domain (Fig. 3A). However, a true BBox domain is characterized by the presence of four pairs of Zn2+-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues. The corresponding myospryn domain only contains two pairs of these conserved residues, so we have named this domain BBox′. Also of note in the primary sequence of myospryn is a 12-amino acid imperfect repeat (consensus sequence pIVhREEEHAPE; uppercase, 80% identity) that occurs nineteen times between amino acids 476–715 (Fig. 1B). A BLAST search performed on the non-redundant protein data base using the myospryn primary amino acid sequence showed that genethonin-3 (AAD55265), a transcript that is down-regulated in DMD (33Tkatchenko A.V.

The specificity of this antibody was confirmed by Western blotting protein extracts from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a full-length myospryn construct (Fig. 3A). Both des122A and B, which were purified from different rabbits, detect a 5,000 kDa protein in transfected cells (Fig. 3A). The des122B antibody was used for all of the experiments described herein. A mouse multiple tissue Western blot probed with des122 reveals a band of over 500 kDa present in cardiac and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3B). The increased apparent molecular mass of myospryn, when compared with the predicted value, may be due to the high content of acidic amino acids present in the protein. An α-tubulin antibody was used to probe an identical blot to show the presence of protein in all extracts. To confirm the tissue distribution of myospryn, a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was hybridized with the myospryn cDNA, and a transcript of ∼12 kb is detected in heart, skeletal muscle, and skin (Fig. 3C). A weak signal was also detected at ∼6 kb in skin, although this may be a specific degradation product of the large transcript. It is possible that the band visualized in skin is due to the presence of contaminating sub-dermal muscle mRNA present in the sample. The same blot was probed with a β-actin cDNA probe to show equal loading of mRNA in all lanes (Fig. 3C). Association of Myospryn and Dysbindin—To confirm the interaction between myospryn and dysbindin, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from transfected cells and fresh tissue. For the in vitro analysis, Myc-tagged dysbindin (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and the C terminus of myospryn (clone MD9, Fig. 1A) were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Dysbindin was immunoprecipitated from RIPA cell extracts using the anti-dysbindin antibody PA3111A. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by Western blotting with the myospryn-specific antiserum des122. This demonstrated that dysbindin co-immunoprecipitated myospryn strongly (Fig. 4A, top panel). When dysbindin is visualized using the rabbit polyclonal PA3111A, a rabbit IgG heavy chain band obscures the dysbindin band. For this reason, immunoprecipitation of dysbindin was confirmed using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, 9E10 (Fig. 4A, middle panel). In a control experiment, the known dysbindin-interacting protein, β-dystrobrevin (1Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol.

The GAr inhibits proteasome processing, an early step in antigen peptide presentation, but the mechanism of proteasome inhibition has been unclear. By embedding a GAr within ornithine decarboxylase, a natural proteasome substrate that does not require ubiquitin conjugation, we now demonstrate inhibition in a purified system, excluding involvement of ubiquitin conjugation or of proteins extraneous to substrate and proteasome. We show further that the GAr acts as a stop-transfer signal in proteasome substrate processing, resulting in vivo in partial proteolysis that halts just short of the GAr. Similarly, introducing a GAr into green fluorescent protein destabilized by the ornithine decarboxylase degradation domain also stops the progress of proteolysis, leading to the accumulation of partial degradation products. We postulate that the ATP motor of the proteasome slips when it encounters the GAr, impeding further insertion and, in this way, halting degradation.

We postulate that the ATP motor of the proteasome slips when it encounters the GAr, impeding further insertion and, in this way, halting degradation. Viruses use diverse strategies to subvert host defense mechanisms. The immune response offers a prominent target for such attacks (1Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 2Hewitt E.W. Immunology. 2003; 110: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Mounting a host immune response requires cleaving viral proteins to peptides and then presenting these as antigenic epitopes. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 1The abbreviations used are: EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; EBNA1, EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1; GAr, glycine-alanine repeat sequence; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; AZ1, antizyme 1; cODC, carboxyl-terminal degradation domain of ODC; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin.-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein of EBV is the sole viral protein required for genome replication in latent infections and is uniformly expressed in malignant cells that arise from EBV infection (3Leight E.R. Sugden B. Rev. Med. Virol. 2000; 10: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Within the EBNA1 protein lies a long repetitive sequence composed exclusively of glycine and alanine residues. Among different viral isolates, the repeat sequence ranges in size from about 60 to 300 residues (4Falk K. Gratama J.W. Rowe M. Zou J.Z. Khanim F. Young L.S. Oosterveer M.A. Ernberg I. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This sequence thwarts immune surveillance by forestalling presentation of EBNA1-derived peptides (5Levitskaya J. Coram M. Levitsky V. Imreh S. Steigerwald-Mullen P.M. Klein G. Kurilla M.G. Masucci M.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Antigenic peptides cannot be generated from the intact protein but can be produced from forms of EBNA1 which lack the repetitive sequence. The Gly-Ala repeat (GAr) restricts the immune response by preventing cleavage of EBNA1 by the proteasome (6Levitskaya J. Sharipo A. Leonchiks A. Ciechanover A. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12616-12621Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar); recent evidence shows that the GAr also inhibits EBNA1 translation (7Yin Y. Manoury B. Fahraeus R. Science. 2003; 301: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Proteasomes are the major neutral protease of eukaryotic cells and the major source of antigenic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The proteasome consists of two large protein complexes (8Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Its 20S catalytic core contains proteolytic sites concealed within a hollow cylindrical nanochamber. Access to the chamber lies through ports in the cylinder ends. A 19S regulatory complex is present at one or both ends of the cylinder. It comprises six distinct ATPases, all essential, and about a dozen additional proteins. Functions attributed to the 19S complex include substrate recognition, unfolding, and insertion into the catalytic cylinder. Fusion of GAr to diverse proteasome substrates has been found to reduce their turnover by the proteasome (9Sharipo A. Imreh M. Leonchiks A. Imreh S. Masucci M.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Heessen S. Leonchiks A. Issaeva N. Sharipo A. Selivanova G. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). GAr can thus function as a context-independent cis-inhibitory module. In most cases, processing by the proteasome requires that substrates first be modified by conjugation to multiple copies of the 76 amino acid ubiquitin protein (12Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Although a GAr sequence does not prevent this modification (6Levitskaya J. Sharipo A. Leonchiks A. Ciechanover A. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12616-12621Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), it is difficult to exclude quantitative or qualitative changes in ubiquitin conjugation. Some downstream step in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway is likely altered, but the nature of the impairment is not clear. Furthermore, providing EBNA1 with highly potent signals for ubiquitination can override the effect of a GAr, resulting in degradation by the proteasome and antigen presentation (13Tellam J. Sherritt M. Thomson S. Tellam R. Moss D.J. Burrows S.R. Wiertz E. Khanna R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33353-33360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Through a mechanism that remains undetermined, GAr potency, a function of repeat sequence length, thus seems to be poised against the extent or efficacy of ubiquitin conjugation. To examine the mechanism of GAr action, we utilized a natural substrate of the proteasome that does not require ubiquitin modification for degradation (14Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) has a short half-life that is modulated by interaction with the protein antizyme 1 (AZ1) (16Coffino P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). ODC initiates the biosynthesis of polyamines. Excess polyamines accelerate the production of AZ1, which interacts with ODC to enhance the affinity of ODC for proteasomes (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The trio of ODC, AZ1, and proteasome thereby comprise a feedback mechanism which enables polyamine pools to keep biosynthesis in check by controlling ODC turnover. The well understood structural and functional requirements for ODC degradation provide a test bed for investigating the GAr. In particular, because degradation of ODC is proteasome-mediated but independent of ubiquitin conjugation, it offers a context for investigating whether GAr action is limited to ubiquitin-conjugated proteasome substrates. We show here that a 30-residue GAr embedded in ODC strongly inhibits degradation of ODC by the proteasome. However, biochemical competition experiments showed that the repeat sequence does not impair proteasome-ODC interaction. The GAr must, therefore, function at a step downstream of substrate recognition by the proteasome. This conclusion was substantiated by the observation that in vivo degradation initiates at an undiminished rate, but then halts if the GAr is present. Degradation stops near the junction of the ODC degradation recognition element and the GAr. The repeat sequence can therefore act as a stop-transfer signal. Reagents—Methionine assay medium was purchased from Difco, protease inhibitor mixture tablets from Roche, MG132, cycloheximide, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel from Sigma, anti-His6 antibody and anti-HA antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-GFP antibody from BD Biosciences. Sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates, goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates, and protein A agarose were all from Amersham Biosciences. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—All plasmid constructions utilized standard molecular biology techniques (17Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed.

Constructions that utilized PCR steps were verified by sequencing; constructions that relied on restriction-ligation utilized fully sequenced constituents. Escherichia coli expression vectors for mouse ODC and carboxyl 37 amino acid truncated ODC were generated from vector pQE30 (Qiagen) as described (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mouse ODC with a GAr positioned after residue 424 was constructed as follows. First, a short sequence with flanking MluI/NdeI sites was cloned after the codon for residue 424 of ODC. After deleting a redundant NdeI site from the pQE30 vector, the ODC open reading frame with insert at 424 was cloned into the remaining NdeI site of the modified vector. For assembly of Gly-Ala 30 repeat with flanking N-terminal FLAG tag and C-terminal HA tag, 4 oligonucleotides were synthesized: GA1, CGCGTGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCTGGAGCAGGCGGTGGAGCAGGTGCTGGAGGTGCAGGTGGAG; GA2, CCTGCTCCACCTGCACCTCCAGCACCTGCTCCACCGCCTGCTCCAGCCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCA; GA3, CAGGCGGTGCAGGAGCAGGTGGTGCAGGTGCTGGAGGTGGAGCAGGTTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTCA; and GA4, TATGAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAACCTGCTCCACCTCCAGCACCTGCACCACCTGCTCCTGCACCG. GA1/GA2 and GA3/GA4 were annealed and phosphorylated by T4 kinase, digested by MluI/NdeI, and ligated to the similarly digested vector carrying ODC with Mlu I/NdeI sites at position 424. Expression in E. coli and purification of recombinant proteins was as described (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The synthetic protein module created in this fashion encodes (using single letter amino acid code) GSTR (linker1), DYKDDDDK (FLAG epitope), AGAGGGAGAGGAGGAGGAGAGGAGAGGGAG (Gly-Ala repeat), YPYDVPDYA (HA tag), and HMID (linker2). The 30-residue GA repeat is identical to the amino acid sequence of human EBNA-1 protein, strain B95–8, GI:59074, residues 196–225 (18Laux G. Perricaudet M. Farrell P.J.

The open reading frame consisting of ODC with this module inserted after position 424 is referred to as ODC::GAr. A construct otherwise identical, but with a shorter seven-residue GAr (AAGGGAG) was constructed by similar means and is referred to as ODC::GAr7. Constructs for expression of GFP and GFP destabilized by the addition of the C-terminal 37 amino acids of ODC were made as described (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The GAr module was inserted as described above. For use as SDS-PAGE molecular mass markers, recombinant proteins derived from ODC were made in E. coli and purified by Talon His6 affinity chromatography (Clontech). The structure and calculated molecular masses of these proteins were MRGS(H)6GSACEL-ODC residues 2–461::GAr, 57.7 kDa; MRGS(H)6-tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (seven residues)-GSM-(FLAG epitope)-ODC residues 2–461, 54.6 kDa; MRGS(H)6-(FLAG epitope)-ODC residues 2–445, 51.6 kDa. For yeast expression, ODC coding sequences were subcloned (SpeI/XhoI digestion) into the p414ADH vector with TRP selection marker (21Mumburg D. Muller R. Funk M.

In vitro degradation was assessed by examining the rate of labeled substrate degradation using 7.5 and 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) or by measuring the rate of production of acid soluble counts from labeled substrate (Fig. 2). SDS-PAGE autoradiogram band intensity was quantitated by scanning and analyzing with TotalLab version 2.00 software (Phoretix) in fully automatic mode using rolling circle background subtraction.Fig. 2Competitive inhibition of ODC degradation by ODC, ODCΔ37, and ODC::GAr.

An overnight culture was diluted to A600 = 0.15 with medium containing 50 μm MG132 (or Me2SO solvent for untreated controls) and incubated for 6 h before pulse label and chase, and performed as described above, except that 50 μm of MG132 was also included in the pulse and chase buffers. For cycloheximide chase, 20 ml of yeast transformant cultures in exponential growth phase (A600 0.2–1.0) were harvested by centrifugation (3 min, 2000 × g) and washed once with 1 ml of S.D. medium (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of chase medium (S.D. medium with 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide). Incubation was continued at 30 °C, and at each time point, 125 μl of cells were removed, centrifuged, resuspended in 125 μl of lysis buffer, and transferred to a 2-ml screw-top microcentrifuge tube containing 200 μl of 0.5-mm glass beads. Cells were lysed as in the pulse-chase assays. For immunoprecipitation with anti-His6 antibody, 400 μl of lysate in lysis buffer was incubated for 1 h at 4° with 2 μl of anti-His6 antibody. 20 μl of protein A agarose was added, and after an additional 1 h of incubation, samples were prepared for Western blotting. Immunoaffinity matrix beads were collected by brief centrifugation (2000 × g for 20 s) and washed 4 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS. To recover soluble samples for 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE fractionation, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (29Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K.

Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG was identical, except that the antiserum was purchased covalently linked to anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma). GAr Inhibits Proteolysis by Purified Components—The degradation element of mammalian ODC consists of its 37 carboxyl-terminal residues cODC. Grafting cODC to other proteins causes them to associate with the proteasome and converts them to proteasome substrates (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Depriving ODC of cODC has no effect on its enzymatic specific activity, implying that acquiring a native conformation does not require that the C terminus be present. Crystallographic models are consistent with the conclusion that cODC is a structurally distinct domain (24Almrud J.J. Oliveira M.A. Kern A.D. Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Hackert M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the junction of cODC with the remainder of the protein is an obvious place to insert sequences that could alter its turnover properties. We arbitrarily chose from within a longer EBV EBNA1 GAr sequence the 30-residue subsequence AGAGGGAGAGGAGGAGGAGAGGAGAGGGAG. To facilitate analysis required in experiments reported below, we flanked the GAr sequence with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) on the N-terminal side and an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) on its C-terminal side. This linker1-FLAG-GAr-HA-linker2 module was inserted after residue 424 of the 461 amino acid ODC protein to create ODC::GAr. Recombinant ODC and ODC::GAr had indistinguishable specific enzymatic activity and reactivity with AZ1 (results not shown). As reported previously, highly purified rat proteasomes degraded native ODC (without the GAr), and degradation depended upon the addition of AZ1 (Fig. 1, top). In sharp contrast, ODC::GAr was not measurably degraded in this assay (Fig. 1, bottom). Evaluating the release of soluble counts from a labeled substrate protein rather than disappearance of substrate, as in Fig. 1, offers a more sensitive way to determine the extent of degradation. For ODC, 15.6% of input counts were made soluble in the presence of AZ1 in 40 min versus 3.0% without AZ1; for ODC::GAr, these figures were 1.7 and 2.2%, respectively. Insertion of a GAr sequence evidently strongly inhibits ODC degradation, as reported for other proteins in cells and in crude extracts containing proteasomes (25Dantuma N.P. Masucci M.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It can also do so, as shown here, in a reaction containing only purified components. Neither Proteasome Interaction nor Catalytic Function Are Impaired by the GAr—One possible explanation of this finding is that the GAr prevents interaction between ODC and the proteasome. We used a competition assay (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) to test this idea. Radiolabeled ODC was incubated with limiting amounts of proteasomes together with various amounts of unlabeled competing proteins, and the extent of ODC degradation was determined by measuring the time-dependent release of soluble radiolabel. The competitors were ODC (structurally identical to the labeled substrate), a truncated form of ODC (ODCΔ37, which lacks the C-terminal ODC degradation element), and ODC::GAr (Fig. 2). As described previously, ODC acts as a competitive inhibitor (IC50 ∼ 2 μm) (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although both ODC::GAr and ODCΔ37 failed to undergo degradation (Fig. 1), ODC::GAr is at least as potent as ODC in the competition assay (IC50 ∼ 0.5 μm), in sharp contrast with ODCΔ37, which is inactive. We conclude that the GAr insert does not render ODC incompetent for interaction with proteasomes and must, therefore, act to prevent degradation at a step subsequent to proteasome recognition. To determine whether ODC::GAr acts to inhibit the catalytic function of the proteasome, we measured the effect of that protein on the peptidase activity of proteasomes, using the identical reaction conditions as in Fig. 2. The various forms of ODC, together with AZ1, were introduced at concentrations as high as 1000-fold the proteasome concentration to maximize our chance of seeing an effect. However, we observed no change in proteasome-mediated peptide hydrolysis upon incubation with ODC, ODCΔ37, or ODC::GAr (results not shown). The inhibitory effect of the GAr must, therefore, target some step that lies between recognition and catalysis. GAr Insert Causes Partial Proteolysis—Degradation of ODC has similar structural requirements in vitro and in vivo, but degradation is more rapid in living cells. Yeast expression was used to determine more sensitively whether ODC containing a GAr could be processed by the proteasome. Mammalian ODC turnover has similar characteristics in animal cells and in yeast: it is mediated by the proteasome and is sensitive to mutation of the same critical residues in the ODC C-terminal region (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In yeast, mammalian ODC has a half-life of about 10 min (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike animal cells, in which AZ1 has a very marked effect on ODC turnover, co-expression of AZ1 accelerates ODC turnover only about 2- to 3-fold. Therefore, we can use this in vivo model of mammalian ODC degradation without the need to co-express AZ1. Pulse-chase experiments in yeast with ODC::GAr were performed using anti-FLAG antibody for immunoprecipitation, and the results were evaluated by 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE, as in the in vitro degradation experiments. ODC::GAr was seen to undergo time-dependent changes in mobility during the course of the 60 min chase period (results not shown). To better resolve protein species that appeared in the course of the chase, we utilized 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. These fractionation conditions revealed a prominent parent band seen at the end of the 5 min pulse label period, which corresponded to the beginning of the chase period; this band diminished in the course of the chase and was replaced by a trio of bands of greater mobility, the fastest-moving being less intense than the other two (Fig. 3A, top). The proteins that appeared during the chase, the products of ODC::GAr post-translational processing, have been termed band 1 (slowest), band 2, and band 3 (fastest). Similar pulse-chase analysis of ODC without the GAr module (Fig. 3A, second from top) showed, as reported previously, that the protein turns over with a half-life of ∼15 min. (In an additional control experiment, ODC::GAr0, containing the GAr module but with no Gly-Ala residues present, was completely degraded and had the same kinetics as ODC (results not shown)). Importantly, both ODC::GAr and ODC disappeared at a similar rate (Fig. 3B), implying that the initial steps of their proteolysis proceed according to identical mechanisms. Pulse-chase analysis under identical conditions, but using a GAr insert of 7 residues rather than 30 (ODC::GAr7, Fig. 3A, third from top), also revealed the production of a partial proteolysis product, with mobility similar to that of band 1. For ODC::GAr (with the 30-residue GAr), the sum of the intensities of precursor and product bands was approximately constant during the entire 60-min chase period, which is consistent with a highly efficient block following partial ODC::GAr degradation. In significant and reproducible contrast, the sum of parent and product band densities diminished during the ODC::GAr7 chase period: in the representative experiment shown, only 42% of the total density present at 0 min was still present at 30 min; 38% was still present at 60 min. This result shows that less than half of the radiolabeled ODC::GAr7 protein pool undergoes partial proteolysis, and the rest is fully degraded. Within the size range examined, GAr length determines the efficiency of blocking further degradation of partial proteolysis products derived from ODC. The greater efficacy of GAr30 compared with GAr7 is consistent with previous findings that a longer GAr is a more effective inhibitor of degradation (11Dantuma N.P. Heessen S. Lindsten K. Jellne M. Masucci M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8381-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rate at which ODC, ODC::GAr7, and ODC::GAr diminished was indistinguishable (Fig. 3B). However, the products of ODC::GAr7 and ODC::GAr (with 30 GAr residues) differed in two ways: (i) the longer GAr produced three bands which together accounted for all the products of the parent band; and (ii) the shorter GAr produced only one partial degradation product (similar in mobility to band 1 of the partial proteolysis trio), and this single band accounted for only a part of the products of parent band proteolysis. The role of the proteasome in the production of bands 1–3 was tested in two ways. Mutation of residue Cys441 of native ODC has been shown to prevent ODC proteasome degradation in both animal cells and in yeast (15Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Miyazaki Y. Matsufuji S. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Introducing a C441A mutation in ODC::GAr stabilized the protein and prevented the appearance of bands 1–3 during a pulse-chase experiment (Fig. 3A, bottom). This finding, therefore, implies that proteasomes produce the slower-migrating species by partially digesting ODC::GAr. Next, we showed that a proteasome inhibitor prevented the production of bands 1–3. Pharmacologic proteasome inhibitors are relatively ineffective in wild-type yeast (28Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) but are more effective in strains lacking the Rpn4 protein, a positive transcriptional regulator of proteasome-associated genes. By preventing compensatory changes in proteasome function, mutating Rpn4 makes it possible to use highly specific proteasome inhibitors in yeast (20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In an rpn4Δ deletion strain, ODC::GAr turned over with a half-life of more than 60 min (Fig. 3C, top and D). The half-life of both ODC::GAr and ODC is prolonged severalfold in rpn4Δ cells compared with Rpn4 wild-type cells (compare Refs. 20Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Toth C. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25921-25926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, and Fig. 3A), presumably because proteasome-associated genes are down-regulated. The peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor MG132 impaired ODC::GAr degradation and almost completely prevented production of the minor bands (Fig. 3C, second from top, and D), confirming the inference that proteasomes produce the smaller proteins by partially cleaving ODC::GAr. ODC was also stabilized by the inhibitor (Fig. 3C, bottom pair of gels, and D). As was observed"
https://openalex.org/W1989220379,"Phosphorylation events play a crucial role in Raf activation. Phosphorylation of serines 259 and 621 in C-Raf and serines 364 and 728 in B-Raf has been suggested to be critical for association with 14-3-3 proteins. To study the functional consequences of Raf phosphorylations at these positions, we developed and characterized phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding epitopes: a monoclonal phosphospecific antibody (6B4) directed against pS621 and a polyclonal antibody specific for B-Raf-pS364 epitope. Although 6B4 detected both C- and B-Raf in Western blots, it specifically recognizes the native form of C-Raf but not B-Raf. Contrary to B-Raf, a kinase-dead mutant of C-Raf was found to be only poorly phosphorylated in the Ser-621 position. Moreover, serine 259 to alanine mutation prevented the Ser-621 phosphorylation suggesting an interdependence between these two 14-3-3 binding domains. Direct C-Raf·14-3-3 binding studies with purified proteins combined with competition assays revealed that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding pS621 represents the high affinity binding site, whereas the pS259 epitope mediates lower affinity binding. Raf isozymes differ in their 14-3-3 association rates. The time course of endogenous C-Raf activation in mammalian cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) has been examined using both phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding sites (6B4 and anti-pS259) as well as phosphospecific antibodies directed against the activation domain (anti-pS338 and anti-pY340/pY341). Time course of Ser-621 phosphorylation, in contrast to Ser-259 phosphorylation, exhibited unexpected pattern reaching maximal phosphorylation within 30 s of NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 340/341 reached maximal levels subsequent to Ser-621 phosphorylation and was coincident with emergence of kinase activity. Taken together, we found substantial differences between C-Raf·14-3-3 binding epitopes pS259 and pS621 and visualized for the first time the sequence of the essential C-Raf phosphorylation events in mammalian cells in response to growth factor stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2085768039,"The <i>Escherichia coli</i> multidrug transporter MdfA contains a membrane-embedded charged residue (Glu-26) that was shown to play an important role in substrate recognition. To identify additional determinants of multidrug recognition we isolated 58 intragenic second-site mutations that restored the function of inactive MdfA E26<i>X</i> mutants. In addition, two single-site mutations that enhanced the activity of wild-type MdfA were identified. Most of the mutations were found in two regions, the cytoplasmic half of transmembrane segments (TMs) 4, 5, and 6 (cluster 1) and the periplasmic half of TM 1 and 2 (cluster 2). The identified residues were mutated to cysteines in the background of a functional cysteine-less MdfA, and substrate protection against alkylation was analyzed. The results support the suggestion that the two clusters are involved in substrate recognition. Using inverted membrane vesicles we observed that a proton electrochemical gradient (<mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>˜</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><sub>H<sup>+</sup></sub>, inside positive and acidic) enhanced the substrate-protective effect in the cytoplasmic region, whereas it largely reduced this effect in the periplasmic side of MdfA. Therefore, we propose that substrates interact with two sites in MdfA, one in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane and the other in the periplasmic leaflet. Theoretically, these domains could constitute a large part of the multidrug pathway through MdfA."
https://openalex.org/W1993777599,"The GLUT1 glucose transporter has been proposed to form an aqueous substrate translocation pathway via the clustering of several amphipathic transmembrane helices (Mueckler, M., Caruso, C., Baldwin, S. A., Panico, M., Blench, I., Morris, H. R., Allard, W. J., Lienhard, G. E., and Lodish, H. F. (1985) Science 229, 941–945). The possible role of transmembrane helix 8 in the formation of this permeation pathway was investigated using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). Twenty-one GLUT1 mutants were created from a fully functional cysteine-less parental GLUT1 molecule by successively changing each residue along transmembrane segment 8 to a cysteine. The mutant proteins were then expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their membrane concentrations, 2-deoxyglucose uptake activities, and sensitivities to pCMBS were determined. Four positions within helix 8, alanine 309, threonine 310, serine 313, and glycine 314, were accessible to pCMBS as judged by the inhibition of transport activity. All four of these residues are clustered along one face of a putative α-helix. These results suggest that transmembrane segment 8 of GLUT1 forms part of the sugar permeation pathway. Updated two-dimensional models for the orientation of the 12 transmembrane helices and the conformation of the exofacial glucose binding site of GLUT1 are proposed that are consistent with existing experimental data and homology modeling based on the crystal structures of two bacterial membrane transporters.

Passive transport of glucose across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is mediated by members of the GLUT (SLC2a) family of membrane glycoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 17-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 3Pessin J.E. Bell G.I. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The GLUT protein family belongs to the major facilitator superfamily, the largest superfamily of proteins that function as membrane transporters (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT1, also known as the red cell glucose transporter, is perhaps the most extensively studied of all membrane transporters (5Mueckler M. Hresko R.C. Sato M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of glucose transport in the human red blood cell are mostly consistent with a simple alternating conformation mechanism (6Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. Vol. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 597-634Google Scholar). Although kinetic anomalies have been observed in human erythrocytes that appear to be inconsistent with this simple mechanism (7Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 8Cloherty E.K. Heard K.S. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10411-10421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), an alternate explanation is that the anomalies may be the result of difficulties in accurately measuring steady-state kinetic properties in the red cell. GLUT1 was predicted to possess 12 transmembrane helices based on hydrophobicity analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). This prediction has been confirmed by glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis (10Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the 12 proposed transmembrane segments are predicted to form amphipathic α-helices, an observation which led to the hypothesis that these helices form the walls of a water-filled chamber through which glucose permeates the lipid bilayer (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). It was also proposed that the hydroxyl- and amide-containing amino acid side chains within these helices form the sugar binding site(s) of GLUT1 via hydrogen bond formation with glucose hydroxyl groups, although hydrophobic interactions between aromatic amino acid side chains and the C-6 region of glucose also appear to be important (11Barnett J.E.

Valine 165, which is positioned one helical turn distant from glutamine 161, is accessible to aqueous sulfhydryl reagents and appears to be near the exofacial substrate binding site based on mutagenesis and inhibitor studies (19Mueckler M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, hydrogen exchange studies demonstrate that 30% of peptide hydrogen atoms are exposed to water in purified reconstituted GLUT1, which is consistent with the presence of an aqueous cleft in the membrane (21Jung E.K.

In this study cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used in conjunction with a sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagent to examine the possible role of transmembrane segment 8 in the formation of the GLUT1 substrate translocation pathway. Our results suggest that transmembrane segment 8 is an amphipathic α-helix with a water-accessible face that lines the exofacial portion of the sugar permeation pathway.

The 100× concentrated reagent stock was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. After a 15-min incubation period, the oocytes were washed four times in Barth’s saline and then used for the determination of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C).

Western blot analysis of each of the mutant transporters was performed on ∼1 μg of total membrane protein, and the intensity of the glycosylated GLUT1 band was quantified by scanning densitometry using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager SI. Analysis was performed using the ImageQuant NT program (Version 4.0). 2-[3H]Deoxyglucose uptake (pmol/oocyte/30 min) of each mutant was concomitantly determined in each set of experiments. Specific activity is expressed as the 2-deoxyglucose uptake/ng of mutant GLUT1 protein expressed/μg of total oocyte membrane protein. Purified human erythrocyte membranes were loaded on the same gels as the oocyte membrane samples for use as a quantitative standard.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) the properties of a cysteine-less (C-less) human GLUT1 polypeptide in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either serine or glycine residues. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes the C-less transporter exhibits transport activity nearly indistinguishable from wild-type GLUT1 (19Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating that none of the native cysteine residues plays an essential role in transport function. C-less GLUT1 cDNA was used as a template to construct single-C mutants for transmembrane segment 8. Mutant cDNAs were constructed using oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis in which each of the 21 residues within transmembrane segment 8 was individually changed to a cysteine residue producing 21 mutant GLUT1 molecules, each possessing only a single cysteine residue (see Table I).Table ICysteine scanning mutagenesis of helix 8 cDNA encoding cysteine-less human Glut1 was subjected to oligonucleotide-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis, creating a series of 21 mutant cDNAs in which each of the 21 residues within transmembrane helix 8 was individually changed to cysteine.

As we have observed for the analysis of other GLUT1 helices (13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the single-C mutants were expressed at varying concentrations in the oocyte plasma membrane necessitating the normalization of uptake data to expression levels to directly compare the catalytic activities of the mutants with the C-less parent. The expression of 20 of the 21 single-C mutants was detected readily in the oocytes, but the V316C mutant was expressed at levels too low to enable further analysis. Transport activity above the very low endogenous oocyte background level was detectable for all 20 mutants as determined by uptake of 2-[3H]deoxyglucose. The absolute uptake data are shown in Fig. 2a, and the specific transport activities normalized to the plasma membrane content of each mutant are presented in Fig. 2b. Cysteine substitution at threonine 310, asparagine 317, and threonine 318 significantly reduced specific transport activity relative to the C-less parent, whereas cysteine substitution at isoleucine 311 increased specific transport activity. To determine which transmembrane residues are accessible to the external aqueous solvent and may therefore comprise part of the sugar permeation pathway, transport activity was measured for each of the 21 mutants after incubation in the presence of the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent, pCMBS (Fig. 3). We have demonstrated previously (19Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that pCMBS can permeate the glucose permeation pathway of GLUT1 and has close access to the exofacial sugar binding site. Fig. 3 presents the transport activities observed in the presence of pCMBS normalized for each mutant to the activity measured in the absence of the reagent, i.e. a value of 1 indicates no effect of pCMBS, values greater than 1 indicate stimulation by pCMBS, and values less than 1 indicate inhibition by pCMBS. The activity of four single-C mutants (A309C, T310C, S313C, and G314C) was significantly inhibited after incubation with pCMBS, indicating that the corresponding amino acid side chains reacted with the pCMBS and therefore must be accessible to the external aqueous solvent. V165C represents a well characterized positive control for inhibition by pCMBS (13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Helical wheel analysis of the results of the pCMBS inhibition experiments revealed that the four residues accessible to pCMBS from the external aqueous solvent are clustered together along one face of a putative α-helix formed by transmembrane segment 8 (see Fig. 4). These results are similar to those obtained with helices 2 (12Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 5 (13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 10 (15Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and 11 (16Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Helix 7 appears to be unique in that it contains residues sensitive to pCMBS along its entire circumference, implying that its N-terminal half is completely immersed in solvent (14Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Not unexpectedly, the four residues within helix 8 that are clearly reactive to pCMBS all lie within the exoplasmic half of the helix, a result similar to that observed with helices 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 11, all of which possess residues close to the exoplasmic face that are accessible to the pCMBS present in the external solvent. Cysteine substitution at three positions (threonine 310, asparagine 317, and threonine 318) caused significant reductions in the intrinsic transport activity of GLUT1. The side chains of threonine 310 and asparagine 317 are predicted to lie within the aqueous translocation pathway based on the presumed orientation of the helix according to pCMBS sensitivity, suggesting that these residues may be directly involved in hydrogen bonding to glucose lying in the exofacial binding pocket. However, pCMBS reactivity only inhibited transport at position 310, which is inconsistent with hydrogen bonding between glucose and the side chain of asparagine 317. Because asparagine 317 lies further toward the cytoplasmic face of the membrane than any of the amino acid positions that were sensitive to pCMBS reactivity, it is possible that helix 8 twists as it passes through the membrane such that asparagine 317 actually abuts an adjacent helix (see Fig. 5a). The serine side chain of this residue may be involved in stabilizing helical packing via hydrogen bonding to a residue in an adjacent helix (5Mueckler M. Hresko R.C. Sato M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar or 10Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, a cysteine substitution at threonine 318 may disrupt hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl group of the threonine side chain and a side chain from an abutting helix. Interestingly, a cysteine substitution at isoleucine 311 significantly increased specific transport activity. This residue is predicted to either be in contact with the lipid or to abut helix 5 (see Fig. 5b). It is possible that the bulky isoleucine side chain at this position slightly impairs the movement of helices 5 and 8 associated with the transporter cycle and that this is reflected by increased activity observed upon substitution with the much more compact cysteine side chain. A major breakthrough in our understanding of the structure of the major facilitator transporters was reported recently in the form of x-ray crystallographic data at near-atomic resolution for the Escherichia coli lac permease (26Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and the glycerol-3-P antiporter (27Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Both molecules were crystallized in their cytoplasmic facing orientations, and in this form, the molecules exhibit a very similar basic folding pattern with a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry. The data for these two members of the major facilitator superfamily are consistent with the 12-transmembrane helical model that was first proposed for GLUT1 (9Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). The pseudosymmetry also supports the notion that the 12 transmembrane transporter genes are descended from a common 6 transmembrane-encoding ancestral gene that underwent a duplication event. Based on the crystallographic data, 8 of the 12 transmembrane helices form a central cavity containing the cytoplasmic substrate binding site. Remarkably, the structures suggest analogous mechanisms for cotransport and antiport and, by inference, simple uniport involving the tilting of helices such that substrate binding sites are alternately exposed to either the cytoplasm or exoplasm. An alternating conformation mechanism of this type was originally postulated by Vidaver (28Vidaver G.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1966; 10: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) nearly four decades ago based purely on kinetic considerations, and inhibitor (29Barnett J.E. Holman G.D. Chalkley R.A. Munday K.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and spectroscopic studies (30Appleman J.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8221-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Appleman J.R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4575-4578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the red cell glucose transporter have strongly supported such a mechanism. All of the cysteine accessibility experiments (12Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) on GLUT1 employing pCMBS to detect solvent-accessible helical faces pertain to the exofacial conformation of the transporter, and thus the available crystallographic data for the lac permease and the glycerol-3-P antiporter may not be directly applicable to these GLUT1 data. However, it is likely that GLUT1 shares the same basic helical packing arrangement with these two bacterial transporters and that this arrangement is maintained during the transport cycle, i.e. major shifts in the relative arrangement of helices in the plane of the membrane do not occur. Given this assumption, we can use homology modeling to update our crude two-dimensional model for the exofacial substrate binding site of GLUT1. Helices 2 (12Olsowski A. Monden I. Krause G. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 5 (13Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have solvent-accessible residues along their entire cross-sectional perimeter (14Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36176-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These experimental observations are completely consistent with the helical packing of the lac permease (26Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (27Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) in their cytoplasmic facing orientations, suggesting that the transmembrane helices do not rotate substantially in the plane of the membrane during conversion to the outward facing form. The central solvent-accessible cavity is proposed to be formed by helices 1, 2, 4, and 5 in the N-terminal half of the molecule and by the analogous helices 7, 8, 10, and 11 in the C-terminal half. A ribbon diagram of the transmembrane helices as shown from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane and in the cytoplasmic facing orientation, based on homology modeling using the lac permease structure as a template, is shown in Fig. 5a. A putative model of the exofacial binding pocket is shown in Fig. 5b. Residues within helices 5, 7, and 11 have been implicated in exofacial substrate binding (reviewed in Ref. 32Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Glucose is known to be stabilized in the exofacial binding pocket via interactions between GLUT1 and the hydroxyls at positions 1, 3, and 4 (11Barnett J.E. Holman G.D. Munday K.A. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The orientation of helices 5 and 7 in the model is consistent with hydrogen bond formation between hydroxyl groups of a dehydrated glucose molecule lying in the exofacial binding pocket and two residues directly implicated in substrate binding, glutamine 161 (17Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutamine 282 (18Hashiramoto M. Kadowaki T. Clark A.E. Muraoka A. Momomura K. Sakura H. Tobe K. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine 282 appears to interact directly with the glucose C-1 hydroxyl group (33Seatter M.J. De la Rue S.A. Porter L.M. Gould G.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The orientation of helix 5 is also consistent with the observation that valine 165 lies near the outer vestibule of the exofacial substrate binding site, although this residue is not directly involved in transport activity (19Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies (19Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that side chains bulkier than valine are not tolerated at position 165, whereas smaller side chains are tolerated. The orientation of valine 165 in the model is consistent with bulky substitutions at this position interfering with hydrogen bond formation between glucose and glutamine 161. The low transport activity of the T310C and N317C mutants along with their orientation along the solvent-exposed face of helix 8 suggests that the side chains of these residues may be involved in hydrogen bond formation with glucose in the exofacial substrate binding site. The orientation of helix 11 is consistent with a hydrophobic interaction between the C-6 region of glucose and tryptophan 412. A hydrophobic interaction, possibly a stacking interaction involving an aromatic ring of GLUT1 and the C-6 region of glucose, was predicted by Barnett et al. (11Barnett J.E. Holman G.D. Munday K.A. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) based on transport studies employing substituted glucose analogs. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that a tryptophan at position 412 is critical for transport activity (20Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and additional studies indicate that an aromatic ring is essential at this position. 3M. Mueckler, unpublished observations. Determination of the structure of GLUT1 in the outward facing configuration awaits the crystallization of the protein, a feat that has not yet been achieved for any eukaryotic membrane protein. Although the recent successes with the bacterial transporters are encouraging, the problems faced with eukaryotic membrane proteins, including structural heterogeneity because of post-translational modifications and the lack of robust overexpression systems, are extraordinarily daunting. In the interim, various biochemical approaches can be used to test the applicability of homology modeling based on the structures of the lac permease and glycerol-3-P antiporter."

Here we report a mutational analysis of 16 conserved residues in motifs Ia (534TQPRRVAA541), IV (695LVFLTG700), and V (757TNIAETSIT765). Mutants T757A, I764A, and T765A were lethal, and F697A cells did not grow at ≤30 °C. The mutant proteins failed to catalyze mRNA release from the spliceosome in vitro, and they were deficient for RNA unwinding. The F697A, I764A, and T765A proteins were active for ATP hydrolysis in the presence of RNA cofactor. The T757A mutant retained basal ATPase activity but was not stimulated by RNA, whereas ATP hydrolysis by T765A was strictly dependent on the RNA cofactor. Thus Thr-757 and Thr-765 in motif V link ATP hydrolysis to the RNA cofactor. To illuminate the mechanism of Prp22-catalyzed mRNA release, we performed a genetic screen to identify extragenic suppressors of the cold-sensitive growth defect of a helicase/release-defective Prp22 mutant. We identified one of the suppressors as a missense mutation of PRP8 (R1753K), a protein component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. We show that PRP8-R1753K suppressed multiple helicase-deficient prp22 mutations, including the lethal I764A mutation. Replacing Arg-1753 of Prp8 by either Lys, Ala, Gln, or Glu resulted in suppression of helicase-defective Prp22 mutants. Prp8-Arg1753 mutations by themselves caused temperature-sensitive growth defects in a PRP22 strain.

ATP hydrolysis is essential for the in vivo functions of Brr2, Prp2, Prp16, Prp22, and Prp43, insofar as mutations that abolish ATPase activity in vitro are invariably lethal in vivo (5Kim D.H. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Martin A. Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15452-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Prp22 plays two distinct roles during pre-mRNA splicing. It is important for the second catalytic step that results in formation of mRNA, and it is essential for releasing mature mRNA from the spliceosome (13Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In yeast extract depleted of Prp22, spliceosomes assemble on actin pre-mRNA and the first step occurs, leading to accumulation of the 5′ exon and lariat intermediates. Upon addition of purified Prp22, mRNA is formed in an ATP-independent fashion. The role of Prp22 in mRNA formation is not well understood, and no mutation in Prp22 has been identified that specifically abates step 2 function without abolishing interaction with the spliceosome. Deletion analyses established that an N-terminal segment spanning residues 262–465 of the 1145-aa Prp22 protein is important for spliceosome binding (34Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The interaction of Prp22 with the precursor RNA during the splicing reaction has been probed by cross-linking using chemically modified RNAs; Prp22 can be cross-linked to the last 8 nucleotides at the 3′ splice site of the intron in a sequence-independent fashion. This suggests that Prp22 might bind to the precursor RNA prior to step 2 (35McPheeters D.S. Schwer B. Muhlenkamp P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 36McPheeters D.S. Muhlenkamp P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4174-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Release of mRNA from the spliceosome depends on ATP hydrolysis by Prp22 (13Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Wagner J.D.O. Jankowsky E. Company M. Pyle A.M. Abelson J.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2926-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although necessary, ATPase activity does not suffice for mRNA release. For example, S635A and T637A mutations in motif III (SAT) result in severe cold-sensitive growth defects that correlate with the inability of the mutant proteins to catalyze mRNA release from the spliceosome and to unwind a synthetic RNA duplex in vitro (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The S635A and T637A proteins are proficient in hydrolyzing ATP. These findings suggest that the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis by Prp22 needs to be coupled to mechanical work (e.g. RNA unwinding) in disassembly of the spliceosome. The growth and RNA unwinding defects incurred by altering motif III in Prp22 can be suppressed by single amino acid changes within the core ATPase/helicase domain (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that these mutations alter the conformation and/or flexibility of Prp22 to restore mRNA release and RNA unwinding. Four of the intragenic suppressors of cold-sensitive Prp22 mutants mapped within or close to motifs Ia (534TQPRRVAA541), IV (695LVFLTG700), and V (757TNIAETSIT765) (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby implicating motifs Ia, IV, and V in helicase activity. Here we examine the effects of 16 alanine substitution mutations in motifs Ia, IV, and V on Prp22 function in vivo and in vitro. We identify three individual amino acids in motif V (Thr-757, Ile-764, and Thr-765) and one in motif IV (Phe-697) that are important for Prp22 function in vivo, for mRNA release in vitro, and for helicase activity in vitro. The I764A and F697A proteins exhibit ATPase activity that is stimulated by RNA. ATP hydrolysis by T765A is dependent on the RNA cofactor, whereas T757A displays basal ATPase activity that is not stimulated by RNA. Thus, Thr-757 and Thr-765 are important to link ATP hydrolysis to the RNA cofactor. Understanding the mechanism of Prp22 function in detail requires the analysis of the macromolecular interactions in the spliceosome that are remodeled by Prp22. We describe the isolation of spontaneous extragenic suppressors of the cold-sensitive prp22-S635A mutant. One of these suppressors maps to the essential PRP8 gene that encodes a constituent of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (38Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 39Lossky M. Anderson G.J. Jackson S.P. Beggs J.

A. 1999; 96: 7226-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The 2413-aa Prp8 protein plays important roles during spliceosome assembly and both transesterification steps (38Brown J.D. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Collins C.A. Guthrie C. Nat. Struct.

We show that a single missense mutation in Prp8, R1753K, suppresses the growth defects of multiple helicase-defective Prp22 mutants, including the lethal mutant prp22-I764A. The findings that several different substitutions for Arg-1753 of Prp8 suppress helicase-defective prp22 mutations and that these mutant PRP8 alleles are temperature-sensitive in vivo suggest that Prp8 makes a contact via Arg-1753 to either RNA or protein, which cannot be disrupted by helicase-deficient Prp22 mutants. Targeted Mutagenesis of PRP22—Alanine mutations were introduced into the PRP22 gene by using the two-stage PCR overlap extension method. Plasmid p358-PRP22 (CEN TRP1 PRP22), which contains the PRP22 coding region (3435 bp) plus 232 bp upstream and 255 bp downstream of flanking yeast genomic DNA, was used as the template for the first amplification step (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Residues targeted for Ala substitutions are as follows: Thr-534, Gln-535, Pro-536, Arg-537, and Arg-538 in motif Ia; Leu-695, Phe-697, Thr-699, and Gly-700 in motif IV; and Thr-757, Asn-758, Asp-761, Thr-762, Ser-763, Ile-764, and Thr-765 in motif V. The mutated DNA products of the second stage amplification were digested with restriction endonucleases and inserted into p358-PRP22 in lieu of the corresponding wild type restriction fragments (yielding p358-T534A, p358-Q535A, etc.). The presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the segments corresponding to the inserted restriction fragment were then sequenced completely in order to exclude the acquisition of unwanted mutations during amplification or cloning. Test of Mutational Effects on PRP22 Function in Vivo by Plasmid Shuffle—Viability of the prp22Δ strain (MATa ura3 trp1 his3 leu2 ade2 prp22::LEU2) depends on the plasmid p360-PRP22 (PRP22 URA3 CEN). prp22Δ was transformed with TRP1 plasmids carrying the various PRP22-Ala mutants. Trp+ transformants were selected and streaked to agar medium containing 0.75 mg/ml 5-fluororotic acid (5-FOA) to select against the URA3 PRP22 plasmid. The ability of the mutant PRP22 alleles to support growth on 5-FOA was tested at 15, 30, and 37 °C. 5-FOA survivors were streaked to YPD agar medium and incubated at different temperatures from 15 to 37 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Prp22 Protein—Plasmid pET16b-PRP22 expresses an N-terminal His-tagged version of wild type Prp22 in bacteria under the control of a T7 promoter (13Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here we constructed pET-based plasmids for expression of His-tagged Prp22 mutants F697, T757A, I764A, and T765A. The expression plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon Plus(DE3)RIL (Stratagene). Cultures were inoculated from single colonies of freshly transformed cells and maintained in logarithmic growth at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin to a final volume of 1 liter. When the A600 reached 0.6 to 0.8, the cultures were chilled on ice for 30 min and then adjusted to 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 2% ethanol. The cultures were incubated for 16 h at 17 °C with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at –80 °C. All subsequent operations were performed at 4 °C. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml, and the suspensions were mixed gently for 40 min and then adjusted to 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The solubility of the mutant proteins F697A, T757A, I764A, and T765A was similar to that of wild type Prp22. The soluble lysate was mixed for 1 h with 10 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-ntirilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated in buffer A. The resin was recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A, and collected again by centrifugation. The washed resin was suspended in 40 ml of buffer A and poured into a column. Adsorbed proteins were eluted stepwise with 25, 100, and 500 mm imidazole in buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The elution profiles of recombinant Prp22 were monitored by SDS-PAGE of the column fractions. Wild type Prp22 and the mutated polypeptides were recovered predominantly in the 100 mm imidazole eluate (containing 5–8 mg of protein). Aliquots (160–200 μg) of the nickel-agarose preparations were applied to 4.8 ml of 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 47,000 rpm in a Sorvall SW50 rotor. Fractions (0.18 ml) were collected from the tops of the tubes. The elution profiles of the Prp22 proteins were gauged by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye-binding reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. ATPase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 μg of poly(A), and Prp22 proteins as specified were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 280 μl of a 5% (w/v) suspension of activated charcoal (Sigma) in 20 mm phosphoric acid. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and the charcoal was recovered by centrifugation. 32P radioactivity in the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The results are values obtained from duplicate reaction mixtures with a deviation of less than 10%. Helicase Assay—To prepare the RNA/DNA hybrid substrate, an in vitro synthesized 97-mer RNA molecule (5′-GCGAAUUGGGCCCUCUAGAUGCAUGCUCGAGCGGCCGCCAGUGUGAUGGAUAUCUGCAGAAUUCGCCCUUAAACCAUAAUCAUACCAGUUUUGGCAG-3′) was annealed to a 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide (40-mer) complementary to the RNA (underlined) using a 3:1 molar ratio of the DNA to RNA. The RNA/DNA hybrid substrate was then purified by native gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled double-stranded RNA substrate was prepared as described previously (13Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The helicase assays were performed as described previously (13Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). RNA Binding Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 25 fmol of RNA substrate, and Prp22 as specified were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then transferred to ice. Glycerol and Triton X-100 were added to a final concentration of 6 and 0.05%, respectively. The reaction products (free substrate and protein-RNA complex) were resolved by native PAGE (6% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1), 0.25× TBE, 0.05% Triton X-100) and visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel. Pre-mRNA Splicing in Vitro—Yeast whole cell extract from strain BJ2168 was prepared using the liquid nitrogen method (43Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4001-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The extract was immunodepleted using polyclonal, affinity-purified anti-Prp22 antibodies. Splicing reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 50% Prp22-depleted extract, 105 cpm (∼2 fmol) of [32P]GMP-labeled actin precursor RNA, 60 mm potassium phosphate, 3% (w/v) PEG8000, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 2mm ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 23 °C, and then 4–5 ng of wild type or mutant Prp22 protein was added and incubation continued for 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were halted by transfer to ice. For analyses of spliceosome disassembly, the reaction volumes were increased to 100 μl, and the amount of Prp22 protein added was ∼200 ng. Reaction mixtures were layered onto 15–40% glycerol gradients containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2. The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 14 h at 35,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH641 rotor. Fractions (400 μl) were collected from the tops of the tubes. RNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA from alternate fractions was analyzed by electrophoresis through a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 1× TBE. Radiolabeled RNA was visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel. Extragenic Suppressors of the prp22-S635A cs Phenotype—Spontaneous suppressors were selected as described (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, 80 independent cultures were inoculated with single colonies of YBST2 (MATa ura3-52 trp1-63 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1 ade2-101 lys2-801 prp22::LEU2 p360-prp22-S635A (URA3 CEN)) cells and grown at 30 °C, the nonpermissive temperature for S635A. Cultures that showed growth after 3–6 days were plated to YPD agar and incubated at 30 °C. Each of the strains that grew was transformed with a CEN TRP1 prp22-S635A plasmid. Trp+ transformants were plated to 5-FOA at 30 and 37 °C to select cells that had lost the original prp22-S635A CEN URA3 plasmid. Eight strains that grew at 30 °C were considered to contain chromosomal suppressor mutations. In 18 other strains that failed to grow at 30 °C, the suppressing mutation was linked to the original prp22-S635A URA3 CEN plasmid (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We provisionally named the extragenic suppressors SHM1 to SHM8 (suppressor of helicase mutant). We focused our analysis on the shm1-1 mutant strain YBST3 (MATa ura3-52 trp1-63 his3-Δ200 leu2Δ1 ade2-101 lys2-801 shm1-1 prp22::LEU2 p360-prp22-S635A (URA3 CEN)). Suppression of Cold-sensitive and Lethal prp22 Mutant Alleles by shm1-1—CEN TRP1 carrying either PRP22 or the cold-sensitive prp22-Ala alleles under control of the natural PRP22-promoter were introduced into YBST2 and YBST3. Trp+ transformants were selected and streaked to 5-FOA medium at 30 and 37 °C to eliminate the URA3 prp22-S635A plasmid. 5-FOA survivors were patched to YPD agar medium and then inoculated in liquid medium, and the cultures were grown at the respective permissive temperatures. Serial dilutions (10–2, 10–3, 10–4, and 10–5) were spotted onto YPD agar plates and incubated at temperatures from 15 to 37 °C. Cloning of SHM1 by Complementation—prp22-H606A/shm1-1 cells were transformed with a wild type genomic library on 2-μm URA3 (in YEP24). Ura+ transformants were selected at 37 °C. The plasmids were isolated from the individual strains, amplified in E. coli, and re-tested to confirm their ability to complement the ts phenotype of prp22-H606A/shm1-1 cells. A total of 7 clones that re-tested were analyzed by restriction analysis and sequencing. The 2-μm plasmids contained either PRP22 or PRP8. A DNA fragment (∼8.3 kb) encompassing the PRP8 coding region plus 718 bp of upstream and ∼400 bp of downstream sequence was inserted into the yeast plasmids pSE360 (CEN URA3), pSE358 (CEN TRP1), and pRS413 (CEN HIS3) to yield p360-PRP8, p358-PRP8, and pRS-PRP8. The same PRP8 fragment was also inserted into p360-PRP22 (24Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to yield p360-PRP22/PRP8. In this plasmid, both wild type genes are expressed from their natural promoters in a tail-to-tail configuration. PRP8 Gene Disruption—The PRP8 gene was disrupted in the diploid yeast strain W303 by insertion of the kanMX marker (44Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), thereby removing amino acids 80–2295 of Prp8 (2413 aa). The PRP8/prp8:: kanMX diploid was transformed with p360-PRP8, sporulated, and dissected. The genotype of the prp8Δ strain used for testing prp8 mutant alleles by the plasmid shuffle procedure was MATa ura3 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 can1 prp8::kanMX p360-PRP8 (URA3 CEN). A strain in which the PRP8 and PRP22 genes are both disrupted was generated by mating, sporulation, and dissection. The prp22Δ prp8Δ strain YBS228 (MATa ura3 ade2 trp1 his3 leu2 can1 prp22::LEU2 prp8::kanMX) depends on the plasmid p360-PRP22/PRP8 (URA3 CEN) for viability. Transformation of YBS228 with either p358-PRP22 (TRP1 CEN) or pRS-PRP8 (HIS3 CEN) alone did not yield viable cells on 5-FOA medium; cotransformation with both genes was necessary for growth of the prp22Δ prp8Δ cells on 5-FOA. Targeted Mutagenesis of PRP8 —Mutations were introduced into the PRP8 gene using the two-step PCR overlap extension method. Residues targeted for Ala substitution were Tyr-1751, Arg-1753, Lys-1755, and Phe-1756. We also replaced Arg-1753 by Lys, Gln, and Glu and Lys-1755 by Glu. A BstEII fragment (2.1 kb) containing the mutation was exchanged for the wild type fragment in pRS-PRP8. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm the desired mutation and exclude the introduction of unwanted mutations during amplification and cloning. Conserved Residues in Motifs Ia, IV, and V Are Important for Prp22 Function in Vivo—Prp22(466–1145) encompasses an autonomous catalytic ATPase/helicase domain that includes the seven defining motifs of the DEAH box protein family (34Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The importance of motifs I, II, III, and VI for NTP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding has been demonstrated for the spliceosomal DEAH proteins and several viral DEXH box RNA helicases (5Kim D.H. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1999; 5: 959-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 23Gross C.H. Shuman S. J.

In order to assess the significance of these motifs for Prp22 function, we substituted 16 individual amino acids by alanines (Fig. 1) and tested the function of the mutants in vivo using the plasmid shuffle procedure. We found that the prp22 alleles T757A, I764A, and T765A (motif V) failed to complement the prp22Δ mutation at all temperatures tested between 15 and 37 °C (Fig. 2). Mutants R538A (motif Ia), F697A (motif IV), and N758A, E761A, and S763A (motif V) exhibited cold-sensitive growth defects of varying severity. F697A cells grew normally at 37 °C but fail"
https://openalex.org/W2134596819,"Activation of adenosine A1 or A3 receptors protects heart cells from ischemia-induced injury. The A3 receptor signals via RhoA and phospholipase D (PLD) to induce cardioprotection. The objective of the study was to investigate how RhoA activates PLD to achieve the anti-ischemic effect of adenosine A3 receptors. In an established cardiac myocyte model of preconditioning using the cultured chick embryo heart cells, overexpression of the RhoA-noninteracting PLD1 mutant I870R selectively blocked the A3 agonist (Cl-IBMECA, 10 nM)-induced cardioprotection. I870R caused a significantly higher percentage of cardiac cells killed in A3 agonist-treated than in A1 agonist (CCPA, 10 nM)-treated myocytes (ANOVA and posttest comparison, P<0.01). Consistent with its inhibitory effect on the PLD activity, I870R attenuated the Cl-IBMECA-mediated PLD activation. Cl-IBMECA caused a 41 +/- 15% increase in PLD activity in mock-transfected myocytes (P<0.01, paired t test) while having only a slight stimulatory effect on the PLD activity in I870R-transfected cells. To further test the anti-ischemic role of a direct RhoA-PLD1 interaction, atrial cardiac myocytes were rendered null for native adenosine receptors by treatment with irreversible A1 antagonist m-DITC-XAC and were selectively transfected with the human adenosine A1 or A3 receptor cDNA individually or they were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding either receptor plus I870R. I870R preferentially inhibited the human A3 receptor-mediated protection from ischemia. The RhoA-noninteracting PLD1 mutant caused a significantly higher percentage of cardiac cells killed in myocytes cotransfected with the human A3 receptor than in those cells expressing the human A1 receptor (ANOVA and posttest comparison, P<0.01). The present data provided the first demonstration of a novel physiological role for the direct RhoA-PLD1 interaction, that of potent protection from cardiac ischemia. The study further supported the concept that a divergent signaling mechanism mediates the anti-ischemic effect of adenosine A1 and A3 receptors."

NFAT activation, reflecting dephosphorylation by the calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, and subsequent nuclear localization, is generally thought to require a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. However, in smooth muscle we have found that elevation of calcium by membrane depolarization fails to induce an increase in nuclear localization of the NFATc3 isoform. Here, we demonstrate that physiological intravascular pressure (100 mm Hg) induces an increase in NFATc3 nuclear localization in mouse cerebral arteries. Pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation is abrogated by endothelial denudation and by nitric-oxide synthase, cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG), and voltage-dependent calcium channels inhibition. We further show that exogenous nitric oxide, in combination with an elevation in calcium, is an effective stimulus for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. c-Jun terminal kinase 2 (JNK) activity, which has been shown to regulate NFATc3 nuclear export, is also reduced by pressure, an effect that is prevented by pretreatment with a PKG inhibitor. Consistent with this, pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation is independent of PKG in arteries from JNK2-/- mice. Collectively, our results indicate that both activation of the NO/PKG pathway and elevation of smooth muscle calcium are required for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation and that PKG inhibits JNK2 to decrease NFAT nuclear export. Our findings suggest that at physiological intravascular pressures NFATc3 is localized to the nucleus in smooth muscle cells of intact arteries and indicate a novel and unexpected role for nitric oxide/PKG in NFAT activation.

Pressure-induced mechanical deformation of arterial smooth muscle cells initiates a signaling cascade that leads to constriction (myogenic tone) (1Meininger G.A. Davis M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H647-H659PubMed Google Scholar). This serves to maintain tissue perfusion despite increases in blood pressure. In small intact cerebral arteries one aspect of this cascade is a graded membrane potential depolarization, which opens voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels (VDCCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) channel; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; HK, high potassium; JNK, c-Jun terminal kinase; P-JNK, phosphorylated JNK; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKGi, PKG inhibitor; PSS, physiological saline solution; WT, wild type; l-NNA, Nω-nitro-l-arginine; Indo, indomethacin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and provides the increase in arterial smooth muscle intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) required for vasoconstriction (1Meininger G.A.

Intracellular Ca2+ in pressurized arteries not only regulates the contractile state of the smooth muscle cells but may also determine the activity of a variety of Ca2+-dependent transcription factors, including cyclic AMP response element binding protein and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells). Despite the importance of pressure in arterial function and the potential significance of Ca2+-regulated transcriptional activity in smooth muscle, little is known about the relationship between pressure and Ca2+-dependent transcription factor activation. The NFAT transcription factor family is comprised of four well characterized members, designated NFATc1 (NFAT2/c), NFATc2 (NFAT1/p), NFATc3 (NFAT4/x), and NFATc4 (NFAT3). First identified as a Ca2+-dependent transcription factor responsible for mediating coordinated changes in gene expression associated with T-cell activation (6Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B.

NFAT has been shown to play a role in adipogenesis (9Ho I.C. Kim J.H.J. Rooney J.W. Spiegelman B.M. Glimcher L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Less is known about the role of NFAT in vascular smooth muscle, but recent reports have shown that NFAT is critical for embryonic vasculogenesis (19Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and may play a role in regulating the phenotype of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (20Wada H. Hasegawa K. Morimoto T. Kakita T. Yanazume T. Abe M. Sasayama S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NFAT activation is regulated primarily through control of its subcellular localization. In general, a sustained or chronically oscillating increase in [Ca2+]i is thought to be necessary for sustained nuclear NFAT accumulation and NFAT-mediated transcription, although the recently reported effectiveness of transient elevations of Ca2+ in hippocampal neurons challenges the universality of this requirement (21Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Elevation of global Ca2+ produced by a variety of mechanisms activates the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, which dephosphorylates the NFAT molecule at specific N-terminal serine residues. This induces a conformational change that exposes nuclear localization signals (22Okamura H. Aramburu J. Garcia-Rodriguez C. Viola J.P. Raghavan A. Tahiliani M. Zhang X. Qin J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), allowing NFAT nuclear import. NFAT nuclear accumulation is subject to further regulation by serine/threonine kinases, which promote the export of nuclear NFAT. For example, nuclear c-Jun terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) has been shown to selectively promote the nuclear export of the NFATc3 isoform in both transfection studies (23Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and native isolated cerebral arteries (24Gomez M.F. Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Stevenson A.S. Wilkerson M.K.

Recently, we have shown that NFATc3 is expressed in cerebral artery smooth muscle and can be induced to accumulate in the nucleus by uridine triphosphate (UTP) and other Gq/11-coupled receptor agonists. This induction is mediated by calcineurin and is dependent on both sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release through inositol trisphosphate receptors and extracellular Ca2+ influx through VDCC (25Gomez M.F.

Unexpectedly, we found that opening of VDCC by membrane depolarization with 60 mm K+ (HK) fails to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in this tissue (25Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37756-37764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ through activation of VDCC by membrane potential depolarization induces significant NFATc3 accumulation in arteries from JNK2-/- mice (24Gomez M.F.

In the absence of JNK2, NFATc3 export is greatly slowed (24Gomez M.F. Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Stevenson A.S. Wilkerson M.K. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46847-46853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), consistent with the reported role for JNK2 in regulating nuclear export of this isoform (23Chow C.W.

Nitric oxide and cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) have been traditionally viewed as mediators of vasodilation through effects on large conductance, Ca2+-activated potassium (BK) channels (26Robertson B.E.

Recent evidence indicates that NO/PKG can promote or inhibit vascular remodeling (33Feil R. Lohmann S.M. de Jonge H. Walter U. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). PKG also has a significant role in the determination of the phenotype, contractile or synthetic, of vascular smooth muscle (34Boerth N.J. Dey N.B. Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies from PKGi knockout mice provide evidence that PKG has an essential role in neovascularization (35Yamahara K. Itoh H. Chun T.H. Ogawa Y. Yamashita J. Sawada N. Fukunaga Y. Sone M. Yurugi-Kobayashi T. Miyashita K. Tsujimoto H. Kook H. Feil R. Garbers D.L. Hofmann F. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3404-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As indicated, NFAT also has an important role in vasculogenesis (19Graef I.A. Chen F. Chen L. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 2001; 105: 863-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, the transcription factors affected by PKG have remained obscure. In the present study we sought to establish the potential activation status of NFATc3 in intact cerebral arteries under conditions of physiological intravascular pressure by examining NFATc3 subcellular distribution at 100 mm Hg. At this pressure smooth muscle membrane potential is depolarized, intracellular Ca2+ is elevated, and the arteries are partially constricted. Based on the lack of effect of K+-mediated depolarization on NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, we anticipated that NFATc3 would be primarily cytoplasmic in response to a pressure stimulus. Contrary to expectation, we found that NFATc3 accumulates in the nucleus when intraluminal pressure is elevated from 10 to 100 mm Hg. This pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation is dependent on Ca2+ influx through VDCC and is further dependent on endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) and PKG activity. Finally, we provide evidence that PKG acts to facilitate NFATc3 nuclear accumulation through inhibition of JNK2-mediated nuclear export. These results support the concept that the degree of NFATc3 activation reflects both physiological fluctuations of intracellular Ca2+ and endothelium-derived NO release and PKG activity. Animals—Adult male JNK2-/- and C57BL/6 wild-type mice (20-25 g) were used. JNK2-/- mice were kindly provided by Dr. Mercedes Rincon and have been previously described (36Yang D.D. Conze D. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). C57B6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. All experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publication 85-23, 1985) following a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of the University of Vermont. Isolated Arterial Preparation—Animals were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital solution (200 mg/kg intraperitoneally). After euthanasia the brain was removed and placed into oxygenated ice-cold physiological saline solution (PSS, for composition see “Chemicals and Buffers”). Posterior, cerebellar, and middle cerebral arteries were isolated and dissected from the surrounding connective tissue. Arteries were then cannulated and mounted in a specially designed, close-working distance arteriograph. All experiments with intact arteries were done under continuous superfusion with PSS at 37 °C. Only arteries that constricted in response to increased pressure were used. Endothelial denudation of cannulated vessels was accomplished by passage of 1 ml of air followed by 1 ml of PSS through the lumen. Arterial diameters were measured with a video dimension analyzer (Ionoptix). Arterial Wall [Ca2+]i—Cannulated arteries were loaded with the ratiometric Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2 AM, Molecular Probes) (2 μm). Arterial [Ca2+]i was calculated in Fura-2-loaded arteries as described previously (4Knot H.J. Nelson M.T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—At the end of each experiment cannulated arteries were fixed in the arteriograph with 4% formaldehyde in PSS (pH 7.4). After permeabilization and blocking of unspecific binding sites, primary antibody (rabbit anti-NFATc3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-P-JNK 1/2 (BIOSOURCE)) diluted 1:250 in 2% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline was applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody (Cy5-anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; 1:500 dilution) was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid dye SYTOX (Molecular Probes; 1:5000 dilution). Individual arteries were then mounted (Aqua Polymount mounting medium, Polysciences) onto glass slides and examined at 40× magnification using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. NFATc3 or P-JNK was detected by monitoring the Cy5 fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 650 nm and an emission wavelength of 670 nm. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in arteries incubated with primary or secondary antibodies alone. For scoring of NFATc3-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each vessel were imaged and counted by two independent observers under double-blind conditions using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The software was programmed so that individual pixels within a given image would appear white if co-localization of the green nucleic acid stain and the Cy5-NFATc3 stain occurred. Thus, for quantification purposes, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (white) was uniformly distributed in the nucleus, whereas a cell was considered negative if no co-localization (green only) was observed. For P-JNK quantification, Metamorph software was used to determine the intensity of the antibody staining. For each vessel image log integrated intensity was measured in 5 representative regions (40 × 40 pixels) and averaged. Chemicals and Buffers—All drugs and chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. PSS contained 118.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.18 vKH2PO4, 0.026 mm EDTA, 24 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4). This solution was continuously bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and heated to 37 °C. High external K+ (60 mm) solution was made by iso-osmotic substitution of NaCl with KCl in the PSS. Drugs were added to the superfusate. Statistics—Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was tested at the 95% (p < 0.05) confidence level using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test where applicable. Elevation of Intraluminal Pressure Induces NFATc3 Nuclear Accumulation; Dependence on Ca2+ Influx through VDCC—To address the role of pressure as a stimulus for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation we used immunofluorescence microscopy to determine NFATc3 localization in arterial smooth muscle after elevation of intraluminal pressure from 10 to 100 mm Hg. This intraluminal pressure (100 mm Hg) is ∼80% of the mean arterial blood pressure of these animals (111 ± 6 mm Hg, n = 6) and is close to the estimated physiological intraluminal pressure experienced by the cerebral vasculature (38Faraci F.M. Heistad D.D. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In cannulated cerebral artery segments from wild-type mice (WT) elevating intravascular pressure from 10 to 100 mm Hg increases smooth muscle [Ca2+]i from 133 ± 4 to 279 ± 53 nm, consistent with our previous results (3Brayden J.E. Nelson M.T. Science. 1992; 256: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 4Knot H.J. Nelson M.T. J.

Given the similar underlying mechanism of action, we anticipated that pressure, as with HK (25Gomez M.F. Stevenson A.S. Bonev A.D. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Nelson M.T. J. Biol.

Contrary to expectation, we found that an elevation in intravascular pressure from 10 to 100 mm Hg for 30 min induces NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1, A and B). Inhibition of VDCCs with a dihydropyridine, nisoldipine (1 μm), dilated pressurized cerebral arteries (Fig. 2B) and prevented NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that pressure induces NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, which is dependent on Ca2+ entry through VDCC.Fig. 2Pressure-induced NFATc3 accumulation is dependent on endothelial nitric oxide. A, summary of the effects of endothelium removal (denuded), nitric-oxide synthase (l-NNA), cyclooxygenase (indomethacin (Indo)), or PKG (10 μmol/L Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPs, PKGi) inhibition on nuclear NFATc3 accumulation in pressurized cerebral arteries. Arteries were incubated for 30 min at 100 mm Hg intraluminal pressure in either PSS (control, denuded) or PSS with the following drugs added: 200 μml-NNA, 10 μm Indo, or 10 μm PKGi. Drugs were added at least 10 min before increasing pressure. Denudation was achieved by passing an air bubble (∼1 ml) through the lumen at the beginning of the experiment.

To determine whether the endothelium plays a role in pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, NFATc3 nuclear accumulation was evaluated in endotheliumdenuded cerebral artery segments. Under these conditions increasing pressure to 100 mm Hg caused vasoconstriction but did not induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation (Figs. 2, A and B), indicating that endothelium-derived factors are indeed involved in regulating smooth muscle NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. To explore possible roles for endothelium-derived NO or prostanoids in NFAT activation, arteries were pretreated with the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, Nω-nitro-l-arginine (200 μml-NNA), and/or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 μm Indo) for 30 min. Combined treatment with Indo and l-NNA inhibited pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear translocation in endothelium intact arteries, as did treatment with l-NNA alone (Fig. 2A). Indo alone, however, had no effect. These results indicate that endothelial-derived NO is required for pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation, whereas prostanoids are not. NO affects smooth muscle relaxation and phenotype by stimulating soluble guanylyl cyclase to produce cGMP, which in turn activates PKG (40Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of NO on pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation that we observed occurs through PKG activation, we utilized the specific PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPs (15 min of pretreatment with 10 μm). PKG inhibition completely prevented NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in arteries subjected to 100 mm Hg (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that endothelium-derived NO, acting through PKG, plays a major role in NFATc3 nuclear translocation mechanism in response to a pressure stimulus. Cyclooxygenase, nitric-oxide synthase, or PKG inhibition or endothelial denudation potentiate pressure-induced vasoconstriction (Figs. 2, B and C). The fact that treatments that inhibit pressure-induced NFATc3 nuclear accumulation may promote vasorelaxation (i.e. nisoldipine) or vasoconstriction (i.e. l-NNA and Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPs) indicates that the contractile state of the artery per se is not a determinant of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation. NO Converts Depolarizing K+ into an Effective Stimulus for NFATc3 Nuclear Accumulation—Although membrane potential depolarization with HK elevates intracellular Ca2+ it is not a sufficient stimulus to induce significant NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in the smooth muscle cells of non-pressurized arteries. If elevated smooth muscle [Ca2+]i acts in concert with endothelial-derived NO to regulate NFATc3 nuclear localization, as suggested by the results above, the failure of HK to induce NFATc3 nuclear accumulation may reflect insufficient NO release. To test this possibility, the effect of membrane potential depolarization with HK in combination with an NO donor (1 μm NONOate for 30 min) was examined. HK plus NONOate promoted NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in the absence of a pressure stimulus (Fig. 3A), whereas HK alone or NONOate alone were not effective stimuli for NFATc3 activation. This effect is not related to changes in [Ca2+]i levels since NONOate addition partially dilates the arteries but does not modify HK-increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations (Figs. 3, B and C) (41Lehen'kyi V.V.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results further support the idea that both an elevation in [Ca2+]i and NO are required for NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in vascular smooth muscle. Nitric Oxide Decreases JNK2 Activity through PKG Activation—Although the Ca2+/calmodulin/calcineurin-dependent control mechanism for NFAT nuclear localization has been clearly established, a role for PKG in the regulation of NFATc3 nuclear accumulation has not been reported. Using JNK2-/- animals we have found that JNK2 plays an important role in promoting NFATc3 nuclear export in arterial smooth muscle (24Gomez M.F. Gonzalez Bosc L.V. Stevenson A.S. Wilkerson M.K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46847-46853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a result that supports previous reports of JNK2-mediated export of exogenously expressed NFATc3 in cultured cells (23Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that JNK2 may be a downstream target of PKG, the effect of pressure on nuclear NFATc3 accumulation was examined in JNK2-/- arteries in the presence or absence of PKG inhibitors. In arteries from JNK2-/- mice elevated intraluminal pressure induces a Ca2+-dependent (i.e. nisoldipine-sensitive) increase in nuclear NFATc3 that is comparable with that obtained in WT animals. However, in contrast to results obtained in WT mice, pressure-induced nuclear NFATc3 accumulation in JNK2-/- mice is not dependent on PKG, as shown by the lack of an effect of PKG inhibition (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that JNK2 likely"

A common feature of the clostridial cellulosomes is that they consist of a large number of catalytic components arranged around noncatalytic scaffolding proteins. The scaffolding proteins have been identified as CipA (or scaffoldin) in C. thermocellum (7Gerngross U.T. Romaniec M.P. Kobayashi T. Huskisson N.S. Demain A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), CipC in C. cellulolyticum (8Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CbpA in C. cellulovorans (9Shoseyov O. Takagi M. Goldstein M.A. Doi R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins fundamentally consist of repetitive noncatalytic domains of about 140 residues, termed cohesin domains, and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. e.g. C. josui CipA is composed of an N-terminal family 3 CBM followed by a hydrophilic domain and six cohesin domains (see Fig. 1A); and C. thermocellum CipA contains a CBM between the second and third of nine repeated cohesin domains and a type II dockerin domain at its C terminus (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequences of all the cohesin domains from these bacteria are strikingly similar to each other, especially within the same species (Fig. 1, B and C). Each cohesin domain is a subunit-binding domain that interacts with a docking domain, called dockerin, of each catalytic component. Pagès et al. (10Mechaly A. Yaron S. Lamed R. Fierobe H.P. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 2000; 39: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) found that C. thermocellum Cel48A (formerly CelS) did not interact with the first cohesin domain of C. cellulolyticum CipC and C. cellulolyticum Cel5A (formerly CelA) did not recognize the second cohesin domain of C. thermocellum CipA. This phenomenon was recognized as species specificity of cohesin-dockerin interactions. Dockerin domains consist of a pair of well conserved 22-residue repeats spaced by a linker of 8–18 residues (see Fig. 2A). In all cases, the 11th and 12th residues of both segments are conserved within the same type of dockerin domain but are different between different types, i.e. the 11th and l2th residues are a serine residue in the first position and either a serine or a threonine in the second for C. thermocellum dockerin domains, and an alanine and a hydrophobic residue (usually leucine or isoleucine) for C. cellulolyticum dockerin domains, suggesting that they are involved in determining the binding specificity (11Pages S. Belaich A. Belaich J.P. Morag E. Lamed R. Shoham Y. Bayer E.A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) between C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum. This was demonstrated by swapping these residues between the dockerin domains of C. thermocellum Cel48A and C. cellulolyticum Cel5A: each of the mutated dockerins acquired the ability to bind to its noncognate cohesin domain but did not lose the affinity for its cognate cohesin domain, suggesting that the conserved 11th and 12th residues do indeed play a role in biorecognition, whereas additional residues may also contribute to the specificity of the interaction (10Mechaly A.

Gilbert H.J. Ali B.R. Hazlewood G.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13García-Campayo V. Béguin P. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and C. thermocellum Cel48A bound nonselectively to four cohesin polypeptides from C. thermocellum CipA, which were separately produced by Escherichia coli recombinants. These observations suggested that the dockerin domains of C thermocellum Cel9A, Cel5C, and Cel48A could bind to any cohesin domains in the cognate CipA with a similar affinity. On the other hand, the second and third cohesin domains of C. thermocellum CipA interacted with all the catalytic subunits, except for the largest catalytic subunit now known as Cel9D-Cel44A (formerly CelJ) (14Ahsan M.M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5732-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of the cellulosome in an affinity blotting analysis (14Ahsan M.M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5732-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that generally there is no selectivity in the interactions among cohesin and dockerin domains within the same species, but that there may be at least one exception. Because Cel9D-Cel44A is known as a component of the cellulosome, the cohesin domains, except for the second and third ones, should associate with the dockerin domain of Cel9D-Cel44A, i.e. it is possible that the dockerin domains preferentially bind to particular cohesin domains of CipA. However, there have been no reports containing a quantitative analysis of the interaction between a dockerin domain and different cohesin domains within the same species other than C. cellulolyticum (8Pages S. Belaich A. Fierobe H.P. Tardif C. Gaudin C. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1801-1810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or describing an exception to the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interactions between different bacteria. C. josui is closely related to C. cellulolyticum taxonomically (4Kakiuchi M. Isui A. Suzuki K. Fujino T. Fujino E. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although their optimum growth temperatures are different, i.e. 45 °C for the former but 32–35 °C for the latter. The gene cluster of the former, including cipA and a number of genes responsible for catalytic components, is identical to that of the latter with respect to the gene order, and the corresponding genes are highly homologous with each other between the two bacteria. Furthermore, the dockerin domains of C. josui are specified by the two pairs, including an alanine in the first position and a hydrophobic residue (usually leucine or isoleucine) in the second (Fig. 2A) like the dockerin domains of C. cellulolyticum. Therefore, we predicted that the interactions among cohesins and dockerins between C. thermocellum and C. josui would be species-specific. In this study, however, we unexpectedly found that the dockerin domain of C. thermocellum Xyn11A exceptionally interacted with all the tested cohesin domains of C. josui CipA, whereas that of C. thermocellum Xyn10C did not, and furthermore those of C. josui Aga27A and Cel8A (formerly CelB) showed no affinity for any of the cohesin domains of C. thermocellum CipA. Here, we report the results of qualitative and quantitative analyses of the cohesin-dockerin interactions within C. thermocellum and C. josui, respectively, and describe an exception to the species specificity of the cohesin-dockerin interactions between these two bacteria, i.e. the binding of the dockerin domain of C. thermocellum Xyn11A to the cohesin domains of C. josui CipA.

International J. Systematic Bacteriology. 1988; 38: 179-182Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) P-9684 were used for the isolation of genomic DNA and cellulosomal proteins. E. coli strains DH5α, JM109, and BL21(DE3)RIL were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). E. coli M15(pREP4) was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Recombinant E. coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Plasmids and Plasmid Constructions—Plasmids pR1, pR2, and pR3 are derivatives of pRSETB (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and contain DNA fragments encoding the first, second, and third cohesin domains (referred to as Coh1-Ct, Coh2-Ct, and Coh3-Ct in this report), respectively, of C. thermocellum CipA (17Lytle B. Myers C. Kruus K. Wu J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCip7 is a derivative of pQE-31 (Qiagen) carrying a DNA fragment encoding the seventh cohesin domain of C. thermocellum CipA (18Beguin P. Raynaud O. Chaveroche M.K. Dridi A. Alzari P.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1192-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET-28a(+) was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The plasmid used to produce the fourth cohesin domain of C. thermocellum CipA was constructed as follows: pCip102 (13García-Campayo V. Béguin P. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was digested with Sau3AI, and the 984-bp fragment was recovered from an agarose gel using a GeneClean II kit (BIO101, Vista, CA) after agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA region encoding Coh4-Ct was amplified by PCR from the recovered 984-bp fragment with KOD dash DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and a combination of PCR primers, CtCoh4-F and CtCoh4-R (Fig. 1D). The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pT7Blue (Novagen) as specified by the supplier. After sequencing the inserted DNA fragment for confirmation of the absence of mutation, the inserted fragment was cleaved from the plasmid by digestion with NdeI and SalI, and transferred to pET-28a(+) (Novagen), yielding pET-R4. Construction of plasmids for the production of the first, second, fifth, and sixth cohesin domains (Coh1-Cj, Coh2-Cj, Coh5-Cj, and Coh6-Cj) of C. josui CipA (4Kakiuchi M. Isui A. Suzuki K. Fujino T. Fujino E. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4303-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out using similar procedures to those used for the construction of pET-R4. Different combinations of PCR primers containing an artificial NheI or SalI recognition sequence were used (Fig. 1D), i.e. CjCoh1-F and CjCoh1-R for Coh1-Cj, CjCoh2-F and CjCoh2-R for Coh2-Cj, CjCoh5-F and CjCoh5-R for Coh5-Cj, and CjCoh6-F and CjCoh6-R for Coh6-Cj. PCR was performed with pMK-2 as the template, and the resultant PCR fragments were cloned between the NheI and SalI sites of pET-28a(+), yielding pCoh1-Cj, Coh2-Cj, pCoh5-Cj, and pCoh6-Cj. The DNA regions encoding the dockerin domains of C. thermocellum Xyn11A (19Hayashi H. Takehara M. Hattori T. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Xyn10C (20Hayashi H. Takagi K.I. Fukumura M. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C. josui Aga27A (21Jindou S. Karita S. Fujino E. Fujino T. Hayashi H. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Cel8A (22Fujino T. Karita S. Ohmiya K. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1993; 76: 243-250Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were amplified from pKS101, pKS103, pCj-Aga27A, and pUCJ2E, respectively, with different combinations of PCR primers containing an artificial NheI or SalI recognition sequence, i.e. Ct-Xyn11ADocF and Ct-Xyn11ADocR for the dockerin domain of Xyn11A, Ct-Xyn10CDocF and Ct-Xyn10CDocR for that of Xyn10C, Cj-AgaADocF and Cj-AgaADocR for that of Aga27A, and Cj-Cel8ADocF and Cj-Cel8ADocR for that of Cel8A (Fig. 2B). The resultant PCR fragments were cloned between the NdeI and SalI sites of pET-28a(+), yielding pCt-Xyn11ADoc, pCt-Xyn10CDoc, pCj-Aga27ADoc, and pCj-Cel8ADoc, respectively. All plasmids were checked for PCR fidelity by DNA sequence analysis. Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant polypeptides produced by E. coli were referred to as rCoh1-Ct, rCoh2-Cj, rXyn11ADoc, and others in this study. E. coli BL21(DE3)RIL or M15(pREP4) harboring a recombinant plasmid was grown at 37 °Cto A600 = 0.6 in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), or ampicillin (50 μg/ml), and then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture to give a final concentration of 0.8 mm. After an additional incubation of 2 h, the cells were centrifuged (3,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4 pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). The recombinant proteins, containing a His6 tag at their N termini, were purified as follows. The cell-free extracts were mixed with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer, and the resin was subsequently washed with wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). The recombinant protein adsorbed onto the resin was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole), followed by dialysis against 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The protein concentration was routinely estimated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard using a Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Affinity Blotting Analysis—Affinity blotting analysis was performed to detect the C. thermocellum and C. josui cellulosomal proteins that specifically interacted with some dockerin polypeptides or cohesin polypeptides from C. thermocellum and C. josui. Cellulosomal proteins isolated from C. josui (16Sukhumavasi J. Ohmiya K. Shimizu S. Ueno K. International J. Systematic Bacteriology. 1988; 38: 179-182Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and C. thermocellum (15Sakka K. Karita S. Ohmiya K. Shimada K. Shimada K. Hoshino S. Ohmiya K. Sakka K. Kobayashi Y. Karita S. Genetics, Biochemistry and Ecology of Lignocellulose Degradation. Uni Publishers Co., Ltd., Tokyo1994: 32-38Google Scholar) were separated by SDS-PAGE in 13% gels, respectively, and transferred electrophoretically onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using an electroblotting apparatus, Compact Blot (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were blocked with PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5) containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA (Fraction V; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, followed by additional washing with PBS buffer containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with a His-tagged dockerin or cohesin polypeptide (each 10 μg) in PBS buffer containing 15 mm CaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% BSA, and the cellulosomal proteins that interacted with the His-tagged probe were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-six-His antibody (Anti-His6-Peroxidase; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride by Western blotting. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR with a BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to determine the kinetic and equilibrium constants of the cohesin-dockerin interactions at 25 °C. HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) was used as an immobilization buffer, and 10 mm CaCl2, 0.005% surfactant P20 (BIA-core), and 50 mm Tris-maleate buffer, pH 6.5, was used as a running buffer, as described previously for SPR analysis of C. cellulolyticum proteins (23Fierobe H.P. Pages S. Belaich A. Champ S. Lexa D. Belaich J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12822-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each of the cohesin polypeptides tested was immobilized on a dextran matrix with free carboxylic groups (CM5 chip, BIAcore) employing conventional carbodiimide coupling chemistry and subsequent deactivation of excess active esters using ethanolamine (EDC/NHS coupling kit, BIAcore). The purified cohesin polypeptides were injected for 10 s resulting in ∼400–500 resonance units of immobilized protein. Two flow cells were prepared for the kinetic experiments: in one cell, one of the cohesin polypeptides (rCoh1-Ct, rCoh2-Ct, rCoh3-Ct, rCoh4-Ct, rCoh7-Ct, rCoh1-Cj, rCoh2-Cj, rCoh5-Cj, or rCoh6-Cj) was immobilized and an adjacent cell was used as a reference with no treatment. The flow cells were routinely equilibrated with running buffer. The ligands (rAga27ADoc, rCel8ADoc, rXyn11ADoc, and rXyn10CDoc) were diluted in running buffer and allowed to interact with the sensor surface by a 240-s injection. In all cases, at least four different concentrations (2.1–13 nm) of ligands were injected at a flow rate of 30 μl per min. Kinetic evaluation was performed with BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore), fitting the four curves in each concentration series using the global fitting method. The obtained sensor grams were evaluated with the biomolecular interaction analysis evaluation software (BIAcore) to calculate the kinetic constants. The data were interpreted on the basis of the simple model, L + A ↔ LA, where L denotes the mobile ligand and A is the immobilized receptor. With the exception of Xyn11A, the surface of the sensor chip was efficiently regenerated by injection of 10 mm HCl between each protein injection. Other Procedures—The cellulosome fractions of C. thermocellum F1 and C. josui grown on BMC (ball-milled cellulose) were, respectively, prepared from the culture supernatants as described previously (4Kakiuchi M.

Preparation of the antiserum against C. thermocellum Xyn11A and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (19Hayashi H. Takehara M. Hattori T. Kimura T. Karita S. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Production and Purification of Various Cohesin and Dockerin Polypeptides—C. thermocellum CipA consists of nine cohesin domains, a family 3 CBM, and a type II dockerin domain (Fig. 1A). Among these cohesin domains, Coh3-Ct, Coh4-Ct, Coh5-Ct, Coh6-Ct, Coh7-Ct and Coh8-Ct are highly homologous with each other, and Coh4-Ct, Coh5-Ct, Coh6-Ct, and Coh8-Ct, in particular, show high sequence identity (higher than 99%) among them (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Coh1-Ct, Coh2-Ct, and Coh9-Ct are relatively less homologous with the other cohesin domains. Therefore, we chose Coh1-Ct, Coh2-Ct, Coh3-Ct, Coh4-Ct, Coh7-Ct, and Coh9-Ct to quantitatively measure the cohesin-dockerin interactions, but unfortunately the Coh9-Ct polypeptide could not be purified. On the other hand, C. josui CipA contains six cohesin domains in addition to a family 3 CBM and a hydrophilic domain (Fig. 1A). Among these cohesin domains, Coh2-Cj, Coh3-Cj, Coh4-Cj, and Coh5-Cj are highly homologous with each other, whereas Coh1-Cj and Coh6-Cj are less similar to the other cohesin domains (Fig. 1C). Therefore, rCoh1-Cj, rCoh2-Cj, rCoh5-Cj, and rCoh6-Cj were produced and used for quantitative analysis of the cohesin-dockerin interactions. The dockerin domains of C. thermocellum Xyn11A and Xyn10C, and C. josui Aga27A and Cel8A have typical amino acid residues in their 11th and 12th positions, i.e. “ST” in the first segment and “ST” in the second segment in Xyn11A, “SS” and “ST” in Xyn10C, “AL” and “AL” in Aga27A, and “AL” and “AI” in Cel8A (Fig. 2A). These dockerin domains were produced with three amino acid residues upstream of the first conserved residue of each dockerin domain. All the recombinant proteins used in this study contained a His tag at their N termini and were found in the soluble fraction of the recombinant E. coli lysate. We obtained homogeneous purified polypeptide preparations by a single step purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, by keeping the amount of resin lower than that necessary to bind all the His-tagged polypeptides. Qualitative Analysis of Interactions between Cohesin and Dockerin by Affinity Blotting—It was interesting to determine whether the five cohesin polypeptides from C. thermocellum CipA and the four cohesin polypeptides from C. josui CipA interacted nonselectively with cellulosomal proteins within the same species or whether a given cohesin polypeptide interacted specifically with a single or a small number of cellulosomal proteins. Furthermore, we were interested to learn whether the cohesin polypeptides from either C. thermocellum or C. josui interacted specifically with their cognate dockerin domains or whether they interacted with noncognate dockerin domains beyond the species specificity. To address these questions, an affinity blotting analysis was carried out using various cohesin and dockerin polypeptides as probes. Total cellulosomal proteins from C. thermocellum and C. josui were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The separated bands were then challenged with the cognate and noncognate cohesin polypeptides rCoh1-Cj, rCoh2-Cj, rCoh5-Cj, rCoh6-Cj, rCoh1-Ct, rCoh4-Ct, and rCoh7-Ct. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 1), all the cohesin polypeptides from C. thermocellum appeared to interact with almost all of the C. thermocellum cellulosomal proteins. It is noteworthy that these cohesin polypeptides did not detect the largest catalytic component Cel9D-Cel44A. Affinity blotting analysis using a recombinant dockerin polypeptide derived from Cel9D-Cel44A failed to detect the interaction between the dockerin polypeptide and C. thermocellum CipA (data not shown). In all cases, the labeling pattern was almost identical. Similar phenomena were observed in the interactions between the cohesin polypeptides and cellulosomal proteins from C. josui (Fig. 3B). These observations suggested a lack of selectivity in the interactions between cohesin and dockerin domains within the same species. When the cohesin-dockerin interactions between C. thermocellum and C. josui were examined, none of the cohesin polypeptides from C. josui CipA interacted with any of the C. thermocellum cellulosomal proteins (Fig. 3A), supporting the previous conclusion that there is species specificity in the cohesin-dockerin interactions between the two different species. Unexpectedly, in contrast, the cohesin polypeptides from C. josui CipA interacted with two proteins in the C. thermocellum cellulosome, i.e. 75- and 50-kDa proteins (Fig. 3B). We predicted that these two proteins were xylanases Xyn11A and Xyn11B, because the molecular sizes of Xyn11A and Xyn11B were consistent with those of the two proteins that interacted with the cohesin polypeptides, and Xyn11A and Xyn11B have quite similar dockerin domains (Fig. 2A), which were expected to have similar characteristics in the cohesin-dockerin interaction. To prove this prediction, an affinity blotting analysis was performed with rXyn11ADoc as the probe. As shown in Fig. 4, rXyn11ADoc bound to the scaffolding protein CipA of C. josui in addition to C. thermocellum CipA, although rXyn10CDoc, rAga27ADoc, and rCel8ADoc interacted with their cognate scaffolding proteins but not with noncognate scaffolding proteins. Furthermore, the antiserum raised against Xyn11A (21Jindou S. Karita S. Fujino E. Fujino T. Hayashi H. Kimura T. Sakka K. Ohmiya K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) interacted with two proteins, Xyn11A and Xyn11B, whose sizes were in good agreement with those of the two proteins that interacted with the cohesin polypeptides from C. josui CipA (Fig. 5). The results obtained by these qualitative analyses clearly indicated that species specificity in the cohesin-dockerin interactions was generally conserved between C. thermocellum and"

There is a great deal of interest in the up- or down-regulation of OGG1 expression after DNA damage. In this study, we investigated the effect of a DNA-alkylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), on hOGG1 expression level and found that MMS treatment resulted in an increase in the functional hOGG1 expression in HCT116 cells. A region between –121 and –61 of the hOGG1 promoter was found to be crucial for this induction by MMS. Site-directed mutations of the two inverted CCAAT motifs substantially abrogated the induction of the hOGG1 promoter as a result of MMS treatment. In addition, the NF-YA protein (binding to the inverted CCAAT box) was induced after exposing cells to MMS. Moreover, gel shift and supershift analyses with the nuclear extracts prepared from HCT116 cells identified NF-YA as the transcription factor interacting with the inverted CCAAT box. Mutations of the inverted CCAAT box either prevented the binding of this factor or abolished its activation as a result of MMS treatment. Finally, this study showed that hOGG1-expressing HCT116 cells exhibited increased hOGG1 repair activity and resistance to MMS. Overall, these results demonstrate that MMS can up-regulate hOGG1 expression through the induction of the transcription factor, NF-YA, and increased transcription level of the hOGG1 gene correlates with an increase in enzyme activity providing functional protection from MMS.

Berger M. Douki T. Ravanat J.L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 131: 1-87PubMed Google Scholar). Relatively large quantities of 8-oxoG are produced in mammalian cells, either as a byproduct of the normal oxidative metabolism, or as a result of exogenous sources of ROS, such as ionizing radiation, single oxygen sensitizer dyes, and redox-active organic molecules (8Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7024-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). 8-oxoG preferentially mispairs with adenosine during replication and thereby gives rise to G:C → T:A transversion mutations (9Shibutani S.

Because of its persistent generation, relative abundance, and potent mutagenicity, 8-oxoG is believed to represent a major source of spontaneous mutagenesis in all aerobic cells. In order to prevent the mutagenic effect of 8-oxoG, the bacterium, Escherichia coli, contains a GO system (13Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J.

The bacteria GO system consists of three proteins: MutM (also known as the Fpg protein), a DNA glycosylase/lyase that recognizes 8-oxoG:C and catalyzes the excision of 8-oxoG (16Boiteux S.

Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the main defense enzyme against the mutagenic effects of 8-oxoG in cellular DNA is 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), which is structurally unrelated but functionally similar to formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg) in E. coli (20van der Kemp P.A.

In human tissues, the level of OGG1 expression is much higher in the thymus, testis, kidney, intestine, brain, cerebrum, and the germinal center of B cells than in other tissues (25Radicella J.P.

Hudson E.K. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that OGG1 expression may be modulated by a variety of stimuli. There is mixed evidence for the role of oxidative stress in influencing OGG1 expression. For example, three reports have suggested that the induction of hOGG1 expression is associated with oxidative stress (44Tsurudome Y. Hirano T. Yamato H. Tanaka I. Sagai M. Hirano H. Nagata N. Itoh H. Kasai H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 45Kim H.N. Morimoto Y. Tsuda T. Ootsuyama Y. Hirohashi M. Hirano T. Tanaka I. Lim Y. Yun I.G. Kasai H.

Nakabeppu Y. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 211-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, other studies have failed to observe the induction of OGG1 by ROS (47Dhenaut A. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 48Hodges N.J. Chipman J.K. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether or not a ROS producing agent, H2O2, and a DNA-alkylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), can modulate the mRNA and protein expression of hOGG1 in HCT116 cells. The results showed that MMS could effectively induce functional hOGG1 expression but not H2O2. A series of experiments were performed to identify the regulatory elements of the hOGG1 promoter. Two inverted CCAAT motifs were identified as MMS regulatory elements necessary for MMS activation of the hOGG1 promoter. A disruption of the inverted CCAAT motif abolished activation of the hOGG1 promoter by MMS. In support of these findings, it was also demonstrated that the nuclear factor-YA (NF-YA) protein was induced as a result of MMS treatment. In addition, the binding affinity of NF-YA to its consensus sequences was also enhanced after MMS treatment. Finally, it was shown that an increase in the functional hOGG1 expression level could protect cells against MMS. This is the first report showing the characterization of an important molecular mechanism by which MMS regulates hOGG1 as well as its biological significance. Cell and Reagents—The human colorectal carcinoma HCT 116 cells were a generous gift from Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore), and cultured in McCoy’s 5A-modified medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). MMS and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. MMS was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma) in a stock solution. Plasmid Constructs—The human OGG1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using the hOGG1 oligo primer (5′-ATGCCTGCCCGCGCGCTTCTGCC-3′, 5′-CTAGCCTTCCGGCCCTTTGGAAC-3′) from human fibroblast GM00637 cells. After confirming the DNA sequence, the hOGG1 cDNA was cloned into a pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector driven by the CMV promoter (Invitrogen). In order to clone the hOGG1 promoter, genomic DNA from the human fibroblast GM00637 cell line was prepared according to standard protocols and a hOGG1 promoter region search at the NCBI site using GenBank™ accession number AF521807. The hOGG1 promoter fragment –1980/+93 bp, p(–1980)-hogg1luc was amplified from the genomic DNA of the human fibroblast GM00637 cell line by PCR using a sense primer (5′-ATA AAC TGT CAA TTT AGA ATT CTT TGT TCT-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TTT CCT GAG GTG TAG GTC CC-3′). This fragment was then cloned into SacI and XhoI sites of a promoterless luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and was used to generate nested deletions. PCR was performed to prepare deletion mutants. Constructed plasmids and sense primers are as follows: p(–1060)hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-TGA CCA ACA TGG TGA AAC CC-3′; p(–700)hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-TCC AGG CGA CTA GAA GCC AG-3′; p(–590)hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-ATG AGC AGA TGG AGT ATG GA-3′; p(-390)hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-AGC TGT GTT CGC TCC GGT TC-3′; p(–240)hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-GGA ACC GCG GGG CGC CCA GAT-3′; p(–20)-hogg1luc: sense primer 5′-TGC TGT GGT CTG CCC CTG GAG-3′. The serial mutagenesis of the region from –240 to –20 was generated using an Erase-a-BaseR system (Promega). Briefly, an Erase-a-BaseR system was designed for the rapid construction of the 5′-flanking region subclones containing the progressive unidirectional deletions of any inserted DNA. The Erase-a-BaseR method was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. To insert point mutations in one inverted Sp1, proximal-inverted CCAAT, or a distal-inverted CCAAT motif, various mutant constructs were generated by PCR using the p(–240)hogg1luc promoter. The constructs and primers used are as follows: mSp1 (5′-CGCCTCAGAACGGCCCtaCCACCTGATTTCAT GGGCC-3′); mP-CCAAT (5′-ACCCTGATTTCTCtTTGGCGCTCCTACTCCTCTCGG-3′); mD-CCAAT (5′-ACCTCCTCCTCGGtTTGGCTACCTCTAGGTGAAATGAGCGG-3′). The lowercase, underlined characters indicate the nucleotide substitutions in insert mutations. The nucleotide sequence of each construct was confirmed by cycle sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Science). Promoter Luciferase Activity Assays—The reporter plasmids were transiently transfected into cells using the LipofectAMINE method according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfection efficiency was determined with the Renilla luciferase gene-containing pRL-CMV plasmid (Promega). HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid and then treated with 200 μm MMS. 24 h after treatment, transfected cells were washed twice with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in a lysis buffer (5× PLBR, Promega) with gentle shaking at room temperature for 20 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min to pellet the cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube, and the dual luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Briefly, each assay mixture contained 2 μl of the cell lysates and 10 μl of a firefly luciferase-measuring buffer (LAR ll R, Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (the luminometer was programmed to perform a 2-s premeasurement delay, followed by a 10-s measurement period for each reporter assay). After measuring the firefly luciferase activity (Stop & GloR, Promega), a Renilla luciferase-measuring buffer was added, and the Renilla luciferase activity was then measured. Each transfection was performed in duplicate, and all were repeated at least three times. Western Blotting—Cells in the medium were exposed to 200 μm MMS or 100 μm H2O2 for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, and lysed at 0 °C for 30 min in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, PH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μ/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 5 mm NaF). The protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding microassay, and 20 μg of protein per lane were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels after boiling for 5 min in a Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were blotted onto the Hybon ECL membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The markers (MBI) were used as size standards. After electroblotting, the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk, and were incubated with the anti-hOGG1, APE, NF-YA, NF-YB, NF-YC, and α-tubulin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking buffer for 4 h. The primary antibody dilutions were those recommended by the manufacturer. The membranes were the washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:4,000) in a blocking buffer for 2 h, and repeatedly washed. The blotted proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (iNtRON, Biotech, Seoul, Korea). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction—RNA extraction from the human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cell line was conducted using the RNA-STAT-60 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Briefly, cells in the medium were exposed to 200 μm MMS or 100 μm H2O2 and collected at the indicated time points. After homogenizing cells in the RNA STAT-60, the homogenate was mixed with chloroform (5:1; v/v), shaken vigorously for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The RNA presented in the upper colorless aqueous phase was precipitated by adding isopropyl alchohol, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and air-dried for 10 min. The RNA was then resuspended in DEPC. 10-μl RNA aliquots were prepared and stored at –70 °C until needed. 2 μg of the total RNA were reverse-transcribed using a M-MLV cDNA synthesis system (Promega), and the reverse-transcribed DNA was subjected to PCR. The profile of the replication cycles was denaturation at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 58 °C for 50 s, and polymerization at 72 °C, for 1 min. In each reaction, the same amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control. The primers used for PCR are as follows: hOGG1 forward, 5′-CTG CCT TCT GGA CAA TCT TT-3′; hOGG1 reverse, 5′-TAG CCC GCC CTG TTC TTC-3′ designed to amplify a 551-bp region; hAPE forward, 5′-GGA AGA AGC CC CAG ATA TAC-3′; hAPE reverse, 5′-GTG TCA CAG TGC TAG GTA TA-3′ designed to amplify a 705-bp region; GAPDH forward, 5′-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3′; and GAPDH reverse 5′-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3′ designed to amplify a 194-bp region (total number of cycles: 26). The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then photographed. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The nuclear protein was extracted from HCT116 cell line cultures as described previously (49Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffiner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were treated with 0, 100, or 200 μm MMS for 12 h, cells were then washed with PBS and pelleted at 4 °C for 5 min at 2,500 rpm. The upper supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of an ice-cold cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin). The suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing by inversion. Subsequently, 24 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was then added, cells were mixed by inversion, and nuclei were immediately pelleted at 4 °C for 5 min at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet containing the nuclei was resuspended by adding 50 μl of an ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (30 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 450 mm KCl) dropwise. The mixture was then incubated on ice for 30 min, and the nuclear debris were pelleted at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The nuclear extracts were stored at –70 °C until needed. EMSA binding reactions were incubated in a 20-μl final volume for 20 min at room temperature containing 5 μg of the nuclear extract, 20 fmol of the end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and 1 μg of the poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC). The binding buffer contained 30 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin. The supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μl of polyclonal antibodies against NF-YA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to adding the radiolabeled probe. Competition was performed in the presence of a 10- or 20-fold excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide cassette and incubating for 20 min at room temperature prior to adding the labeled probe. The complexes were resolved using a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA and electrophoresis at 200 volt for 1 h. The gels were dried and exposed overnight at –70 °C to x-ray film. Endonuclease Nicking Assay—Cells at the exponential phase were treated with 0–200 μm MMS for 24 h, and cell pellets (106 cells per each assay) were then suspended in 2 volumes of homogenation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 0.05% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5) and homogenized. The homogenates were mixed with streptomycin (final concentration 1.5%) to remove nucleic acids. Supernatants obtained by centrifugation were dialyzed extensively against the homogenation buffer and used as cell extracts for endonuclease nicking assay. 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG)-containing 21-mer with the sequence 5′-CAGCCAATCAGTXCACCATTC-3′ (X = 8-oxoG), and its complementary strand were chemically synthesized (The Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX). Oligonucleotides were 3′-end-labeled using terminal transferase and [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol). The end-labeled oligomer was annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide, and the resulting duplex DNA was used as the assay substrate. The duplex substrate DNA (20 pmol) was incubated with the cell extracts (10 μg of protein) at 37 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The reaction was terminated by heating at 90 °C for 3 min. Reaction products were electrophoresed on 20% denaturing (7 m urea) polyacrylamide gels (DNA sequencing gel). After electrophoresis, the gels were wrapped in Saran Wrap and the amounts of the cleaved substrate were determined by autoradiography and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Incision activity was calculated as the amount of radioactivity in the band corresponding to the damage-specific cleavage product over the total radioactivity in the lane in the reaction. Clonogenic Cell Survival Assay—Clonogenic survival assay was measured as described previously (50Cho H.J. Jeong H.G. Lee J.S. Woo E.R. Hyun J.W. Chung M.H. You H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Briefly, cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cells per 25 cm culture flask and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were then treated with different doses of MMS for 12 h, washed twice with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in fresh medium. They were counted with a Coulter counter, and the number of cells required for plating was obtained by successive dilutions in fresh complete medium. Cells were then allowed to grow at 37 °Cina5%CO2 atmosphere for 14 days. Fresh medium was added on the fifth day. Two weeks after drug treatment, cultures were fixed by methanol and stained with Giemsa. The number of colonies exceeding 50 cells was counted with a binocular lens. The surviving fraction was determined as the ratio of the number of colonies observed after treatment to the number of cells seeded, adjusted to the plating efficiency. Measurement of N7-Methylguanine—N7-methylguanine (N7-meG) was measured as described by van Delft et al. (51van Delft J.H. van Winden M.J. van den Ende A.M. Baan R.A. Environ. Health Perspect. 1993; 99: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with different doses of MMS for 6 h, and DNA was extracted from cells by multiple treatments with phenol-chloroform, RNase, and proteinase K. The DNA was heated for 1 h at 100 °C and cooled at 0 °C followed by addition of 1 m HCl, after 10 min on ice, the DNA precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatant was removed, neutralized with 1 m K2HPO4, and analyzed by HPLC (elution buffer; 25 mm H3PO4-KOH, pH 6.0, 5% methanol; flow rate, 0.5 ml/min) with electrochemical detection (coulometric array detector, ESA). MMS Treatment Induced Human OGG1 mRNA and Protein Expression—In order to determine if H2O2 and MMS could induce human OGG1 expression in cultured cells, HCT116 cells were treated with either 200 μm MMS or 100 μm H2O2, and hOGG1 mRNA levels were determined in attached cells after 0, 6, 12, 24 h of MMS or H2O2 treatment. The PCR exponential phase was obtained and the optimal number of PCR cycles, which was 26 cycles (Fig. 1A), was determined. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that hOGG1 mRNA accumulation was increased by more than 2.5-fold as early as 24 h after incubating cells with 200 μm MMS (Fig. 1B). However, no effect on the hOGG1 mRNA expression level was observed after treating cells with 100 μm H2O2 at any incubation time. Western blotting was performed to determine if this increase in the hOGG1 mRNA level corresponds to an increase in the hOGG1 protein level (Fig. 2). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate the whole cell extracts of the protein from untreated and MMS-treated cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, Western blotting with a specific antibody against hOGG1 showed that a small quantity of the hOGG1 protein was present in the untreated HCT116 cells. However, treating cells with MMS caused an increase in hOGG1 protein accumulation within 48 h of post-treatment with MMS. Dose-response experiments showed that the effect of MMS reached a maximum at 200 μm MMS with approximately a 4-fold increase in the hOGG1 protein level (Fig. 2B). The specificity of MMS-induced hOGG1 expression was demonstrated by the lack of an effect on the expression of the human apurinic endonuclease (hAPE) or the housekeeping gene α-tubulin at any of the incubation times or MMS"
https://openalex.org/W2118531357,"Little is known about an in vivo significance of angiotensin II Type-1 receptor (AT1) for pregnancy-associated diseases, including hypertension and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). We previously demonstrated that female mice carrying the human angiotensinogen gene (hAG+/+), when mated with human renin transgenic (hRN+/+) male mice, displayed hypertension in late pregnancy due to secretion of human renin from the fetal side into the maternal circulation. In the present study, to investigate a role for AT1 in pregnancy-associated hypertension, we generated a new strain of hAG+/+/mAT1a-/- mice by genetically deleting the AT1a gene from hAG+/+ mice. When mated with hRN+/+ male mice, excessive increases in human renin, angiotensin, and plasma renin activity were detected in the plasma of pregnant hAG+/+/mAT1a-/- mice as found in that of pregnant hAG+/+ mice. Surprisingly, however, blood pressure of hAG+/+/mAT1a-/- mice was not elevated in late pregnancy despite the presence of AT1b, a subtype of AT1. The maternal and fetal defects, such as cardiac and placental abnormalities, and IUGR observed in pregnant hypertensive hAG+/+ mice were not recognized in pregnant hAG+/+/mAT1a-/- mice. The limited term administration of AT1 antagonists to hypertensive hAG+/+ mice in late pregnancy dramatically improved hypertension and IUGR, showing the clinical importance of AT1a."
https://openalex.org/W2041297501,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are extremely efficient at remyelination. These cells persist in the adult human central nervous system and can proliferate. However, the failure to remyelinate is a pathological characteristic of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), which suggests that these cells are ineffective in this disorder. This paper reports that IgG antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients specifically recognize an antigen on OPCs in culture. Control patients were found not to possess these antibodies. The antigen was immunoprecipitated in cell extracts from cultures with purified IgG from MS CSF. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified it as the beta type of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblot showed that this antigen in fact corresponds to two specific isoforms of Hsp90beta. Several control assays using monoclonal and polyclonal anti-Hsp90 antibodies confirmed the specific expression of Hsp90 on OPCs. Labeling OPCs in vivo with MS CSF and anti-Hsp90 antibodies and subsequent immunofluorescence confocal microscopy located the antigen on the cell surface. The binding of CSF antibodies from MS patients to the OPC surface led to complement activation and significant extinction of the OPC population. These results suggest that OPCs may be a target of anti-Hsp90 antibodies in MS patients and that this could prevent remyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1964915719,"Receptor agonists that initiate fluid secretion in salivary gland epithelial cells also increase protein phosphorylation. To assess contributions of tyrosine phosphorylation to secretion, changes in muscarinic receptor-initiated secretion (estimated from sodium pump-dependent increases in oxygen consumption) were measured in parotid acinar cells exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, like the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone, tyrphostins AG10 and AG18 increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced cellular ATP by ∼90% in the absence of the muscarinic agonist carbachol, indicating that these tyrphostins uncouple mitochondria. Exposure of isolated mitochondria to five structurally related tyrphostins demonstrated that their relative potencies as uncouplers differed from their in vitro kinase-inhibitory potencies due to different molecular requirements for the two effects. AG10 and AG18 blocked parotid phosphorylation events only at concentrations that reduced ATP content. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein reduced ATP content by 15–20% and weakly uncoupled isolated mitochondria, but its inhibition of carbachol-mediated protein kinase Cδ tyrosine phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation appeared attributable to blocking tyrosine kinases directly. Carbachol itself rapidly reduced ATP content by 15–20%. Carbachol, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate (P2X7 receptor agonist), AG10, AG18, and carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone rapidly activated the fuel sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK); however, only AMPK activation by carbachol and BzATP was due to sodium pump stimulation. AG10 and AG18 also activated AMPK and/or uncoupled mitochondria in PC12, HeLa, and HEK293 cells. These studies demonstrate that some tyrosine kinase inhibitors produce cellular effects that are mechanistically different from their primary in vitro characterizations and, as do salivary secretory stimuli, promote rapid metabolic alterations that initiate secondary signaling events.

Signaling by G protein-coupled receptors engages a variety of downstream effectors and signaling cascades that rely on alterations in the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine and other residues. In salivary gland epithelial cells, secretagogues (i.e. receptor ligands that promote secretion), including the muscarinic receptor ligand carbachol, increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (1Purushotham K.R. Humphreys-Beher M.G. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1995; 6: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J.

Therefore, a likely hypothesis is that secretagogue-dependent changes in tyrosine phosphorylation contribute to fluid secretion in the parotid gland, one of the three main salivary glands. To examine this possibility, experiments were designed to block tyrosine phosphorylation using chemical inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, including AG18, a member of the tyrphostin (tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor) family, and genistein. To evaluate the action of kinase inhibition on fluid secretion, the effects of these inhibitors were measured on carbachol-stimulated increases in the rate of O2 consumption (QO2) 1The abbreviations used are: QO2, rate of oxygen consumption; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimide; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone. of parotid acinar cells. Carbachol and other ligands such as substance P and α-adrenergic agonists, which activate receptors that initiate fluid secretion, promote increases in the QO2 of parotid acinar cells and other salivary gland epithelial cells (5Murakami M.

Receptor-initiated increases in fluid movement across epithelia are accompanied by quantitative increases in the rate of cell respiration due to the tight coupling between mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and the sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) activity (5Murakami M. Miyamoto S. Imai Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 426: 127-143Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 7Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen.

Nephrol. 1987; 7: 20-28PubMed Google Scholar), which is activated when net secretion and net reabsorption are stimulated. In parotid acinar cells, the initiation of fluid secretion is promoted by the elevation of [Ca2+]i, the opening of potassium and chloride channels, and the entry of sodium into the cells via multiple transport systems (13Turner R.J. Dobrosielski-Vergona K. The Biology of the Salivary Glands. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 105-127Google Scholar, 14Turner R.J. Sugiya H. Oral Dis. 2002; 8: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The sodium pump is activated by the rapid increase in the intracellular sodium/potassium ratio due to secretagogue-promoted potassium loss and sodium entry. Changes in the activity of the ATP-consuming sodium pump alter the cytosolic ATP/ADP ratio in secretory and absorptive epithelial cells, and the rates of oxidative phosphorylation increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in net ion movement. In previous studies, we and others determined that agents that reduced or blocked fluid secretion in parotid acinar cells also reduced or blocked the muscarinic receptor-stimulated increases in QO2 (5Murakami M. Miyamoto S. Imai Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 426: 127-143Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Smaje L.H. Poulsen J.H. Ussing H.H.

Therefore, it seemed that the contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation to fluid secretion could be examined in parotid acinar cells by determining whether tyrosine kinase inhibitors altered increases in carbachol-stimulated rates of respiration. Accordingly, the initial experimental focus was to determine whether AG18 and genistein affected the stimulation of respiration by carbachol; however, preliminary findings led to a revision of this approach and to an evaluation of the inhibitors themselves. Genistein and some tyrphostins, including AG18, have been used as broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Tyrphostins have been used to implicate tyrosine kinases in various cell signaling and biological events, such as sodium pump (15Niisato N. Marunaka Y. J. Physiol. 1999; 518: 417-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and chloride channel (16Niisato N. Marunaka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) activation in epithelial cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (17Duan R.-D. Wagner A.C.C. Yule D.I. Williams J.A.

J. 1995; 305: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In initial experiments with parotid acinar cells, the QO2 was not increased by carbachol in cells exposed to AG18. This was surprising, since it was not expected that tyrosine kinases would play such a dominant role in mediating secretory effects downstream of receptor stimulation. However, subsequent experiments indicated that the ineffectiveness of carbachol was due to the fact that AG18 uncoupled the mitochondria and stimulated a nearly maximal increase in the QO2 independent of receptor activation. A large number of tyrphostins have been synthesized based on a common structural core of benzylidinemalononitrile, and structurally related tyrphostins based on this core had differing potencies and degrees of effectiveness as kinase inhibitors (20Levitsky A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 21Gazit A. Yaish P Gilon C. Levitky A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the relevant structural moieties of AG18 that produced its uncoupling effects and to determine whether the structural moieties relevant to its uncoupling activity were related to its reported effectiveness as a kinase inhibitor, the effectiveness of AG18 as a mitochondrial uncoupler was compared with a number of tyrphostins of related structure. The effects of tyrphostins and other agents were examined on several phosphorylation events evoked by muscarinic receptor activation in parotid cells: the Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2. The effects of carbachol and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors also were examined on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in parotid acinar cells and other cells. AMPK is a fuel-sensing enzyme that is an α, β, γ heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase, and it may be activated as a protective mechanism when the cellular ATP/AMP ratio is decreased (22Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 23Zong H. Ren J.M. Young L.H. Pypaert M. Mu J. Birnbaum M.J. Shulman G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15983-15987Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). AMPK blocks pathways that consume ATP, such as cholesterol and glycogen synthesis, and promotes mechanisms that can increase cellular ATP content, such as glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation (24Kemp B.E. MIthcelhill K.I. Stapleton D. Michell B.J. Chen Z.-P. Witters L.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 22-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Since the parotid ATP content was altered by kinase inhibitors as well as by receptor stimuli, their effects on AMPK were compared. The results of these studies highlight differences between the effects of kinase inhibitors in vitro and on a variety of cell types and demonstrate that these inhibitors can produce multiple actions and consequences that affect the interpretation of their biological actions. These studies also evaluate metabolic changes produced by secretory stimuli acting on freshly dissociated salivary gland epithelial cells and enhance our understanding of cellular responses to ligands that initiate fluid secretion. Chemicals—All chemicals were reagent grade or better. Carbamyl choline (carbachol), carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP), essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and fraction V bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-ERK2 antibody (SC-154) and polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (SC-213) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal PKCδ was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-AMP kinase (Thr(P)171), and AMP kinase antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Thomas Roberts (Dana Farber Cancer Institute). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175–225 g) obtained from Charles River Laboratories or Taconic were used for all experiments. Nystatin (mycostatin), AG9 (also designated tyrphostin A1; 4-methoxybenylidene malononitrile), AG10 (tyrphostin A8; 4-hydroxybenzylidinemalononitrile), AG18 (tyrphostin A23; α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)cinnamonitrile), AG30 (tyrphostin A36; α-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)cinnamic acid), AG43 (tyrphostin A63; α-cyano-(4-hydroxy)dihydrocinnamonitrile), and genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) were purchased from Calbiochem. Ouabain was obtained from Aldrich. Protein A-Sepharose beads were bought from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Preparations and Solutions—Freshly dispersed rat parotid acinar cells were prepared as described previously (25Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Talamo B.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C934-C940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended at 1–1.5 mg/ml in a medium (solution A) composed of the following: 116.4 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Na-HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium butyrate, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. In experiments using BzATP, solution A contained 1 mm CaCl2 and no added MgCl2. Cells were maintained on ice prior to use. Samples of the cell suspension were stirred and equilibrated at 37 °C for at least 15 min prior to use. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for 20 min prior to use, as noted. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. All three cell lines were grown to ∼80% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Isolation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Mitochondria from male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared in isolation medium (IM; 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) as described previously (26Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen Consumption—For measurements using parotid cells, conditions were similar to those reported previously (26Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, parotid acinar cells suspended in solution A were prewarmed for 15 min at 37 °C prior to placing them in a stirred chamber maintained at 37 °C. A Clark-type O2 electrode (model 125/05; Instech Laboratories) was used to record the disappearance of O2 from a closed 400-μl chamber. The output from the O2 electrode amplifier (Instech) was recorded using a Kipp & Zonen (model BD112) flatbed chart recorder. At the end of each measurement, an aliquot of the cell suspension was collected for protein analysis (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.L. Farr A.L. Randell R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that the rate of O2 consumption (QO2) could be normalized to the protein content of the cells (∼1 mg/ml). The QO2 value was calculated from the linear QO2 that was achieved upon the addition of an agent to the chamber. The ΔQO2 values for parotid and other cells are the differences between the O2 consumption rates under initial conditions and the new rates achieved upon the addition of various agents. For measurements using cultured cell lines, cells were exposed briefly to trypsin/EDTA solution (BioWhitaker), transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, subjected to centrifugation, resuspended in solution A containing 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) for 1–2 min, spun down again, and resuspended in fresh solution A. QO2 measurements were carried out at 37 °C in a similar manner to the experiments using parotid cells. For QO2 measurements using isolated mitochondria, aliquots of mitochondria suspended in IM were diluted ∼1:9 with solution B (120 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). Pyruvate (10 mm) and malate (0.5 mm) were added as substrates during the incubation of mitochondria at 37 °C for ∼5 min prior to sealing a 1.85-ml chamber to commence the measurement of the QO2. A Clark-type O2 electrode (YSI Inc.) was used to record the disappearance of O2. At the end of each QO2 measurement, a sample of the mitochondrial suspension was collected for protein analysis. The mitochondria were used at ∼3–4 mg protein/ml. ATP Assay—In experiments to examine the effects of various agents on the ATP content (Fig. 4), aliquots of parotid acinar cells were incubated at 37 °C for ∼3 min, after which they were exposed to inhibitors or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were rapidly sedimented, and ATP was extracted from the cell pellets by lysing them in 6% perchloric acid. After 15 min, the mixture was subjected to centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 × g), the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and neutralized using K2CO3, and the perchloric acid-precipitated proteins were saved for quantification via protein assay (27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.L. Farr A.L. Randell R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP content in the neutralized supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically (26Soltoff S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37986-37992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after storing the sample at –80 °C. In experiments in which the time-dependent effects of carbachol on ATP content were examined in control and genistein-treated cells (Fig. 6), 1.9-ml cell aliquots were treated with genistein (100 μm) or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C for 20 min, and 400-μl samples (with carbachol) were removed sequentially and added to microcentrifuge tubes containing ice-cold perchloric acid (6% final concentration). The samples were subjected to centrifugation and treated as described above. For each condition in each experiment, samples from 2–4 cell aliquots were collected, and the mean value of each condition was calculated as n = 1 experiment. The results from multiple experiments using separate acinar cell preparations were averaged, and the S.E. values were calculated.Fig. 6Effects of carbachol on the cellular ATP content in parotid acinar cells. ATP was measured in parotid cells treated with vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) or genistein (100 μm) for 20 min prior to exposure to carbachol (Carb;10–5m) for 1–5 min. In each experiment, samples were collected in triplicate. Values shown are the mean ± S.E. for n = 3 experiments. In each experiment, the ATP contents were calculated relative to the basal content (8.0 ± 1.0 nmol of ATP/mg of protein, n = 3) for cells treated with vehicle (no carbachol). *, p < 0.04, (–genistein/+carbachol) versus (–genistein/–carbachol); **, p < 0.03, (+genistein/+carbachol) versus (+genistein/–carbachol); #, p < 0.03, (+genistein/–carbachol) versus (–genistein/–carbachol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—Parotid acinar cells were exposed to various agents or vehicle and then were collected by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge (Model 5415C, Eppendorf, Wesbury, NY). The supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as previously described (2Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates cleared of insoluble proteins were added to fresh tubes and diluted 1:1 with 2× sample buffer. In some experiments, prior to adding sample buffer, PKCδ was immunoprecipitated using ∼0.5 μg of monoclonal PKCδ per 1 ml of lysate. Immunoprecipitated proteins were collected using 4 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads, washed, and diluted with 2× sample buffer. The composition of the buffers and the washing protocols for the immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (2Benes C. Soltoff S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1498-C1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, nitrocellulose filters containing the transferred proteins were exposed to the following dilutions of antibodies: anti-PKCδ (polyclonal), 0.2 μg/ml; anti-Tyr(P), 1 μg/ml; anti-phospho-ERK1/2, 1:1000; anti-ERK2, 0.1 μg/ml; anti-phospho-AMP kinase, 1:1000; anti-AMP kinase, 1:1000. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence techniques and x-ray film. Data—The mean values + S.E. of n number of independent experiments (each obtained from a separate cell preparation) are as indicated throughout. Differences between control and experimental samples for the accumulated data were evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t test. All immunoblots are representative of at least three separate experiments. Effects of Tyrphostins on QO2 of Parotid Cells and Isolated Mitochondria—The five tyrphostins and other compounds used in these studies are shown in Fig. 1. These tyrphostins have closely related benzylidenemalononitrile-based structures and were developed originally as potential epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors (20Levitsky A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 21Gazit A. Yaish P Gilon C. Levitky A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a number of studies have used several of these compounds, including AG18, as general tyrosine kinase inhibitors to block tyrosine phosphorylation and events downstream of tyrosine phosphorylation. The tyrphostins are structurally similar to tyrosine, and many of them are competitive with exogenous substrate (21Gazit A. Yaish P Gilon C. Levitky A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, carbachol did not increase the QO2 in AG18-treated cells (not shown), a finding that could be consistent with a major dependence of fluid secretion on tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the QO2 of cells treated for 15–20 min with AG18 (100 μm) consistently was much larger than that for untreated cells. In contrast, the basal QO2 and the carbachol-stimulated QO2 for cells treated with AG9 (100 μm, 20 min) were similar rates to those found in cells treated with vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) alone. AG9 is a relatively ineffective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is structurally related (Fig. 1) to AG18 and often is used as a negative control for tyrphostins. When tyrphostins were examined for acute effects on parotid cell respiration, AG9 (100 μm) did not produce an acute increase in the basal QO2, but AG18 (100 μm) produced a rapid and large increase in the QO2 (Fig. 2). Respiratory increases produced by the muscarinic agonist carbachol were blocked in cells treated with the sodium pump inhibitor ouabain, but ouabain did not block the respiratory increase produced by AG18 (Fig. 2A). Exposure of parotid cells to the cationophore nystatin, which increases intracellular sodium and decreases intracellular potassium levels (7Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), increased the QO2 in a receptor-independent manner, since the sodium pump was activated by the increased intracellular sodium/potassium ratio. Ouabain reduced the nystatin-stimulated QO2, but AG18 stimulated the QO2 of ouabain-treated parotid cells that had been treated first with nystatin or carbachol (Fig. 2A). This suggested that AG18 promoted the uncoupling of mitochondria and was not acting as a cationophore to stimulate the sodium pump. In fact, the increased QO2 values of parotid cells exposed to 100 μm AG18 quantitatively were similar to those of cells treated with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 2B). Like AG18, the effects of FCCP on cell respiration also were not blocked by ouabain (Fig. 2A). These results suggested that AG18, a tyrphostin used as a general inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, is a mitochondrial uncoupler and thereby unsuitable for the initial experimental design. To understand more about the relationship between tyrphostin structures and their potential to act as mitochondrial uncouplers, additional tyrphostins of similar structure to AG18 and AG9 were screened by monitoring alterations in the QO2 of parotid acinar cells. AG30 (100 μm) and AG43 (100 μm) did not increase the basal QO2, but AG10 (100 μm) produced a rapid and large increase in the basal QO2 similar to that of AG18 (Fig. 2B). Like AG18, AG10 also stimulated the QO2 of ouabain-treated parotid cells that had been treated first with nystatin or carbachol prior to tyrphostin addition (not shown). AG10 and AG18 (10–100 μm) produced similar concentration-dependent increases in the QO2 of parotid acinar. To examine more fully the potential of tyrphostins to uncouple mitochondria and the structural basis of this response, the effects of these tyrphostins were measured on the respiration of mitochondria isolated from rat liver. Similar to the results obtained using dissociated parotid cells, AG10 (100 μm) and AG18 (100 μm) stimulated large increases in the QO2 of isolated mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Large increases also were produced by ADP, for which O2 consumption is coupled to ATP production (i.e. oxidative phosphorylation), and FCCP. In contrast to effects of AG10 and AG18, the mitochondrial QO2 was not increased by AG9 (100 μm), AG30 (100 μm), and AG43 (100 μm) (Fig. 3B). AG10 and AG18 stimulated the mitochondrial QO2 in a concentration-dependent manner between 10 and 100 μm. At 100 μm, AG10 and AG18 stimulated the QO2 to about the same level as FCCP (10 μm). The concentration dependence (EC50 ∼20 μm) of AG10 and AG18 for increasing the QO2 of isolated mitochondria (Fig. 3B) was similar to their effect on parotid acinar cells (Fig. 2B). These findings indicate that these two tyrphostins are mitochondrial uncouplers and presumably act as weak acids to carry protons across the mitochondrial membrane. In terms of evaluating the design of molecules with biological effects, it was interesting that 1) tyrphostins of very similar structure (Fig. 1) could have very different effects on mitochondrial respiration, and 2) the relative potencies (AG30 > AG18 > AG10 > AG9 > AG43) of these compounds as inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (IC50 (in μm) = 25, 35, 560, >1250, 6500, respectively, as reported in Ref. 21Gazit A. Yaish P Gilon C. Levitky A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) were distinct from their potencies (AG10 ∼ AG18 ≫ AG9, AG30, AG43) as mitochondrial uncouplers (see “Discussion”). AG9, AG30, and AG43 also were examined for their effects on oxidative phosphorylation by measuring the ADP-stimulated QO2 of isolated mitochondria in the acute presence (3–4-min exposure) of these tyrphostins. Compared with the ADP-stimulated QO2 of mitochondria exposed only to vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), AG9 inhibited the ADP-stimulated QO2 by ∼30% (Fig. 3C). In contrast, AG30 was with"

Two isoforms, μ- and m-calpains, are ubiquitously expressed and known as conventional calpains. It has been previously shown that the mammalian calpains are activated during mitosis by transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. However, it is still unknown whether the activation of calpains contributes to particular events in mitosis. With the use of RNA interference (RNAi), we investigated the roles of calpains in mitosis. Cells reduced the levels of m-calpain, but not μ-calpain, arrested at prometaphase and failed to align their chromosomes at the spindle equator. Specific peptidyl calpain inhibitors also induced aberrant mitosis with chromosome misalignment. Although both m-calpain RNAi and calpain inhibitors affected neither the separation of centrosomes nor the assembly of bipolar spindles, Mad2 was detected on the kinetochores of the misaligned chromosomes, indicating that the prometaphase arrest induced by calpain inhibition is due to activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Furthermore, when calpain activity was inhibited in cells having monopolar spindles, chromosomes were clustered adjacent to the centrosome, suggesting that calpain activity is involved in a polar ejection force for metaphase alignment of chromosomes. Based on these findings, we propose that activation of m-calpain during mitosis is required for cells to establish the chromosome alignment by regulating some molecules that generate polar ejection force.

Based on these findings, we propose that activation of m-calpain during mitosis is required for cells to establish the chromosome alignment by regulating some molecules that generate polar ejection force. Chromosome alignment at the spindle equator, or congression, is a remarkably conspicuous event during mitosis that defines the metaphase stage of the cell cycle. This movement of chromosomes to the spindle equator is necessary for accurate segregation of replicated DNA in organisms as diverse as plants, insects, and mammals (1Kapoor T.M. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Stable metaphase chromosome positioning and the preceding prometaphase chromosome movements are a consequence of the balance or imbalance of poleward and antipoleward movements. For some chromosomes that are closer to one pole, the polar ejection force that pushes chromosomes away from the pole is necessary to move toward the spindle equator to establish metaphase alignment. Recently, a kinesin-like DNA-binding protein (Kid), 1The abbreviations used are: Kid, kinesin-like DNA-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DIC, differential interference contrast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; APC, anaphase-promoting complex.1The abbreviations used are: Kid, kinesin-like DNA-binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DIC, differential interference contrast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; APC, anaphase-promoting complex. a chromokinesin, has been identified as taking a leading role in producing the polar ejection force for metaphase alignment of chromosomes (2Tokai N.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2091-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate the polar ejection force to establish initial congression of chromosomes and maintenance of alignment prior to anaphase are largely unknown. Cell cycle progression is regulated by a complex process, which involves kinase/phosphatase cascades, protease action, signaling by second messengers, and other operations. These mechanisms cooperatively function to execute various events during the cell cycle. Recently, it has become well known that changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+, a second messenger of intracellular signaling, plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression (8Santella L. Kyozuka K. Hoving S. Munchbach M. Quadroni M. Dainese P. Zamparelli C. James P. Carafoli E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Santella L. Kyozuka K. De Riso L. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In particular, Ca2+ oscillations occur at the G1-S boundary and near the G2-M transition when the downstream molecules of Ca2+ signaling are considered to be activated. However, the target molecules involved in cell cycle progression through Ca2+ signaling are obscure. Calpains are a superfamily of Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases whose members are expressed ubiquitously or in a tissue-specific manner. Numerous isoforms of calpains were identified in organisms ranging from mammals to invertebrates, and homologues have been found even in yeast and bacteria. Among them, the mammalian μ- and m-calpains (called conventional calpains) are the most extensively analyzed and have been shown to play a role in various physiological functions, including cell motility (10Cox E.A.

Several lines of evidence suggest that calpains are critically involved in mitotic progression. First, paxillin, a protein involved in focal adhesion, is cleaved specifically by activated m-calpain during mitosis when focal adhesions dissociate (17Yamaguchi R. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Sabe H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Second, calpains and their endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin, alter their distributions during mitosis (18Lane R.D. Allan D.M. Mellgren R.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Third, injection of calpains into the nuclei of prophase-arrested starfish oocytes results in the resumption of meiosis (8Santella L. Kyozuka K. Hoving S. Munchbach M. Quadroni M. Dainese P. Zamparelli C. James P. Carafoli E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These findings allow us to speculate that calpain activation contributes to the mitotic progression through proteolysis of their specific substrates. In this study, we demonstrate that reduction of m-calpain expression by RNA interference induced chromosome misalignment in mitotic cells and atypical nuclear morphology in interphase cells. The similar phenotypes were observed when mitotic cells were treated with specific calpain inhibitors. In those cells, prometaphase duration was significantly prolonged due to the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of calpain activity impairs the polar ejection force, which is required for chromosomes to achieve bipolar microtubule attachment and to align on metaphase plate. Our findings suggest that m-calpain is required for chromosome alignment in mitosis by regulating the machinery of polar ejection force through proteolysis of target proteins. Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa cells were cultured in a mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Synchronization was performed using double thymidine block protocol (first 22 h of incubation with 2 mm thymidine, an interval of normal medium incubation for 8 h, and second incubation with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h), a sequential thymidine/nocodazole protocol (first 22 h of incubation with 2 mm thymidine, an interval of normal medium incubation for 6–7 h, and 100 ng/ml nocodazole incubation for 8–12 h) or thymidine/butyrolactone1 protocol (first 22 h incubation with 2 mm thymidine, and following 50 μm butyrolactone 1 incubation for 8 h). Mitotic cells were collected by mechanical shake-off from the culture plate after a sequential thymidine/nocodazole protocol as above. Collected mitotic cells were washed with PBS, released into medium containing indicated reagents, and harvested at indicated times. RNA Interference—The sequences of the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for human large subunits of m-calpain and μ-calpain were 5′-CCAGGACUACGAGGCGCUGdTdT-3′ and 5′-GCUAGUGUUCGUGCACUCUdTdT-3′, respectively. The sequence of the siRNA specific for human Mad2 was 5′-ACCUUUACUCGAGUGCAGAdTdT-3′. A siRNA-targeting luciferase (GL-2: 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAd-TdT-3′) was used as a control (19Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide RNA-DNA chimeric duplexes were obtained from Japan Bioservice (Asaka, Japan). Both annealing of the component strands of each siRNA and transfection with the use of Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen) were performed as described (19Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8018) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry and Mitotic Index—For cell cycle analysis and DNA content evaluation, cells were fixed in 70% methanol at -20 °C for several hours (20Nitta M. Tsuiki H. Arima Y. Harada K. Nishizaki T. Sasaki K. Mimori T. Ushio Y. Saya H. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm and resuspended in PBS containing RNase A (Sigma) at 0.1 mg/ml. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and propidium iodine was added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. Samples were analyzed by a FACScallibur flow cytometer using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Mitotic index was determined as a percentage of mitotic cells in the total population. Cells with mitotic condensed chromatin were visualized by aceto-orcein (Merck) in 60% acetic acid and analyzed microscopically as previously described (21Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies used in these experiments were as follows: rabbit polyclonal antibody against domain III of m-calpain was obtained from SIGMA; mouse monoclonal antibody against domain III of μ-calpain was obtained from RBI; mouse monoclonal antibody against cyclin B were obtained from Transduction Lab; goat polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal peptide of m-calpain (N-19), goat polyclonal antibody against securin and mouse monoclonal antibody against p53 (DO-1) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rat monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin was obtained from Harlan Sera Lab; rabbit antiserum against Mad2 was generated by injecting rabbits with recombinant GST-hsMad2 fusion protein. Inhibitors—The membrane-permeable inhibitors of calpain used in this study were calbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-aldehyde (Z-LLal: Peptide Institute, Osaka), calbobenzoxy-valyl-phenylalanial (MDL28170: Calbiochem), calbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-thyr-CH2F (Z-LLT-FMK: Calbiochem), 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl-Val-Leu-CHO (SJA6017: Calbiochem). The inhibitor against proteasome used in this study was carbobenzoxy-leucyl-leucyl-leucinal (MG132: Calbiochem). The inhibitor of Eg5 used in this study was 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-6-methyl-2-thioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-H-pyrimidin-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (monastrol: Calbiochem). These reagents were prepared at the following concentrations: 10 mm, Z-LLal; 10 mm, MG132; and 100 mm, monastrol in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at -20 °C. Immunoblotting—To determine protein levels of cyclin B, securin, and p53, HeLa cells were directly lysed with Laemmli buffer and sonicated. For evaluation of siRNA transfection, cells were gently rinsed with ice-cold TBS-EDTA (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), added with lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P40, 100 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors, pH 8.0), collected by scraping, incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, supernatants were saved and added with Laemmli buffer to be 2 mg/ml as final concentration after quantification by BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk/PBS for 30–60 min at room temperature, and incubated with the primary antibody for 1–6 h at room temperature in 0.03% Tween-20/PBS. Nonbound primary antibodies were removed by washing four times for 5 min each in 0.3% Tween-20/PBS, and bound antibody was detected using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Ig (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed four times for 5 min each in 0.3% Tween 20/PBS, and the signals were detected using chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence Microscopy, Classifying Aberrant Nuclei, and Calculating the Area Occupied by Chromosomes or Cytoplasm—HeLa cells were grown on Lab-Tek II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc international) to ∼70% confluence, rinsed with PHEM (60 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4), rinsed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PHEM briefly at 37 °C followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100/PHEM for 5 min at 37 °C, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PHEM for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/0.03% Tween 20/PBS and then incubated with each primary antibody. This was followed by incubation with 1:200 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG (BIOSOURCE) against identical species of primary antibody, 1:1000 TOTO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes) and 1:100 RNase mixture (Ambion). The stained cells were mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane/glycerol, and observed with confocal microscopy (FV300 and 500/Fluoview system; Olympus). Images were obtained separately by independent excitation to minimize overlapping signals, and were processed using Photoshop (Adobe) software. Aberrant nuclei were judged by the following criteria: nuclei that were standard in size, round, or oval shaped, and containing only one or no smooth invaginations were classified into normal nuclei. Nuclei that were abnormal in size, including giant and micronuclei, multiple-lobed or invaginated, and rough shaped were classified as aberrant nuclei. Chromosomal and cytoplasmic areas were calculated on images obtained by fluorescence confocal microscopy of monopolar cells as in Fig. 5E looking up the areas as oval shapes. Statistical significance between experimental groups was assessed by Student's t test. Time-lapse Fluorescence and Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Video Microscopy—To examine the effect of m-calpain RNAi, HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B (HeLa/H2B-GFP) were grown on ΔT dish (Bioptechs, Inc), with addition of 2 mm thymidine simultaneously with transfection of siRNA targeting mRNA of m-calpain. This was followed by 22 h of incubation, release into normal medium, and then time-lapse fluorescence and DIC video microscopy (IX 70; Olympus). To examine the effect of Z-LLal on mitotic progression, HeLa/H2B-GFP cells on ΔT dish were synchronized by sequential thymidine/butyrolactone1 protocol as described under “Cell Culture and Synchronization.” Cells were released from butyrolactone1 into 50 μm Z-LLal and 10% fetal bovine serum containing Leibovitz’s L-15 medium (Invitrogen), and then analyzed by time-lapse fluorescence and DIC video microscopy. To examine the effect of Z-LLal on the maintenance of chromosome congression on the metaphase plate, asynchronized HeLa/H2B-GFP cells were treated with MG132 for 3.5 h before the time-lapse recording. At 1.5 h after the start of recording in the presence of MG132, cells were cultured in medium containing both MG132 and Z-LLal and continuously recorded. Images were acquired and edited by Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The Amount of m-Calpain Is Regulated in a Cell Cycle-dependent Manner and Elevated in G2-M Phase—To investigate the involvement of conventional calpains in the progression of mitosis, we first assessed the changes of protein levels of conventional calpains during cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of S phase by double thymidine block method. At different times after release from block, cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Both the full-length and autolyzed fragments of m-calpain increased in G2-M phase, similar to cyclin B. In contrast, the levels of full-length and proteolytic fragments of μ-calpain were not dramatically changed throughout the cell cycle. These findings raised the possibility that m-calpain, rather than μ-calpain, is involved in events during G2-M phases. Reduction of m-Calpain by RNA Interference Induces Aberrant Mitosis with Chromosome Misalignment—To assess the functions of conventional calpains in cell cycle progression, we used siRNAs targeting mRNAs of μ-calpain and m-calpain. The protein levels of μ- and m-calpains were effectively reduced by siRNA transfection (Fig. 2A). Reduction of m-calpain expression led to a significant increase in the mitotic index (Fig. 2B) and induced aberrant mitosis with chromosome misalignment, although bipolar spindles were normally formed (Fig. 2C). However, reduction of μ-calpain did not affect mitotic index (Fig. 2B) and chromosome alignment (Fig. 2C). HeLa cells, which stably express a GFP-tagged histone H2B (H2B-GFP) fusion protein, were transfected with m-calpain siRNA and investigated the nuclear dynamics by using time-lapse fluorescence and DIC video microscopy (Fig. 2D). Cells with reduced m-calpain expression showed mitotic delay with misalignment of chromosomes followed by aberrant cell division. Moreover, the depletion of m-calpain significantly induced abnormal nuclear morphology, such as large and multiple lobed nuclei (Fig. 2E), in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2F), suggesting that they had become aneuploid after aberrant mitosis. In contrast, the abnormal nuclei were not observed in cells treated with control siRNA (GL2 oligo) and μ-calpain siRNA (Fig. 2, E and F). These results suggest that m-calpain plays a significant role in chromosome alignment and proper segregation of chromosomes. Calpain Inhibitor Induces Mitotic Delay with Misalignment of Chromosomes Despite Normal Bipolar Spindle—To further confirm the involvement of calpains in mitotic event, we treated HeLa cells with Z-LLal, a specific peptidyl calpain inhibitor. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of HeLa cells treated with Z-LLal or MDL28170 for 8 h showed an accumulation of cells with 4 n DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). We also microscopically investigated chromosome configuration by aceto-orcein staining and found that the proportion of mitotic cells (mitotic index) were increased after Z-LLal treatment (Fig. 3B). Synchronized HeLa cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP fusion protein were incubated with Z-LLal from G2 phase, and the nuclear dynamics were investigated by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 3C). The duration of mitosis appeared to be prolonged from 6 h to over 10 h, and the cells eventually divided abnormally or underwent cell death (Fig. 3C). In those Z-LLal-treated cells, alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate was heavily impaired while chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown occurred normally. In most of those mitotic cells, some chromosomes did not congress near the spindle equator and remained near or behind the poles (Fig. 3D) although the bipolar spindles were normally produced. This finding was consistent with that we found in cells treated with m-calpain siRNA (Fig. 2C). Treatment with other calpain inhibitors, MDL28170, Z-LLY-CH2F, and SJA6017, showed similar effects on mitosis of HeLa cells (Fig. 3D), HCT116 cells, NIH/3T3 cells, and HEK293T cells (data not shown). Calpain Inhibitor Activates Mad2-dependent Spindle Assembly Checkpoint—Metaphase-anaphase transition is driven by activation of ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated proteolysis, which is promoted by anaphase-promoting complex (APC). The spindle assembly checkpoint blocks the transition from metaphase to anaphase by inhibiting APC activity until all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate and achieve bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle. To investigate whether mitotic arrest induced by calpain inhibition is due to the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint, we first examined the APC activity in cells treated with calpain inhibitors. HeLa cells were synchronized at prometaphase by using the thymidine/nocodazole protocol, and released into medium containing Me2SO, Z-LLal, or MG132, a general proteasome inhibitor. In the cells released into normal medium (Me2SO) from nocodazole, both cyclin B and securin that are known substrates of APC were rapidly degraded. In contrast, in cells released into Z-LLal or MG132, levels of cyclin B and securin did not change at 3 h after the release from nocodazole (Fig. 4A), suggesting that APC is inactivated by calpain inhibition. To rule out the possibility that Z-LLal directly inhibits proteasome function, we examined the effect of Z-LLal on the stability of p53 protein, which is known to be degraded by an Mdm2-mediated ubiquitin/proteasome mechanism but not by the APC-dependent pathway. The p53 was stabilized by the treatment with MG132 but not by Z-LLal treatment (Fig. 4B). APC activity is suppressed by the activation of spindle assembly checkpoint (22Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To explore whether the checkpoint activation is involved in prometaphase arrest of the calpain-inhibited cells, we examined the recruitment of Mad2 protein to kinetochores; such recruitment is considered to occur at unattached kinetochores and is necessary for maintenance of spindle assembly checkpoint signaling. In cells arrested at prometaphase by Z-LLal-treatment, Mad2 was stained as paired dots at kinetochores of most of the misaligned chromosome, whereas aligned chromosomes were negative for Mad2 staining (Fig. 4C). The misaligned chromosomes contained Mad2-positive kinetochores, suggesting that these kinetochores were not properly captured by bipolar spindles. Furthermore, transfection of the cells with siRNA specific for Mad2 resulted in abrogation of Z-LLal-induced prometaphase arrest (Fig. 4D); the cells entered into mitosis and then quickly exited. In contrast, cells transfected with a control siRNA were arrested at prometaphase after exposure to Z-LLal. These findings suggest that the activation of calpain is required for proper microtubule attachment at kinetochores of misaligned chromosomes and, thereby, calpain inhibition results in the activation of the Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint, which leads to prometaphase arrest. Calpain Inhibitor Has No Effect on Bipolar Spindle Formation—Spindle assembly checkpoint is activated by reagents such as nocodazole and taxol, which affect the stability of mitotic spindles. Therefore, we examined the status of mitotic spindles in cells arrested at prometaphase by calpain inhibitors. Images obtained by fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that two spindle poles were positioned contralaterally and bipolar spindles formed normally when HeLa cells were treated with various calpain inhibitors including Z-LLal (Fig. 3D). These findings indicate that calpain inhibitors affected neither the separation of centrosomes nor the assembly of bipolar spindles. To test whether calpain inhibitors alter the stability of mitotic spindle in the same manner as taxol, we added 5 μl/ml of Me2SO (control), 50 μm of Z-LLal, 200 ng/ml of nocodazole, or 100 nm of taxol to HeLa cells pretreated with nocodazole or Z-LLal. In the presence of preceding nocodazole, additional Z-LLal treatment did not affect nocodazole-induced depolymerization of mitotic spindles while taxol markedly stabilized them (Fig. 4E, upper panels). Conversely, in the presence of preceding Z-LLal, additional nocodazole treatment resulted in complete depolymerization of mitotic spindles (Fig. 4E, lower panels), suggesting that Z-LLal did not stabilize mitotic spindles. These findings provide evidence that prometaphase arrest induced by calpain inhibitors is not caused by abnormalities in bipolar spindle formation and stability. Chromosomes on Monopolar Spindles Were Clustered Adjacent to the Centrosome by Inhibition of Calpain—Proper chromosome alignment during mitosis is achieved via a complex and variable series of movements that include the rapid poleward translocation of monoorienting chromosomes, oscillation of monooriented chromosomes toward and away from their attached spindle pole by poleward and polar ejection forces, and bipolar attachment followed by congression to the spindle equator (1Kapoor T.M. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Skibbens R.V. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 859-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 24Rieder C.L. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Microscopic analysis of cells arrested at prometaphase by treatments with m-calpain siRNA (Fig. 2C) and calpain inhibitors (Fig. 3D) showed that some chromosomes interact with microtubules derived from one of the two spindle poles and are closely localized to the pole. These findings prompted us to examine whether calpain activity is required to generate a polar ejection force during mitosis. It has been shown previously that the polar ejection force can be monitored by examining chromosome position on monopolar spindles (5Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells treated with monastrol, a specific Eg5 inhibitor, formed monopolar spindles due to failure of centrosome separation (25Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Chromosomes formed a ring around the single pole, oriented in a “V” shape formed by poleward force at kinetochores and polar ejection force at their arms, and a chromosome-clear zone was seen widely at the center of the ring. The balance between poleward and polar ejection forces determines this chromosome position. Given that the polar ejection force is normally stronger than the poleward force in normal prometaphase cells, a chromosome-clear zone is evidently formed (Fig. 5, A, upper panels, and B, left panel). However, cells treated with Z-LLal in the presence of monastrol showed that chromosomes on monopolar spindles tended to cluster adjacent to the centrosome and did not orient in the “V” shape (Fig. 5, A, lower panels and B, right panel). Furthermore, we calculated the areas occupied by cytoplasm and chromosomes using images obtained by fluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 5E). The areas of chromosomes in cells treated with Z-LLal (average: 455.7 μm2) were significantly smaller than that in cells treated with Me2SO (average: 619.8 μm2) (p < 0.0001, Student’s t test), although the areas of cytoplasm did not differ between cells treated with Z-LLal and Me2SO (average: 1041.3 μm2 and 1018.6 μm2, p = 0.28) (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the ratio of chromosome area to cytoplasm was significantly smaller in Z-LLal-treated cells than control cells (average: 0.45 in Z-LLal-treated cells and 0.60 in control cells, p < 0.0001). The same effect was observed when HeLa cells were transfected with m-calpain siRNA and treated with monastrol (Fig. 5D). The ratio of chromosomal area to cytoplasm in each cell was significantly smaller in m-calpain-depleted cells than cells treated with control siRNA (average: 0.51 in m-calpain-depleted cells and 0.59 in control cells, p < 0.0001). These findings suggest that m-calpain inhibition suppresses the polar ejection force on the chromosome arms. We thus speculated that m-calpain is activated during mitosis and proteolyses a target molecule(s) that regulates the polar ejection force of mitotic spindles. Calpain Activity Is Required to Maintain Chromosome Alignment at the Spindle Equator—In Xenopus egg extracts, the polar ejection force produced by chromokinesin Kid (Xkid) is required for maintenance of chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate (4Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I. Cell. 2000; 102: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To investigate whether calpain activity is required, not only for chromosome congression on the metaphase plate but also for maintenance of chromosome alignment during metaphase, we treated HeLa cells with MG132 to induce metaphase arrest (Fig. 6A) (26Topper L.M. Bastians H. Ruderman J.V. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and subsequently treated with Z-LLal in the presence of MG132, followed by time-lapse fluorescence and DIC video microscopy. In cells treated with Me2SO in the presence of MG132, all chromosomes were aligned at the equator and arrested at metaphase for up to 14 h (data not shown). By contrast, the addition of Z-LLal into the medium containing MG132 rapidly induced impairment of chromosome alignment (Fig. 6B) and which never aligned again until the end of our observations (Fig. 6, C and D). The final phenotype appeared to be very similar to that observed in cells treated with the calpain inhibitor alone (Fig. 3D). These results indicated that chromosome alignment at metaphase is not static and requires m-calpain activity to be maintained. We have shown that the amount of m-calpain increases in G2-M phase in HeLa cells, while μ-calpain is almost static throughout the cell cycle. Cells treated with siRNA oligos against m-calpain, not μ-calpain, accumulated in mitosis with chromosomes failed to align at the spindle equator. Atypical larger lobulated nuclei, possibly resulted from aberrant mitosis, increased in ratio in a time-dependent manner in m-calpain-down-regulated cells, but not in μ-calpain-down-regulated cells. These data thus suggest that m-calpain is involved in chromosome alignment during mitosis. Inhibition of m-calpain induces mitotic delay with chromosome misalignment without obvious spindle abnormality. Kinetochores in the misaligned chromosomes were positive for Mad2 staining, indicating that spindle assembly checkpoint is activated by impairment of proper kinetochore-spindle connection. Accordingly, inhibition of m-calpain activity in the mitotic phase may impair the formation of bipolar attachment of mitotic spindles to kinetochores of several chromosomes near spindle poles, resulting in activation of spindle assembly checkpoint. To congress to the spindle equator a chromosome must biorient, i.e. attach to spindle microtubules with each kinetochore interacting with microtubules derived from one of the two spindle poles. Some chromosomes biorient immediately upon nuclear envelope breakdown, and oscillate about the spindle equator. Other chromosomes initially interact with microtubules at only one kinetochore, resulting in rapid chromosome movement toward one of the poles. Near the spindle pole, both sister kinetochores capture spindles from the same pole. This monopolar attachment is corrected by activating the Aurora B kinase-INCENP complex until one of the kinetochores is captured by microtubules from opposite pole to form bipolar attachment (27Tanaka T.U. Rachidi N. Janke C. Pereira G. Galova M. Schiebel E. Stark M.J. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2002; 108: 317-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Polar ejection force is required for the monooriented chromosomes to move away from their attached spindle pole to facilitate bipolar attachment, followed by congression to the spindle equator. Impairment of polar ejection forces may induce frequent detachment of kinetochores from microtubules until bipolar attachment is formed. This might trigger the Mad2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint, which causes prometaphase arrest in cells disrupted m-calpain function. We propose that m-calpain plays a role in generating polar ejection forces to promote chromosome alignment for the following reasons. First, both cells depleted m-calpain by RNAi and treated with calpain inhibitor failed to congress their chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Second, cells treated with calpain inhibitor in the presence of monastrol demonstrated that the spreading area of chromosomes on monopole was reduced and chromosomes did not orient in a typical “V” shape. This phenotype is similar to those observed in cells microinjected with antibodies against Kid (5Levesque A.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which has been lately demonstrated to be a major player for generating polar ejection force (3Funabiki H. Murray A.W. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 4Antonio C. Ferby I. Wilhelm H. Jones M. Karsenti E. Nebreda A.R. Vernos I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that m-calpain proteolyses recombinant Kid protein in vitro (data not shown). This finding together with the reported finding that overexpression of Kid disrupts chromosome alignment (7Ohsugi M. Tokai-Nishizumi N. Shiroguchi K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Inoue J. Yamamoto T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2091-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) supports the hypothesis that m-calpain may regulate turnover of Kid protein, which is required for proper chromosome congression. Arthur et al. (28Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) proposed that conventional calpains are potentially essential for embryonic development, but not for cell growth and division, by analyzing mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) derived from mice lacking the Capn4 gene (28Arthur J.S. Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Williams K. Greer P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Since Capn4 is a common small regulatory subunit for both m- and μ-calpains, Capn4-/- MEFs potentially lack the activities of conventional calpains. Discrepancy between our findings and their results obtained using Capn4-/- MEFs may be explained by the recent experimental observation that the conventional calpains can be activated without binding of Capn4 (29Hata S. Sorimachi H. Nakagawa K. Maeda T. Abe K. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by our findings that neither Capn4 RNAi nor the treatment of PD150606, an inhibitor of Capn4, shows significant effect on mitotic progression of HeLa cells (data not shown). It is thus conceivable that inhibition of calpain 2, a large subunit of m-calpain, may leads to biological responses different from those induced by inhibition or depletion of Capn4 in mammalian cells. Proteolysis is a key event in control of the cell cycle. Increasing evidence has revealed that changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations also have a crucial role in the progression of the cell cycle, particularly mitosis. Therefore, it has been suggested that the activation of Ca2+-dependent protease m-calpain is essential to mitotic progression, although the substrates of m-calpain during mitosis have been unknown (9Santella L. Kyozuka K. De Riso L. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Santella L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our data demonstrated that m-calpain is required to establish bioriented chromosomes during prometaphase by regulating polar ejection forces.

During the acute inflammatory response, the levels of mitochondrial-derived ROS increase in response to local, elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus perpetuating the deleterious effects of ROS, such as superoxide (4Schulze-Osthoff K.

As part of the inflammatory response the double-edged nature of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β, includes the transcriptional activation of Mn-SOD (5Wong G.H.

Human Mn-SOD is a tetrameric dimer of dimers with one active site manganese atom per 22-kDa monomer (9Borgstahl G.E.O. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A.

We have previously evaluated the enzymatic mechanism for human Mn-SOD using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with stopped-flow spectroscopy, pulse radiolysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and x-ray crystallography (10Silverman D.N.

Fig. 1A shows the metal coordinated by three histidines (26, 74, 163), one monodentate aspartate (159), and a single solvent molecule giving distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Our studies have shown that the coordinated solvent molecule (Wat-1) along with Tyr-34, Gln-143, and His-30 form a hydrogen-bonding network (13Ramilo C.A. Lévêque V. Guan Y. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A.

Our kinetic results have also established that the wild-type (WT) human enzyme exhibits first-order catalysis within the first milliseconds of the reaction followed by a zero-order product-inhibited phase that dominates the remainder of the catalytic cycle (10Silverman D.N.

The catalytic mechanism of Mn-SOD (Reaction 1) is depicted below, where Mn(III)-SOD represents the ground state of the metal-bound enzyme. These reactions represent an oxidative followed by a reductive stage, where two O2˙- are converted to O2 and H2O2 by either the uninhibited or inhibited (Mn(X)-SOD) pathways (15McAdam M.E. Fox R.A. Lavelle F. Fielden E.M. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The product-inhibited state of Mn-SOD has been conserved from bacteria to man with the emergence of the inhibited form appearing 30-fold more rapidly for the human enzyme (11Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y.

In addition, in mammals, Mn-SOD has been postulated to function as a tumor suppressor gene (16Bravard A. Sabatier L. Hoffschir F. Ricoul M. Luccioni C. Dutrillaux B. Int. J.

An inference, therefore, derived from the active site structure, catalytic mechanism, and the signaling properties of H2O2, would be that specific alterations in active site residues may alleviate the inherent inefficiency associated with the product-inhibited complex, thus increasing the anti-proliferative effects through elevated levels of H2O2. To this end, we have generated active site mutants in an attempt to eliminate this rate-limiting portion of the catalytic cycle and have assessed the properties of these more efficient, mutant enzymes through overexpression in cell culture and in an animal model of tumorigenesis. These results have provided further insight into the physiological importance of Mn-SOD activity during oncogenesis as well as the relevance for evolutionary conservation of the product-inhibited complex. Reagents—The mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3.1/LacZ, a plasmid containing β-galactosidase; pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+); pcDNA3.1(+); LipofectAMINE Plus; G418 and Zeocin were purchased from Invitrogen Corp (Carlsbad, CA). TNF-α was a gift of Genentech Corp., San Francisco, CA. Cycloheximide (CHX) and catalase were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, MO), and WST-1 cell proliferation kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science (Nutley, NJ). The pLPCX retroviral vector was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Plasmid Constructs—An 853-bp human Mn-SOD cDNA fragment was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from mRNA isolated from human renal proximal tubule cells using oligonucleotides containing 5′ HindIII and 3′ EcoRI: (Forward: 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCGGGCGGCGCAGGAGCGGC-3′ and reverse: 5′-CGGGGTACCAATAGAGCAGCTTACTGTAT-3′) and subcloned into either pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). The DNA fragment encoding the Mn-SOD mitochondrial leader sequence fused to human catalase cDNA was excised from pSVZEOmsp-CAT (24Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) by digestion with BsaI and NotI and inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ that had been completely digested with NotI, and partially digested with BsaI as described previously (25Davis C.A. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Mn-SOD active site mutants were generated using PCR as described previously (14Lévêque V.J.-P. Vance C.K. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10586-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the following primer sets: H30N Forward: 5′-CAGCTGCACCATTCGTCGAAGAACCACGCGGCCTA-3′, H30N Reverse: 5′-TAGGCCGCGTGGTTCTTCGAATGGTGCAGCTG-3′, Q143A Forward: 5′-GCTGCTTGTCCAAATGCGGATCCAC-3′, Q143A Reverse: 5′-GTGGATCGCGAATTGGACAAGCAGC-3′ (underlined codon denotes site of mutations). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 Cell Culture, Cell Transfection, and Generation of Stable Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured as previously described (25Davis C.A. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in growth medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing either wild-type Mn-SOD, the H30N or Q143A mutant using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), cultured for 48 h in growth medium and transferred to growth medium containing zeocin (150 μg/ml). Antibiotic-containing medium was replaced every 3 days for approximately 4 weeks. Multiple zeocin-resistant colonies were isolated by clonal selection and grown without antibiotic prior to screening for Mn-SOD or catalase protein expression by immunoblot analysis. Identical stable clones were also generated using selection with G418 to test for the effects of antibiotic selection on the quiescence phenotype, which occurred with cells stably overexpressing the H30N mutant with similar results, as described below. In transient transfection assays, 1 μg of pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing either wild-type Mn-SOD, H30N, or Q143A mutants and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1/LacZ were co-transfected into 60-mm dishes containing 1.9 × 105 HEK 293 using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were split into two 35-mm plates and allowed to recover for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested for Northern and immunoblot analyses, as described below. Enzyme Isolation and Pulse Radiolysis—Wild-type and mutant Mn-SODs (lacking the leader sequence which in eukaryotic cells is excised following targeting of the protein to the mitochondrion) were overexpressed and purified as described previously from Escherichia coli (11Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17687-17691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial lysates were heat-treated (60 °C) followed by subsequent dialysis and ion exchange chromatography (DE-52 and CM-52). Final protein concentrations were determined by the ratio of occupied metal sites (determined by flame atomic absorption) compared with the number of total Mn-SOD active sites as determined by the Lowry assay. Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out at the Brookhaven National Laboratory utilizing a 2-MeV Van de Graaff accelerator, as described previously (26Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Buffered enzyme solutions containing 1 μm enzyme, 2 mm Taps, 30 mm sodium formate, and 50 μm EDTA at pH 8.2 were exposed to the electron beam instantaneously generating 20 μm O2˙-. The progress of superoxide decay and thus activity of the enzymes was followed spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from transfected cells using a modification of the Chomczynski and Sacchi method (7Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was quantified and size fractionated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto nylon membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled human Mn-SOD cDNA probe. Membranes were then washed and subjected to autoradiography. Immunoblot Analysis—Transfected or retrovirally transduced cells were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 (1%). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and 20 μg of total protein was electrophoresed on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat milk and incubated for 1 h with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Mn-SOD (1:2000, Stressgen Inc., Victoria, BC, Canada (25Davis C.A. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar)), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (1:1000, Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA) or anti-catalase (1:500, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) antibodies followed by washing and incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Labeled protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cell Growth and Toxicity Assays—HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3.1/LacZ and pcDNA3.1 alone, or carrying wild-type Mn-SOD, H30N, or Q143A mutant enzymes. The transfected cells were split 1:2 either treated, or not, with 50 μg/ml CHX for 20 min followed by 100 ng/ml of TNF-α for 24 h. Cell were washed and stained for β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase-positive cells were blindly counted in 8–10 random 10× high power fields. The data are expressed as the fraction of β-galactosidase positive cells in the control and treated groups. Cell growth rates and cellular toxicity were also determined using the WST-1 Proliferation Kit (Roche Corp.), where HEK 293 cell lines stably overexpressing mitochondrial targeted catalase as well as wild-type Mn-SOD, H30N, or Q143A enzymes were plated at 4 × 103 cells per well in a 96-well plate and grown for 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 days. 10 μl of the WST-1 reagent was added to each well and for toxicity studies the percentage was determined by subtracting the ratio of (A450 - A690 in treated cells/A450 - A690 control cells) following the addition of WST-1. To evaluate the effects of protein overexpression in cells that were stably overexpressing mito-catalase (25Davis C.A. Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2683-2690PubMed Google Scholar) and the respective Mn-SOD proteins in the context of a cytotoxic challenge, cells were exposed to CHX/TNF-α and cell viability determined by the WST-1 assay. For determination of percent toxicity following TNF and CHX challenge, 4 × 104 cells of each stable cell line (replicates of four) were plated 24 h prior to challenge into 96-well plates. Cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml CHX for 20 min followed by the addition of 100 ng/ml TNF. Control and treated cells were incubated with 10 μl of WST-1 reagent and allowed to incubate for 1 h prior to measurement of absorbances at 450 and 690 nm as per the manufacturer's instructions. Percent viability was determined by the quotient (A450 - A690 of treated samples/A450 - A690 of control samples) × 100. All growth curves and toxicity measurements represent the means ± S.E. of at least four replicate experiments. Measurement of Cellular H2O2 Levels—HEK cell lines stably expressing the wild-type Mn-SOD, H30N, or Q143A enzymes as well as empty vector were exposed to DCF-DA as a probe for ROS as described previously (24Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the presence of increased H2O2 levels was determined via quenching with exogenous catalase. Retroviral Constructs, Transductions, and Cell Growth—Wild-type (WT) Mn-SOD and H30N Mn-SOD mutant cDNAs were subcloned from the pcDNA 3.1 plasmid into a pBMN-IRES-eGFP retroviral expression vector (27Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and into the puromycin selectable retroviral expression vector pLPCX (Clontech Corp.). The Mn-SOD cDNAs were excised from the pcDNA 3.1 plasmid using EcoRI and NotI and subcloned into both of these retroviral vectors. Phoenix-packaging cells were used for the production of infectious retroviruses (27Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A549 cells were utilized for the retroviral transduction experiments and were cultured in Ham's modified F12K media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For the generation of retrovirally transduced A549 cells, Phoenix cells at ∼40% confluency were transfected using calcium phosphate with 8 μg of empty vector, wild-type Mn-SOD, H30N Mn-SOD, or GFP (pLPCX only) and incubated at 37 °C (27Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The same protocol was used for both the pBMN-IRES-GFP and pLPCX constructs. Eighteen hours post-transfection, the media was changed and the Phoenix cells were moved to 32 °C for 24 h for retrovirus generation. Forty-eight hours post-transfection the media from the Phoenix cells was collected and centrifuged to remove live packaging cells. The media containing infectious retrovirus was put on 30–40% confluent A549 cells and placed at 32 °C for 24 h after which fresh media was added, and the cells were moved to 37 °C. For the pBMN-IRES-GFP A549 cells, GFP expression was apparent after 48 h and 80–90% of the cells were GFP-positive as confirmed by flow cytometry. The A549 cells transduced with pLPCX vectors were selected at 1 μg/ml puromycin starting at 48 h post-infection, with selection complete at 2 weeks. Independent confirmation of infection efficiency was performed using flow cytometry with the GFP-pLPCX cells and demonstrated greater than 98% transduction. Protein was isolated from all groups of transduced cells, and immunoblot analysis was used to confirm transgene expression. For evaluation of cell growth, control A549 cells and cells transduced with the empty retroviral vector were compared with retroviral transduced cells overexpressing the wild-type Mn-SOD and H30N proteins. 1 × 105 cells were plated on 100-mm plates and allowed to grow for 5 days, and cells were then blindly counted in triplicate using a hemacytometer. Cell growth was evaluated at 16, 23, 44, 57, and 64 days post antibiotic selection as described above. Animal Model of Tumorigenesis—NOD/SCID mice (28Serreze D.V. Leiter E.H. Hanson M.S. Christianson S.W. Shultz L.D. Hesselton R.M. Greiner D.L. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were injected subcutaneously with 2 × 106 retrovirally transduced A549 cells overexpressing empty pBMN-IRES-GFP vector (27Fletcher B.S. Dragstedt C. Notterpek L. Nolan G.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1507-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), wild-type Mn-SOD, or the H30N mutant in pBMN-IRES-GFP (n = 7 per group). Flow cytometry of GFP fluorescence was performed prior to injection to determine the transduction efficiency, which was between 88 and 92%. Tumor size was determined by measuring the tumor length (L) and width (W) using a Vernier caliper, and the tumor volume (TV) was calculated in cubic millimeters by the formula, TV = L × W2/2. Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as mean ± S.E. The t test was used for comparisons between two groups, and for comparisons involving more than two groups, we used analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test. All results are considered significant at p < 0.05. Catalytic Efficiency Assessed by Pulse Radiolysis—Our previous studies (11Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10586-10591Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mutagenesis at position Gln-143 (see Fig. 1A) in the active site leads to changes in the redox chemistry of the manganese atom, converting the metal from Mn(III) to Mn(II) in the ground state dramatically reducing the efficiency of catalysis. This is illustrated in a pulse radiolysis trace of the Q143A mutant (Fig. 1B), where pure mutant enzyme in buffer is placed in a cuvette and bombarded with a collimated electron beam instantaneously producing reproducible levels of O2 mined based on O2.. Superoxide concentrations are deter-. absorbance at 260 nm. The upper tracing illustrates the slower catalytic efficiency over time of the Q143A mutant relative to the WT enzyme. On the other hand, substitution of asparagine at position His-30 (13Ramilo C.A. Lévêque V. Guan Y. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27711-27716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), another important residue in the hydrogen bond network of the active site (Fig. 1A), essentially eliminates the product-inhibited phase of catalysis and generates an enzyme that can more efficiently dismutate an equivalent concentration of O2˙- over the observed time interval relative to the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of Site-directed Mutants of Human Mn-SOD—To characterize the cellular and physiological consequences of the more efficient H30N enzyme, stable cell lines (vector, WT, H30N, and Q143A) were established in both HEK293 and A549 cells. Fig. 2A shows a Northern analysis of transiently expressed WT and mutant Mn-SODs in HEK293 cells. The overexpressed message of ∼1.2 kb is seen relative to the 4.0- and 1.0-kb endogenous mRNA for human Mn-SOD. To evaluate the functional characteristics of these mutant enzymes, we transiently overexpressed the WT, H30N, and Q143A enzymes and tested their effectiveness in a model of TNF-mediated apoptosis (6Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B illustrates that cells overexpressing the less efficient Q143A enzyme exhibited cell viability similar to vector transfected cells. In contrast, cells expressing the WT or H30N enzymes showed equivalent cytoprotection with significantly increased viability compared with vector- or Q143A-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C illustrates an immunoblot of individual antibiotic-selected HEK 293 clones from cells stably transfected with each of the abovementioned constructs. The presence of the 22-kDa Mn-SOD monomer is indicated in each panel. Protein from WT clone #3 was employed on each immunoblot for a comparison to the mutant protein expression levels. Most significantly, selection of stable, clonal transformants in HEK 293 cells employing mammalian expression vectors with either zeocin or G418 selection caused significant effects on cellular growth. Over the time period necessary for stable selection, overexpression of the H30N enzyme caused significant slowing of cell growth in multiple independent clones and separate transfections, irrespective of the vector or selection regimen. To explain the anti-proliferative effects of this mutant enzyme, we evaluated the level of ROS in the stably transfected cells using DCF-DA (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that the H30N stably overexpressing cells produce elevated levels of ROS and that the anti-proliferative effects are most likely a consequence of increased H2O2 production based on the reduction in signal following catalase treatment (Fig. 2E). Other than these limited studies, H30N-overexpressing cells established through stable transfection protocols were essentially refractory to further study due to the potent anti-proliferative effects of this mutant enzyme. Rescue of H30N-overexpressing Cells by Mitochondrial-targeted Catalase—As additional evidence for the relevance of H2O2, we tested the strategy that overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mito-CAT) (24Rodriguez A.M.

Isc proteins are integral components of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthetic pathway for organisms as diverse as bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes (1Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

By use of these pathways, cells are able to assemble protein-bound Fe-S clusters that are used for redox reactions, enzymatic catalysis, gene regulation, and structural stabilization. The cellular machinery for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis is necessary not only to provide appropriate proteins with their necessary metallocofactors, but, more importantly, to do so without suffering the toxic effects of free iron and sulfide. A main component of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis pathway is the protein IscU. IscU is believed to function as an Fe-S cluster scaffold in which a nascent Fe-S cluster is synthesized and subsequently delivered to target Fe-S apoproteins (3Mansy S.S. Wu G. Surerus K.K.

Surerus K.K. Foster M.W. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5024-5032Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the reactions of IscU in cluster transfer to a target protein, apoferredoxin (11Wu S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8876-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also addressed the mechanism of assembly of IscU-bound clusters (15Nuth M. Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2003; 125: 6078-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structure of IscU would provide critical insight to our understanding of IscU chemistry; however, the structural characterization of IscU has proven to be challenging. Our structural characterization efforts have thus far been focused on a homolog from the hyperthermophile T. maritima (17Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Del Bianco C. Luchinat C. Mansy S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Initial structural characterization by circular dichroism correctly predicted a high degree of secondary structure (3Mansy S.S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21397-21404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other spectroscopic and functional evidence seemed consistent with a high degree of secondary structure and the presence of a stable tertiary fold. The strongest evidence for such was the high degree of chemical shift dispersion observed by 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR experiments. However, subsequent efforts to further define the three-dimensional structure of T. maritima (Tm) 1The abbreviations used are: Tm, Thermotoga maritima; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; WT, wild-type. IscU by NMR failed to identify a unique tertiary fold (17Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Del Bianco C. Luchinat C. Mansy S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the vast majority of the NMR data were consistent with a stable and rigid protein fold, the number of detectable long-range nuclear Overhauser effects was significantly below that which is normally observed for a protein the size of Tm IscU and provided too few distance constraints for satisfactory structural calculations of the tertiary fold. Much of the NMR data were, however, similar to those previously characterized for molten globule states of proteins. The term molten globule is generally used to describe a state in which a protein possesses a high degree of secondary structure without a stable tertiary fold (18Ptitsyn O.B. J. Protein Chem. 1987; 6: 273-293Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 19Ohgushi M. Wada A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 20Kuwajima K. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Molten globules often show large degrees of chemical shift dispersion, but lack long-range nuclear Overhauser effects (21Yao J. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3561-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Matthews J.M. Norton R.S. Hammacher A. Simpson R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1942-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The main difference in the results of NMR studies on Tm IscU relative to those reported previously for molten globule proteins is the dynamic data. Molten globules usually show motion on a nanosecond-picosecond time scale detectable by 15N relaxation measurements (23Cavagnero S. Nishimura C. Schwarzinger S. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14459-14467Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tm IscU did not appear to have significant nanosecond-picosecond motion. In addition to the dynamic data, several lines of evidence such as resonance splitting and hydrogen exchange suggested that flexibility existed on a millisecond time scale. Thus, it is presently unclear what tertiary state Tm IscU is in and whether that state reflects what is typically described as a molten globule. Therefore, we sought to characterize Tm apo-IscU by methods typically employed to identify molten globules. These methods include near-UV CD, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) binding, free energy of unfolding, hydrodynamic radius measurements, and limited tryptic digestion. Apo- and holoproteins behave similarly by NMR criteria. However, due to complications arising from the instability of the bound Fe-S cluster of Tm holo-IscU, the majority of the structural data were acquired on Tm apo-IscU. The data suggest unusual dynamic behavior that is not fully consistent with typical protein states such as fully folded, fully unfolded, or molten globule. For instance, the existence of a stable tertiary fold is supported by near-UV CD spectra and the hydrodynamic radius, whereas other data are less clearly interpretable and may be viewed as consistent with either a molten globule or fully folded state. However, all of the data are consistent with our previous hypothesis of a protein sampling multiple discrete tertiary conformations in which these structural transitions occur on a “slow” (microsecond-millisecond) time scale. The significance of such dynamics and how they may be affected by partner protein interactions are discussed. General Chemicals—ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR); the low molecular mass protein ladder was from Invitrogen; and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Protein samples were expressed and purified as described previously (3Mansy S.S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21397-21404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All protein concentrations were calculated based on monomer equivalents. ANS Binding—ANS concentration was determined by absorbance using the previously determined extinction coefficient at 350 nm (24Weber G. Young L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1415-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The change in fluorescence emission was monitored by use of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 371 nm and a slit width of 3 nm, whereas emission was monitored at 482 nm with a slit width of 10 nm at 25 °C. The buffer used was 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). NaCl was varied between 0 and 200 mm. Data were corrected for the inner filter effect when necessary (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983: 43-47Google Scholar). Near-UV CD—CD spectra were measured on an Aviv Model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer using a 1-cm path length cuvette. The protein concentration was 0.08 mm in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded in 0, 50, and 200 mm NaCl. Buffer spectra were subtracted. Spectra are averages of three measurements, except for those in guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). Dynamic Light Scattering—Light scattering was recorded on a DynaPro-801 (Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA) with a temperature-controlled microsampler. The laser wavelength and scattering angle were 8294 Å and 90°, respectively. The instrument software (Dynamics Version 3.27) was used to calculate the hydrodynamic radius using the measured translational diffusion coefficient and the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 1), DT=(kT)/f=(kT)/(6πηR)(Eq. 1) where DT is the translational diffusion coefficient, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, f is the frictional coefficient, η is the viscosity of the solution, and R is the hydrodynamic radius. Solution conditions were 50 μm protein in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at 22.7 °C with varying NaCl concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 450 mm. Samples were filtered through 0.02-μm filters (Whatman Anatop 10) immediately prior to measurements. Free Energy of Unfolding—GdnHCl-induced unfolding was monitored by CD. Measurements were carried out on an Aviv Model 202 circular dichroism spectrometer using a 0.1-mm path length cuvette, repeated three times, and averaged. Protein (0.08 mm) was incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, and 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.3 m GdnHCl overnight at room temperature. The GdnHCl concentrations were prepared by mixing stocks of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 200 mm NaCl and an identical solution with 8.0 m GdnHCl in which the pH was adjusted after dissolving all of the components. Unfolding was followed by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of GdnHCl concentration and analyzed by the linear extrapolation method (26Felitsky D.J. Record M.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2202-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which assumes a two-state unfolding mechanism. Equations 2, 3, 4 were used to fit the data, K=fD/(1-fD)(Eq. 2) ΔGD=-RTlnK(Eq. 3) ΔGD=GD(H2O)-m[GdnHCl](Eq. 4) where K is the equilibrium constant for unfolding, fD is the fraction of denatured protein, ΔGD is the free energy of unfolding, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, ΔGDH2O) is the free energy of unfolding extrapolated to zero denaturant, and the m value is proportional to the amount of polypeptide exposed to solvent upon unfolding. Tryptic Digestion Monitored by Mass Spectrometry and SDS-PAGE— Reactions were carried out at the Campus Chemical Instrument Center of Ohio State University. Wild-type (WT) and D40A Tm IscU were reduced with dithiothreitol (5 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate), alkylated with iodoacetamide (15 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate), mixed with 1:25 (w/w) Promega sequence-grade modified trypsin, and incubated at 37 °C. After 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, aliquots were removed, immediately desalted by use of ZipTips (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer’s directions, and analyzed by electrospray ionization using a Micromass Q-TOF™ II mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal electrospray source (Z-spray) operated in positive ion mode. Sodium iodide was used for mass calibration at a calibration range of m/z 100–2500. Proteins were prepared in a solution containing 50% acetonitrile, 50% water, and 0.1% formic acid at a concentration of 50 pmol/μl and infused into the electrospray source at a rate of 5–10 μl/min. Optimal electrospray ionization conditions were as follows: capillary voltage, 3000 V; source temperature, 110 °C; and cone voltage, 60 V. The electrospray ionization gas was nitrogen. Q1 was set to optimally pass ions from m/z 100 to 2000, and all ions transmitted into the pusher region of the Q-TOF analyzer were scanned over m/z 100–3000 with a 1-s integration time. Data were acquired in continuum mode until acceptable averaged data were obtained (10–15 min). Electrospray ionization data were deconvoluted using MaxEnt I (Micromass). The experiment was repeated identically except that, at each time point, an aliquot was removed and mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subsequently loaded onto a homogenous precast polyacrylamide gel from Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). ANS Binding—ANS is a structural probe whose fluorescence is greatly dependent on its polar environment. For example, ANS fluorescence is negligible in aqueous solution, whereas in an apolar environment, its fluorescence is greatly increased and blue-shifted. ANS addition to native or fully unfolded protein solutions usually does not result in significant fluorescence. However, in the presence of partially folded or molten globule proteins, ANS exhibits a large degree of fluorescence, presumably by penetrating the protein’s hydrophobic core (27Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Under the current solution conditions and in the absence of protein, ANS showed weak fluorescence, with a maximum emission at 516 nm. Upon Tm IscU addition (either WT or D40A), the fluorescence increased ∼16-fold and was blue-shifted to 478 nm (Fig. 1). Increasing sodium chloride concentrations resulted in decreased ANS fluorescence in the presence of protein. For example, in 200 mm NaCl, the ANS fluorescence decreased 2-fold. To ensure that a heating step in the purification of Tm IscU (3Mansy S.S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21397-21404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was not responsible for the ANS binding properties of the protein, a His-tagged construct that was not subjected to this heat step was tested and found to have similar ANS binding characteristics. The presence of dithiothreitol did not inhibit fluorescence. As an additional control, human apo- and holoferredoxins were examined for ANS binding. Human ferredoxin is regarded as a typical low molecular mass [2Fe-2S] protein that is not considered a molten globule in the apo or holo state. Under identical solution conditions used for the Tm IscU experiments, ANS fluorescence increased <2-fold in the presence of either human apo- or holoferredoxin and slightly increased with increasing NaCl concentrations. As is commonly observed (28Reddy G.B. Das K.P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4565-4570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Kusmierczyk A.R. Martin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33504-33511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Scatchard plots of ANS-Tm IscU titrations were not linear, indicating multiple ANS-binding sites, with the affinity of the first binding site being ∼1 μm. Near-UV CD—Near-UV CD spectra are sensitive to the protein’s tertiary structure surrounding its aromatic residues. Only fully folded proteins show significant signals within this region, whereas fully unfolded and molten globules do not (30Chaffotte A. Guillou Y. Delepierre M. Hinz H. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8067-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both WT and D40A Tm IscU showed near-UV CD spectra indicative of a stable tertiary fold with minima at 297 and 299 nm and a maximum near 292 nm. These signals were lost in the presence of high concentrations of GdnHCl (Fig. 2). Sodium chloride did not significantly affect the near-UV CD spectra. Dynamic Light Scattering—The measured translational diffusion coefficient (DT) was 8.83 × 10-7 and 8.54 × 10-7 cm2/s for WT and D40A Tm IscU, respectively. Using the Stokes-Einstein equation, the hydrodynamic radius was calculated to be 2.4 ± 0.1 nm for WT Tm IscU and 2.5 ± 0.1 nm for D40A Tm IscU, which is normal for a dimeric protein of the size of Tm IscU and is in agreement with 15N NMR relaxation measurements (17Bertini I. Cowan J.A. Del Bianco C. Luchinat C. Mansy S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 907-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For comparison, the expected hydrodynamic radii of monomeric and dimeric Tm IscU are 2.0 and 2.5 nm, respectively. Sodium chloride did not have a significant effect on the measured DT and consequently did not influence the hydrodynamic radius. The translational diffusion coefficient and the hydrodynamic radius are related to the frictional coefficient of the molecule, which is indicative of the overall shape of the protein in solution. In particular, the ratio of the measured frictional coefficient (f) to that calculated for the smallest rigid sphere capable of accommodating the protein (fsphere) is typically between 1.2 and 1.3 for globular proteins. Values larger than this are observed for non-globular proteins with elongated tertiary folds (31Eisenberg D. Crothers D. Physical Chemistry with Applications to the Life Sciences. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1979: 718-724Google Scholar, 32Schurmann G. Haspel M. Grumet M. Erickson H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 1765-1773Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The f/fsphere for both WT and D40A Tm IscU was 1.2. Free Energy of Unfolding—The unfolding of Tm IscU was achieved by incubation with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and was monitored by CD (Fig. 3). Assuming a two-state mechanism for unfolding, the calculated free energies of unfolding (ΔGD(H2O)) were 3.9 and 5.8 kcal/mol for WT and D40A Tm IscU, respectively. The dependence of the free energy on GdnHCl concentration is often represented by the m value and reflects the amount of polypeptide that is exposed to solvent upon unfolding (33Tanford C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 2050-2059Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 34Schellman J.A. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The m values for WT and D40A Tm IscU were 0.9 and 1.4, respectively.

Both proteins were relatively resistant to protease digestion, with nearly full-length protein fragments persisting for >19 h. After 5 min, the predominant species present was the full-length protein. However, after 15 min, a slightly truncated species appeared that predominated for the duration of the measurements. This fragment spanned Met5 to Pro142, i.e. the full-length protein minus the first four residues. The limited proteolytic digestion of WT and D40A Tm IscU was not identical. For instance, after 30 min, several additional large peptides between 6 and 14 kDa were observed for D40A Tm IscU, but not for WT Tm IscU.

In the present study, two crystal structures of the C domain of rat synapsin I (rSynI-C) in complex with Ca2+ and ATP reveal that this protein can form a tetramer and that a flexible loop (the “multifunctional loop”) contacts bound ATP. Further experiments were carried out on a protein comprising the A, B, and C domains of rat synapsin I (rSynI-ABC). An ATP-stabilized tetramer of rSynI-ABC is observed during velocity sedimentation and size-exclusion chromatographic experiments. These hydrodynamic results also indicate that the A and B domains exist in an extended conformation. Calorimetric measurements of ATP binding to wild-type and mutant rSynI-ABC demonstrate that the multifunctional loop and a cross-tetramer contact are important for ATP binding. The evidence supports a view of synapsin I as an ATP-utilizing, tetrameric protein made up of monomers that have a flexible, extended N terminus.

The synapsins are a family of phosphoproteins that are localized at presynaptic termini of neurons (1Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H-T. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D.

In mammals, synapsins are dynamically associated with the cytosolic surface of synaptic vesicles (4Hosaka M. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 377-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and they are necessary for the proper regulation of neurotransmitter release (5Llinas R. McGuinness C.S.

These proteins are the targets of several kinases that transduce rising second-messenger concentrations into protein phosphorylation (9Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). Synapsins also bind to several neuronal proteins (9Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar), including calmodulin, annexin VI, and cytoskeletal proteins.In vertebrates, there are five known synapsin proteins, termed Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and IIIa. The primary sequences of these proteins have been grouped into eight domains (1Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H-T. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner M.A. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Science. 1989; 245: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). At the N termini, the A domains are about 30 amino acids in length and contain a conserved phosphorylation site that regulates the ability of the synapsins to associate with synaptic vesicles (1Südhof T.C. Czernik A.J. Kao H-T. Takei K. Johnston P.A. Horiuchi A. Kanazir S.D. Wagner M.A. Perin M.S. De Camilli P. Greengard P.

The primary structures of the B domains are variable and contain a disproportional number of proline, glycine, alanine, and serine residues. The well-conserved C domains are the largest of the synapsin domains (∼300 amino acids). The crystal structure of the C domain of bovine synapsin I (bSynI-C) 11 The abbreviations used are: bSynI-C, bovine synapsin I; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); r.m.s., root mean square; VS, velocity sedimentation; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; GSHase, glutathione synthetase; rSynI-ABC, rat synapsin I. 11 The abbreviations used are: bSynI-C, bovine synapsin I; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); r.m.s., root mean square; VS, velocity sedimentation; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; GSHase, glutathione synthetase; rSynI-ABC, rat synapsin I. is known (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The overall fold of this domain places it in a group of proteins called the “ATP-grasp superfamily” (11Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1999; 6: 2639-2643Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of bSynI-C is most similar to that of the ATP-grasp enzyme glutathione synthetase (GSHase). GSHase contains a flexible, catalytically essential loop, called the “multifunctional loop” (12Hibi T. Nishioka T. Kato H. Tanizawa K. Fukui T. Katsube Y. Oda J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 16-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Tanaka T. Nishioka N. Oda J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This loop is disordered in crystal structures of unliganded GSHase, but structures in the presence of ligands show that it can become ordered upon substrate binding (14Hara T. Kato H. Katsube Y. Oda J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11967-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The synapsin C domain also has a multifunctional loop, but it was disordered in crystal structures with and without bound ATPγS (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of synapsins, D-H, are less conserved and sometimes specific to a given gene or isoform.The structure determination of bSynI-C has spurred other studies designed to characterize this domain in more detail. The crystal structure showed a tightly associated dimer of C domains (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that synapsins form multimers in vivo (15Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16747-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that ATP binds tightly to all synapsins; the half-maximal inhibitory constants of ATP competing with bound ATPγS range between 110-450 nm (2Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13371-13374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J.

An intriguing result of the ATP-binding investigations is the role that Ca2+ plays in this process. The ATP-binding activity of synapsin I is enhanced by Ca2+, synapsin II is indifferent to the presence of the cation, and the presence of Ca2+ is refractory to the ATP-binding activity of synapsin III (2Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13371-13374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). No ATPase activity has been detected for a synapsin. Despite this, it has been speculated that synapsins have enzymatic activity, based on their homology to a known class of enzymes (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 16Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and on the observation that the protein binds ADP with less affinity than ATP (16Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In this study, we set out to characterize further the structural aspects of synapsin I. Using x-ray crystallography, we determined the crystal structures at resolutions of 2.1-2.23 Å of the C domain of rat synapsin I (rSynI-C) complexed to a Ca2+ chelate of ATP (Ca·ATP). The structures recapitulate a tetramer of synapsin C monomers that was observed before (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our structures also illustrate that residues from the multifunctional loop contact ATP that is bound to the C domain. Interactions across the tetramer interface appear to stabilize these contacts. Velocity sedimentation and size-exclusion chromatographic experiments on a protein comprised of the A, B, and C domains of rat synapsin I (rSynI-ABC) show that this tetramer exists in vitro and is stabilized by the presence of Ca·ATP. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies on mutant rSynI-ABC proteins demonstrate that the multifunctional loop is critical for the ATP-binding activity of the synapsin C domain, and that the tetramer participates in ATP binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unless noted otherwise, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Corporation.Protein Purification—The plasmid pSynABC (provided by the T. C. Südhof laboratory) expresses a fusion protein comprised of glutathione S-transferase (GST) followed by a thrombin protease site and residues 2-420 of rat synapsin I. The protein was purified essentially as described (17Wang C.R. Esser L Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2264-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with the exception that thrombin was used to cleave the protein from the glutathione-agarose beads. Further purification was performed at 4 °C. rSynI-ABC was dialyzed overnight against buffer GFA (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Amresco)). The dialyzed sample was passed over a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer GFA. Synapsin eluted in the flow-through. Finally, the protein solution was injected onto a Superdex 200 16/60 (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with buffer GFA. Fractions containing rSynI-ABC were pooled and concentrated as needed.Mutagenesis—pSynABC was used as the template for all mutageneses performed in this study. For the mutations W335F, K336R, and D290A, the Gene Editor (Promega) methodology was used, as outlined by the manufacturer. A PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (megaprimer mutagenesis) was utilized to generate the W335A and K336A mutations (18Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Standard methods (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to restrict the PCR product and ligate it into pSynABC that was missing the corresponding wild-type region of DNA. The mutant plasmids were sequenced at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas Biopolymer Facility.Chromatographic Determination of Stokes' Radius—rSynI-ABC was dialyzed against Buffer GFB (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). In cases where ATP was included, the protein was incubated at 4 °C with 120 μm NaATP for 1 h. Proteins were applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 column that had been equilibrated with GFB ± 120 μm NaATP. A280 traces were compared against standard curves (20Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) that had been generated using proteins of known Stokes' radii (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer GFB both in the absence and presence of NaATP. Values for the positions of the peaks and their integrated areas were calculated with the evaluation software included with the Äkta system (Amersham Biosciences).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Apparent association constants for ATP binding to rSynI-ABC were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A solution of rSynI-ABC was dialyzed for 2 days against ITC buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 μm CaCl2). ATP was dissolved in the same dialysis buffer used to equilibrate the protein. The concentrations of both protein and ligand were calculated using Beer's Law, c = A/ϵl, where c is the concentration, A is the absorbance (at 280 nm for the protein and 260 nm for ATP), and ϵ is the extinction coefficient. The literature ϵ for ATP was used, and the ϵ for rSynI-ABC was derived empirically (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Starting concentrations for the proteins ranged between 12 and 32 μm. The experiment consisted of a series of injections of 8 μl of the ATP solution ([ATP] = 180-600 μm) into a cell containing 1.4 ml of the protein solution equilibrated at 20 °C. In most cases, some precipitation occurred during the titration. However, several samples were centrifuged and filtered after the titration was complete, and the precipitate comprised less than 10% of the total protein. Heats associated with ATP binding were measured by a Microcal isothermal titration calorimeter (model VP-ITC). Apparent association constants derived from these data were calculated using software included with the calorimeter (Microcal ORIGIN).Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Velocity sedimentation studies were carried out at the Analytical Ultracentrifugation Core Facility at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Purified rSynI-ABC was extensively dialyzed versus buffer GFB. rSynI-ABC samples at concentrations of 12.3 and 4.9 μm were centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman Model XL-I ultracentrifuge at 40,000 rpm. When ATP was included, its concentration was 120 μm and it was incubated at 4 °C with the protein for at least 1 h prior to centrifugation. The distribution of protein in the cells was monitored using absorption optics. Data were analyzed using the program DCDT+, which uses a plot of -dc/dt versus s* to derive the sedimentation coefficient, s, and the diffusion coefficient, D (22Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When molecular masses were estimated from these plots, the number of scans was strictly limited to obey the “rule of thumb” for Δ(ω2t) proposed by W. F. Stafford (www.bbri.org/faculty/stafford/dcdt/Rule_of_thumb.html). s0 values were derived by assembling a plot of s versus protein concentration and extrapolating to infinite dilution. The values of s0 were converted to s20,w0 by multiplying s0 by the following conversion factor shown in Equation 1, s20,w0/s0=(1-(V¯2)20,wρ20,w)(η4,b)/(1-(V¯2)4,bρ4,b)(η20,w)(Eq. 1) where (V̄2) denotes partial specific volume, ρ is solution density, and η is solution viscosity calculated under conditions of either water as the solvent at 20 °C (subscript “20,w”), or of buffer as the solvent at 4 °C (subscript “4,b”). Nonstandard values for V̄2, ρ, and η were calculated using SEDNTERP (www.rasmb.bbri.org). The minimum expected frictional coefficient, fmin, was calculated using Equation 2, fmin=6πη((3Mk(V¯2)/4πNA)1/3)(Eq. 2) where Mk is the known mass of the protein and NA is Avogadro's number. The experimental frictional coefficient, f, was calculated using the relationship in Equation 3. f=Mk(1-(V¯2))/s20,w0NA(Eq. 3) The formula used to calculate Stokes' radius (rS) is in Equation 4. rS=f/6πη20,w(Eq. 4) The sedimentation data were also analyzed with the program Sedfit (24Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Continuous c(s) and c(M) distributions were examined, and s4,b and M values were taken to be the weighted average of the peaks in these distributions, respectively. s20,w0 values derived from these analyses were computed as outlined above.Mass Spectrometry—Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out using standard protocols at the Biopolymers Facility of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.Crystallization and Structure Determination—One hour prior to mixing with precipitant, rSynI-ABC (7.5 mg/ml) was incubated on ice with 10 mm Ca·ATP. Crystallization was carried out using the vapor diffusion methodology by mixing a 1-μl drop of rSynI-ABC/Ca·ATP with 1 μl of reservoir solution, (150 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15-20% (w/v) PEGMME 5000 (Fluka), and 300 mm NaCl), then hanging this drop over 1 ml of the reservoir. Crystallization was accomplished at 26 °C and usually occurred in one to 3 weeks. During the course of crystallization, the protein was partially proteolyzed such that the major product in the crystals was rSynI-C. Four crystal forms were obtained, and this report describes two of them. One occurs in space group P6522, and the other in space group P1. The crystals were stabilized by transferring them to fresh well solution, and were subsequently cryostabilized by transferring them serially to solutions containing the same buffer plus increasing amounts of ethylene glycol. Prior to cooling, the final concentration of ethylene glycol was 20% (v/v). Crystals were flash cooled in liquid propane, and the propane was then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID at the Argonne National Laboratories Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) beamline F1, and National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) beamline X4A. An Argonne CCD detector was used at APS, and Quantum 4 CCD detectors (ADSC) were used at CHESS and NSLS. Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38346) Google Scholar). Two structures of rSynI-C were determined by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (26Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). For the P6522 data, a single molecule of bovine synapsin I C was used as the search model. Two molecules were located in the asymmetric unit. For the P1 data, a tightly associated dimer of bSynI-C was used as the search model, and the asymmetric unit contained four such dimers. The models were adjusted using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar) and XtalView (28McRee D.E.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSStructural Overview of rSynI-C—We used molecular replacement to determine the structures of two crystal forms of rSynI-C complexed to a Ca2+ chelate of ATP (Fig. 1a and Table I). Although covalently intact rSynI-ABC was used in the crystallization experiments, the A and B domains were largely absent owing to proteolysis (data not shown). Crystals containing intact rSynI-ABC have been obtained; electron-density maps calculated using diffraction data from such crystals do not betray the presence of the A or B domains (data not shown). The protease sensitivity and lack of electron density of the A and B domains indicate that these domains are probably flexible and disordered under our crystallization conditions. The first crystal form of rSynI-C has the symmetry of space group P6522, with two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The second has the symmetry of space group P1, and eight monomers are found in the asymmetric unit. Thus, in our two crystal forms, we observed ten crystallographically independent monomers. The structures of rSynI-C and bSynI-C are very similar (Fig. 1b). Pairwise comparisons of the Cα atoms of the aforementioned ten rat C domains to those of two known bovine C domains (PDB accession code 1AUX) show r.m.s. deviations between the structures of 0.6 Å or less. This likeness is expected, as the primary structures of the domains differ by only four amino acids.In both of our rSynI-C structures, we observe nearly identical tetramers made up of four monomers (Fig. 1c). In the P6522 form, the asymmetric unit contains a previously described C-domain dimer (Ref. 10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar; e.g. the yellow and green monomers of Fig. 1c), and two dimers interact across a crystallographic 2-fold axis to form the tetramer. In the P1 form, four dimers exist in the asymmetric unit, and local pseudo-2-fold axes relate them, forming two of these tetramers. The dimers bury an additional 4010 Å2 of surface area (2005 Å2 per dimer) upon tetramerization. The total buried surface area of the tetramer is about 11,150 Å2. The most extensive interface between the two dimers is formed by packing the α4 helices of one dimer against the phosphate-binding loops of the other, and vice versa (Fig. 1, a and c). This oligomer was also observed in the bSynI-C structure (10Esser L. Wang C-R. Hosaka M. Smagula C.S. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and in other rSynI-C structures not presented in this paper (data not shown). The residues that form the tetramer interface are well conserved across all three isoforms of rat synapsin I (Fig. 2a). We therefore expect that all rat synapsin C domains can assemble in a similar tetrameric arrangement. The conservation of a key cross-tetramer contact (discussed below) across all known synapsin C domains implies that the tetramer is present in all synapsin-harboring species (Fig. 2b). A similar quaternary arrangement is observed in the tetrameric ATP-grasp enzyme GSHase (Fig. 1d).Fig. 2Multiple sequence alignments of synapsin C domains. a, conservation of the tetramer contacts in the rat synapsin C domains.

Our ten observed monomers exhibit electron density for between two and all fourteen residues of the loop (Fig. 3a). Differing local environments of the ten monomers in the crystalline lattice probably account for the differential ordering of the loop. The multifunctional loop contacts the bound ATP at portions of the nucleotide that were solvent-exposed in the bovine structure. The observed disposition of the loop makes the bound ATP essentially solvent-inaccessible (Figs. 3, b and c). Because this conformation of the loop would impede access to the AT-binding site, it is likely that it adopts"
https://openalex.org/W2016463445,"Previous studies have shown that the endosomal apparatus plays an important role in insulin signaling. Inhibition of endosomal acidification leads to a decrease in insulin-insulin receptor kinase (IRK) dissociation and insulin degradation. Thus, vacuolar pH could function as a modulator of insulin signaling in endosomes. In the present study we show that in primary hepatocytes pretreated with bafilomycin, there is an inhibition of vacuolar acidification. Incubation of these cells with insulin was followed by an augmentation of IRK activity but an inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activity and a decrease in insulin-induced DNA and glycogen synthesis. Bafilomycin treatment inhibited IRK recycling to the plasma membrane without affecting IRK internalization. Impaired IRK recycling correlated with a decrease in insulin signaling. We suggest that inhibiting vacuolar acidification sequesters activated IRKs in an intracellular compartment(s) where signaling is inhibited. This implies that endosomal receptor trafficking plays a role in regulating signal transduction. Previous studies have shown that the endosomal apparatus plays an important role in insulin signaling.

Although a proportion of IRK is targeted to lysosomes for degradation, most internalized IRK recycles to the plasma membrane (PM) (2Marshall S. J. Biol.

Various studies have shown that signaling by growth factors and hormones, including insulin, occurs at both the cell surface and in endosomes (4Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) has been shown to yield substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and signal transduction. It follows that the extent and duration of cell signaling is subject to modulation by endosomal processes (3Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Posner B.I. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 2003; 4: 430-434PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the endosomal IRK is dephosphorylated by an associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase (3Drake P.G. Posner B.I. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reduced intraendosomal pH (pH ≤ 6) promotes dissociation of internalized insulin-IRK complexes and degradation of insulin (10Hamel F.G. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Frank B.H.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9437-9446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The acidic pH of endosomes also effects a conformation-dependent inactivation of the IRK (13Contreres J.O. Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22007-22013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the acidic pH of the endocytic compartment and the IRK-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase(s) therein play fundamental roles in attenuating insulin signaling.Weak bases, proton ionophores, and inhibitors of vacuolar ATPases have been used to study the role of acidification in physiological processes (14Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Drose S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In liver, chloroquine (a weak base) accumulates in hepatic endosomes leading to the inhibition of both the dissociation of insulin-IRK complexes and insulin degradation (16Posner B.I. Patel B.A. Khan M.N. Bergeron J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5789-5799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Levy J.R. Olefsky J.M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggests that inhibitors of vacuolar acidification would potentiate insulin signaling from the endosomal compartment, and there are studies consistent with this view. Thus, in rats, chloroquine treatment augmented and prolonged IRK activity in hepatic endosomes (19Bevan A.P. Krook A. Tikerpae J. Seabright P.J. Siddle K. Smith G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26833-26840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Further, the administration of chloroquine to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus decreased fasting plasma glucose levels, improved glucose tolerance, and increased plasma insulin levels (20Smith G.D. Amos T.A. Mahler R. Peters T.J. Br. Med. J. 1987; 294: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Powrie J.K. Smith G.D. Shojaee-Moradie F. Sonksen P.H. Jones R.H. Am. J.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the effects of chloroquine in these patients are associated exclusively with improved insulin sensitivity as opposed to an increase in plasma insulin levels. In contrast, a previous study in adipocytes showed that chloroquine inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the PM (23Romanek R. Sargeant R. Paquet M.R. Gluck S. Klip A. Grinstein S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In view of the importance of this issue to an understanding of insulin signaling and potentially insulin resistance and in view of the above-noted discrepancies, we examined the role of vacuolar acidification on insulin signaling in primary rat hepatocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Porcine insulin (24.5 units/mg) was a gift from Lilly Research Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN).

Subconfluent cultures were prepared by seeding 1 × 106 cells, onto 9.6-cm2 six-well plates (Corning, Costar, Cambridge, MA) or 5 × 106 cells, onto 78-cm2 culture dishes (Starstedt Canada, St. Laurent, Canada). The cells were bathed for 24 h in seeding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaHCO3, 500 IU/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin) and then for 48 h in serum-free medium that differed from the seeding medium in that it lacked fetal bovine serum and contained 1.25 μg/ml fungizone, 0.4 mm ornithine, 2.25 μg/ml l-lactic acid, 2.5 × 10-8m selenium, and 1 × 10-8m ethanolamine. Serum-free medium was renewed before the addition of [3H]thymidine, insulin, and bafilomycin.Glycogen Synthesis—Glycogen synthesis was determined by incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen as previously described (26Urso B. Cope D.L. Kalloo-Hosein H.E. Hayward A.C. Whitehead J.P. O'Rahilly S. Siddle K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30864-30873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hepatocytes (1×106 cells) were serum-deprived for 4 h and incubated for 2 h in serum-free medium containing 15 mm [U-14C]glucose in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1 (100 nm) and insulin (100 nm). Incubations were stopped by three rapid washes with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH. The samples were then boiled in the presence of 2 mg of carrier glycogen and precipitated overnight in 70% ethanol at -20 °C. After centrifugation, the precipitated glycogen was resuspended in 500 μl of water and incubated for 5 min at 70 °C. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting as previously described (27Mounier C. Lavoie L. Dumas V. Mohammad-Ali K. Wu J. Nantel A. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Posner B.I. Mol.

Thymidine (5 μCi/ml), insulin, and bafilomycin A1 were added to cells as described in the figure legends. After an 18-h incubation, the cells were rinsed twice with 3 ml of cold PBS, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized at room temperature in 1 ml of 1 n NaOH, and then transferred to scintillation vials for counting of 3H in an LKB liquid scintillation counter as described before (24Band C.J. Mounier C. Posner B.I. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5626-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Preparation of Cell Lysates—Primary rat hepatocytes were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined in the resulting supernatant.PI 3-Kinase Activity—Phosphotyrosine proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an αPY antibody. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed, and the protein A-Sepharose pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol and assayed for PI 3-kinase activity as previously described (28Band C.J.

Exogenous tyrosine kinase activity was determined using poly(Glu:Tyr::4:1) as substrate (25Burgess J.W. Wada I. Ling N. Khan M.N. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol.

Caro L.H. Hindman N. Taylor S.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of bafilomycin and insulin as noted in figure legends. Thereafter, hepatocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ (PBS with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), and cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubation with 0.5 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+ for 30 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing the dishes three times with PBS-Ca2+-Mg2+containing 15 mm of glycine. After biotinylation, the cell lysates were prepared as described above, and IRK was immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the α-subunit of the IRK. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in the presence of Laemmli buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with α960 or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Streptavidin binds to biotinylated proteins, allowing only the detection of IRK associated with the PM.Immunofluorescence—Acidic compartments in primary hepatocytes were visualized by immunofluorescence with the DAMP method as indicated by the manufacturer (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI). Briefly, the primary hepatocytes were incubated with DAMP (30 μm) for 30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and permeabilized by incubation with 0.5% Triton X-100. The fixed hepatocytes were incubated with a monoclonal anti-DNP antibody for 60 min and subsequently washed to remove unbound IgG. The cells were then incubated for 60 min with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine and viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert 135 confocal microscope. Photographs were taken using a Zeiss LSM microsystem.Preparation of Endosomes—Primary hepatocytes from seven culture dishes (78 cm2) were homogenized in 12 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Mg2Cl, 2 mm NaF, and 2 mm orthovanadate). The endosomes were prepared as previously described (1Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSBafilomycin is a macrolide antibiotic that, at concentrations up to 1 μm, specifically inhibits vacuolar ATPases without the side effects induced by proton ionophores and weak bases (15Drose S. Altendorf K. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In this study we use bafilomycin to evaluate the effect of inhibiting vacuolar acidification on insulin signaling.Effect of Bafilomycin on Vacuolar Acidification and Trafficking of IRK—First, we confirmed that bafilomycin inhibits vacuolar acidification by incubating primary hepatocytes with DAMP, a compound that accumulates in acidic vesicles. On performing this incubation, DAMP, detected by immunofluorescence (see “Experimental Procedures”), was found in granular structures in the presence or absence of insulin (Fig. 1, top panels). Preincubation with bafilomycin (100 nm for 30 min) abolished the granular fluorescence almost completely (Fig. 1, bottom panels), indicating that bafilomycin inhibited vacuolar acidification in primary hepatocytes.Previous work has shown that inhibition of vacuolar acidification interferes with receptor recycling (31Desbuquois B. Lopez S. Janicot M. Burlet H. de Galle B. Fouque F. Diabete. Metab. 1992; 18: 104-112PubMed Google Scholar, 32Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We used cell surface biotinylation to assess the effect of bafilomycin on insulin-induced IRK internalization and recycling to the cell surface. Hepatocytes were preincubated with insulin (100 nm) in the presence or absence of bafilomycin, and cell surface proteins were subsequently labeled with Sulfo-Biotin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were lysed, the IRKs were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and both total and PM-associated IRKs were detected by immunoblotting with α960 and streptavidin, respectively. It can be seen that bafilomycin did not inhibit insulin-induced IRK internalization (Fig. 2a). Consistent with this was our observation that, following 15 min of incubation with insulin, the increase in the level of IRK in a crude endosomal preparation from hepatocytes was not significantly affected by bafilomycin (analysis by Student's t test, p > 0.05; data not shown).Fig. 2Inhibition by bafilomycin of IRK recycling but not internalization. a, IRK internalization: Primary hepatocytes were incubated with or without bafilomycin (Bafilo, 100 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of insulin (100 nm) for the indicated times. The cell surface proteins were biotinylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were then lysed, and IRK was immunoprecipitated from these lysates using an antibody to the α-subunit of IRK. The immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes that were probed with an anti-IRK antibody (α960) or with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Strept) for detection of the total amount of IRK or PM-associated IRK, respectively. To assess specificity of immunoprecipitation, control samples were immunoprecipitated (IP) with normal IgG. The depicted experiment is one of three similar ones. b, IRK recycling. Hepatocytes were incubated with or without bafilomycin (100 nm) as above. Insulin (100 nm) or buffer was added for an additional 10 min to allow internalization of the IRK. The cells were subsequently washed three times with serum-free medium and incubated for an additional 10 min in the absence of insulin to permit recycling of IRK to the PM. The cell surface proteins were biotinylated, and total IRK and PM-associated IRK were determined as indicated above.

In control cells most internalized IRK recycled to the PM in the absence of ambient insulin, whereas in cells incubated with bafilomycin recycling of IRK to the PM was strikingly inhibited (Fig. 2b).Effect of Bafilomycin on Insulin Action in Primary Hepatocytes—To determine the effect of bafilomycin on insulin action, we measured the effect of insulin on thymidine incorporation and glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes incubated with or without bafilomycin. As is evident in Fig. 3, bafilomycin significantly inhibited the effect of insulin on both thymidine incorporation and glycogen synthesis by 40 and 60%, respectively.Fig. 3Bafilomycin inhibits insulin-stimulated DNA and glycogen synthesis. a, serum-starved hepatocytes were incubated with 5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 18 h at 37 °C in presence or absence of bafilomycin (100 nm) and insulin (100 nm). Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. #, p < 0.05 (versus insulin alone). b, serum-starved hepatocytes were incubated with 15 mm [U-14C] glucose for 2 h at 37 °C in presence or absence of bafilomycin (100 nm) and insulin (100 nm). Glycogen synthesis was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.01 (versus insulin alone).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bafilomycin and IRK Activation—We next sought to determine whether the inhibitory effect of bafilomycin on thymidine incorporation and glycogen synthesis corresponded to an impairment in insulin signaling. Pretreatment of hepatocytes with bafilomycin did not modify insulin-induced augmentation of IRK phosphotyrosine content at 2 or 15 min after insulin (Fig. 4a). However, preincubation with bafilomycin did augment IRK activity significantly at 15 but not 2 min following insulin (Fig. 4b). We conclude that bafilomycin pretreatment results in an increase in IRK activity without a proportional increase in IRK phosphotyrosine content (Fig. 4c). In previous work we showed that endosomal IRK is inactivated consequent to a conformational change induced by acidic pH (13Contreres J.O. Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22007-22013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, neutralizing vacuolar pH with bafilomycin could suppress this acidification-dependent conformational change leading to increased IRK activity. This might explain the lack of correlation between IRK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation following bafilomycin treatment.Fig. 4Bafilomycin increases insulin-induced IRK activity. Hepatocytes were treated with (○) or without (•) bafilomycin (100 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Insulin (100 nm) or buffer was then added for an additional 2 or 15 min. IRK was subsequently partially purified from lysates using wheat germ agglutinin columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, aliquots of wheat germ agglutinin-purified IRK were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The level of IRK tyrosine phosphorylation and IRK content were determined by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against phosphotyrosine proteins (αPY) and IRK (α960), respectively. To quantitate the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRK, the β-subunit bands of IRK and their phosphotyrosine content were determined by scanning densitometry and expressed as a PY/IRK ratio. Each point is the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. b, IRK tyrosine kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate (poly[Glu:Tyr::4:1]) was assessed in aliquots eluted from wheat germ agglutinin columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinase activity is expressed per IRK content. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. *, p < 0.001 (versus 15 min insulin). c, IRK kinase activity is expressed per IRK phosphotyrosine content. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. #, p < 0.01 (versus 15 min insulin). PY, phosphotyrosine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Bafilomycin and Downstream Signaling Events—We investigated the effect of bafilomycin on insulin-induced downstream signaling events. Hepatocytes were pretreated with or without bafilomycin, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS1 and IRS2 was assessed at 2 and 15 min after insulin. Bafilomycin had no effect on insulin-augmented IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5a, left panel) but significantly inhibited IRS2 phosphorylation by 35% (p < 0.005 versus insulin alone) in hepatocytes stimulated with insulin for 15 min (Fig. 5a, right panel).Fig. 5Bafilomycin inhibits insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2 but not its association with p85. Primary hepatocytes were treated with bafilomycin (100 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by insulin (100 nm) or buffer for 2 or 15 min. IRS1 and IRS2 were immunoprecipitated (IP) from lysates (1 mg of protein) with specific antibodies bound to protein-A. The immunoprecipitates were washed, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The level of phosphotyrosine (a) and p85 (b) associated with IRS1 and IRS2 were determined by immunoblotting with αPY and αp85, respectively. A representative immunoblot at the top of each bar graph is shown. The results are the means ± S.E. of three to five separate experiments. *, p < 0.005 (versus 15 min of insulin). PY, phosphotyrosine; WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In response to insulin, tyrosine phosphorylated IRS1 and IRS2 bind p85 (a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase), leading to the activation of PI 3-kinase. We thus assessed the effect of bafilomycin pretreatment on the extent of association of p85 with IRS1 and IRS2 following insulin treatment. As seen in Fig. 5b, incubation of hepatocytes with insulin stimulated the association of p85 with both IRS1 and IRS2 immunoprecipitates. Pretreatment with bafilomycin had no effect on the extent of the insulin-induced association (Fig. 5b). We then determined whether insulin-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase associated with IRS1 or IRS2 is affected by bafilomycin. As seen in Fig. 6a, bafilomycin had no effect on PI 3-kinase activation assessed in anti-IRS1 and -IRS2 immunoprecipitates at 2 min but reduced this activity by 80% in anti-IRS2 immunoprecipitates at 15 min following incubation with insulin. Next we investigated the impact of reduced IRS2 associated PI 3-kinase activity on the total activity. Bafilomycin had no effect on PI 3-kinase activation assessed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates at 2 min but reduced this activity significantly by 60% at 15 min (p < 0.01 versus insulin alone) following incubation with insulin. As seen in Fig. 6c, a broad band at 160–180 kDa represents the main phosphotyrosine protein co-immunoprecipitated with p85 in response to insulin. Previous studies in hepatocytes have shown that this band corresponds almost exclusively to IRS1 and IRS2 (33Rother K.I. Imai Y. Caruso M. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Accili D. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1968027631,"In the present study, it was found that tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-R2 protein expression did not correlate with mRNA expression in melanoma cell lines. In particular, early passage primary cultures from patients had low TRAIL-R2 protein expression compared with later passage cultures although TRAIL-R2 mRNA expression was similar in early and late passages. Similarly, cell lines made resistant to TRAIL by cultures in TRAIL had low TRAIL-R2 protein expression but normal levels of mRNA for TRAIL-R2. Expression from a luciferase reporter gene construct with the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) (but not the 5′-UTR) of TRAIL-R2 was suppressed when transfected into the TRAIL-selected (resistant) melanoma lines compared with that seen in the parental (sensitive) lines. Similar results were seen in early passage (resistant) cultures compared with late passage (sensitive) primary melanoma cultures. RNA gel shift assays demonstrated protein(s) binding to the 3′-UTR of TRAIL-R2 mRNA that were more evident in TRAIL-resistant cultures with low TRAIL-R2 protein expression. A 23-base fragment of the 3′-UTR inhibited binding of the proteins to the 3′-UTR, and a probe using this fragment bound to proteins in TRAIL-selected melanoma lines and early passage isolates of melanoma. Binding of the 3′-UTR probe to the cytosolic protein(s) was induced by exposure to TRAIL and was lost from the TRAIL selected lines 2–3 days after withdrawal of TRAIL from the cultures. These results are consistent with post-transcriptional regulation of TRAIL-R2 expression by cytosolic proteins induced by TRAIL that bind to the 3′-UTR region of TRAIL-R2 mRNA.

Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Normal human liver cells were reported to be sensitive to TRAIL, but this is believed to be due to the particular form of TRAIL used in those studies (10Jo M. Kim T.-H. Seol D.-W. Esplen J.E. Dorko K. Billiar T.R. Strom S.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis by TRAIL is believed to be mediated by interaction with two death receptors on cells referred to as TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 (see review in Ref. 3Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar for alternate nomenclature). Normal cells were postulated to be protected from TRAIL-induced apoptosis by their expression of TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4, which lack cytoplasmic death domains and act to sequester TRAIL (decoy receptors) or to mediate antiapoptotic signals (6Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gura T. Science. 1997; 277: 768Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TRAIL was able to induce varying degrees of apoptosis in approximately two-thirds of the melanoma cell lines tested (4Thomas W.D. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2195-2200PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity of melanoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis showed an overall correlation with the level of death receptors, and in particular TRAIL-R2 expression, but did not correlate with the level of expression of the decoy receptors, TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 (5Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar). Resistance of some cell lines to TRAIL was due to the absence of all receptors for TRAIL. Exposure of melanoma cells to TRAIL resulted in down-regulation of death receptors due to internalization in endosomes, and re-expression was from the trans-Golgi network. In contrast, the decoy receptors were located in the nucleus and underwent relocation to cytosol and cell membranes due to signals from the death receptors (13Zhang X.D. Franco A.V. Nguyen T. Gray C.P. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3961-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Factors that determine the level of TRAIL-R expression are not well understood. In some cell types, chemotherapy and irradiation was shown to up-regulate TRAIL-R2 expression by activation of p53 (14Sheikh M.S. Burns T.F. Huang Y. Wu G.S. Amundson S. Brooks K.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. el-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in others, p53-independent mechanisms were involved (15Meng R.D. el-Deiry W.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 by dexamethasone and interferon-gamma was independent of p53 (15Meng R.D. el-Deiry W.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R3 (DcR1) appeared to be also regulated by p53 (16Guan B. Yue P. Lotan R. Sun S.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3121-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1509-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The DNA binding sites for p53 were found to be located at three sites in the genomic locus of TRAIL-R2, either upstream of the ATG site or within intron 1 or intron 2 (18Takimoto R. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1735-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the TRAIL-R2 gene was found to have transcription start sites 122 and 137 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. Two Sp1 sites were responsible for the basal transcriptional activity (19Yoshida T. Maeda A. Tani N. Sakai T. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and it was speculated that agents binding to the Sp1 sites (such as certain histone deacetylase inhibitors) may up-regulate TRAIL-R2 expression. The promoter region for TRAIL-R1 (DR4) contained several AP-1 binding sites, which is a target for the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway that can be activated by several chemotherapeutic agents (20Guan B. Yue P. Clayman G.L. Sun S.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition to the variability of TRAIL-R2 expression between different melanoma lines, we reported that primary cultures established from patients commonly have low TRAIL death receptor expression but on successive culture passages acquire higher expression levels of TRAIL-R2 and sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis comparable with that seen in established lines (21Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 966-973Google Scholar). We also found that exposure to TRAIL over several weeks resulted in down-regulation of TRAIL receptors and that re-expression occurred over several weeks in the absence of TRAIL. These are referred to as TRAIL-selected resistant cells (21Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 966-973Google Scholar). The basis for down-regulation of TRAIL-R2 in the latter cell lines and in primary cultures is unknown, but we hypothesized that it may be due to transcriptional down-regulation of TRAIL-R2. To answer these questions, we examined TRAIL-R2 mRNA expression by real time PCR and correlated this with TRAIL-R2 protein expression. The results suggest that post-transcriptional events may be more important than transcriptional events in regulation of TRAIL-R2 expression. Cell Lines—Human melanoma cell lines Me4405, Mel-FH, Mel-RM, Mel-CV, MM200, Me1007, Mel-RMu, IgR3, Mel-LT, Mel-AT, Me10538, and SK-Mel-28 have been described previously (4Thomas W.D. Hersey P. J.

The TRAIL-selected lines of Mel-FH, Mel-RM, and MM200 are described elsewhere (21Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 966-973Google Scholar). The cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Melbourne, Australia). Antibodies, Recombinant Proteins, and Other Reagents—Recombinant human TRAIL (lot 6321-19) was supplied by Immunex (Seattle, WA). The preparation was supplied as a leucine zipper fusion protein, which required no further cross-linking for maximal activity. The monoclonal antibodies against TRAIL-R1 (IgG2a hu TR1-M271; lot 7136-07), TRAIL-R2 (IgG1 hu TRAIL-R2-M413; lot 5274-96), TRAIL-R3 (IgG1 hu TR3-M430; lot 7313-217), and TRAIL-R4 (IgG1 hu TR4-M444; lot 7136-15) were supplied by Immunex and have been described previously (22Griffith T.S. Rauch C. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Lynch D.H. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2597-2605PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Analysis was carried out using a Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, CA) FACScan flow cytometer, as described previously (5Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of antigen-positive cells was calculated as the difference in positive area between the positive and negative control histograms. The positive area was that to the right of the intersection of the two curves (23Sharrow C.O. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 5.2.1-5.2.2Google Scholar). Apoptosis—Apoptotic cells were determined by the propidium iodide method described elsewhere (4Thomas W.D. Hersey P. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2195-2200PubMed Google Scholar, 5Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, apoptosis was measured by staining with PE-conjugated annexin V according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells with or without pretreatment with TRAIL were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in binding buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One hundred μl of the resulting solution (1 × 105 cells) were transferred to a 5-ml culture tube, and 5 μl of annexin V-PE was added. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min in the dark, an additional 400 μl of binding buffer was added to each tube, and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A total volume of 25 μl was used, made up of 5-μl aliquots of the following: cDNA sample (0.2 μg/ml); 300 nm TRAIL R2 forward primer (CGCTGCACCAGGTGTGATT); 300 nm TRAIL R2 reverse primer (GTGCCTTCTTCGCACTGACA); TRAIL R2 probe (6-carboxyfluorescein-CCCTGCACCACGACCAGAAACACAG-6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine) (Sigma); and 9 mm MgCl2 (Brilliant QPCR Kit; Integrated Sciences, Willoughby, New South Wales, Australia). The same samples were analyzed simultaneously for their β-actin content using β-actin forward primer (CTCGCAGCTCACCATGGAT), β-actin reverse primer (ATGCCGGAGCCGTTGTC), and β-actin probe (6-carboxyfluorescein-TGATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGT-6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine). PCR was performed using the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C; 10 min at 95 °C; 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, 40 cycles. The threshold cycle values (Ct), a fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold, for TRAIL R2 expression were taken and subtracted from the Ct for β-actin expression level from the same individual sample (= ΔCT). These were then subtracted from the ΔCT of the control sample in each assay (= ΔΔCT). Relative abundance was then calculated as 2-ΔΔCT. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated three times. These methods are as described in User Bulletin 2 (1997) of Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7700 detection systems. RNA Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Total RNA was extracted from melanoma cell lines with the spin or vacuum total RNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). The 5′ and 3′ RACEs were processed according to protocol of First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, for 5′ RACE, total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove free 5′-phosphates from molecules such as ribosomal RNA, fragmented mRNA, tRNA, and contaminating genomic DNA. The RNA is then treated with tobacco acid pyrophophosphatase to remove the cap structure from full-length mRNA to produce a 5′-monophosphate end. A 45-base RNA adapter containing two forward primer sequences (see the protocol supplied by the manufacturer) is ligated to the RNA population using T4 RNA ligase. A random primer reverse transcriptase-PCR and a nested PCR then amplified the 5′-end of the specific RNA. Two reverse primers for the nested PCR are GGAGATGCAATCTCTACCGTCTTC (outer reverse primer) and TTGGGTGATCAGAGCAGACTCA (inner reverse primer). For 3′ RACE, the first strand cDNA was synthesized from above total RNA using a supplied 3′-end adapter containing two reverse primer sequences (as per the protocol supplied by the manufacturer). Sequentially, nested PCR was processed to the resulting cDNA with other two primers, which were specific to the R2 3′-end. The two forward nesting primers are GTGGCTGTGTTTGTTTGCAA (outer primer) and GACAGAAGCTCACAACGA (inner primer). Plasmid Construction—The above RACE products were purified with QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Pty. Ltd.) and directly ligated into a T-tailed vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) to form constructs of pGEM-T-5′-end and pGEM-T-3′-end. The inserts of 3′- and 5′-ends of TRAIL-R2 were verified by sequencing with the above primers without restriction enzyme sequences. For assay of luciferase expression, the firefly luciferase vector pGL3-promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) was digested with HindIII and NcoI, which allowed the 5′-UTR to be inserted immediately downstream of the SV40 promoter in order to produce the luciferase mRNA with TRAIL-R2 5′-UTR. The inserts of 5′-UTR were produced by PCR with a primer pair of TGGGCGAAGCTTGCGTTTGCTGGGTTTGAT (containing HindIII) and GTTGTCCATGGGCGGTGGGAAGGCTCTTAT (containing NcoI) and the above pGEM-T-5′-end as a template. The above insert was ligated into the linearized pGL3-promoter to form pGL3–5′-UTR. Similarly, the 3′-UTR and 3′-UTR-invert inserts were cloned by PCR with pGEM-T-3′-end as a template but with invert restriction sites. Then TRAIL-R2 3′-UTR and 3′-UTR-invert were ligated to the position of the deleted 3′-UTR and poly(A) (from 1934 to 2196) of the luciferase gene of pGL3-promoter by digestion with restriction enzymes of XbaI and BamHI, and thus pGL3–3′-UTR and pGL3-R2-invert were formed. Primers used were as follows: 3′-UTR forward primer (containing SpeI), GAAGCACTAGTTTGAGGACCACTTGTTGAGC; 3′-UTR reverse primer (containing BamHI), CGCGGATCCGCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGA; 3′-UTR-invert forward primer (containing BamHI), GAAGCGGATCCTTGAGGACCACTTGTTGAGC; 3′-UTR-invert reverse primer (containing SpeI), TGGATATCTAGAGCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGA. The AU-rich element (ARE) insert was synthesized commercially (Sigma). Sense and antisense sequences were annealed by heating at 95 °C and cooled down to room temperature in annealing buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl) in 1 h. The formed double strand DNA was ligated into the 3′-UTR and poly(A)-deleted pGL3-promoter as above. The mutant ARE (M-ARE) and mutant 3′-UTR (M-3′-UTR) inserts were created by the same methods except that Ts in the ARE region were changed into Cs. All of the above inserts in the pGL3-promoter were verified by sequencing with the above primers. The above 3′-UTR and ARE inserts were also cloned into pGEM-T and pcDNA3 as above for the purpose of synthesis of the mRNA probe and transfection to Mel-RM. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—The firefly luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected in melanoma cells with Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-SV40 vector. Two million melanoma cells were electroporated with 30 μg of each vector. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were analyzed by the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia). Briefly, the cells were harvested with passive lysis buffer. The assays for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially in a Lumat LB 9501/16 luminometer (Bertold, Germany) after adding their substrates. The relative light units from firefly vectors were normalized with those from the Renilla vector according to the manufacturer’s (Promega, Annandale, New South Wales, Australia) instructions. Preparation of 32P-Labeled RNA Probes—Transcription in vitro was performed in a reaction mix containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm each ATP, GTP, and CTP, 12 μm UTP, 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (10 μCi/μl), 1 μg of plasma DNA (pGEM-T-3UTR or pGEM-T-5UTR), and 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase using Riboprobe In Vitro Transcription Systems (Promega, Annandale, Australia). An irrelevant Escherichia coli cRNA was used for a negative control, and unlabeled competitor cRNA synthesized under the same conditions was used as a specificity control. The size and integrity of cRNA transcript was verified by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea. Preparation of Cytoplasmic Extracts (S-100 Fraction)—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Mel-FH, Mel-FH-select, Mel-RM, and Mel-RM-select cells using a protocol modified from Ref. 24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar. Briefly, the cells were collected by a scraper from three 175-cm2 flasks, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and resuspended in two packed volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of other proteinase inhibitors (Protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science)) at 4 °C, lysed on ice by 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min in a bench microcentrifuge. The crude cytoplasmic extracts were mixed with 0.11 volume of buffer B (0.3 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.4 m KCl, and 0.0 m MgCl2) at 4 °C and centrifuged for 60 min at 80,000 at 4 °C using a SW 50.1 rotor in a Backman XL-90 ultracentrifuge. The high speed supernatants were dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The supernatant was recovered and stored at -80 °C after the concentration was measured by the Bradford assay method (Bio-Rad). RNA Gel Retardation—This was performed according to a modification of the protocol of Walker et al. (25Walker J. de Melo Neto O. Standart N. Martin R. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar). Ten μg of the above S-100 protein extracts were incubated with the indicated complementary RNA probes in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 3 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, rRNA 0.5 mg/ml, tRNA 0.5 mg/ml, 100 mm KCl, and 1 μl of 32P-labeled cRNA probes (5× 1010 cpm/0.6 ng) in a total volume of 20 μl. To determine RNA-binding specificity, 2 μl (0.2 μg) of unlabeled, nonspecific, 3′-UTR and ARE probes were incubated with cell extract before 32P-labeled probes were added for RNA gel retardation. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 min. RNase T1 was added at 1 unit per action to remove all labeled RNA not protected by bound protein and incubated for 15 min. One μl of 20 mg/ml heparin was added and incubated for a further 10 min. The samples were then resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gel (60:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide) using 0.5× TBE as a running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak film at -80 °C. RNase T1 mapping was performed as described by Leibold and Munro (26Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Briefly after RNA gel was isolated by electroelution from the native gel in 45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, at 150 V for 3 h. Then the current was reversed for the last 5 min of electroelution. The electroelution buffer was followed by extraction with phenol after the addition of tRNA (2.5 μg/ml) and precipitation with ethanol. The isolated RNAs were digested to completion with 10 units of RNase T1 (Ambion). For comparison, intact 3′-UTR and a small fraction of 3′-UTR were also digested with RNase T1. The samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min with 7 μl of RNA gel loading buffer II (Ambion) and electrophoresed on a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. The Decade marker system (Ambion), which ranged from 10 to 150 nucleotides, was used after being labeled with [α-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Actinomycin D Chase Study—The 3′-UTR-pcDNA3 and pcDNA3 were transfected to Mel-RM with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and selected by G418 (300 μg/ml). The transfected cells then were treated with actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml) for 0, 1, 2, 3, and 2 h. The total RNA was extracted at different time points, and real time PCR was performed for TRAIL-R2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. TRAIL-R2 mRNA Expression in Relation to TRAIL-R2 Protein Expression and Sensitivity to TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—We examined the relation between TRAIL-R2 mRNA, TRAIL-R2 protein, and apoptosis in a panel of nine melanoma lines that exhibited a range of sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As reported previously (5Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar), there was an overall correlation between TRAIL-R2 protein expression and sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1a). There was, however, very little correlation between TRAIL-R2 protein expression and mRNA levels (e.g. in Me4405, there was high TRAIL-R2 protein and apoptosis but relatively low mRNA levels, whereas Mel007 had high TRAIL-R2 mRNA levels and relatively low TRAIL-R2 protein). The latter was also the pattern shown in studies on melanocytes. Dissociation of Protein and mRNA Expression for TRAIL-R2 in Early Versus Late Passage Primary Melanoma Cultures from Patients—Fresh isolates of melanoma cells from patients frequently had relatively low TRAIL receptor expression, but expression of the latter increased with successive passages in culture (21Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 966-973Google Scholar). We examined mRNA levels for TRAIL-R2 in relation to TRAIL-R2 protein in successive passages from four patients. As shown in Fig. 1b, TRAIL-induced apoptosis and TRAIL-R2 protein was low or absent in passage 1 cultures and showed small to moderate increases with successive passages. mRNA values for TRAIL-R2 were, however, relatively constant throughout. In patient RW, mRNA levels were highest in passage 2 cells and then decreased with successive passages, whereas TRAIL-R2 protein was highest in passage 8 cells. In patient MC, TRAIL-R protein was only detected in the late passage 7 cells, whereas TRAIL-R2 mRNA was relatively constant in successive passages. In melanoma cultures from patient KC, mRNA for TRAIL-R2 showed an increase from passage 1 to passage 6 cells, but no significant TRAIL-R2 protein was detected until passage 6. There was no significant variation in the expression of HLA class I antigens detected by the monoclonal antibody W6/32 on melanoma. The percentage expression was 96.5% on RW passage 3 and 97.7% on RW passage 8. Cultures from RW were sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Those from MC, DC, and KC were relatively resistant. MC melanoma cells expressed relatively few receptors, but cultures from DC and KC were resistant even in late passage cultures expressing modest levels of TRAIL-R2 protein. TRAIL-R2 mRNA Levels in Melanoma Cells Selected for Resistance to TRAIL—Culture of melanoma cells in TRAIL for prolonged periods results in generation of TRAIL-resistant cultures that have low TRAIL-R expression (21Nguyen T. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 966-973Google Scholar). Culture of the resistant lines in the absence of TRAIL resulted in partial recovery of both receptor expression and sensitivity to apoptosis. We examined the association between TRAIL-R2 protein and mRNA in these cells. The results in Fig. 1c indicate that mRNA from Mel-RM was at similar levels in the parental and resistant TRAIL-selected lines despite relatively low TRAIL-R2 protein. In the Mel-FH and MM200 lines, there was a reduction in both TRAIL-R2 mRNA and protein, but the reduction in TRAIL-R2 protein was relatively greater. There was no significant variation in the expression of the HLA class I antigen detected by monoclonal antibody W6/32 on Mel-FH, Mel-FH-select (99.1%, 99.4%) and Mel-RM, Mel-RM-select (98.5%, 98.5%). TRAIL-selected Resistant Melanoma Lines and Early Passage Melanoma Suppress Expression of Reporter Genes Containing 3′-UTR from the TRAIL-R2 mRNA—The evidence presented above suggested that events controlling translation of protein from mRNA for TRAIL-R2 were an important determinant of TRAIL-R2 receptor expression. To investigate this further, we investigated expression from reporter constructs transfected into the cell lines. Reporter plasmids were constructed that used an SV40 early promoter-driven luciferase gene with the 3′-UTR from the TRAIL-R2 gene (shown in Fig. 2). The reporter constructs were transfected into the parental (Mel-FH, Mel-RM) and TRAIL-selected melanoma lines (Mel-FH-select and Mel-RM-select) and into early (P3) and late passage (P9) cultures from MC and RW (P2 and P8). As shown in Fig. 3a, firefly luciferase expression relative to Renilla luciferase expression was much lower in transfectants of early compared with late passage cultures from Mel-MC and Mel-RW (p = 0.005 for Mel-RW p8 versus p2; p = 0.006 for Mel-MC p9 versus p3). No significant differences in expression were seen in melanoma cells transfected with the vectors containing the 5′-"
https://openalex.org/W2042599603,"Mutational analysis of determinants located in the C-terminal (C) tail of the high affinity leukotriene (LT) B4 receptor, BLT1, was performed to assess their significance in BLT1 trafficking. When expressed in COS-7 cells, a BLT1 deletion mutant lacking the C-tail (G291stop) displayed higher numbers of binding sites and increased signal transduction compared with wild-type (WT) BLT1. Addition of the C-tail from either the platelet-activating factor receptor or the LTD4 receptor, CysLT1, did not restore WT phenotype. Moreover, the number of LTB4 binding sites was higher in the chimeras than in the WT BLT1, suggesting the requirement for specific structural determinants within the BLT1 C-tail. Elimination of a distal C-tail dileucine motif (Leu304-Leu305), but not the proximal (Leu292-Leu293) motif, altered BLT1 pharmacological characteristics and caused a moderate constitutive receptor activation. Surprisingly, all mutant receptors were efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane, but not to a greater extent than WT BLT1, as assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, substitution of Leu304-Leu305 prevented LTB4-induced BLT1 internalization. Molecular modeling of BLT1 on the bovine rhodopsin receptor scaffold strongly suggested the involvement of the distal dileucine motif (Leu304-Leu305) in a hydrophobic core, including intrahelical interactions within α-helix VIII and interhelical interactions with residues of helix I. Disruption of this hydrophobic core is proposed to increase the population of receptors in the active form, to restrain their trafficking and to facilitate the activation of BLT1 as indicated by the increased maximal level of binding of the ligand and constitutive activation of the receptor.

Disruption of this hydrophobic core is proposed to increase the population of receptors in the active form, to restrain their trafficking and to facilitate the activation of BLT1 as indicated by the increased maximal level of binding of the ligand and constitutive activation of the receptor. A variety of stimuli, including light, neurotransmitters, hormones, and inflammatory lipid mediators produce their effects via activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; BLT1, leukotriene B4 receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; G-protein, GTP-binding regulatory protein; GRK, GPCR kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IP, inositol phosphate(s); LTB4, leukotriene B4; PI, phosphoinositide; TM, transmembrane; WT, wild type; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PAFR, platelet-activated factor receptor. Taking into account the heterogeneity of ligands, it is interesting that all members of this superfamily of receptors share the same topology characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane α-helices. Conserved residues within subfamily A (related to rhodopsin) are localized throughout these helices, serving as reference points for sequence alignments. Biophysical and biochemical evidence indicate that upon photoactivation, relative movements of transmembrane (TM) 3 and TM6 occur in rhodopsin; similarly, rearrangement of the cytoplasmic proximal portion of TM7 relative to TM1 and of TM2 relative to the intracellular helix VIII were also observed (reviewed in Ref. 1Gether U. Asmar F. Meinild A.K. Rasmussen S.G. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 91: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Through structural mimicry, despite the incredible diversity of ligands, GPCRs presumably share the core function of activation through similar conformational changes (2Ballesteros J. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). GPCRs exist in equilibrium between the inactive (R) and active (R*) conformations, as described in the cubic ternary model of GPCR activation (3Weiss J.M. Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 178: 169-172Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Stabilizing networks of intramolecular interactions constrain the receptor in an inactive conformation. Disruption of these stabilizing interactions leads to isomerization of the population of receptors into the active conformation (R*). Several mutations have been described to facilitate the isomerization of receptors from the R to the R* state, leading to higher basal receptor activity in the absence of agonist (1Gether U. Asmar F.

Regulation of activated receptors generally involves Ser/Thr phosphorylation by the GPCR-specific kinases (GRKs) and binding of members of the arrestin family, the latter acting as adaptors between the receptor and components of the internalization machinery (7Pitcher J.A.

APs also bind specific sorting signal sequences in cytoplasmic domains of several transmembrane proteins such as the tyrosine-based motifs (NPXY and YXXφ, where X represents any amino acid, and φ is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic group) and dileucine-based sorting signals (10Kirchhausen T.

Extensive studies have defined the C-terminal (C) tail of GPCRs as a key domain for several aspects of the GPCR biology, including receptor activation and regulation. The atomic structure resolution of rhodopsin in its inactive form revealed the presence of an eighth helix, located in the C-tail segment distal to helix VII (23Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5054) Google Scholar). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation in the C-tail are involved in receptor coupling selectivity (24Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and G-protein activation (25Okamoto Y. Ninomiya H. Tanioka M. Sakamoto A. Miwa S. Masaki T. J. Biol.

Dumuis A. Fagni L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether specific determinants located in the C-tail were implicated in the activation and trafficking of the high affinity human leukotriene (LT)B4 receptor (BLT1). LTB4 is a powerful inflammatory mediator derived from lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid, which induces neutrophil chemotaxis, chemokinesis, aggregation, degranulation, cation fluxes, as well as other immunodulatory functions (reviewed in Ref. 27Rola-Pleszczynski M. Immunol. Today. 1985; 10: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (28Stankova J. Gagnon N. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Immunology. 1992; 76: 258-263PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stankova J.

LTB4 mediates its functions through interaction with two specific plasma membrane receptors showing different affinity for the ligand: a high affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT1 (31Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and low affinity receptor, BLT2 (32Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), which share 45% identity. Several structural determinants purportedly involved in the regulation of transmembrane protein trafficking are present in the BLT1 C-tail and are conserved among species (human, rat, mouse, guinea pig) as well as in the human BLT2 (Fig. 1A). We recently demonstrated that within the BLT1 C-tail reside structural elements involved in its desensitization as well as in arrestin-independent and GRK- and dynamin-dependent BLT1 internalization; both regulatory processes require an intact C-tail.2 (33Gaudreau R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31567-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) In addition, preliminary data revealed that a BLT1 deletion mutant (G291stop) lacking the C-tail, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, showed higher numbers of LTB4 binding sites and increased signal transduction when compared with the WT receptor (33Gaudreau R.

These data suggest that specific structural determinants of BLT1 C-tail regulate cell surface expression, yet the motifs involved are still unknown. Within this receptor segment are located most of the multiple potential intracellular phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr) as well as two dileucine motifs (Fig. 1A). We therefore sought to determine which structural determinants of BLT1 direct its expression. Reagents—cDNA encoding Gα16 was a generous gift from Dr. M. I. Simon (Passadena, CA); cDNA encoding GRK2 was a generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Other materials and their sources were as follow: Geneticin and all culture media from Invitrogen Canada Inc. (Burlington, Ontario, Canada); bovine serum albumin, Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), paraformaldehyde, and poly-l-lysine from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada); fetal bovine serum from BIO MEDIA Canada Inc. (Drummondville, Quebec, Canada); FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, Pwo polymerase, and restriction endonuclease from Roche Applied Science (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); T4 DNA ligase, anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 32Pi, [3H]LTB4, and myo-[3H]inositol from Amersham Biosciences (Baie D’Urfé, Quebec, Canada); LTB4 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); perchloric acid from VWR Canlab (Ville Mont-Royal, Quebec, Canada); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody from BIO/CAN Scientific (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada); gentamicin sulfate from Schering Canada Inc. (Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). Construction of Myc-tagged Wild Type (WT) and Mutant Receptors— The cloning of WT BLT1 cDNA was previously described (34Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to allow rapid assessment of cell surface expression of BLT1, the N-terminal initiator methionine was replaced by the Myc sequence MEQKLISEEDLSRGSPG resulting in Myc epitope-tagged WT and mutant BLT1. The G291stop mutant generation was also described previously (33Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Venne M.H. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31567-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The chimeric mutant receptors were generated by PCR. Primers were designed to link BLT1 core receptor at residue Gly291 (Fig. 1A), immediately after the TM7, in-frame with the C-terminal tail of either PAFR C-tail, from residue Lys298, or CysLT1 C-tail, from residue Gly300. The 4L/A (in which Leu292, Leu293, Leu304, and Leu305 are substituted to alanine) or 2L(304–5)/A and 2L(292–3)/A mutant BLT1 were also constructed by PCR amplification. Each mutant BLT1 is identified by the single letter code of the original amino acid followed by the position number and the single letter code of the exchanged amino acid (Fig. 1B). All constructions were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). Mutant and chimeric receptor cDNAs were then sequenced (University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada) to confirm substitutions or fusion of the chimeric receptor. The human Gα16 and GRK2 cDNAs were in pCIS, under the control of a CMV promoter, and in pcDNA3, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 and HEK293 were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin sulfate (40 μg/ml). Transient transfections were carried out with FuGENE 6, and experiments were performed 48 h post-transfection. Total transfected cDNA quantities were adjusted for each experiment with the pcDNA3 vector DNA. Radioligand Binding Assay—1.2 × 106 COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of cDNA encoding WT or mutant BLT1. After 48 h, cells were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and twice in Hepes-Tyrode’s Buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (35Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which cells were also resuspended for the assay. Competition binding curves were carried out on 2 × 105 cells with 0.25 nm [3H]LTB4 and increasing concentrations of non-radioactive LTB4, for 2 h at 4 °C. For saturation binding curves, 1 × 105 cells were subjected to increasing [3H]LTB4 concentrations (0–16 nm). Nonspecific binding was measured in presence of 2 μm nonradioactive LTB4 and represented less than 10% of total binding. Free radioactivity was separated from cells by centrifugation and a double wash with 1 ml of Hepes-Tyrode’s buffer. Radioactivity contained in the cell pellet was counted in liquid scintillation using a β counter. Inositol Phosphate Determination—COS-7 cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (2.0 × 105 cells/dish) and cultured 24 h before transient transfection with cDNAs encoding WT or mutant BLT1 in combination with cDNA of Gα16 subunit. In brief, 24 h post-transfection, cells were labeled and the following day, stimulated with 100 nm LTB4. Inositol phosphates (IP) were then extracted, and radioactivity was counted as described previously (34Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Total IP levels represent IP production in response to the agonist, over basal levels (or unstimulated). Constitutive activity was determined by comparing the ratio between the basal IP levels of mutant and WT receptors. Flow Cytometry Studies—COS-7 cells transiently expressing the Myc-tagged WT or mutant BLT1 were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Cells (2,5 × 105) were labeled as previously described (34Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Metaoui S. Lemire S. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with anti-Myc followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. All measures were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest sofware (BD Biosciences). Internalization Assay—HEK293 grown at 80% confluency in Petri dishes were transfected with 2 μg of cDNA encoding WT or mutant BLT1 with 4 μg of each others cDNA or the pcDNA3 expression vector DNA as indicated in figure legends. Transfected cells cultured for 24 h were transferred to 6-well plates with 1.5 × 106 cells/well and incubated for another 24 h. After washing once with HBSS, medium containing LTB4 (300 nm) or its vehicle was added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Incubations were stopped on ice, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS. Flow cytometry analysis was carried out as described earlier except that antibody labeling was performed at 4 °C while cells were still attached to the plates. Cells were collected and analyzed. Percentage of receptor internalization was calculated based on either the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of cells or on the percentage of positive cells, with comparable results, using LTB4-treated cells compared with cells treated with the vehicle alone. Molecular Modeling—The modeling and rendering of BLT1 were executed using the INSIGHTII suite of programs (Accel Inc., San Diego, CA). All the calculations were performed on an SGI Octane2 workstation (Silicon Graphics Inc., Mountain View, CA), as described previously (36Deraët M. Rihakova L. Boucard A. Pérodin J. Sauvé S. Mathieu A.P. Guillemette G. Leduc R. Lavigne P. Escher E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 80: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pairwise sequence alignment between the primary structures of BLT1 (SwissProt accession no. GenBank™ accession no. D89078) and the bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank: 1L9H) was performed using the program HOMOLOGY. The sequences of the two proteins were aligned so as to match the positions of the following conserved residues: Asn55-Asn1.5036 (the superscripts represent the residue numbering in rhodopsin structure Protein Data Bank code 1F88, and human BLT1 sequence, respectively, and 1.50 is the numbering in the standardized nomenclature), Asp83-Asp2.5064, Arg135-Arg3.50115, Trp161-Trp4.50142, Pro215-Pro5.50193, Pro267-Pro6.50236 and Pro303-Pro7.50282. The coordinates of the identified structurally conserved regions were then transferred to the sequence of the BLT1. To relieve residual strain resulting from suboptimal positioning of the side chains, the resulting model was subjected to energy minimization using the program DISCOVER with a consistent valence force field (37Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). During this process, the Cα atoms and the side chains of conserved residues were kept fixed at their positions in the rhodopsin crystal structure. A distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was used with simple harmonic potential for bond length energy. No cross-term energies were included, and the peptide bonds were forced to planarity. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student’s paired t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. WT and mutant BLT1 were expressed in a mammalian expression system in order to determine and characterize structural elements involved in BLT1 trafficking and receptor activation. Motifs located in the C-terminal tail of the receptor were investigated with regard to receptor expression, targeting to the membrane and functionality. Structural Determinants of BLT1 C-tail Are Essential for Regulation of BLT1 Expression—We previously reported that a complete C-tail-truncated BLT1 (G291stop) showed increased numbers of [3H]LTB4 binding sites and a greater IP production in response to LTB4 stimulation than WT BLT1 (33Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Venne M.H. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31567-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to define whether selective BLT1 determinants could regulate its cell surface trafficking, we created two chimeric receptors composed of the main core of BLT1: residues 1–291 at the end of TM7 of BLT1 and the C-tail of either the PAFR or the LTD4 receptor CysLT1 (Fig. 1B). The amino acids present in the C-tail of each receptor are shown in Fig. 1A. Chimeric receptors (BLT1-PAFR and BLT1-CysLT1) were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and were present at the plasma membrane as assessed by [3H]LTB4 binding (Table I). Nonlinear regression analysis of competition binding curves revealed the presence of one class of binding sites exhibiting high affinity for LTB4 (BLT1-PAFR, Kd = 3.6 ± 0.7 nm; BLT1-CysLT1, Kd = 6.7 ± 1.9 nm). These Kd values were slightly higher than the value for WT BLT1 value (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.5 nm) (Table I).Table IBinding characteristics of WT and modified BLT1ReceptorsDissociation constant, KdnmBLT1 WT0.99 ± 0.46BLT1-PAFR3.59 ± 0.74BLT1-CysLT16.71 ± 1.874L/A10.6 ± 2.402L(304·5)/A12.2 ± 3.002L(292·3)/A4.47 ± 1.47 Open table in a new tab We next investigated whether those chimeric receptors were able to transduce LTB4 signaling. Total IP accumulation was monitored in COS-7 cells coexpressing Gα16 subunit protein and either chimeric or WT receptor. Surprisingly, in response to 100 nm of LTB4, IP production was markedly increased for both BLT1-PAFR (155 ± 16%) and BLT1-CysLT1 (163 ± 18%) in comparison with WT (defined as 100%) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the increased ability of the chimeric BLT1 to transduce LTB4 signaling was associated with a higher number of binding sites, as shown by [3H]LTB4 saturation binding curves (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the C-tail of WT BLT1 contains a signal that is not conserved in PAFR or CysLT1 C-tail, which controls BLT1 trafficking or functional expression at the cell surface. We further sought to define the structural determinants present in the C-tail that could regulate BLT1 expression. Since a partially C-tail-truncated BLT1 mutant (G319stop) had shown binding characteristics similar to WT BLT1 (33Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Venne M.H. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31567-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we investigated the cytoplasmic segment comprising residues 291–319. Two types of structural determinants located within the 291–319 C-tail segment could be involved in receptor trafficking: phosphoacceptor sites (S/T) and dileucine motifs (LL). Notably, the addition of PAFR and CysLT1 C-tails containing potential phosphoacceptor sites did not prevent the increase in binding site numbers observed with the G291stop BLT1. Moreover, several phosphorylation sites (Thr308, Ser310, Ser313, Ser314, Thr315) within this segment had been mutated without any effect on [3H]LTB4 binding (Ref. 33Gaudreau R. Le Gouill C. Venne M.H. Stankova J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31567-31576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and data not shown). Consequently, BLT1 C-tail dileucine motifs were further studied. Characterization of Dileucine Mutant BLT1—Dihydrophobic motifs, such as leucine-valine and leucine-leucine are involved in efficient trafficking of several transmembrane proteins through sorting, localization or internalization signals as observed for the β2-AR and CXCR4 (13Heilker R. Spiess M. Crottet P. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Gabilondo A.M. Hegler J. Krasel C. Boivin-Jahns V. Hein L. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Two dileucine motifs are located between residues 291–319 of the BLT1 C-tail. In order to assess whether the dileucines were essential for the WT phenotype, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt Leu292, Leu293, and Leu304, Leu305 in the full-length BLT1. Leucines were substituted to alanines so as to change each motif alone or in combination, generating three new mutant receptors: 2L(292–3)/A, 2L(304–5)/A, and 4L/A mutant BLT1 (Fig. 1B). Again, mutant receptors displayed a higher Kd for LTB4 (respective Kd values: 4.47 ± 1.47 nm, 12.2 ± 3.0 nm, 10.6 ± 2.4 nm) than the WT BLT1 (Table I). LTB4-induced IP accumulation was increased for the 4L/A mutant receptor (136 ± 17%) when compared with the WT (defined as 100%) (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, mutation of the distal dileucine motif 2L(304–5)/A led to a significant increase in IP production upon LTB4 exposure (177 ± 22%), whereas mutation of the proximal motif 2L(292–3)/A had no detectable effect (108 ± 22%). Similar results were also observed in a time course study of IP production (Fig. 3B). We next addressed whether dileucines might regulate BLT1 expression. Saturation binding curves correlated with the IP production, given that the 4L/A and the 2L(304–5)/A mutant receptors showed higher numbers of binding sites at the plasma membrane, but saturation could not be achieved (Fig. 3C). In contrast, WT and the 2L(292–3)/A BLT1 binding sites for LTB4 could be saturated. Overall, these results suggest that leucines 304 and 305 are responsible for the phenotype observed with the G291stop deletion. We assessed the expression levels of Myc-tagged WT and mutant BLT1 at the plasma membrane by flow cytometry analysis. Surprisingly, the mean fluorescence intensity of COS-7 cells expressing each mutant receptor did not significantly vary from that of WT BLT1 (Fig. 4 and Table II). Similar results were observed when the number of Myc+ cells was evaluated (Table II). Thus, the cell surface expression of the protein was not affected by removal of either one or both of the dileucine motifs and hence, the increased binding capacity of the population of receptors was not the consequence of a higher number of cell surface BLT1. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the distal dileucine motif regulated in some way LTB4 binding or LTB4 mediated activation of BLT1, by an augmentation of the population of receptors in the active state.Table IIExpression of WT and mutant BLT1ReceptorsPo"

Moreover, we found that expansion and contraction of CAG repeat size in the hHD transgene depended on the gender of the progeny (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2667-2775Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expansions are primarily seen in males and contractions dominate in females. The molecular basis for the parent-of-origin effect is unknown. The gender dependence of expansion can be due to differences in CAG repeat distribution in X- and Y-bearing sperm. Alternatively, the change in repeat number, contraction, or expansion can take place after fertilization in early embryogenesis. In order to distinguish between these two mechanisms, the isolation and purification of the X- and Y-bearing sperm were required. This, however, was not possible using conventional technology. In present work, we have developed techniques and used advanced technology to separate pure populations of X- and Y-bearing germ cells from HD transgenic mice. We show here that CAG repeat distributions in X- and Y-bearing parental sperm are not different. Repeat expansion occurs equally well within both X and Y chromosomes. This indicates that the gender-dependent processing of CAG repeats must take place post-zygotically. Thus, these data provide evidence for a new kind of imprinting that may be important in the interpretation of genetic data in other systems. Animals—HD transgenic male mice (line B6CBA-TgN R6/1) were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The colony was maintained at the animal core facility, Mayo Clinic/Foundation. Animals were routinely screened for the presence of HD transgene by PCR (10Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Mahal A. Mott R. Seller M. Bates G.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Kovtun I.V. McMurray C.T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Preparation of Single Cell Suspension and Flow Sorting—Mouse epididymis was dissected from the animal, placed in phosphate-buffered saline, and chopped with a razor. Resulting suspension was filtered through cheesecloth. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1500 rpm, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Mature spermatozoa then were sonicated, stained with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml), and subjected to FACS analysis. Sperm samples were sorted using a modified FACSVantage (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with argon laser operating in the ultraviolet spectrum. The fluorescence emission was collected at 0 and 90° to the excitation source through 418-nm long pass filters. CAG Repeat Sizing—Sorted X- and Y-bearing sperm were collected by centrifugation and lysed. DNA was isolated, and CAG repeat lengths were determined by PCR followed by GeneScan analysis as described in Refs. 10Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Mahal A. Mott R. Seller M. Bates G.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar and 18Kovtun I.V. McMurray C.T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar. FISH Analysis—Aliquots of spermatozoa, sorted for X and Y chromosomes, were analyzed by double-FISH. The sperm cells were decondensed with 10 mm dithiothreitol, denatured using 70% formamide, and subsequently hybridized with specific probes for mouse X and Y chromosomes. The probes were centromere-specific α-satellite DNA that was directly labeled with a fluorescent dye. The X chromosome was labeled with SpectrumOrange and the Y chromosome with SpectrumGreen (Imagenetics). The spermatozoa were visualized and classified as either X- or Y-bearing using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope equipped with dual pass fluorescein isothiocyanate/rhodamine filter. To test whether expansion and contraction in HD are “imprinted” in Y- and X-bearing germ cells, we adapted a FACS approach to separate X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa (Fig. 1, A–C), after which we sized the CAG repeat in each population (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2667-2775Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Mahal A. Mott R. Seller M. Bates G.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). We found that X- and Y-bearing sperm did not differ in repeat distribution in any animal tested (Fig. 1D; shown are two animals). These results were not due to population mixing. We were able to isolate successfully pure populations of X and Y chromosome-bearing spermatozoa based on the 2.8–3% total DNA content differences. Isolations were performed using a flow cytometer with specific modifications as developed by Johnson et al. (13Johnson L.A. Welch G.R. Keyvanfar K. Dorfmann A. Fugger E.F. Schulman J.D. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 10: 1733-1739Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Modifications included an additional fluorescence detector positioned at a right angle (90°) and a novel sample injection tip designed to “orient” the spermatozoa to the laser beam (14Johnson L.A. Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 1995; 7: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Rens W. Welch G.R. Johnson L.A. Cytometry. 1998; 33: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fluorescent signal from Hoechst-stained spermatozoa oriented with their brightest edge toward the 90° detector was collected by 0° detector and showed bimodal distribution. The smaller left peak comprised Y-bearing sperm and the larger right peak comprised X-bearing sperm (Fig. 1, A–C). The two peaks overlap (Fig. 1B). Non-overlapping areas of the peaks representing populations enriched in Y and X sperm (left and right peak, respectively) were selected by the electronic sort windows and collected (Fig. 1C). The purity and accuracy of the isolated X- and Y-bearing sperm were confirmed by FISH analysis using specific X and Y probes (Fig. 2, A and B). Mean percentages of X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa indicate 94–95% efficiency of separation in tested samples (Fig. 2A). Nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2667-2775Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was used to compare repeat distributions (Fig. 1D) of two sorted populations. Analysis confirmed that neither the size of the midpoint (peak with the largest area) nor the distribution of the repeat sizes was different between X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa. It has been well documented that in both HD patients (16Leeflang E.P. McPeek M.S. Arnheim N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 896-904PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leeflang E.P. Tavare S. Marjoram P. Neal C.O.

Genet. 2001; 27: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) expansions are present in spermatozoa. Repeats after transmission tend to expand in male progeny in mice (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2667-2775Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and new mutations tend to arise through the paternal line in humans (19Giovannone B. Sabbadini G. Di Maio L. Calabrese O. Castaldo I. Frontali M. Novelletto A. Squitieri F. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, expansion is gender-biased. Direct testing of the gender dependence, however, has not been possible by using conventional technology. Questions were raised as to whether altered repeat sizes existed on the X and Y chromosomes of the parent before transmission. In this work, we directly tested whether expansions and contractions are segregated with X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa. We demonstrate here that the CAG repeat distributions in X- and Y-bearing parental sperm are not different (Fig. 1D). The repeat expansion occurs equally well within both X and Y chromosomes. GeneScan is accurate in showing the most prevalent sizes in the heterogeneous pool (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol.

Therefore, the data are clear in evaluating repeat length alterations. We have reported previously (9Kovtun I.V. Therneau T.M. McMurray C.T. Hum. Mol.

We find that gene scan analysis carried out on the total population of germ cells in mice is accurate in distinguishing changes between X and Y populations of sperm. These data for the first time allow an unequivocal demonstration that the observed gender bias was not due to imprinting of the parental sperm. Rather, the gender-dependent processing of CAG repeats within the X and Y chromosomes appears to occur post-zygotically. These data point to a new kind of imprinting that depends on signals in the embryo and may influence far-reaching implications with respect to the interpretation of genetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2076876079,"The effect of protein kinase C (PKC) activation on beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) regulation of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) was studied using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Treatment of guinea pig ventricular myocytes with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) caused a significant decrease in ICa,L sensitivity to stimulation by submaximal beta1-AR activation using isoproterenol (Iso). This decrease in sensitivity was also associated with the ability of higher concentrations of Iso to directly inhibit the stimulatory response. PDBu treatment produced similar effects on H2 histamine receptor-mediated ICa,L responses. In the presence of PDBu, higher concentrations of Iso inhibited the histamine stimulated ICa,L, and this effect was blocked by a selective beta1-AR antagonist. Higher concentrations of histamine also inhibited the Iso stimulated ICa,L, and this effect was blocked by a selective H2 receptor antagonist. The effects of PDBu were blocked by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, and they were not mimicked by the inactive phorbol ester 4alpha-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate. The inhibitory effects of Iso and histamine were significantly reduced when Gi/o mediated responses were blocked with pertussis toxin. These results suggest that PKC promotes coupling of cardiac beta1-adrenergic and H2 histamine receptors to Gi/o mediated inhibitory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2035808485,"The interaction of fibrinogen with integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (GPIIb/IIIa), in part mediated by an RGD tripeptide motif, is an essential step in platelet aggregation. Based on their inhibition of platelet aggregation, three integrin alphaIIbbeta3 inhibitors are clinically approved. The clinically most widely used integrin alphaIIbbeta3 inhibitor abciximab is a chimeric mouse/human antibody that induces thrombocytopenia, often severe, in 1-2% of patients due to a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) response. In addition, unlike other ligands mimicking small molecular drugs, abciximab cross-reacts with integrin alphavbeta3 and alphaMbeta2. Here we used phage display to select monoclonal antibodies specific to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 from a synthetic human antibody library based on the randomized HCDR3 sequence VGXXXRADXXXYAMDV. The selected antibodies revealed a strong consensus in HCDR3 (V(V/W)CRAD(K/R)RC) and high specificity toward integrin alphaIIbbeta3 but not to other RGD binding integrins such as alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, and alpha5beta1. The selected antibodies as well as three synthetic peptides (VWCRADRRC, VWCRADKRC, and VVCRADRRC) whose sequences were derived from the HCDR3 sequences of the selected antibodies strongly inhibited the interaction between integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and fibrinogen and platelet aggregation ex vivo. To our knowledge, these are the first fully human monoclonal antibodies that are specific to integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and can potently inhibit platelet aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1990910599,"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) controls cell proliferation, differentiation, and senescence and provides an essential tumor suppressive function that cells must eliminate to attain unlimited proliferative potential. Elimination of the Rb pathway also results in apoptosis, however, thereby providing an efficient surveillance mechanism to sense the loss of Rb.

We show that oncogenic Ras (RasV12) potently blocks cell death in Rb family member knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (TKO cells). Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Raf by oncogenic Ras mediated this protection, implying that multiple Ras effector pathways are required, in concert, for this pro-survival signal. Although activation of Raf by selective Ras mutants protected TKO cells from cell death, pharmacologic inhibition of MEK had little effect on RasV12 protection, suggesting that a Raf-dependent, MEK-independent pathway was important for this effect. We show that this Raf-dependent protection occurred through activation of c-Jun and thus AP-1 activation. These observations could account for the dependence of Ras transformation on c-Jun activity and for the roles of AP-1 in oncogenesis.

Our results support the concept of two oncogenic events cooperating to achieve a balance between immortalization and survival. The retinoblastoma protein (Rb), a negative regulator of cell proliferation, was the first tumor suppressor discovered. It is thought that the loss of Rb function is a required step for tumorigenesis (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4295) Google Scholar). This theory is supported by the high frequency of oncogenic lesions that directly or indirectly impinge upon the Rb pathway in human cancer (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar) and by the demonstration that abrogation of Rb function is necessary for transformation of primary human cells (3Hahn W.C.

Abrogation of Rb function can occur through deletion of the Rb locus itself, as seen in retinoblastoma, osteosarcoma, lung carcinoma, and some forms of breast cancer (4Friend S.H. Bernards R.

More common are genetic lesions in other components of the Rb pathway that result in nonfunctional Rb. Cyclin D/cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; TKO, triple knockout; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. 1The abbreviations used are: cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; TKO, triple knockout; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblasts. 4/6 and cyclin E/cdk2 phosphorylate and inactivate Rb, and cdk inhibitors such as p16Ink4a and p15Ink4b inhibit the cyclin/cdk complexes. Overexpression or amplification of each of the cyclin and cdk subunits, activating point mutations in cdk4, and silencing of p15 or p16 through deletion or methylation of their promoters have all been observed in human cancer (1Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4946) Google Scholar, 9Reed S.I. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of Rb itself may be rare because upstream lesions affect not only Rb but also its two relatives, p107 and p130, which are not tumor suppressors but share many of the growth inhibitory characteristics of Rb.However, the loss of Rb function also results in a strong signal for apoptosis in many cell types. This occurs largely through hyperactivity of E2F transcription factors, positive regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by Rb (10Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). There are also other apoptotic effectors that bind to Rb such as Id2 (11Lasorella A. Noseda M. Beyna M. Yokota Y. Iavarone A. Nature. 2000; 407: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Viral oncogenes such as adenoviral E1A and HPV E7 induce apoptosis, in part, by binding and inhibiting Rb (12Jones D.L. Thompson D.A. Munger K. Virology. 1997; 239: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13White E. Oncogene. 2001; 54: 7836-7846Crossref Google Scholar). Overexpression of an E2F mutant that binds DNA (and thus displaces Rb from promoters) but fails to transactivate gene expression can induce apoptosis (14Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loss of Rb repression at promoters is sufficient to cause cell death even in the absence of E2F activity. It is thought that this response to loss of Rb is a tumor surveillance mechanism whereby cells in which this essential growth inhibitory pathway is lost are eliminated before they give rise to tumors.The requirement for the loss of Rb function for tumorigenesis raises questions about certain classic models of tumorigenesis. Growth factor and growth factor receptor signaling, as well as their intracellular effectors Ras and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases, have long been known to be hyperactivated in many human cancers. These lesions promote cell proliferation, but in the absence of Rb it is unclear how important further enhancement of cell proliferation might be. Loss of Rb function overcomes permanent growth arrest, conferring (potentially) unlimited growth potential, and this may be a more important barrier for would-be tumor cells to overcome rather than simply increasing their growth rate. Several types of human cancers have both mutations in the p16/Rb pathway and activation of Ras (for example, see Refs. 16Walker G.J. Hayward N.K. J. Invest. Derm. 2002; 119: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 17Hilgers W. Rosty C. Hahn S.A. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 16: 7-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hyperactivation of Ras pathways may be important for characteristics of advanced neoplasm such as metastatic potential (18Webb C.P. Vande Woude G.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 318-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). On the other hand, because the loss of Rb induces apoptosis, growth factor/growth factor receptor, Ras, and Ras effector signaling may initially be important for promoting survival, without which a cell in which Rb function was lost might never yield progenitors.To study the role of activating, oncogenic Ras mutations in cell survival and death caused by the loss of the Rb pathway, we turned to a cell culture system. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which all three Rb family members (Rb, p107, and p130) are “knocked out” (triple knockouts or TKOs) have been described (19Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 20Dannenberg J.H. van Rossum A. Schuijff L. te Riele H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These cells undergo accelerated apoptosis when serum/growth factors are removed, making them an ideal model by which to study the effects of mitogenic signaling on apoptosis caused by the loss of Rb function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Retroviral Infections, and Apoptosis Assays—Rb family triple knockout cells (TKOs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum plus sodium pyruvate and nonessential amino acids. For viability assays, the cells were plated such that they were ∼75% confluent the following day. Serum deprivation was with 0.1% FBS. At harvesting, supernatant, wash, and trypsinized cells were combined for trypan blue exclusion assay. Ras effector mutants (RasV12S35, RasV12G37, RasV12E38, and RasV12C40) were constructed through point mutagenesis using pBabepuroRasV12 as the template (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). Dominant inhibitory RasN17 was made through point mutagenesis using pBabe.puro.Ras as template. All of the plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the appropriate mutations had been incorporated. MSCV c-Jun was constructed by PCR amplifying c-Jun cDNA to have ends with BamHI and EcoRI sites and ligating it into the BglII-EcoRI cloning sites of MSCV.Retroviruses were produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with the retroviral vectors and the φ2 helper virus. Virus was harvested at five separate time points spaced 6–10 h apart. Target cells were infected at three separate time points spaced 3 h apart without removing the previous virus. For pBabe.puro retroviral vector infections, TKOs were selected in 2.0 μg/ml puromycin. MSCV vectors carried an internal ribosomal entry site-green fluorescent protein. The efficiency of infections was generally nearly 100% as assessed by puromycin selection or green fluorescent protein positivity.Western Analysis—Cells were lysed in ELB buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium pyrophosphate, and sodium fluoride. Antibodies used were phospho-Ser473-Akt (Cell Signaling 9271); phospho-Ser73 c-Jun (Cell Signaling 9164); phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-p44/p42 ERK (Cell Signaling 9910); α-tubulin (Sigma T5168); phospho-Ser217/221-MEK1/2 (Cell Signaling 9121); and p21 (Santa Cruz sc-291).RESULTSOncogenic Ras Protects against Loss-of-Rb-mediated Cell Death—Numerous studies have shown that oncogenic Ras can promote either apoptosis or survival in fibroblasts (for examples, see Refs. 21Fernandez A.

Biol. 2002; 22: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked what effect the expression of oncogenic Ras would have on the cell death that results from functional loss of Rb family members, an essential step in tumorigenesis.Mouse embryo fibroblasts triply knocked out for all three Rb family members, Rb, p107, and p130 (TKOs) underwent cell death when serum was removed (0.1% fetal bovine serum) (Fig. 1A and Ref. 19Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), whereas wild type MEFs survived in medium containing 0.1% FBS without proliferating or undergoing significant cell death for at least 2 weeks (data not shown). TKOs were transduced with either a control retrovirus (pBabe.puro) or a retrovirus expressing c-H-RasV12 (RasV12) and selected for stable integration by puromycin treatment. When control pBabe TKOs were deprived of serum (0.1% FBS), ∼65% were dead 2 days after serum withdrawal (Fig. 1A). By 4 days over 90% of cells were dead (Fig. 1A). In contrast, for RasV12-expressing TKOs, only ∼15% of cells were dead 2 days after serum withdrawal, and less than 25% were dead after 4 days (Fig. 1A). RasV12 TKO viability exceeding 70% was present up to 10 days of continuous culture in 0.1% serum, and after 2 weeks ∼50% of cells were still viable (Fig. 1A).TKO cells transduced with dominant negative Ras (RasN17) had a higher rate of basal cell death in 10% FBS compared with control pBabe TKOs (∼30% versus 10%, respectively; Fig. 1B). In addition, when serum was withdrawn, RasN17 expressing TKOs underwent cell death faster than control TKOs (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that oncogenic Ras could overcome cell death resulting from the combination of loss of Rb family member function and growth factor deprivation. Furthermore, endogenous Ras appears to provide a basal survival signal to cells that have lost Rb family member function.Multiple, but Not All, Ras Effector Pathways Are Required to Prevent Cell Death of Rb Family Null MEFs Following Serum Deprivation—Next we asked what signaling pathways downstream of activated Ras were required to protect TKO cells from cell death following serum deprivation. First, a pharmacologic approach was taken. Cells were treated with various drugs that inhibit specific Ras effector pathways. Two concentrations of each drug were used on control pBabe TKOs or RasV12 TKOs, in the presence or absence of serum, and cell death was quantified after 2 days of drug treatment. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, significantly blocked the protective effect of RasV12 at both the low (10 μm) and high (50 μm) concentrations, accelerated cell death of control pBabe-infected TKOs when serum-deprived, and caused increased cell death of control pBabe TKOs grown in the presence of serum (Fig. 2A). Wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, also reversed RasV12 protection against serum deprivation-induced death and increased death in control pBabe TKOs both in the presence and absence of serum (data not shown). SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, also significantly blocked the protective effect of RasV12 at both low (20 μm) and high (50 μm) concentrations, accelerated cell death of serum-deprived control pBabe TKOs, and increased cell death of control pBabe TKOs grown in the presence of serum (Fig. 2A). Two MEK inhibitors were also tested. PD98059 only partially reversed the RasV12 protective effect and only at the high concentration (100 μm; ∼2-fold the cell death), but did accelerate the cell death of serum-deprived control pBabe TKOs, and had only a marginal effect on control pBabe TKO survival in the presence of serum (Fig. 2A). U0126 treatment, another MEK inhibitor, gave results similar to that of PD98059 treatment (Fig. 2A). SB203580, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, had no significant effect on any of these parameters (Fig. 2A). None of the drugs affected RasV12 TKOs cell survival grown in the presence of serum, except for a small effect of LY294002 but only at the high concentration (Fig. 2A), indicating that changes in cell survival were not due to nonspecific toxicity of the drugs. In summary, these results suggested that activation of PI3K and JNK are both important in Ras-mediated protection against cell death in Rb family TKOs. Because inhibition of either of these pathways also increased death of control TKOs grown in the presence of serum, this suggested that in the absence of Rb function, the base-line activity of the PI3K and JNK pathways contributed to survival.Fig. 2Inhibition of single Ras pathways reverses Ras-mediated protection. A, control pBabe.puro TKOs or RasV12 TKOs were plated at equal confluence, and 24 h later medium was changed to 0.1% (–ser) or 10% (+ser) FBS. At the same time, cells were treated with the following drugs: Me2SO (first columns, white), 10 μm LY294002 (second columns, gray) or 50 μm LY294002 (third columns, black), 20 μm SP600125 (fourth columns, white) or 50 μm SP600125 (fifth columns, gray), 20 μm PD98059 (sixth columns, black) or 100 μm PD98059 (seventh columns, white), 1 μm U0126 (eighth columns, gray) or 5 μm U0126 (ninth columns, black), or 3 μm SB203580 (tenth columns, white) or 10 μm SB203580 (eleventh columns, gray). 48 h later, all cells were collected and cell death was quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay. B, control pBabe.puro TKOs and RasV12 TKOs were plated at equal confluence, and 24 h later the same drugs (D) were added at the same concentrations. 2 or 8 h after addition of drugs total cell lysates were taken, and Western blots were performed as indicated (W). As internal controls, blots were probed for α-tubulin. C, TKOs were transduced with the indicated retroviruses, selected, and plated to be at equal confluence the following day, and then medium was changed to 0.1% FBS. 48 h later, all cells were collected, and cell death was quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay. Shown are the death rates relative to control pBabe.puro TKOs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether treatment of cells with the pharmacologic inhibitors resulted in the expected inhibition of target signaling proteins, Western blots for activated phosphorylated signaling proteins in the effector pathways were performed. As expected, LY294002 resulted in a decrease in phospho-Akt levels, a direct downstream target of PI3K; SP600125 caused a decrease in phospho-c-Jun levels, a target of JNK; and PD98059 and U0126 both caused a decrease in phospho-ERK (p42/p44) levels, a target of MEK (Fig. 2B). These Western blots also yielded additional information. First, the inhibitory effects of LY294002, SP600125, and U0126, although initially strong (Fig. 2B, 2 h), did not persist for 8 h. In contrast, the effects of PD98059 persisted for 8 h at the high concentration (Fig. 2B). The strong reversal of RasV12-mediated protection of TKO apoptosis despite temporary inhibition of PI3K and JNK suggested that transient inhibition of PI3K or JNK was sufficient to allow initiation of an apoptotic program that continued even after PI3K and JNK function was restored. In support of this possibility, the addition of SP600125 followed by its removal after 8 h still resulted in reversal of RasV12-mediated protection and acceleration of death of control pBabe TKOs (data not shown). Second, RasV12-expressing TKOs had significantly higher basal levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-c-Jun than control TKOs, as expected (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, however, control TKOs had clearly higher levels of phospho-ERK than RasV12 TKOs (Fig. 2B), indicating that ERK activation most likely did not contribute to the protective effect of RasV12. These pharmacologic experiments indicated that multiple Ras effector pathways are required, in concert, for efficient protection against loss-of-Rb-mediated cell death.As a second approach to determine what signaling pathways downstream of activated Ras contributed to the protection of TKOs from serum-deprived cell death, RasV12 compound mutants that activate only one Ras effector pathway (27Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) were tested for their capacity to rescue TKOs from cell death following serum deprivation, relative to RasV12 or control pBabe TKOs. RasV12S35 (RasS35) and RasV12E38 (RasE38) activate only Raf, RasV12G37 (RasG37) activates only Ral-GDS, and RasV12C40 (RasC40) activates only PI3K. TKOs were transduced with control pBabe virus, RasV12, or RasV12 effector mutant retroviruses and selected for stable expression. The cells were deprived of serum for 2 days, and cell death was quantified. A significant reduction in cell death upon serum withdrawal was observed for RasS35 and RasE38 TKO cells (Fig. 2C; ∼50% reduction compared with pBabe control TKO cells) and for RasC40 TKOs (Fig. 2C; 40% reduction compared with pBabe control TKO cells). These reductions were not as strong as observed in RasV12 TKOs, however (Fig. 2C; 80% reduction compared with pBabe control TKO cells). For RasG37 TKOs, only a marginal reduction in cell death was observed (∼20% reduction compared with pBabe control TKO cells, Fig. 2C).Consistent with the results obtained from pharmacologic inhibition of downstream signaling pathways activated by oncogenic RasV12, hyperactivation of a single Ras effector pathway by RasV12 effector mutants was only able to provide partial protection against loss-of-Rb-mediated cell death. These results again indicated that activation of multiple but not all Ras effector pathways were required for RasV12 to protect Rb family TKO cells from cell death following serum deprivation.Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K (e.g. LY294002) and selective activation of PI3K (e.g. RasC40) indicated that PI3K mediated part of the protective effect of oncogenic RasV12. The PI3K/Akt pathway is a well characterized Ras activated anti-apoptotic pathway. PI3K, which is activated by Ras, in turn activates Akt, which phosphorylates and inactivates numerous apoptotic proteins such as Bad and caspase 9, promoting survival in many different systems (28Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2905-2927Crossref Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). That LY294002 potently reversed the RasV12 protective effect and that RasC40 was able to partially protect TKOs (Figs. 2A and 3B) from apoptosis were consistent were this. Interestingly, although activation of Raf by RasS35 or RasE38 was protective, pharmacologic inhibition of MEK (downstream of Raf) had only a minor effect on RasV12 protection. These results suggested the possibility that other Raf-dependent but MEK-independent signaling pathways were important for the protective effect of RasV12 in Rb family TKO cells.Fig. 3Ras protects against loss-of-Rb-mediated cell death via AP-1. A, pBabe TKOs or RasV12 TKOs were plated to give equal confluence the following day, and 24 h later the medium was changed to 0.1% (–ser) or 10% (+ser) FBS, and at the same time, curcumin was added at 0 (EtOH, the solvent, was added as a control; speckled bars), 10 μm (diagonal lines), or 20 μm (solid gray bars). Cell death was quantified after 48 h by trypan blue exclusion assay. B, Northern blot was performed on total RNA harvested from proliferating pBabe TKOs and RasV12 TKOs and probed for c-Jun. C, TKOs were transduced with SupJunD1, selected for stable transduction, and plated in the presence of serum (10% FBS), and 48 h later cell death was quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay. D, TKOs transduced with the indicated retroviruses were selected in puromycin, the cells were plated and 48 h later, before reaching confluence, total cell lysates were taken, and Western blots were performed for phospho-c-Jun (Ser73). α-Tubulin was probed for as an internal control. E, TKOs were transduced with the indicated retroviruses. RasV12 + SupJunD1 (SJD1) were expressed from a single bicistronic retroviral vector. Two independent infections of TKOs by RasV12 + SupJunD1 were used. The cells were plated to give equal confluence the next day and 24 h later serum-deprived with 0.1% FBS. 48 h later, cell death was quantified by trypan blue exclusion assay. F, lysates from the same pools of transduced cells as in E were probed by Western blot for H-Ras, phospho-c-Jun, and α-tubulin as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RasV12 Promotes Survival by Signaling to AP-1—Inhibition of JNK activity appeared to be as potent as inhibition of PI3K activity in the abrogation of oncogenic Ras-mediated survival of Rb family TKO cells deprived of serum (Fig. 2, A and B). This result was unexpected, because JNK is usually pro-apoptotic (29Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3593) Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates and activates c-Jun. c-Jun has also been shown to be pro-apoptotic when overexpressed, to transduce the JNK apoptotic signal in neuronal cells, and to mediate UV-induced apoptosis (30Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). c-Jun is part of the transcription factor complex AP-1, which is comprised of Jun, Fos, Maf, and/or ATF family members (30Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether c-Jun activity (i.e. AP-1) contributed to the RasV12-mediated protection from cell death of Rb family null MEFs deprived of serum.First, control and RasV12 TKO cells (± serum) were treated with curcumin, an AP-1 inhibitor (31Huang T.S. Lee S.C. Lin J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 32Hanazawa S. Takeshita A. Amano S. Semba T. Nirazuka T. Katoh H. Kitano S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9526-9532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Curcumin reversed RasV12-mediated protection from serum-deprived cell death of TKOs to an extent similar to inhibition of JNK by SP600125 (Fig. 3A versus Fig. 2A, respectively). This suggested that activation of AP-1 could be an important target of RasV12-mediated survival. Because AP-1 autoregulates itself by inducing transcription of c-Jun (33Vogt P.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2365-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), if AP-1 was activated by RasV12 one would expect the level of c-Jun mRNA to increase in RasV12-expressing TKO cells relative to pBabe control cells. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that c-Jun mRNA levels were indeed elevated in RasV12-expressing TKOs (Fig. 3B), consistent with increased AP-1 activity.Second, TKO cells were transduced with SupJunD1, a dominant negative inhibitor of AP-1. SupJunD1 expression resulted in an increase in basal (i.e. in the presence of serum) cell death compared with control pBabe TKO cells grown in serum (5-fold; Fig. 3C). This result suggested that endogenous AP-1 was important for viability in cells that have lost Rb family function. Western blot analysis of phospho-c-Jun levels in SupJunD1-transduced TKO cells demonstrated a reduction in phospho-c-Jun (active), confirming that SupJunD1 inhibited AP-1 activity (Fig. 3D, third lane versus first lane).Third, TKO cells were transduced with a bicistronic retrovirus expressing both RasV12 and SupJunD1. TKOs transduced with RasV12 alone were protected against serum deprivation-induced cell death, as expected (8% for RasV12 versus 64% for control pBabe; Fig. 3E). Co-transduction of SupJunD1 with RasV12 reversed the protective effect of RasV12. In these cells cell death was comparable with control pBabe TKO cells (avg. 58% death; Fig. 3E). Western blot analysis demonstrated that phospho-c-Jun levels were increased by RasV12 alone (Fig. 3F, as in Fig. 2B) and that SupJunD1 reduced phospho-c-Jun induction by RasV12 to the levels present in control pBabe TKO cells (Fig. 3F).Fourth, c-Jun was overexpressed in TKO cells. c-Jun-overexpressing TKOs exhibited a ∼60% reduction in cell death after 2 days of serum deprivation compared with control TKO cells (Fig. 4A), further supporting a survival role for AP-1 in loss-of-Rb-mediated cell death.Fig. 4c-Jun protects against, an"

The heme-bound CO is used as a spectroscopic antenna to probe the original distribution of conformers in the dioxygen derivative of Ascaris Hb, by utilizing sol-gel encapsulation.

Ascaris Hb shows very high O2 affinity (KD = 2.7 nm compared with 857 nm in Mb), arising from an extremely slow dissociation rate (koff = 0.0041 s-1) (1Davenport H.E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Ascaris Hb has a distal glutamine residue at the E7 position (Gln-E7) and a tyrosine residue at the B10 position (Tyr-B10) (Fig. 1). It has been proposed that a network of hydrogen bonds connecting these two residues to the heme-bound ligand is responsible for this extremely low oxygen dissociation rate (5Yang J. Kloek A.P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recent calculations support this picture by showing that the hydrogen bonding of the oxygen to the B10 tyrosine (11Scherlis D.A. Estrin D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8436-8437Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) alone does not account for this low dissociation rate. Recently it was suggested that the interactions of the Gln-E7 and Tyr-B10 with the heme-bound CO result in two active site conformers as manifested in the vibrational spectra. Visible excitation resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed two distinct Fe–CO stretching frequencies (νFe–CO) at 543 and 515 cm-1 that correlate with two C–O stretching frequencies at 1909 and 1948 cm-1, respectively (10Das T.K. Friedman J.M. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C–O stretching frequencies observed in the resonance Raman spectra are consistent with those measured by Fourier transform IR in which broad, strong transitions were detected at 1912 and 1956 cm-1, and a weak shoulder was detected at 1965 cm-1 (9Peterson E.S. Huang S.C. Wang J.Q. Miller L.M. Vidugiris G. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Chance M.R. Wittenberg J.B. Friedman J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13110-13121Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The conformer with the high Fe–CO stretching frequency (543 cm-1) was termed the H conformer and that with the lower frequency (515 cm-1) was termed the L conformer. It was proposed that the population giving rise to the 543/1909–1912 cm-1 set of peaks corresponds to a conformation of the distal heme pocket in which the B10 and E7 residues are in close proximity to the bound CO. This postulate was supported by studies of the Tyr-B10 → Phe mutant in which the 543/1909–1912 cm-1 bands were absent (9Peterson E.S. Huang S.C. Wang J.Q. Miller L.M. Vidugiris G. Kloek A.P.

Thus these solution phase studies show that there is conformational heterogeneity associated with the distal heme pocket of the CO-bound derivative of Ascaris Hb. Moreover, the vibrational data indicate that in solution there are accessible conformations of the distal pocket of Ascaris HbCO that can support strong interactions between polar residues and the CO ligand (10Das T.K. Friedman J.M. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), anticipated to be similar to the hydrogen bonding patterns for the oxy complex of Ascaris Hb as suggested by the kinetics (1Davenport H.E.

A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the x-ray crystallographic data from the dioxygen derivative of Ascaris Hb reveals only a single well defined conformation of the distal heme pocket (5Yang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Mathews F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the crystal structure for Ascaris HbCO is not available, preventing a direct comparison. Indeed, it is possible that the presence of only one conformation for the dioxygen derivative in the x-ray structure may be an artifact of a crystal versus solution comparison. Nevertheless, it is more plausible that heme-bound dioxygen, because of its strong hydrogen bonding tendencies, is likely to heavily bias the distribution of accessible distal heme pocket conformations toward conformations that favor the network-forming interactions among B10, E7, and the bound dioxygen. Heme-bound CO is less likely to bias the distribution in the same way, as the CO ligand has lesser capacity for hydrogen bonding than dioxygen. Solution UV excitation resonance Raman spectra are consistent with this scenario, displaying ligand-specific differences in the degree of polar interaction between the heme-bound ligand and the B10 tyrosine (8Huang S. Huang J. Kloek A.P. Goldberg D.E. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 958-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The above analysis suggests that the distribution of conformers of the distal heme pocket of Ascaris Hb is likely to be ligand-dependent. To test this hypothesis spectroscopically, one would like to characterize the conformational distribution of the dioxygen derivative. That is a tricky task because the vibrational frequencies of the dioxygen derivative (Fe–O–O) are often insensitive to environmental changes (14Hirota S. Li T. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7845-7846Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). (For an exception to insensitivity see Ref. 15Das T.K. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M. Rousseau D.L. Proc.

We propose to use heme-bound CO as a spectroscopic antenna to probe the original distribution of conformers for the dioxygen derivative of Ascaris Hb, by utilizing sol-gel encapsulation.

Protocol 1, trapping the dioxygen derivative equilibrium structure HbO2→gelationandaging[HbO2]→COexposure[HboxyCO] Protocol 2, trapping the CO derivative equilibrium structureHbCO→gelationandaging[HbCO]SCHEME 1 The first step is to encapsulate the dioxygen derivative in the porous sol-gel and let the gel age, thus trapping the equilibrium conformational distribution of Ascaris dioxygen Hb (HbO2). In the second step, the dioxygen ligand is replaced by CO, as the sol-gel readily allows the exchange of solute and small ligands in and out of the gel matrix and the protein. However, the sol-gel environment impedes any large scale movements, drastically slowing down the conformational relaxation triggered by the ligation change, essentially “locking in” the initial quaternary and even tertiary structure of the protein. Indeed, previous studies show that sol-gel encapsulation protocols can be used to lock in nonequilibrium quaternary and tertiary conformations of tetrameric Hb (16Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L.

We use square brackets to denote entrapment of the equilibrium structure of the protein during gelation, and changes made in sample after gelation are differentiated by identifying the initial structure as a subscript. For example, [HbCO] denotes a sol-gel sample of the CO derivative, and [HboxyCO] denotes a sample that was initially trapped in sol-gel as the dioxygen derivative and only subsequently to gelation and aging was the dioxygen replaced by a CO ligand (see Scheme 1). The latter sample could then be probed spectroscopically. The Fe–CO frequencies in the Raman spectra are used to determine whether the distribution of the distal heme pocket conformers is dependent on the history of the sample with the expectation that the sample that was initially oxygenated should manifest an enhanced population of the bound CO that is influenced by the close proximity of the B10 tyrosine. Extending the study to Ascaris mutants allows examination of the effect of specific residues in the distal pocket and their polarity on the conformational distribution. The mutant forms are selected based largely on the anticipated variation in hydrogen bonding patterns. Additionally, a study of the mutants was conducted in solution for the purpose of assigning various stretching and bending frequencies with different conformers, in particular for those associated with the FeCO moiety. These assignments allow us to compare the solution data, and the sol-gel data (both protocols), and make a comparative analysis of the population distribution of individual FeCO conformers. The results show that the sol-gel encapsulation can slow or prevent re-equilibration within the distal heme pocket of Ascaris Hb and that the distribution of distal heme pocket conformers for the CO derivative of Ascaris Hb in the sol-gel is highly dependent on the history of the sample. The results support a picture in which the dioxygen derivative biases the population more strongly toward a tightly packed configuration that favors a network of strong hydrogen bonding interactions. Purification of Active Site Mutants of Ascaris Hb—The active site mutants, at E7 and F7 positions (all are D1 domain mutants), and the wild type (either the D1 or D2 domains) proteins were prepared as described elsewhere (25Kloek A.P.

The optical absorption spectra (UV-2100U spectrophotometer, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) were recorded prior to and after the Raman experiments to ensure stability of a sample in its desired ligation state. Sample concentrations were 50–500 μm Hb in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 or 50 mm BisTris acetate, pH 6.5. The reduced Hb samples were made by the addition of a freshly prepared dithionite solution to the degassed protein in solution under anaerobic conditions. Ascaris HbCO was prepared by exposing dithionite-reduced samples to either 12C16O or 13C18O in tightly sealed Raman cells. 13C18O gas was a product of ICON (Mt. Marion, NY), and 12C16O was obtained from Matheson (Rutherford, NJ). The laser power was maintained at ∼0.5 milliwatt at the sample to minimize CO dissociation. For the reduced (deoxy) protein, the laser power was 5 milliwatts. The procedures for making the resonance Raman measurements with sol-gel samples in NMR tubes have been described elsewhere (16Das T.K. Khan I. Rousseau D.L. Friedman J.M. Biospectroscopy. 1999; 5: S64-S70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance Raman spectra in the low frequency region are usually normalized to the intensity of ν7 line at ∼675 cm-1 for comparison. Preparation of Sol-gel Encapsulated Hb—Sol-gel encapsulated Hb samples were prepared as thin films lining the bottom of either 5- or 10-mm diameter NMR tubes, following the method described previously (22Das T.K.

The deoxy samples were prepared using a minimal quantity of aqueous dithionite under anaerobic conditions (ligation states of Hb were verified by optical spectra). The dioxygen ligand was replaced by changing the buffer with CO-saturated buffer also containing dithionite. Because the oxy form of the Gln-E7 → His mutant was not stable, first the Met form was encapsulated, and subsequently CO and dithionite were added (to reduce the heme iron). Anaerobic conditions were maintained in the NMR tube containing sol-gel samples for making the CO derivatives. When needed as a control, sol-gels of the CO derivative, [HbCO], were also made and compared both to solution samples of the CO derivative and to sol-gels of the original dioxygen derivative, [HboxyCO]. Optical Spectra—The optical spectra of the E7 and F7 Ascaris Hb mutants in the visible region (Fig. 2) are useful for examination of the ligation states of the heme. The spectra of the deoxy species of all the mutants studied here except the Gln-E7 → His mutant are typical of high spin ferrous Hbs, displaying a broad band centered at ∼555 nm. In contrast, the spectrum of the Gln-E7 → His mutant is indicative of a six-coordinate ferrous low spin heme with the signature bands at 530 and 559 nm. Similar six-coordinate low spin ferrous species have also been observed in some other non-vertebrate Hbs (27Das T.K. Lee H.C. Duff S.M.G. Hill R.D. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L.

Upon binding with exogenous ligands, however, the intrinsic sixth ligand is displaced in these hemoglobins. In a similar manner, CO replaces the resident sixth ligand in the Gln-E7 → His mutant, and the CO complex displays two visible bands at ∼540 and ∼570 nm, similar to those in the CO complex of the wild type and of the other Ascaris mutants studied here. Optical spectra, however, do not provide the stereochemical details that are essential for understanding ligand interactions in the heme pocket. Assignment of νFe–CO in CO Complex of E7 Mutants in Solution—The low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectra of hemeproteins is composed of several in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational modes of the heme, including heme substituent modes and ligand vibrational modes. The enhancement of the vibrational modes involving the axial ligand bound to the iron arises from electronic coupling of the ligand orbitals to the heme orbitals. Detection of a ligand vibrational mode is extremely useful as it directly identifies a particular ligand and the nature of its interactions with amino acid residues in the heme pocket. The Fe–CO stretching mode (νFe–CO) in the CO complex of hemeproteins is sensitive to interactions of the bound CO with neighboring residues. In the low frequency region of the resonance Raman spectrum, the wild type Ascaris Hb has two νFe–CO frequencies, at 543 and 515 cm-1 assigned by CO isotope replacement experiments (10Das T.K.

The νFe–CO modes in Gln-E7 → Leu mutant are assigned at 536 and 493 cm-1 (Table I) and confirmed by isotope (13C18O) replacement experiments (Fig. 3, spectra b and a). The corresponding lines with 13C18O appear at 520 and 482 cm-1, respectively, close to the values expected for a two-body harmonic oscillator between the iron and the CO. Two Fe–C–O bending modes (δFe–C–O) are detected at 587 and 576 cm-1 for the 12C16O complex and shift to 566 and 556 cm-1, respectively, with 13C18O. The 587 cm-1 mode is much stronger than the 576 cm-1 mode and can be seen readily in the absolute spectrum. However, in the isotope difference (12C16O–13C18O) spectrum, spectrum c, two sets of bands are clearly seen. We assign the two bending modes at 587 and 576 cm-1 to be associated with the conformers that have νFe–CO at 537 and 493 cm-1, respectively. Detection of multiple bending modes associated with multiple FeCO conformers is rare in hemeproteins.Fig. 5Resonance Raman spectra of the CO complex of the Gln-E7 → His mutant of Ascaris Hb in solution and in sol-gel.

Observation of a νFe–CO at 492 cm-1 suggests that the heme-bound CO does not experience significant polar interactions with its neighboring residues, in contrast to the heme pocket structural features of the wild type protein. A 530 cm-1 line may be assigned to a second but very weak νFe–CO mode. A single Fe–C–O bending mode (δFe–C–O), albeit weak, is assigned at 575 cm-1.
