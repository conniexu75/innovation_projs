https://openalex.org/W1727290854,"The purpose of this study was to develop a method of classifying cancers to specific diagnostic categories based on their gene expression signatures using artificial neural networks (ANNs). We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell tumors (SRBCTs) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The ANNs correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2170881661,"From 28 young children in the Netherlands, we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative new member of the Metapneumovirus genus based on virological data, sequence homology and gene constellation. Previously, avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus, hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus: human metapneumovirus. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of five years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years."

https://openalex.org/W1577139444,"The adipocyte fatty-acid–binding protein, aP2, has an important role in regulating systemic insulin resistance and lipid metabolism. Here we demonstrate that aP2 is also expressed in macrophages, has a significant role in their biological responses and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice also deficient for aP2 showed protection from atherosclerosis in the absence of significant differences in serum lipids or insulin sensitivity. aP2-deficient macrophages showed alterations in inflammatory cytokine production and a reduced ability to accumulate cholesterol esters when exposed to modified lipoproteins. Apoe−/− mice with Ap2+/+ adipocytes and Ap2−/− macrophages generated by bone-marrow transplantation showed a comparable reduction in atherosclerotic lesions to those with total aP2 deficiency, indicating an independent role for macrophage aP2 in atherogenesis. Through its distinct actions in adipocytes and macrophages, aP2 provides a link between features of the metabolic syndrome and could be a new therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis."

The receptor polypeptides share 77% amino acid sequence identity and are type II transmembrane proteins. The extracellular domain of each comprises seven 23-residue tandem repeats and a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD). Cross-linking, equilibrium ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism studies of soluble recombinant fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR have been used to show that the extracellular domain of each receptor is a tetramer stabilized by an α-helical stalk. Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind ligands bearing mannose and related sugars through the CRDs. The CRDs of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide 130- and 17-fold more tightly than mannose, and affinity for a glycopeptide bearing two such oligosaccharides is increased by a further factor of 5- to 25-fold. These results indicate that the CRDs contain extended or secondary oligosaccharide binding sites that accommodate mammalian-type glycan structures. When the CRDs are clustered in the tetrameric extracellular domain, their arrangement provides a means of amplifying specificity for multiple glycans on host molecules targeted by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.

However, it is expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelium, the endothelium of lymph node sinuses, and placental capillary endothelium, rather than on dendritic cells. Low levels of DC-SIGN are co-expressed with DC-SIGNR on lymph node sinus endothelium. 2E. J. Soilleux, personal communication. 2E. J.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of each consists of a series of seven and a half tandem repeats of a highly conserved sequence of 23 amino acids followed by a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Both ICAM-3 and gp120 carry an abundance of N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides. Binding of ICAM-3 to DC-SIGN requires Ca2+, and interaction between DC-SIGN and gp120 is inhibited by mannan, mannose, and EGTA (1Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F.

A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that ligand binding is probably mediated through binding of carbohydrates by the CRD in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This hypothesis is consistent with the presence of residues believed to be necessary for mannose-binding to a C-type CRD in both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (7Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that the repeating sequences between the transmembrane region and the CRDs mediate oligomer formation by forming an α-helical coiled-coil (2Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 4Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Similar structures mediate the oligomerization of other cell surface C-type lectins such as the mammalian hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, and the subunit organization of these oligomeric complexes is critical to their biological functions. Polymorphic variants of the DC-SIGNR cDNA have been identified in which the length of the encoded neck regions differ, indicating that the cell-surface role of DC-SIGNR could be influenced by its specific neck structure (5Bashirova A.A. Geijtenbeek T.B.H. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. van Vliet S.J. Eilering J.B.G. Martin M.P. Wu L. Martin T.D. Viebig N. Knolle P.A. KewalRamani V.N. van Kooyk Y. Carrington M. J. Exptl. Med. 2001; 193: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).In this study, soluble recombinant fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR have been used to demonstrate that the extracellular domain of each molecule is a tetramer stabilized by an α-helical neck and that the individual CRDs possess high affinity for mannose-containing oligosaccharides. This information suggests that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR employ a novel mechanism of carbohydrate recognition to achieve specificity for their natural ligands by binding multiple high mannose oligosaccharides spaced at appropriate distances on the surface of a limited number of glycoproteins.RESULTSFragments of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, representing the CRDs alone and the complete extracellular domains, were expressed inE. coli and purified on Man-Sepharose (Fig.2). Although the CRD fragments of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are retarded on the columns, they elute predominantly in the wash fractions and thus bind mannose relatively weakly. The extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind to the columns with greater affinity and are retained in the presence of Ca2+ and elute with EDTA.Physical CharacterizationThe oligomeric states of the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR fragments were examined by chemical cross-linking in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Fig.3). Dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the extracellular domain fragments were detected at increasing concentrations of cross-linking reagent. The pattern observed was the same in both the presence and absence of Ca2+ and was almost identical for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. These results suggest that the extracellular domain of each protein exists in solution as a tetramer. Similar treatment of the CRDs produced only a single band across the entire range of cross-linking reagent concentrations, indicating that these fragments are monomers.Figure 3Cross-linking analysis of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR fragments. Following incubation with the indicated concentrations of bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (µm), the samples were resolved on a 10% acrylamide gel that was stained with Coomassie Blue. Left panels, 10 mmCa2+; right panels, no Ca2+;ECD, extracellular domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The cross-linking results were confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4). At loading concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.5 mg/ml, the extracellular domain fragment of DC-SIGN is a single stable species with an apparent molecular mass corresponding closely to the theoretical value for a tetramer. A similar result was obtained for DC-SIGNR, analyzed over a loading concentration range of 0.02–0.8 mg/ml, again indicating the existence of a tetramer. In each case, parallel experiments using protein dialyzed into Ca2+-free buffer yielded similar results, demonstrating that tetramer formation is Ca2+-independent. Sedimentation data for the CRD fragments of both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR confirm that each CRD exists as a monomer. Thus, the neck regions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are essential for oligomer formation.Figure 4Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation analysis of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR fragments. Apparent weight-averaged molecular mass values as function of concentration for a range of loading concentrations are shown. The centrifugation speeds used were 8000 rpm for the extracellular domain (ECD) fragments and 21,000 rpm for the CRDs. Molecular masses determined by fitting the experimental data are indicated at the top rightof each panel. These values can be compared with calculated masses: DC-SIGN ECD tetramer, 157 kDa; DC-SIGNR ECD tetramer, 150 kDa; DC-SIGN CRD monomer, 17.8 kDa; DC-SIGNR CRD monomer, 16.2 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Secondary structures of the neck regions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR were determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy using the difference between spectra of the extracellular domain and CRD fragments to define the spectrum of the neck (Fig. 5). The results for both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are consistent with an α-helical conformation, as indicated by the characteristic maximum at 193 nm and minima at 208 nm and 223 nm.Figure 5Determination of the secondary structure of the neck portions of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The circular dichroism spectra of the neck polypeptides (C, F) for DC-SIGN (A–C) and DC-SIGNR (D–F) were calculated as the difference between the spectra of the extracellular domain (ECD; A, D) and the CRD spectra (B,E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The close similarity between the sequences of the neck regions in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR suggests that they could form hetero-oligomers (4Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR elute from a Mono-Q column at slightly different salt concentrations, and the two polypeptides can be resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel. When these fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are allowed to renature together, some of the protein elutes from the Mono-Q column at an intermediate elution position, suggesting that hetero-oligomers are formed. When examined by analytical gel filtration, these hetero-oligomers behave identically to the homo-oligomers, indicating that mixed tetramers are formed rather than higher order oligomers (data not shown).Monosaccharide Binding ActivityThe sugar-binding properties of the extracellular domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR were investigated using solid phase assays in which monosaccharides compete with125I-Man30-BSA for binding to the immobilized protein (Table I). Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind mannose better than they bind galactose, as expected from earlier analysis of the CRD sequences. However, the margin of specificity is narrower than for other C-type lectins, such as MBP (24Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Fay M. Drickamer K. Shao M.-C. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4810-4815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of galactose to mannose-specific C-type CRDs can occur through interactions with the C-1 and C-2 hydroxyl groups of the free sugar (25Ng K.K.-S. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To eliminate such nonphysiological binding, further competition experiments were performed with methyl glycosides. Inhibition by methyl α-galactoside is 27- to 34-fold less effective than inhibition by methyl α-mannoside, indicating a preference for methyl α-mannoside comparable with serum MBP. These results suggest that DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, like other C-type lectins, distinguish between monosaccharides through recognition of the C-3 and C-4 hydroxyl groups, and the preferred ligands have an equatorial arrangement at these positions.Table IMonosaccharide binding to the extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNRMonosaccharideDC-SIGNDC-SIGNRKIKI, Sugar/KI, ManKIKI, Sugar/KI, ManmmmmMannose13.1 ± 0.412.6 ± 0.21Methyl α-mannoside12.5 ± 0.51.0 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.1N-Acetylmannosamine8.7 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.10.50 ± 0.05Galactose72 ± 56.7 ± 0.520 ± 28.3 ± 0.6Methyl α-galactoside270 ± 1027 ± 3112 ± 234 ± 1Glucose23 ± 11.9 ± 0.37.3 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.1Methyl α-glucoside32 ± 12.6 ± 0.39.1 ± 0.42.8 ± 0.1N-Acetylglucosamine32 ± 42.5 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.22-Deoxyglucose28 ± 42.9 ± 0.67.3 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.1L-Fucose6.7 ± 0.50.50 ± 0.034.1 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.1Inhibition constants (K I) for each monosaccharide, determined by solid-phase competition assay, are derived from three independent assays each performed in duplicate. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Both DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR show preference for axial C-2 substituents, as they interact with glucose and GlcNAc more weakly than they interact with mannose. For both proteins, affinity is increased by replacement of the axial hydroxyl group of mannose with the N-acetyl group in N-acetylmannosamine. However, binding of GlcNAc to DC-SIGNR is somewhat tighter than binding to DC-SIGN. Also, DC-SIGN has higher affinity for l-fucose than for mannose whereas DC-SIGNR has higher affinity for mannose than forl-fucose.High Affinity Binding to High Mannose OligosaccharidesThe Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide of soybean agglutinin was used as a convenient, homogeneous ligand to investigate the interaction of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR with oligosaccharides similar to those found on their natural ligands. On an equimolar basis, this oligosaccharide competes for binding to the extracellular domain of DC-SIGNR 24-fold more effectively than does mannose (Fig.6 A). This type of cluster effect, in which affinity for a multivalent sugar ligand is enhanced compared with simple monosaccharides, has been observed for other C-type lectins (26Lee Y.C. Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Lonngren J. Arnarp J. Haraldsson M. Lonn H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 199-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased affinity is often related to formation of lectin oligomers in which multiple CRDs bind to multiple terminal sugar residues in the ligands. However, the results in Fig.6 B demonstrate that a comparable cluster effect for DC-SIGNR is observed for the monomeric CRD. A slightly more pronounced cluster effect is observed for the extracellular domain of DC-SIGN and a still greater effect is observed for the CRD (TableII). The fact that oligosaccharides bind with high affinity to an individual CRD in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR indicates that the CRD must make additional contacts with the oligosaccharide beyond the primary mannose-binding site. The fact that the cluster effect for the extracellular domain fragment of DC-SIGN is actually less than for the isolated CRD suggests that some of these contacts must be occluded when the CRDs are assembled in the tetramer.Figure 6Inhibition curves for125I-Man30-BSA binding by DC-SIGNR in the presence of mannose and Man9GlcNAc2.

Open table in a new tab Enhanced affinity for the Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide compared with mannose was also demonstrated using a fluid-phase assay protocol (27Hudgin R.L. Price Jr., W.E. Ashwell G. Stockert R.J. Morell A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5536-5543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the solid-phase data and ruling out the possibility that the cluster effect within the CRDs could result from the immobilization protocol (data not shown). For comparison, solid-phase competition assays were also performed using plates coated with a trimeric fragment of rat MBP. In contrast to the DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR results, the relative affinities of MBP for Man9GlcNAc2 and mannose are almost indistinguishable, confirming previous studies (28Lee R.T. Ichikawa Y. Kawasaki T. Drickamer K. Lee Y.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 299: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These findings highlight a major difference in the pattern of carbohydrate recognition displayed by these two classes of mannose-binding molecules.Because the oligosaccharides on natural ligands for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR include a range of high mannose structures, binding to these different species was compared by using the extracellular domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR to probe neoglycolipids bearing high mannose oligosaccharides derived from bovine RNase B (Fig.7). Approximate quantitation indicates that both proteins stain the species from Man5GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2 roughly in proportion to the amounts present (29Childs R.A. Feizi T. Yuen C.T. Drickamer K. Quesenberry M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20770-20777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the results obtained with the Man9GlcNAc2 test oligosaccharide reflect the likely types of interaction of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR with oligosaccharides on their glycoprotein ligands, including the Man6GlcNAc2 found on ICAM-3 isolated from human blood cells (30Funatsu O. Sato T. Kotovuori P. Gahmberg C.G. Ikekita M. Furukawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Figure 7DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR binding to neoglycolipids. Thin layer chromatograms of neoglycolipids bearing oligosaccharides derived from RNase B were incubated with125I-labeled extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR. Bound fragments were visualized using a phosphorimager.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Affinity Enhancement in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR OligomersBecause each CRD in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR can bind a high mannose oligosaccharide, it seemed plausible that the tetrameric extracellular domain fragments would bind multiple oligosaccharides. Such binding might give rise to a supercluster effect, in which oligomers would bind to ligands bearing multiple oligosaccharides more tightly than would the monomeric CRDs. In an attempt to mimic the possible arrangement of clustered high mannose oligosaccharides on gp120 and ICAM-3, a dimeric glycopeptide was created by cross-linking glycopeptides derived from soybean agglutinin. Inhibition of reporter ligand binding to DC-SIGN by the dimeric glycopeptide is 5-fold higher than inhibition by the Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide (Table II), whereas assays using the monomeric glycopeptide give KI values comparable with those of the oligosaccharide. Binding to DC-SIGNR is enhanced more than 20-fold by dimerization of the oligosaccharide.The results with the dimeric glycopeptide provide further evidence that the individual CRDs of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR bind with high affinity to closely spaced clusters of mannose residues. However, in each case the relative affinity for the dimeric glycopeptide is the same for the CRDs and the extracellular domain fragments, so there is no affinity increase for this ligand when the CRDs are assembled in the tetramer.As an alternative approach to analyzing the contribution of the tetramers to interaction with multivalent ligands, binding to Man30-BSA was investigated. Although the sugar units in this case are monomeric sugars, they are widely spaced over the protein surface and thus might be better positioned to contact multiple CRDs in the oligomer. As shown in Table II, the affinity of Man30-BSA for tetrameric forms of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR is 6 to 7-fold higher than the affinity of the monomeric CRDs. These results demonstrate that the presence of multiple CRDs in the tetrameric extracellular domain does give rise to enhanced affinity for multivalent ligands with appropriately spaced sugars.DISCUSSIONA major issue to be addressed is how the properties of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are tailored to mediate specific recognition of ICAM-3 among the many cell-surface glycoproteins that display similar oligosaccharides. Part of the selectivity for specific glycoprotein ligands resides within the CRDs. These domains are unique among those of the C-type lectin family in that they show a pronounced cluster effect in their monomeric form. Ca2+ dependence and selectivity of monosaccharide binding to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR, along with sequence comparisons, suggest that the primary binding site is analogous to that seen in other C-type CRDs. Such sites generally accommodate terminal sugar residues by direct ligation to bound Ca2+ (31Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The enhanced affinity for high mannose oligosaccharides may result from interactions with additional terminal mannose residues at a secondary site elsewhere on the CRD. Alternatively, the primary site may be extended to allow interactions with subterminal residues. In either case, theKI values determined here suggest that the CRDs bind high mannose-type oligosaccharides with submillimolar affinity.Further selectivity for glycoproteins that bear multiple high mannose oligosaccharides such as ICAM-3 and gp120 can be achieved by grouping four CRDs in a tetramer. The results comparing the binding of dimerized soybean agglutinin glycopeptide and Man30-BSA suggest that high mannose oligosaccharides would need to be placed some distance apart on a glycoprotein surface in order to interact with multiple CRDs in the tetramer. Thus, selective binding to ligands may reflect the presence of a specific geometric arrangement of high mannose oligosaccharides. Glycans on gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus presumably have a similar arrangement in order to increase viral infectivity through interactions with DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.Compared with MBP, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR employ mannose recognition in a very different way to perform distinct immunological roles. MBP binds to large glycosylated surfaces in order to direct an innate immune response to foreign organisms (32Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Each CRD in MBP binds a single terminal mannose residue and high avidity binding is only achieved by the clustering of CRDs in trimeric subunits. The large inter-CRD spacing of mannose-binding sites allows binding to widely spaced residues such as those found on the surfaces of bacterial and fungal cells, whereas endogenous mannose-containing glycans are comparatively poor ligands because of the relatively short spacing between terminal residues. In contrast, DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR may recognize multiple self-oligosaccharides in specific arrangements on the surfaces of select glycoproteins. These recognition events contribute to the formation of host cell-cell interactions, and the flow of information within the immune system.Formation of tetramers by DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR contrasts with other multimeric C-type lectins, such as MBP and asialoglycoprotein receptors, that form trimers stabilized by regions of α-helical coiled-coil adjacent to the CRDs. This diversification of oligomeric state within the C-type lectin family has probably emerged in order to accommodate distinct patterns of carbohydrate recognition. The neck structures of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are unusual, as only the first half of each 23 amino acid repeat displays a discernable pattern of hydrophobic residues, spaced at regular intervals, that is observed in most coiled-coils (33McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 34Stetefeld J. Jenny M. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Engel J. Kammerer R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, each repeat contains a proline residue. Nevertheless, the circular dichroism experiments indicate that the repeats fold in an α-helical conformation. Thus, these two molecules may present a novel form of tetrameric coiled-coil motif.Hetero-oligomeric complexes can be formed between the extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR. However, these could only be formed in vivo in cell types where the two receptors are co-expressed, such as lymph node sinus endothelium 2E. J. Soilleux, personal communication. and placental capillary endothelium (6Pohlmann S. Soilleux E.J. Baribaud F. Leslie G.J. Morris L.S. Trowsdale J. Lee B. Coleman N. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2670-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Moreover, possible expression of polymorphic variants of DC-SIGNR, in which neck lengths differ, would be likely to prevent such hetero-oligomer formation (5Bashirova A.A. Geijtenbeek T.B.H. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. van Vliet S.J. Eilering J.B.G. Martin M.P. Wu L. Martin T.D. Viebig N. Knolle P.A. KewalRamani V.N. van Kooyk Y. Carrington M. J. Exptl. Med. 2001; 193: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).Based on the close sequence similarity between DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR and the physical studies presented here, it can be concluded that these two proteins are very similar in overall structure. They also show similar ligand binding characteristics with the various test ligands employed. However, subtle differences in carbohydrate binding are evident, both at the monosaccharide level and in the way that the CRDs and oligomers interact with clustered ligands. For example, it is particularly striking that close spacing of two oligosaccharides causes substantially greater increase in"

Immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicated that the fusion antigens were synthesized in transformed tuber tissues and assembled into cholera holotoxin-like structures that retained enterocyte-binding affinity. Orally immunized mice generated detectable levels of serum and intestinal antibodies against the pathogen antigens. Elevated levels of interleukin 2 (IL2) and interferon γ (INFγ) detected in immunogen-challenged spleen cells from the immunized mice indicated the presence of a strong Th1 immune response to the three plant-synthesized antigens. This result was supported by flow cytometry analysis of immunized mouse spleen cells that showed a significant increase in CD4+ lymphocyte numbers. Diarrhea symptoms were reduced in severity and duration in passively immunized mouse neonates following rotavirus challenge. The results suggest that food plants can function as vaccines for simultaneous protection against infectious virus and bacterial diseases.

We found that the distal p53-binding site of the p21 promoter acts as an enhancer on the homologous or heterologous promoters in hepatoma HepG2 cells. In transfection experiments, p53 transactivated the p21 promoter in HaCaT cells that express Sp1 but have a mutated p53 form. In contrast, p53 could not transactivate the p21 promoter in the Drosophilaembryo-derived Schneider's SL2 cells that lack endogenous Sp1 or related factors. Cotransfection of SL2 cells with p53 and Sp1 resulted in a synergistic transactivation of the p21 promoter. Synergistic transactivation was greatly decreased in SL2 cells and HaCaT cells by mutations in either the p53-binding site or in the −82/−77 Sp1-binding site indicating functional cooperation between Sp1 and p53 in the transactivation of the p21 promoter. Synergistic transactivation was also decreased by mutations in the transactivation domain of p53. Physical interactions between Sp1 and p53 proteins were established by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays. By using deletion mutants we found that the DNA binding domain of Sp1 is required for its physical interaction with p53. In conclusion, Sp1 must play a critical role in regulating important biological processes controlled by p53 via p21 gene activation such as DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

In the cells, p21 is found in quaternary complexes that consist of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs),1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a subunit of DNA polymerase δ (3Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The formation of these complexes is essential for cell cycle progression (4Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Casso D.

However, changes in p21 stoichiometry that could be controlled at the transcriptional level result in suppression of CDK activity, allowing the accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb and cell cycle arrest in G1 (2Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 7Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C.

By interacting directly with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p21 prevents DNA synthesis and regulates DNA methylation (8Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Thus, p21 plays important roles in DNA repair and in the control of cell senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation (9Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M.

A key regulator of p21 is the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53, which plays a central role in a protein network that controls cell cycle progression, differentiation, DNA repair, and apoptosis (12Vogelstein B.

The function of p53 as a tumor suppressor is supported by the finding that mice in which the p53 gene was inactivated by homologous recombination spontaneously developed tumors at a young age (22Choi J. Donehower L.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Over 10,000 human tumor-associated mutations of p53 have been discovered to date (12Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). Most mutations are localized in the DNA binding domain and the C-terminal regulatory domain of the protein (12Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5821) Google Scholar). The p53 protein can be structurally and functionally divided into the following four domains: an N-terminal acidic transcription activation domain between amino acids 1 and 42 that interacts with factors of the basal transcription machinery (TAFII70 and TAFII31) as well as the negative regulator of p53 activity MDM2 protein; a DNA binding domain between amino acids 102 and 292; an oligomerization domain between amino acids 324 and 355; and a C-terminal regulatory domain between amino acids 367 and 393 that may affect the DNA binding function of p53 protein by steric or allosteric interactions (23Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). In addition to p53, other inducers of p21 gene expression include factors that control differentiation of diverse cell types such as steroid hormones (24Jiang H. Lin J. Su Z.Z. Collart F.R.

The majority of the regulatory modulators of p21 including TGF-β1, progesterone, phorbol esters, and phosphatase inhibitors affect p21 gene expression via Sp1 proteins (Sp1 and Sp3) bound to the proximal promoter region between nucleotides −120 and −50 relative to the transcription initiation site (38Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a member of a family of transcription factors with zinc finger-type DNA binding domains that binds to GC-rich or GT-rich DNA sequences (39Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 40Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Mice in which the Sp1 gene was inactivated by homologous recombination die at approximately day 11.5 of gestation indicating that Sp1 plays a pivotal role in development (41Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Sp1 does not seem to be required for the regulation of CpG island methylation but rather is required for the maintenance of terminal cell differentiation by regulating the expression of the MeCP2gene (41Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The Sp1 protein is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (42Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and is heavilyO-glycosylated, a modification that seems to confer resistance to proteasome-dependent degradation (43Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Domains in Sp1 protein that are crucial for its transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization functions were identified using theDrosophila embryo-derived Schneider's SL2 cells (44Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line lacks endogenous Sp1 or Sp1-related activities, and thus it is a very useful model for studies of Sp1-dependent mechanisms of transcriptional activation of eukaryotic genes (45Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The N-terminal glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich domains are essential for transcriptional activation (45Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Sp1 is involved in interaction with other transcription factors (46Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been shown to interact directly with proteins of the basal transcription machinery such as TFIID components (47Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Sp1 interacts physically and cooperates functionally with several sequence-specific activators including NF-κB, GATA, YY1, E2F1, pRb, and SREBP-1 (48Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 49Udvadia A.J. Templeton D.J. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, although Sp1 has been traditionally considered as a ubiquitous factor closely associated with core promoter activities, it has been recently shown that it participates in several cases of regulated gene transcription triggered by multiple signaling pathways and metabolic or differentiation conditions. We have shown recently that Smad3 and Smad4 proteins, which are key effectors in the TGF-β signaling pathway, and Jun members, which are activated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, transactivate the p21 promoter by interacting physically and functionally with Sp1 bound to the proximal −120/−50 region (37Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 52Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

In both cases, no direct binding of Smad or Jun proteins to DNA occurred but rather an enhanced affinity of Sp1 for its cognate sites on the p21 promoter was observed in the presence of the activators (52Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,53Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P.

In the present study we present evidence that Sp1 bound to the proximal p21 promoter is essential for the transactivation of this promoter by p53. p53 cannot transactivate the p21 promoter in DrosophilaSL2 cells which lack endogenous Sp1 activities. Coexpression of p53 and Sp1 in SL2 cells resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of the wild type p21 promoter but not of the promoter mutated in either the distal p53 or the proximal −82/−77 Sp1-binding site. GST pull-down experiments and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that the functional synergism between Sp1 and p53 is the result of physical interactions between the two proteins. Our findings suggest that Sp1 plays a critical role in regulating important biological processes controlled by p53 via p21 gene activation including DNA repair, cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. The p21 promoter plasmids −2,325/+8 luc, −215/+8 luc, −143/+8 luc, −2,325/+8 Δ-122/−60 p21 luc, and −1,890/+8 p21 CAT have been described previously (37Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The reporter plasmids −2,325/−1,890 p21 tk CAT and −1,890/−2,325 p21 tk CAT were constructed as follows. The HindIII/SspI p21 promoter fragment (−2,325/−1,890) was excised from plasmid −2,325/+8 p21 CAT (37Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The p21 promoter fragment was subsequently excised from the pBluescript vectors by XbaI and KpnI and was inserted into the corresponding sites of vector −85 tk-CAT. The reporter plasmids −2,325/−2,260 p21 tk CAT and 2,260/−1,890 p21 tk CAT were constructed by excising the −2,325/−2,260 (HindIII/SacI) and −2,260/−1,890 (SacI/SspI) promoter fragments from plasmid −2,325/+8 p21 CAT, blunting them by Klenow DNA polymerase, and subcloning them into the SmaI site of vector −85 tk CAT. The −2,325/−2,260 p21 fragment was also cloned into theSacI site of plasmids −215/+8 p21 luc and pG5Bluc to create plasmids (−2,325/−2,260) −215/+8 p21 luc and (−2,325/−2,260) pG5B luc.

Delidakis, University of Crete and the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Heraklion, Greece. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells, human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, and human HaCaT keratinocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. DrosophilaSchneider's SL2 cells were cultured in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% insect culture-tested fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 25 °C. Transient transfections were performed using either the Ca3(PO4)2 coprecipitation or the LipofectAMINE method (53Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

Luciferase assays were performed using the luciferase assay kit fromPromega Corp. according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of proteinsin vitro was performed using the coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TNT) of Promega Corp. according to the manufacturer's instructions. Labeling of in vitroexpressed proteins was done by the inclusion of 20 µCi of [35S]methionine in the TNT reaction mixture. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH-10β. Bacteria were grown overnight, diluted 1:25, and, after reaching anA 600 of 0.7, were stimulated with 250 µm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then harvested, resuspended in 1/10 of the original culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated for 1 min in PBS on ice, lysed by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, and cleared by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm, at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellets were redissolved in solubilization buffer (1 mm EDTA, 25 mmtriethanolamine, 1.5% N-laurylsarcosine) for 10 min, at 4 °C, with gentle agitation. Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2% and CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm were added, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, at 4 °C, for 10 min. The solubilization of the expressed proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were equilibrated in PBS and mixed with 1 volume of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins on a rotary shaker for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed one time with an equal volume of 2× interaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 0.4% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Coupling efficiency was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. For the binding reaction, 50 µl of 1:1 bead slurry in 200 µl of 1× interaction buffer was combined with 5 µl of a35S-labeled reticulocyte lysate in a final volume of 400 µl on a rotary shaker for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 3 times with 20 volumes of washing buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCL, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aprotinin), and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, COS-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 13 µg/ml aprotinin, and 6.7 µg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then pre-cleared by incubation with 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer on a rotating platform for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by 30 s of centrifugation and collection of the supernatant. Supernatants were incubated with 0.8 µg/ml of polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (PEP-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on a rotating platform overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 30 µl of protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer for 3 h. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer, precipitated, and resuspended in equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer to Protran nitrocellulose transfer membranes 0.45 µm (Schleicher & Schuell). Immunoblotting was performed with 22 ng/ml of monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and visualization by treatment with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (55Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (; Correction (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7956): 19871-19877PubMed Google Scholar). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed to generate the double-stranded oligonucleotide probe and labeled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP as described (55Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (; Correction (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7956): 19871-19877PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense oligonucleotide used as probe is as follows: p21 (−2,285/−2,255): 5′-ATC AGG AAC ATG TCC CAA CAT GTT GAG CTC T-3′. We have shown previously that the activity of the promoter of the human CDK inhibitor p21 gene in human hepatoma HepG2 cells is controlled by two distinct regions as follows: one distal region between nucleotides −2,325 and −1,890 that seems to act as a transcriptional enhancer, and one proximal region defined by nucleotides −120 to −50 that contains six binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 (37Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Deletion of the proximal or the distal region resulted in 95 and 70% reduction in p21 promoter activity in HepG2 cells, respectively (Fig.1 A and Ref. 37Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a functional cooperation between factors bound to the distal enhancer region and the proximal region. To characterize further the distal p21 promoter and identify regions important for its enhancer activity, a series of reporter plasmids was constructed in which different segments of the −2,325/−1,890 region were placed upstream of the heterologous herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter −85/+1 that contains one Sp1-binding site (Fig. 1 B). These p21/tk-CAT reporter constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and their activity was measured by CAT analysis. It was found that the −2,325/−1,890 p21 promoter region caused a 43.5- and 51.5-fold transactivation respectively of the tk promoter when placed in either the forward or the reverse orientation relative to the orientation of the tk promoter and the CATgene. This finding confirmed the role of the −2,325/−1,890 p21 promoter region as a transcriptional enhancer in HepG2 cells. The −2,325/−1,890 region of the p21 promoter contains a previously identified binding site for the p53 tumor suppressor protein in the region −2,281/−2,269 (13El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E.

Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar). p53 expressed in HepG2 cells binds effectively to this region (Fig. 1, D and E). To study the contribution of the p53-responsive element on the enhancer activity of the −2,325/−1,890 region, additional reporter plasmids were generated. In these constructs, the −2,325/−1,890 promoter region was subdivided into the following two parts: the −2,325/−2,260 region, which contains the p53-responsive element, and the −2,260/−1,890 region, which lacks the p53-binding site. Both regions were placed upstream of the tk promoter and theCAT gene. Transfections of HepG2 cells and CAT analysis showed that full enhancer activity was retained by the −2,325/−2,260 region that contains the p53-responsive element and that this activity was lost when the −2,260/−1,890 region was used (Fig.1 B). To test the ability of the −2,325/−2,260 p21 region to act as a transcriptional enhancer on its homologous promoter, this region was placed immediately upstream of the −215/+8 p21 promoter. Transfection experiments in HepG2 cells showed that the −2,325/−2,260 p21 promoter region transactivated strongly (28-fold) the −215/+8 proximal p21 promoter (Fig. 1 C). The combined data of Fig. 1,A–C, indicate that the distal"

Recently, the VHL-Elongin BC complex was found to interact with a module composed of Cullin family member Cul2 and RING-H2 finger protein Rbx1 to reconstitute a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that activates ubiquitylation by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc5 and Cdc34. In the context of the VHL ubiquitin ligase, Elongin BC functions as an adaptor that links the VHL protein to the Cul2/Rbx1 module, raising the possibility that the Elongin BC complex could function as an integral component of a larger family of E3 ubiquitin ligases by linking alternative BC-box proteins to Cullin/Rbx1 modules. In this report, we describe identification and purification from rat liver of a novel leucine-rich repeat-containing BC-box protein, MUF1, which we demonstrate is capable of assembling with a Cullin/Rbx1 module containing the Cullin family member Cul5 to reconstitute ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition, we show that the additional BC-box proteins Elongin A, SOCS1, and WSB1 are also capable of assembling with the Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute potential ubiquitin ligases.

The Elongin BC complex was initially identified as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A, which is one of several transcription factors capable of stimulating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in vitro (1Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Elongin BC complex was subsequently found to be a component of the multiprotein von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)1 tumor suppressor complex (2Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P.

Science. 1995; 269: 1444-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Interaction of Elongin BC with Elongin A and VHL depends on binding of Elongin C to an ∼10 amino acid degenerate sequence motif, referred to as the BC-box, which has the consensus sequence ((A,P,S,T)LXXXCXXX(A,I,L,V)) and which is the only sequence shared between Elongin A and VHL (2Duan D.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of the VHL-Elongin BC complex revealed that binding of Elongin BC to the BC-box is governed by interaction of the highly conserved leucine at position 2 in the N terminus of the BC-box motif with a hydrophobic pocket created by residues in the C-terminal half of Elongin C (5Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Elongin B binds to a short N-terminal Elongin C region and does not appear to interact directly with the BC-box. In addition to Elongin A and VHL, Elongin BC binds to a large number of additional proteins including members of the SOCS-box protein family (6Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G.

Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that the Elongin BC complex could function as an integral component of a larger family of E3 ubiquitin ligases by linking additional BC-box containing substrate recognition subunits to Cullin/Rbx1 modules. To address this possibility, we sought to determine whether additional BC-box proteins might also function as components of ubiquitin ligases. In a previous study, we identified and partially purified multiple, chromatographically distinct Elongin BC-containing species from rat liver (6Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Here we report purification of one of these species to near homogeneity and identification of a novel leucine-rich repeat-containing BC-box protein, MUF1, which we demonstrate is capable of assembling with a Cullin/Rbx1 module containing Cullin family member Cul5 to reconstitute ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition, we show that the additional BC-box proteins Elongin A, SOCS1, and WSB1 are also capable of assembling with the same Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute potential ubiquitin ligases. Taken together, our findings identify MUF1 as a new member of the BC-box family of proteins, and they predict the existence of a larger family of Elongin BC-based ubiquitin ligases. Male Harlan-Sprague Dawley rats (200–300 g) were purchased from Harlan-Sprague Dawley.

Anti-Elongin C monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Myc (9E10) and anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-T7 monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen, and anti-GST (4C10) monoclonal antibody was from Covance.

After 45 min, the slurry was filtered at 500 ml/h in a 10.5-cm diameter column and then washed at the same flow rate with Buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The phosphocellulose column was eluted stepwise at 800 ml/h with Buffer A containing 0.3 m KCl, and 160-ml fractions were collected.

The AcA 34 column was eluted at 20 ml/h, and 10-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing Elongin B, which eluted as a discrete species with an apparent native molecular mass between 150 and 250 kDa, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) to a conductivity equivalent to that of Buffer C containing 80 mm KCl.

The TSK DEAE 5-PW column was eluted at the same flow rate with a 250-ml linear gradient from 80 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer C, and 5-ml fractions were collected.

Following centrifugation for 20 min at 60,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was applied at 1 ml/min to a 7.5 × 75-mm TSK SP 5-PW HPLC column (Toso Haas) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A containing 40 mmKCl. The TSK SP 5-PW column was eluted at the same flow rate with a 30-ml linear gradient from 40 to 500 mm KCl in Buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected.

Following centrifugation for 20 min at 60,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a 7.5 × 75-mm TSK phenyl 5-PW HPLC column (Toso Haas) pre-equilibrated in Buffer C containing 1.0m (NH4)2SO4. The TSK phenyl-5-PW column was eluted at the same flow rate with a 20-ml linear gradient from 1.0 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4 in Buffer C, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing Elongin B, which eluted between 60 and 30 mm(NH4)2SO4, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C containing 30 mm KCl to a conductivity equivalent to that of Buffer C containing 40 mm KCl. Following centrifugation for 20 min at 60,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was applied at 0.2 ml/min to a 4.6 × 35-mm TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC column (Toso Haas) pre-equilibrated in Buffer C containing 40 mm KCl. The TSK DEAE-NPR column was eluted at the same flow rate with a 6-ml linear gradient from 40 to 350 mm KCl in Buffer C, and 0.2-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing Elongin B eluted between 70 and 110 mmKCl. The MUF1-Elongin BC-containing complex was fractionated by 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, excised, and subjected to in-gel reduction,S-carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion. Peptide sequences were determined in a single run by microcapillary reversed-phase chromatography coupled to the electrospray ionization source of a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan LCQ, San Jose, CA). Identification of human and mouse expressed sequence tags that encoded MUF1 peptide sequences was facilitated by the algorithm SEQUEST and by programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Analysis Facility (24Chittum H.S.

IMAGE Consortium cDNA clones (accession numbers AA023471 and AA111647) encoding the mouse MUF1 ORF were obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Human Ubc5a containing an N-terminal 6-histidine tag and a C-terminal Flag tag, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Uba1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal 6-histidine tag, and mammalian GST-ubiquitin were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni2+-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as previously described (12Kamura T.

After dialysis against 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, proteins were stored at −80 °C. cDNA encoding wild type mouse MUF1 and mouse MUF1 double point mutant MUF1[L24P;C28F] containing N-terminal 6-histidine and Flag tags, mouse WSB1 containing N-terminal 6-histidine and Flag tags, and human Cul1 and Cul2 containing N-terminal HA tags were subcloned into pBacPAK 8. cDNA encoding rat Elongin A containing an N-terminal Flag tag and human Cul3, mouse Cul4, and human Cul5 containing N-terminal HA tags were subcloned into pBacPAK 9. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated with the BacPAK baculovirus expression system (CLONTECH). Baculoviruses encoding human VHL, human Elongin B, human Elongin C, and mouse Rbx1 containing an N-terminal Myc tag, and mouse SOCS1 containing N-terminal 6-histidine, T7, and Xpress tags were previously described (6Kamura T.

Sf21 cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Sf21 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses indicated in the figures. Sixty h after infection, cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml antipain, 5 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 µg/ml aprotinin. Sf21 cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose and the antibodies indicated in the figures. Protein A-Sepharose was washed 3 times in buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized by Western blotting with Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Sf21 cells co-infected with the baculoviruses indicated in the figures were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml antipain, 5 µg/ml pepstatin, and 5 µg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 2 µg of anti-Flag antibody and 10 µl of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were mixed with ∼50 ng of Uba1, ∼100 ng of hUbc5a, and ∼3 µg of GST-ubiquitin in a 20-µl reaction containing 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 60 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1.5 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 26 °C. Reaction products were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-GST antibodies. A multiprotein Elongin BC-containing complex was purified from a post-nuclear supernatant prepared from ∼3 kg of rat liver by 0–38% (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, followed by chromatography on consecutive phosphocellulose, Ultrogel AcA 34, TSK DEAE 5-PW, TSK SP 5-PW, TSK phenyl-PW, and TSK DEAE-NPR columns (Fig. 1 A). Purification of the Elongin BC-containing complex was monitored by Western blotting of aliquots of column fractions using anti-Elongin B antibodies. Analysis of the final TSK DEAE-NPR column fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the ∼19-Da Elongin B protein copurified with five additional polypeptides of ∼90, ∼45, ∼30, ∼20, and ∼15 kDa (Fig. 1 B). The identities of the ∼19- and ∼15-Da proteins as Elongin B and Elongin C were confirmed by ion trap mass spectrometry (data not shown). The ∼45-, ∼30-, and ∼20-kDa polypeptides were identified by ion trap mass spectrometry as the EAP45, EAP30, and EAP20 proteins, which had previously been independently purified in association with RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL and shown to assemble into an EAP20/30/45 subcomplex in vitro and in cells (26Kamura T.

Sequence analysis of the ∼90-Da polypeptide by ion trap mass spectrometry revealed that it was a previously uncharacterized mammalian protein. Two overlapping mouse expressed sequence tags (accession numbersAA023471 and AA111647), which included all of the peptide sequences from the ∼90-kDa polypeptide, were combined to generate a 790-amino acid ORF (Fig. 2). 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends carried out with several cDNA libraries failed to identify any longer ORFs. Because a search of the GenBankTM nonredundant data base identified an expressed sequence tag designated MUF1 (accession no. CAA60013), which codes for a C-terminal portion of the predicted ORF from amino acids 226 to 776, we refer to the ∼90-kDa polypeptide as MUF1. Further analysis revealed that MUF1 is a leucine-rich repeat protein (Fig. 2) that is highly conserved in mammalian species, but failed to identify potential MUF1 orthologs in lower eukaryotes.Figure 2Sequence of MUF1. The MUF1 ORF was derived from mouse expressed sequence tags (accession numbers AA023471and AA111647). MUF1 peptide sequences determined by ion trap mass spectrometry are underlined.

The SOCS-box is an ∼50-amino acid sequence motif composed of an N-terminal Elongin BC-box and a short C-terminal proline-rich region of unknown function (6Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L.

The SOCS-box was originally identified as a conserved sequence motif in the C terminus of the SH2 domain-containing suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, which act as negative regulators of cytokine-induced Jak/STAT signaling (28Starr R.

SOCS proteins appear to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of STATs by binding to and inhibiting Jak or receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, recent studies have shown that overexpression of SOCS1 in mammalian cells can increase the rate of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of Vav, TEL-JAK2, and JAK2, consistent with the possibility that SOCS1 is a component of a ubiquitin ligase (31De Sepulveda P.

Subsequently, a larger collection of SOCS-box proteins was identified and found to include nearly 30 previously uncharacterized members of the SH2, WD-40 repeat, ankyrin repeat, SPRY, and Ras-like protein families (8Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The Elongin BC complex has been shown to interact in vitro and in cells with representative members of each of these families (6Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 7Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G.

To determine which of the proteins in the MUF1-Elongin BC complex is capable of interacting with the Elongin BC complex, Sf21 insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding Elongins B and C and Flag-MUF1, T7-EAP20, HA-EAP30, or Myc-EAP45. As expected from the presence of a SOCS box-like motif in the N terminus of MUF1, the Elongin BC complex could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with MUF1 from Sf21 cell lysates (Fig. 3 B). The Elongin BC complex did not co-immunoprecipitate with EAP20, EAP30, or EAP45 (data not shown). To determine whether MUF1 binds the Elongin BC complex through its N-terminal SOCS box-like motif, a MUF1 double point mutant MUF1[L24P;C28F] containing BC-box mutations shown previously to disrupt binding of Elongin BC to SOCS1 (6Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) was coexpressed in Sf21 cells with Elongins B and C. As shown in Fig.3 B, binding of MUF1 to Elongin BC was strongly dependent on the presence of an intact BC-box within the MUF1 N-terminal SOCS box-like motif; whereas wild type MUF1 was co-immunoprecipitated from Sf21 cell lysates with Elongins B and C, the MUF1 mutant was not. In light of evidence that the Elongin BC-containing VHL tumor suppressor complex is a ubiquitin ligase (9Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc.

Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krezeska M.F. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we asked whether Elongin BC could also function as an adaptor to link MUF1 to a Cullin/Rbx1 module to reconstitute ubiquitin ligase activity. In mammalian cells the Cullin protein family includes at least 5 members referred to as Cul1, Cul2, Cul3, Cul4, and Cul5 (33Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.H. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Each of these Cullin proteins has been shown to assemble with Rbx1 to reconstitute a module that is capable of activating ubiquitylation by E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (20Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 21Seol J.H. Feldman R.M. Zachariae W. Shevchenko A. Correll C.C. Lyapina S.A. Chi Y. Galova M. Claypool J. Sandmeyer S. Nasmyth K. Deshaies R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1614-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). To determine whether Elongin BC is capable of recruiting a Cullin/Rbx1 module to the MUF1-Elongin BC complex, anti-Flag and anti-HA immunoprecipitations were carried out on lysates of Sf21 cells co-infected with baculoviruses encoding Flag-MUF1, Elongins B and C, Rbx1, and individual Cullin proteins containing N-terminal HA epitope tags. In contrast to the VHL-Elongin BC complex, the MUF1-Elongin BC complex did not interact stably with the Cul2/Rbx1 module. In addition, the MUF1-Elongin BC complex did not interact stably with Cullin/Rbx1 modules containing Cul1, Cul3, or Cul4. The MUF1-Elongin BC complex did, however, assemble stably with a Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex containing MUF1, Elongins B and C, Cul5, and Rbx1 (Fig. 4). To determine whether the MUF1-Elongin BC-Cul5-Rbx1 complex possesses ubiquitin ligase activity, the complex was immunoaffinity purified and assayed for its ability to activate formation of polyubiquitin chains by the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc5 in the presence of ATP, the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba1, and GST-ubiquitinK48R. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the MUF1 complex stimulated formation of a ladder of GST-ubiquitinK48R conjugates by Ubc5. In GST-ubiquitinK48R, ubiquitin lysine 48 is mutated to arginine. As a consequence, GST-ubiquitin K48R is unable to form multi-ubiquitin chains linked through lysine 48. At the present time, we do not know whether the observed ladder of GST-ubiquitinK48R conjugates is due to formation of alternate forms of polyubiquitin linked through lysines 6, 11, 29, or 63 of ubiquitin (34Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) or to attachment of single GST-ubiquitinK48R molecules to multiple sites within the GST portion of the fusion protein, to subunits of the MUF1 complex, or to the E1 or E2 enzymes. In a previous study, we observed that VHL BC-box mutants that do not bind Elongin BC or assemble with the Cul2/Rbx1 module do not activate ubiquitylation by Ubc5 (12Kamura T. Sato S. Iwai K. Czyzyk-Krezeska M.F. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10430-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Likewise, the MUF1 BC-box mutant MUF1[L24P;C28F], which does not bind Elongin BC, did not efficiently assemble with the Cul5/Rbx1 module and did not activate ubiquitylation by Ubc5 (Fig. 5 B). Our finding that Elongin BC is capable of recruiting Cullins Cul2 and Cul5 into multiprotein VHL and MUF1 complexes possessing ubiquitin ligase activity raised the possibility that Elongin BC could also function as an adaptor to link additional BC-box proteins to an E2-activating Cullin/Rbx1 module. To investigate this possibility, anti-HA immunoprecipitations were carried out on lysates of Sf21 insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses encoding the BC-box proteins VHL, Elongin A, SOCS1, or WSB1, Elongins B and C, Rbx1, and either HA-Cul2 or HA-Cul5. As shown in Fig. 6, the VHL-Elongin BC complex was capable of assembling with both the Cul2/Rbx1 and Cul5/Rbx1 modules; in contrast, the Elongin A-Elongin BC, SOCS1-Elongin BC, and WSB1-Elongin BC complexes all failed to assemble efficiently with the Cul2/Rbx1 module, but were able to assemble with the Cul5/Rbx1 module. Like the MUF1 complex, all of these complexes are capable of activating formation of GST-ubiquitin conjugates by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5 (data not shown). In summary, in this report we have identified the novel Elongin BC-box protein MUF1 and demonstrated that it is capable of assembling with the Ubc5-activating Cul5/Rbx1 module to reconstitute a multiprotein complex with ubiquitin ligase activity. In addition, we have shown that the additional BC-box proteins VHL, Elongin A, SOCS1, and WSB1 are also capable of assembling with the Cul5/Rbx1 module. Cul5 is the founding member of the Cullin protein family and was originally identified as a cytoplasmic arginine-vasopressin receptor, referred to as the vasopressin-activated calcium-mobilizing-1 protein (35Burnatowska-Hledin M. Spielman W.S. Smith W.L. Meyer J.M. Dewitt D.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1198-F1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently Cul5 (vasopressin-activated calcium-mobilizing-1) was shown to have a role in signal transduction and to be capable of mobilizing calcium, stimulating d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate production, and inhibiting cAMP production in mammalian cells (36Burnatowska-Hledin M. Zhao P. Capps B. Poel A. Parmelee K. Mungall C. Sharangpani A. Listenberger L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. 2000; 279: C266-C273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is presently not known how Cul5 carries out these functions, our finding that Cul5 is capable of interacting with BC-box proteins raises the possibility that one or more of these proteins may also have roles in Cul5-dependent signal transduction. In addition, our finding that RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin A is capable of assembling with the Cul5/Rbx1 module (Fig. 6,upper right panel) raises the intriguing possibility that at least one of the functions of Cul5 may be to participate together with Elongin A in ubiquitin-dependent destruction of components of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery. Finally, although we presently do not understand the functional relationship between MUF1 and the EAP20, EAP30, and EAP45 components of the MUF1-Elongin BC complex, it is noteworthy that the potential S. cerevisiaeorthologs of these proteins are encoded by class E vacuolar protein sorting (vps) genes, which have recently been linked to cellular ubiquitylation pathways by Hochstrasser and co-workers (37Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3365-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) through their genetic interactions with the S. cerevisiae Doa4 deubiquitylating enzyme."

Using phage display, we identified a key epitope that is involved in toxin-receptor interaction. Three different scFv molecules that bind Cry1Ab toxin were obtained, and these scFv proteins have different amino acid sequences in the complementary determinant region 3 (CDR3). Binding analysis of these scFv molecules to different members of the Cry1A toxin family and to Escherichia coli clones expressing different Cry1A toxin domains showed that the three selected scFv molecules recognized only domain II. Heterologous binding competition of Cry1Ab toxin to midgut membrane vesicles from susceptible Manduca sexta larvae using the selected scFv molecules showed that scFv73 competed with Cry1Ab binding to the receptor. The calculated binding affinities (K d) of scFv73 to Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac toxins are in the range of 20–51 nm. Sequence analysis showed this scFv73 molecule has a CDR3 significantly homologous to a region present in the cadherin-like protein from M. sexta (Bt-R1), Bombyx mori (Bt-R175), and Lymantria dispar. We demonstrated that peptides of 8 amino acids corresponding to the CDR3 from scFv73 or to the corresponding regions of Bt-R1 or Bt-R175 are also able to compete with the binding of Cry1Ab and Cry1Aa toxins to the Bt-R1 or Bt-R175receptors. Finally, we showed that synthetic peptides homologous to Bt-R1 and scFv73 CDR3 and the scFv73 antibody decreased thein vivo toxicity of Cry1Ab to M. sexta larvae. These results show that we have identified the amino acid region of Bt-R1 and Bt-R175 involved in Cry1A toxin interaction.

Heterologous binding competition of Cry1Ab toxin to midgut membrane vesicles from susceptible Manduca sexta larvae using the selected scFv molecules showed that scFv73 competed with Cry1Ab binding to the receptor. The calculated binding affinities (K d) of scFv73 to Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac toxins are in the range of 20–51 nm. Sequence analysis showed this scFv73 molecule has a CDR3 significantly homologous to a region present in the cadherin-like protein from M. sexta (Bt-R1), Bombyx mori (Bt-R175), and Lymantria dispar. We demonstrated that peptides of 8 amino acids corresponding to the CDR3 from scFv73 or to the corresponding regions of Bt-R1 or Bt-R175 are also able to compete with the binding of Cry1Ab and Cry1Aa toxins to the Bt-R1 or Bt-R175receptors. Finally, we showed that synthetic peptides homologous to Bt-R1 and scFv73 CDR3 and the scFv73 antibody decreased thein vivo toxicity of Cry1Ab to M. sexta larvae. These results show that we have identified the amino acid region of Bt-R1 and Bt-R175 involved in Cry1A toxin interaction.

Bacillus thuringiensis(Bt),1 a biopesticide, is a viable alternative for the control of insect pests in agriculture and disease vectors of importance in public health. Bt use is also compatible with sustainable and environmentally friendly agricultural practices. Bt produces insecticidal proteins (Cry toxins) during sporulation as parasporal crystals. These crystals are predominantly composed of one or more proteins, also called δ-endotoxins. These toxins are highly specific to their target insect; are safe to humans, vertebrates, and plants; and are completely biodegradable. The three-dimensional structures of Cry3A and Cry1Aa toxins have been resolved by x-ray diffraction crystallography (1Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The two proteins share many similar features and are composed of three domains. Domain I, extending from the N terminus, a seven-helix bundle, is the pore-forming domain. Domain II consists of three anti-parallel β-sheets, and domain III is a β-sandwich of two anti-parallel β-sheets (1Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 2Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.L. Brousseau R. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Domains II and III are involved in receptor binding, and domain III additionally protects the toxin from further proteolysis (for reviews, see Refs. 3Pietrantonio P.V. Gill S.S. Lehane M.J. Billingsley P.F. Biology of the Insect Midgut. Chapman and Hall, London1996: 345-372Crossref Google Scholar and 4Schnepf H.E. Crickmore N. Van Rie J. Dereclus D. Baum J. Feitelson J. Zeigler D.R. Dean D.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 775-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mode of action of Cry toxins is a multistage process. Crystal toxins ingested by susceptible larvae dissolve in the alkaline environment of the larval midgut, thereby releasing soluble proteins. The inactive protoxins are then cleaved at specific sites by midgut proteases, yielding 60–70-kDa protease-resistant active fragments. The active toxin then binds to specific membrane receptors on the apical brush border of the midgut epithelium columnar cells (5Bravo A. Jansens S. Peferoen M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1992; 60: 237-246Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Hofmann C. Vanderbruggen H. Höfte H. Van Rie J. Jansens S. Van Mellaert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7844-7848Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, receptors on the brush border membrane are a key factor in determining the specificity of Cry toxins. This specific binding involves two steps, a reversible followed by an irreversible one (7Dean D.H. Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Wu S.-J. Chen X.J. Alcántara E. Hussain S.R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After binding, the toxin apparently undergoes a large conformational change leading to its insertion into the cell membrane (1Li J. Carroll J. Ellar D.J. Nature. 1991; 353: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The Cry toxin molecules then aggregate through toxin-toxin interactions (8Soberón M. Perez R.V. Nuñez-Valdéz M.E. Lorence A.

This disruption is accompanied by an inflow of water that leads to cell swelling and eventual lysis, resulting in paralysis of the midgut and subsequent larval death (3Pietrantonio P.V. Gill S.S.

A number of putative receptor molecules for lepidopteran-specific Cry1A toxins have been identified. In Manduca sexta, Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac proteins bind to a 120-kDa aminopeptidase N (APN) (11Denolf P. Hendrickx K. VanDamme J. Jansens S. Peferoen M. Egheele D. VanRie J. Eur. J.

B. 1991; 245: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The interaction between toxin and its receptor can be complex. For example, Cry1Ac binds to two sites on the APN purified from M. sexta, and only one of these sites is also recognized by Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab (25Masson L. Lu Y.-J. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20309-20315Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of Cry1Ac to both receptor sites is inhibited by sugars, which do not inhibit the binding of Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab (25Masson L. Lu Y.-J. Mazza A. Brousseau R. Adang M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20309-20315Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). There is little information on the receptor domains involved in Cry toxin binding. In B. mori, Cry1Aa toxin binds to a conserved APN domain (26Nakanishi K. Yaoi K. Shimada N. Kadotani T. Sato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the precise regions that are involved in toxin-receptor interactions, including that of the cadherin-like protein, are not known. In an attempt to identify the receptor molecules and map the receptor epitopes involved, we decided to use the phage display technique. Among several approaches used for epitope mapping, phage display has proven to be highly successful (27Cortese R. Felici F. Galfre G. Luzzago A. Monaci P. Nicosia A.

In this study, we focused on the interaction of Cry1A toxins with brush border membrane vesicles from susceptible insects. We report here the identification of one scFv antibody whose CDR3 region shares extensive homology with an 8-amino acid region present in the cadherin-like receptors Bt-R1 and Bt-R175 from two lepidopteran insects. This 8-amino acid region competes with the binding of Cry1Ab and Cry1Aa to Bt-R1 and Bt-R175, suggesting that we identified the Cry1A toxin-binding epitopes in the cadherin-like receptor protein. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria broth (LB) at 37 °C either with ampicillin (100 µg/ml) or erythromycin (250 µg/ml), while Bt strains were grown in nutrient broth sporulation medium (NB) at 30 °C with or without erythromycin (7.5 µg/ml). The acrystalliferous strain 407cry − (32Lereclus D. Arantès O. Chaufaux J. Lecadet M.-M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1989; 60: 211-218Google Scholar) transformed with pHT409 (33Arantès O. Lereclus D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) harboring the cry1Aa gene or pHT315–1Ab harboring the cry1Ab gene was used for Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab production. Cry1Ac was produced from the wild type Bt strain HD73. Bt strains containing the cry1Ab,cry1Aa, and cry1Ac genes were grown for 3 days in NB. The spores and crystals were harvested and washed with buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals were isolated by sucrose gradients as previously described (34Thomas W.E. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 60: 181-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These crystals were solubilized and activated by trypsin (1:50, w/w) for 2 h, and the proteins were purified by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) as described (34Thomas W.E. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 60: 181-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Aranda E. Sanchez J. Perferoen M. Güereca L. Bravo A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 68: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purified toxins were concentrated in dialysis bags (Spectra/Por, cut-off 12–14 kDa; Fisher) covered with polyethylene glycol 8000, dialyzed against 1000 volumes of buffer A (150 mm N-methylglucamine chloride, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8), and stored at 4 °C until used. Toxins were apparently homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The Nissim synthetic phage-antibody library used in this work was kindly provided by the Cambridge Center for Protein Engineering (Cambridge, UK). This library, with a diversity of 1 × 108 clones, contains a diverse repertoire of in vitro rearranged VH genes containing a random VH-CDR3 of 4–12 amino acid residues in length (36Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Lidgley C. Lane D. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Cry1Ab-binding phages were isolated by panning using immunotubes (Nunc), which were coated with (100 µg/ml) Cry1Ab toxin overnight at room temperature. After each round of selection, individual clones were analyzed for their ability to bind Cry1Ab by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The helper phage VCS-M13 (Stratagene) was used to rescue phages from individual colonies of infected E. coliTG-1. Expression of soluble fragments from single infected E. coli HB2151 colonies (36Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Lidgley C. Lane D. Winter G.

Bacterial supernatants containing phage or scFv fragments were screened for toxin binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. DNA fingerprinting was performed by amplifying the scFv insert using primers LMB3 (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC) and fd-SEQ1 (5′-GAATTTTCTGTATGAGG) followed by digestion with the frequently cutting enzyme BstNI as described (37Hoogenboom H.R. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). CDR3 sequence was determined using the primer CDRFOR (5′-CAGGGTACCTTGGCCCCA) (38Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. MacCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). For purification of scFv molecules, scFv genes were subcloned into the pSyn vector (38Marks J.D. Hoogenboom H.R. Bonnert T.P. MacCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar) and used to transform E. coli TG1. scFv fragments were purified to homogeneity as follows. Selected clones were cultured at 37 °C in 2× TY (supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose) until they reached an OD of 0.7 at 600 nm. Production of soluble scFv was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl thiogalactoside to the culture and grown for 4 h at 25 °C. The scFv was collected from the periplasm. Soluble periplasmic extracts were obtained by osmotic shock at 4 °C using lysis buffer containing 200 mg/ml sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-agarose column, which was washed with PBS, and the scFv was eluted with 2 ml of 250 mm imidazole, 0.2% azide in PBS. DomI and DomII-III-H6 of the Cry1Ab toxin were individually expressed in BL21 E. coli cells as described (39Flores H. Soberón X. Sánchez J. Bravo A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 2A. Bravo, R. Meza, and A. Lorence, unpublished results. Briefly, an overnight culture of pDomII-III-H6 (or pDomI) transformed cells was grown at 37 °C in LB medium (200 µg/ml ampicillin). This culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of LB medium (1:100 dilution). The cells were grown to an OD of 0.5–0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. After 3 h of growth, the cells were centrifuged and suspended in 3 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaSO4,300 mm NaCl, pH 8). Cells were then sonicated on ice (two 1-min bursts) and centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 × g). Soluble proteins (10 µg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed as described (35Aranda E. Sanchez J. Perferoen M. Güereca L. Bravo A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 68: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), using bacterial supernatants containing phage or scFv fragments. For scFv fragments, a c-Myc antibody (Sigma) (1:1000 dilution) was used, followed by incubation with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma) (1:1000 dilution). For clone M13–19, an anti-M13 antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) (1:1000 dilution) was utilized as described (34Thomas W.E. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 60: 181-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Aranda E. Sanchez J. Perferoen M. Güereca L. Bravo A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 68: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Blots were visualized using luminol (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). M. sexta eggs were kindly supplied by Dr. Jorge Ibarra (CINVESTAV, Irapuato), and B. mori eggs were obtained from Carolina Biological Supply Co. M. sexta andB. mori larvae were reared on an artificial diet and fresh mulberry leaves, respectively. BBMVs from fifth instar M. sexta or B. mori larvae were prepared as reported (41Wolfersberger M. Lüthy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar) except that neomycin sulfate (2.4 µg/ml) was included in the buffer (300 mm mannitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 µg ml−1 pepstatin A, 100 µg ml−1 leupeptin, 1 µg ml−1 soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 7.4). Binding and competition analyses of Cry1Aa-c toxins to M. sexta andB. mori BBMV were performed as previously described (35Aranda E. Sanchez J. Perferoen M. Güereca L. Bravo A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 68: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of synthetic peptides used for competition experiments were the following: CDR3–73 (RITQTTNRAA), BtR1-CRY (HITDTNNKAA), BtR175-CRY1 (QIIDTNNKAA), BtR175-CRY2 (LDETTNVLAA), and PepL1 (TDAHRGEYYW). Toxins were biotinylated using biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and binding analyses were performed in 100 µl of binding buffer (PBS, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6). Ten micrograms of BBMV protein were incubated with 10 nmbiotinylated toxin, and the unbound toxin was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The pellet containing BBMV and the bound biotinylated toxin was suspended in 100 µl of binding buffer and washed twice. Finally, the BBMVs were suspended in 10 µl of PBS, pH 7.6, and an equal volume of 2× sample loading buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The biotinylated protein was visualized by incubating with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:4000 dilution) for 1 h, followed by luminol (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For competition experiments, biotinylated Cry1A toxins were incubated with different concentrations of scFvs or peptides in PBS for 1 h at room temperature before incubating toxin with BBMV. Protein blot analysis of BBMV preparations was performed as described previously (35Aranda E. Sanchez J. Perferoen M. Güereca L. Bravo A. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1996; 68: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 41Wolfersberger M. Lüthy P. Maurer A. Parenti P. Sacchi F.V. Giordana B. Hanozet G.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 86A: 301-308Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of BBMV protein were separated by 9% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with 10 nmbiotinylated Cry1A toxins. Unbound toxin was removed by washing the membrane three times with washing buffer for 10 min, and the bound toxin was identified by incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (1:5000) for 1 h and visualized using luminol (ECL;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For competition experiments, biotinylated Cry1A toxins were incubated with different concentrations of scFvs or peptides in washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 0.2% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature before incubating toxin with nitrocellulose membranes. All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using a Biacore X and CM5 sensor chips (Biacore). HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 005% surfactant P20) was used throughout the analyses. The ligand, scFv73 (30 kDa, apparently homogeneous based on SDS-PAGE) at a concentration of 25 µg/ml in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5, buffer, was immobilized on flow cell 2 using a standard amine-coupling kit (Biacore) at densities of less than 150 response units. The surfaces of both flow cells were activated for 5 min at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. Following ligand immobilization on flow cell 2, both flow cells were blocked with a 5-min injection of 1m ethanolamine at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. The analytes (65 kDa, apparently homogenous based on SDS-PAGE) were injected over both flow cells at a flow rate of 30 µl/min. The complex was allowed to associate and dissociate for 120 and 180 s, respectively. The surfaces were regenerated with a 1-min injection of 1 mmHCl. Triplicate injections of each toxin concentration were injected in random order over both surfaces, and the responses were corrected by double referencing (42Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The data were fitted using global analysis software available within Biaevaluation 3.1 (Biacore). Competition experiments were performed by injection of a 10- and 200-fold molar excess of scFv in combination with Cry1Ab and Cry1Aa toxins. Carbohydrate inhibition studies with GalNAc were carried out using 600 nm Cry1Ac and 20 µm GalNAc. As an additional control, we immobilized a non-Cry1A-binding scFv4E that was obtained by panning against a different antigen onto flow cell 1 at similar levels as scFv73. Various concentrations of toxin were injected over both flow cells, and the response curve on flow cell 1 was subtracted from flow cell 2. Using this control flow cell configuration, identical Cry1Ab binding curves were obtained compared with using the ethanolamine-blocked control surface. Bioassays were performed with M. sexta neonate larvae using surface-treated food with 9 ng/cm2 as reported (5Bravo A. Jansens S. Peferoen M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 1992; 60: 237-246Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and mortality was recorded after 7 days. A library of 108 human single chain antibody fragments (scFv) with variability in the CDR3 region (5–12 amino acids) (36Nissim A. Hoogenboom H.R. Tomlinson I.M. Flynn G. Lidgley C. Lane D. Winter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) was used to select a population of phages that bound Cry1Ab toxin. After eight rounds of panning, 98% of the M13 phages bound Cry1Ab (data not shown). To characterize the phages isolated, we amplified the variable regions by PCR and digested the products with BstNI restriction enzyme. Analysis of 50 phage clones showed three different restriction patterns (data not shown). One of these patterns was found in 48 of the clones analyzed (representative clone scFv45), while the other two patterns were each represented by one clone. DNA sequence analysis of the CDR3 region was determined for 10 clones of the most abundant restriction pattern (including scFv45) and also for the two clones representing the other two unique restriction patterns (scFv19 and scFv73). Three different amino acid sequences were present in the CDR3 regions of the clones analyzed (scFv19, RTSPRLTPKHR; scFv73, ITQTTNR; scFv45, NPRIPP). We used Western blot analysis to determine which Cry1Ab toxin domain bound the three scFv antibodies. This analysis was performed using the scFv antibodies against membrane blots containing protein extracts fromE. coli expressing either Cry1Ab domain I or domains II-III. Fig. 1 shows that the three scFv clones recognized the 44-kDa domain II-III polypeptide but not the 30-kDa domain I polypeptide. To analyze whether domain II or III was recognized by these scFv proteins, we determined if the three M13-scFv phages bound Cry1Ac toxin, since this toxin shares 98% identity with Cry1Ab toxin in domain II but only 38% identity in domain III. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding analysis showed that the three scFv antibodies also recognized Cry1Ac toxin (data not shown), suggesting that the three scFv fragments bound to domain II of Cry1Ab toxin. The three anti-Cry1Ab scFv genes were subcloned into a plasmid to incorporate a hexahistidine tag and then expressed and purified from E. coli. Only scFv73 and scFv45 were produced in E. coli in high quantities, and scFv19 was therefore not analyzed further. To determine if the selected scFv antibodies could compete with the binding of Cry1Ab toxin to its receptor, we performed two different binding assays. In the first protocol, a qualitative binding assay, biotinylated Cry1Ab toxin was incubated in solution with BBMV. The bound toxin was visualized following SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose membranes. Fig.2 A shows that both scFv antibodies compete with the binding of Cry1Ab toxin to M. sexta BBMV, although scFv73 competes more efficiently than scFv45 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 6). The second protocol, toxin overlay assays, allows the identification of BBMV proteins that interact with Cry1Ab. BBMV proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Then biotinylated Cry1Ab toxin was incubated with the membranes, and the proteins that bound the toxin were detected with streptavidin coupled to peroxidase. Fig. 2 B shows that both the 120-kDa aminopeptidase (APN) (13Knight P.J.K. Crickmore N. Ellar D.J. Mol. Microbi"

To understand mechanisms that regulate flagellar dynamics, Chlamydomonas cells with nongrowing flagella were labeled with 35S, and flagella and basal body components were examined for labeled polypeptides. Maximal incorporation of label into the flagella occurred within 3 h. Twenty percent of the flagellar polypeptides were exchanged. These included tubulins, dyneins, and 80 other axonemal and membrane plus matrix polypeptides. The most stable flagellar structure is the PF-ribbon, which comprises part of the wall of each doublet microtubule and is composed of tubulin and three other polypeptides. Most35S was incorporated into the high molecular weight ribbon polypeptide, rib240, and little, if any, 35S is incorporated into PF-ribbon-associated tubulin. Both wild-type (9 + 2) and 9 + 0 flagella, which lack central microtubules, exhibited nearly identical exchange patterns, so labeling is not due to turnover of relatively labile central microtubules. To determine if flagellar length is balanced by protein exchange, 35S incorporation into disassembling flagella was examined, as was exchange in flagella in which microtubule assembly was blocked by colchicine. Incorporation of 35S-labeled polypeptides was found to occur into flagellar axonemes during wavelength-dependent shortening in pf18 and in fla10 cells induced to shorten flagella by incubation at 33 °C. Colchicine blocked tubulin addition but did not affect the exchange of the other exchangeable polypeptides; nor did it induce any change in flagellar length. Basal bodies also incorporated newly synthesized proteins. These data reveal thatChlamydomonas flagella are dynamic structures that incorporate new protein both during steady state and as flagella shorten and that protein exchange does not, alone, explain length regulation.

Cilia propel vertebrate sperm, display visual pigments in vertebrate photoreceptors and sensory molecules on olfactory and chemosensory neurons. During development, they are prominent on embryonic surfaces. Pathological conditions associated with defects in ciliogenesis include liver disorders, drug-induced cirrhosis, gastritis, hyperparathyroidism, retinal dysplasia, Mulvihill-Smith progeria-like syndrome, Oak Ridge polycystic kidney disease (1Murcia N.S.

Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia have abnormally aligned cilia or cilia with motility defects, which leads to infertility and decreased resistance to lower respiratory tract infections, chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. Ciliary movement is essential for the development of asymmetry in developing mammals and is particularly important for development and positioning of the heart (2Afzelius B.A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 283-286PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nonaka S. Tanaka Y. Okada Y. Takeda S. Harada A. Kanai Y. Kido M. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 95: 829-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). There are likely to be many unknown links between cilia and embryonic development. Cilia line embryonic surfaces of developing neural tubes and ventral and notochordal plate cells in developing mouse embryos (4Sulik K. Dehart D.B. Iangaki T. Carson J.L. Vrablic T. Gesteland K.

(Basel). 1976; 95: 368-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell- or tissue-specific defects in cilia formation may cause currently unidentified defects during early embryonic development. The growth, maintenance, and disassembly of cilia and flagella is a highly orchestrated process in which the length of each of the nine doublets and the two central microtubules is precisely regulated as is the addition of more than 250 different polypeptides that attach to the microtubules or are associated with the membrane and soluble matrix. Isolated cilia and flagella are extremely stable microtubular structures that can only be dissociated by ionic detergents, heat, or chaotropic agents (7Stephens R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 1W. L. Dentler, unpublished observations.Despite their stability in vitro, fully grown flagella in many cells can be completely disassembled (8Bloodgood R.A. Cytobios. 1974; 9: 142-161PubMed Google Scholar). In sea urchin embryos, cilia can be stimulated to grow by the application of several different agents, including concanavalin A (9Riederer-Henderson M.A. Rosenbaum J.L. Dev. Biol. 1979; 70: 500-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and theophylline (10Stephens R.E. J. Exp. Zool. 1994; 269: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Some of the most dramatic examples of flagellar dynamics occur inChlamydomonas, in which flagella normally disassemble prior to cell division and new flagella grow after division is completed. If one flagellum is amputated, the remaining flagellum shortens and then elongates once a new flagellum has started to grow on the “amputated” basal body (11Rosenbaum J.L. Moulder J.E. Ringo D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 600-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas flagellar growth can be stimulated with lithium (12Nakamura S. Takino H. Kojuma M.K. Cell Struct.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutant, fla10, shortens its flagella at 33 °C but not at 22 °C (15Walter Z. Vashishtha M. Hall J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 16Piperno G. Siuda E. Henderson S. Segi M. Vaananen H. Sassaroli M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1591-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas pf18mutants shorten flagella under reduced red light (13Tuxhorn J. Daise T. Dentler W.L. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and long flagellar (lf) mutants produce up to 3 times longer than normal flagella (17Asleson C.M. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1997; 148: 693-702Google Scholar). When the cytoplasm of cells with abnormally long flagella is mixed with that of cells with normal length flagella, the long flagella rapidly shorten (17Asleson C.M. Lefebvre P.A. Genetics. 1997; 148: 693-702Google Scholar), indicating that signaling mechanisms that regulate flagellar length are dominant in cells with normal length flagella. Although isolated flagellar microtubules are the most stable microtubules known, these microtubules clearly can be dynamic in vivo. Little is understood about the mechanisms that regulate flagellar dynamics, although recent studies point to a role of signal transduction pathways (13Tuxhorn J. Daise T. Dentler W.L. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Wilson N.F. Lefebvre P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (abstr.): 368Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Flagellar assembly, or elongation, requires the transport of subunits from the cytoplasm, where they are synthesized, to the tips of the flagellar microtubules, where they are added to the microtubule ends (19Johnson K. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1605-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Some of the transport to the distal tips requires the heterotrimeric kinesin, kinesin-II, which is associated with intraflagellar transport (IFT) (20Kozminski K.G. Johnson K.A. Forscher P. Rosenbaum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5519-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Early studies by Morris and Scholey (21Morris R.L. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) revealed that sea urchin embryonic cilia could grow nearly half-length if IFT is blocked by kinesin-II antibodies but that further growth could not occur. Subsequent studies have confirmed that kinesin-II is required for flagellar assembly inChlamydomonas (16Piperno G. Siuda E. Henderson S. Segi M. Vaananen H. Sassaroli M. J.

Kinesin-II appears to deliver flagellar protein to the distal tips of the flagellum, the plus-ends of the microtubules, where they are added to the microtubules. The components transported by kinesin-II require recycling to flagellar bases for flagellar growth or maintenance to occur, and this movement requires cytoplasmic dyneins (31Porter M.E. Bower R. Knott J.A. Byrd P. Dentler W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J.

Direct movement of cytoplasmic dynein has been observed in sensory ciliated neurons in C. elegans (26Signor D. Wedaman K.P. Orozco J.T. Dwyer N.D. Bargmann C.I. Rose L.S. Scholey J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Additionally, cytoplasmic dynein is required for the delivery of rhodopsin to vertebrate retinal cilia, and the failure to do so may lead to retinitis pigmentosa (34Orozco J.T. Wedaman K.P. Signor D. Brown H. Rose L. Scholey J.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 674Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 35Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The dependence of flagellar length on kinesin-II and cytoplasmic dynein indicates that flagellar proteins and/or signal transduction pathway components are shuttled back and forth along the flagellum and that some flagellar components are likely to be exchanged in the fully assembled flagellum. One indication of the importance of this shuttling is provided by examination of Chlamydomonas cytoplasmic dynein mutants. These cells can assemble short flagella, but shortly after they are formed, the flagella shorten (31Porter M.E. Bower R. Knott J.A. Byrd P. Dentler W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 32Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 33Pazour G.J. Dickert B.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and, in many cases, the microtubules start to fray into disorganized filamentous structures (31Porter M.E. Bower R. Knott J.A. Byrd P. Dentler W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 693-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Marshall and Rosenbaum (36Marshall W. Rosenbaum J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9 (abstr.): 278Google Scholar) showed that epitope-tagged tubulin could be added to steady state flagella and revealed the presence of retrograde tubulin flux. Moreover, the retrograde flux was balanced by IFT (37Marshall W. Rosenbaum J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (abstr.): 368Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that the balance of anterograde and retrograde IFT and, possibly, some flagellar protein turnover is essential for the maintenance of steady state length. Imbalances in anterograde transport (as in kinesin-II mutants) or in retrograde transport (as in cytoplasmic dynein mutants) may lead to flagellar disassembly or, possibly, elongation. Several early studies of pulse-labeled flagella indicated that a low amount of protein exchange, or turnover, occurred in steady state flagella. Low levels of protein turnover were detected in whole flagella and in the membrane plus matrix and axonemal fractions (11Rosenbaum J.L. Moulder J.E. Ringo D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 41: 600-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar,38Witman G.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 253: 178-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Rosenbaum J.L. Child F.M.

Rosenbaum J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and some tubulin turnover was detected inChlamydomonas flagella (40Bloodgood R.A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1984; 150: 489-494Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Tetrahymena cilia (42Nelsen E.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1975; 9: 152-158Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The only prominent axonemal protein detected to turnover inChlamydomonas flagella was a nontubulin 55-kDa “protein X” (43Remillard S.P. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies rigorously ruled out the possibility that the incorporation of label was not due to protein exchange but, rather, was due to the assembly of new flagella due to flagellar amputation, which up-regulates flagellar protein synthesis. In contrast to protozoans, embryonic cilia on marine organisms are considerably more dynamic. Steady state cilia on sea urchin blastulae exhibit exchange of numerous membrane plus matrix and axonemal polypeptides, including tubulin and tektin A (44Stephens R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2187-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 45Stephens R.E. Cell. Motil. Cytoskel. 2000; 47: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recent studies of sea urchin ciliary turnover and the importance of IFT motors in maintaining flagellar length prompted us to critically reexamine flagellar protein turnover in steady stateChlamydomonas flagella. Moreover, with the availability of mutants that shorten flagella due to light or temperature shifts and long flagellar mutants, we could compare the dynamics of protein turnover in shortening or abnormally long flagella. The results reported here show that steady state flagella exhibit a considerable amount of protein exchange, with a minimum 20% of flagellar proteins being exchanged within a 6-h period. Although tubulin turnover occurs, tubulin turnover could be blocked without affecting the turnover of nontubulin components. Turnover of most flagellar proteins continues to occur as flagella shorten, thus demonstrating that flagellar length is not strictly coupled to the turnover of major flagellar proteins. The single peptide exhibiting the greatest exchange is rib240, a component of the axonemal PF-ribbons. Unlike the ribbon fractions in sea urchin cilia, neither significant tubulin nor tektin-like proteins are exchanged in the PF-ribbons, but a new high molecular weight component, rib240, is exchanged. Since the ribbons have been suggested to be important stabilizers or length determinants in flagella, the role of rib240 in flagellar assembly deserves serious consideration. For all experiments, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild-type (CC-2929),pf18 (CC-1036), fla10 (CC-1919), andlf4–6 (P. Lefebvre, University of Minnesota) were grown in minimal medium (M medium)2bubbled with air and were synchronized by growing cells on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. For each experiment, t = 0 was the start of the light period. Vegetative cells were grown to a density of 5 × 106cells/ml, harvested in sterile bottles, and incubated in low sulfur M medium (MgSO4 was reduced from 1.2 to 0.012 mm, and MgCl2 was added to 1.18 mm) for 24 h. For each labeling experiment, 4 µCi/ml 35S (as sulfuric acid; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to starved cells from a 1 mCi/ml stock solution in sterile distilled water. For colchicine experiments, freshly prepared colchicine was added to cells at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Each batch of colchicine was tested to ensure that it inhibited flagellar growth after deflagellation of cells by pH shock. For chase experiments, 1 liter of starved cells were labeled with 4 µCi/ml 35S for up to 6 h and then pelleted at 1100 × g for 5 min at 20 °C in a JA-10 (Beckman) rotor and washed twice with 400 ml of low sulfur M medium, and cells were gently resuspended in 1 liter of low sulfur M medium supplemented with 30 ml of 10% MgSO4. The final cell suspension was examined by phase microscopy to ensure that all cells were uniformly flagellated. After the chase period, cells were pelleted, and flagella were isolated and fractionated as described below. To induce shortening in light-synchronized pf18 cells, cells were harvested and incubated under low red lights with gentle shaking at 1000 rpm, described by Tuxhorn et al. (13Tuxhorn J. Daise T. Dentler W.L. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 40: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To measure flagellar length, cells were fixed in an equal volume of 2% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. Flagellar length was determined by phase-contrast microscopy using an ocular micrometer. For each sample, flagellar lengths were averaged from 50 biflagellated cells. Flagella were amputated using dibucaine and were isolated following procedures described by King (46King S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by centrifugation (1100 × g, 5 min) and were suspended in 50 ml of ice-cold HMDS (10 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4% sucrose, pH 7.5). Dibucaine was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were swirled for 1–2 min and examined by phase-contrast microscopy to ensure that all cells were deflagellated. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell bodies were pelleted (1100 × g, 5 min), and flagella were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 7500 × g for 10 min. Flagellar pellets were suspended and centrifuged over HMD (10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 25% sucrose at 1100 ×g for 20 min. Purified flagella were harvested at the interface. The membrane plus matrix fractions were isolated by incubating flagella with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) for 20 min on ice and then centrifuging the suspension at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The pelleted axonemes were then twice suspended in HMDS plus 0.6 m KCl, incubated for 20 min on ice, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. PF-ribbons were purified as described by Norrander et al.(47Norrander J.M. DeCatheLineau A.M. Brown J.A. Porter M.E. Linck R.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Isolated axonemes were incubated in 0.7% Sarkosyl in TED (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) overnight with gentle shaking. Ribbons were pelleted 100,000 × g for 1 h, washed with 1 ml of TED, and pelleted a final time. Basal bodies were isolated using the method of Snell (48Snell W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Sulfur-starved cells were incubated with H235SO4 for 2 or 6 h as described above. Cells were collected by centrifugation (1100 ×g, 5 min, 20 °C), suspended in 100 ml of TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and deflagellated with 1 mm dibucaine (Sigma). After centrifugation (1500 × g, 3 min, 20 °C), the supernatant was collected to purify flagella, and the pellet (cell bodies) was suspended in autolysin (49Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 593-594Google Scholar) for 40 min to remove cell walls. Cells were diluted with an equal volume of 1% Nonidet P-40 in TE, stirred for 20 min, and homogenized using a 25-ml glass-Teflon homogenizer with 20 up and down strokes. Cell lysates were layered over 20 ml of 25% sucrose-TE in 50 ml of conical polycarbonate tubes and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (1500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to sediment cells. The supernatant was then layered over 25% sucrose-TE and recentrifuged. This supernatant was layered over a 40–50% sucrose-TE gradient and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (14,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). Basal bodies were collected from the 40–50% interface, diluted with equal volume of TE, and pelleted by centrifugation (35,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The basal bodies were suspended in 3 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in TE, homogenized in a 5-ml glass-Teflon homogenizer, layered over a 50–55-60% sucrose-TE gradient, and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor (14,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C). Basal bodies were collected from the 55–60% interface and treated with 0.6m NaCl on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation (35,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), basal bodies were collected from the pellet. Synchronized wild-type cells were starved in low sulfur M medium for 24 h and deflagellated by pH shock. Cells were concentrated in 200 ml of low sulfur M medium, and 0.5 n acetic acid was added dropwise until pH 4.5 was reached. After 30 s, the pH was raised to 7.0 by adding 0.5n KOH. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended in low sulfur M medium. 35S-Labeled sulfuric acid was added to the cell culture (4 µCi/ml) and incubated for at least 2 h. Cells were checked periodically with a phase-contrast microscope to ensure that flagella regenerated to full-length before flagella were isolated. Flagellar and cell body polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE, using the urea-SDS method of Lefebvre et al. (50Lefebvre P.A. Nordstrom S.A. Moulder J.E. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 8-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To compare labeled polypeptides in each fraction, each gel lane contained the same amount of protein. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, treated with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), air-dried between cellophane, and were exposed on a preflashed Kodak X-Omat XR-5 x-ray film for 2–20 days. For some experiments, dried gels were exposed and read using a Molecular Imager FX System (Bio-Rad). Ten-µl aliquots of purified basal bodies, microtubules, or PF-ribbons were applied to carbon-over-formvar grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Samples were stained and photographed using a JEOL 1200EXII microscope operating at 80 kV. To assay 35S incorporation in whole cells during the light cycle, 2 ml of sulfur-starved cells were taken from the culture every hour during the light period and incubated with 4 µCi/ml 35S for 30 min. Duplicate 50-µl aliquots of cells were spotted onto filter disks (2.3 cm; Whatman 3MM), dropped immediately into cold 20% perchloric acid, incubated for 1 h, washed twice with 50% ethanol, rinsed with distilled water, and air-dried. Each disc was placed in a standard 20-ml plastic scintillation vial with 5 ml of scintillation liquid and counted using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co. 1600 TR Tri-Carb). To measure the incorporation of labeled proteins into each flagellar compartment, duplicate 10-µg samples from intact flagella, membrane plus matrix fraction, KCl-soluble proteins, KCl-insoluble axonemes, and PF-ribbons were spotted onto filter disks, treated with perchloric acid, and counted as described above. To compare the incorporation in different time periods or in different cell strains, radioactivity was calculated and converted as either total cpm in each fraction or cpm/µg for each fraction. For some experiments, polypeptides were sliced from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing equal amount proteins for each component after silver staining and were placed into a 20-ml scintillation vial. Ten ml of 5% Soluene-350 in Insta-Fluor (Packard Instrument Co.) were added to dissolve the gel slices. After incubation at room temperature overnight, samples were counted as described above. Incorporation of 35S in selected polypeptides was also measured from the fluorograms using NIH Image 1.61. Equal amounts of protein for each flagellar compartment were separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to a preflashed x-ray film. Fluorograms were scanned into the computer with an Eastman Kodak Co. density gradient step, and the full-range digital image was analyzed in NIH Image 1.61 calibrated with the density standard. Optical densities for individual polypeptides and the total flagellar fraction were determined. The percentage of labeled individual polypeptides and the total labeled proteins in each compartment were obtained by comparing densities of individual polypeptides with the optical density of the fraction. At least two separate gels were measured for each polypeptide. The S.D. among experiments was statistically insignificant. A polyclonal antibody was raised against rib240 (51Drenckhahn D. Jons T. Schmitz F. Methods Cell Biol. 1993; 37: 8-54Google Scholar). Briefly, PF-ribbons isolated from 4 liters of wild type cells were separated in SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band containing rib240 was excised, homogenized in PBS, and emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). Three mice were immunized intraperitoneally. Serum was obtained after second boost for antibody detection. Purified PF-ribbons were separated in SDS-PAGE. The gel was briefly soaked in 49.6 mm Tris, 384 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS and blotted onto a nitrocellulose sheet for 60 min at 24 V in a blotting apparatus (Idea Scientific). For antigen detection, nitrocellulose was blocked with blocking buffer (5% Carnation dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25) for 1 h. The blot was incubated in either preimmune or postimmune serum diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer for"

A direct pathway for such regulation was elucidated by the identification of p115 RhoGEF, an exchange factor for RhoA that is activated through its RGS domain by Gα13. Endogenous p115 RhoGEF was found mainly in the cytosol of serum-starved cells but partially localized to membranes in cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid. Overexpressed p115 RhoGEF was equally distributed between membranes and cytosol; either the RGS or pleckstrin homology domain was sufficient for this partial targeting to membranes. Removal of the pleckstrin homology domain dramatically reduced the in vitro rate of p115 RhoGEF exchange activity. Deletion of amino acids 252–288 in the linker region between the RGS domain and the Dbl homology domain or of the last 150 C-terminal amino acids resulted in non-additive reduction of in vitro exchange activity. In contrast, p115 RhoGEF pieces lacking this extended C terminus were over 5-fold more active than the full-length exchange factor in vivo. These results suggest that p115 RhoGEF is inhibited in the cellular milieu through modification or interaction of inhibitory factors with its C terminus. Endogenous p115 RhoGEF that was immunoprecipitated from cells stimulated with lysophosphatidic acid or sphingosine 1-phosphate was more active than when the enzyme was immunoprecipitated from untreated cells. This indicates an additional and potentially novel long lived mechanism for regulation of p115 RhoGEF by G protein-coupled receptors.

Such cellular behavior is directed by precise monitoring of the extracellular milieu including contacts with extracellular matrix and concentrations of circulating stimuli. The actin cytoskeleton plays a dynamic role in the coordination of these signals as evinced by its role in clustering and dispersal of focal adhesions, events that are regulated through the monomeric Rho1 GTPases by heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and integrin receptors (1Bishop A.L.

Rho GTPases compose a family of monomeric G proteins in the superfamily of Ras GTPases; other families include the Arf, Rab, Ran, Ras, and Sar GTPases. The mammalian Rho-like family of GTPases, which range in molecular mass from 21 to 28 kDa, is further divided into at least three subfamilies, Rho (RhoA–E), Rac (Rac1–3 and RhoG), and CDC42. Although primarily associated with regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements, Rho GTPases also convey signals controlling gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cytokinesis (7Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 8Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin.

All monomeric G proteins cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound form. Dissociation of GDP is potentiated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that preferentially bind and stabilize the nucleotide-free enzyme. Association of GTP, which is in excess over GDP in the cell, promotes release from exchange factor and interaction of the activated G protein with downstream effectors. GTPase-activating proteins increase the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of GTP bound to the G proteins and thus decrease the life span of bound GTP and the transmission time for each quantum of signaling (10Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Numerous GEFs are capable of stimulating nucleotide exchange on various members of the Rho family. Over half of these GEFs were identified in screens for proteins that could induce formation of transformed foci when expressed in mouse NIH3T3 cells. All of these proteins were found to share a conserved sequence of about 180 amino acids with the CDC42 exchange factor, Dbl, and this region is now called the Dbl homology (DH) domain (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The importance of the DH domain in binding Rho and stimulation of nucleotide exchange is well documented (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 12Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The coordinate inability of GEFs with mutated DH domains to transform NIH3T3 cells strongly indicates that the exchange activity of this region is responsible for the cellular phenotype (12Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). All Rho family exchange factors also contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is C-terminal to the DH domain (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric G12 and G13 proteins mediate signaling between the extracellular agonist LPA and RhoA-dependent signaling (6Sah V.P. Seasholtz T.M. Sagi S.A. Brown J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Intracellular RhoA was found to be activated by the GTPase-deficient mutants Gα12(Q229L) or Gα13 (Q226L) but not by Gαi(Q204L) (13Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Studies have also found that introduction into cells of the GTPase-deficient mutants of either Gα12 or Gα13 mutants causes phenotypes that are similar to those induced by treatment of cells with LPA. LPA-induced rounding of NE1–115 cells was also caused by overexpression of Gα12(Q229L) or Gα13 (Q226L), and this rounding was blocked by expression of dominant negative N19-RhoA (13Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of active RhoA (Q63L), Gα12 (Q229L), or Gα13 (Q226L), but not Gαq (Q209L) or Gαi2 (Q204L), promoted formation of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells by a process that was inhibited by theClostridium botulinum C3 toxin (14Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Attenuation of LPA-mediated formation of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells by microinjection of antibodies against Gα13, but not by antibodies against Gαq/11 or Gα12, provided direct evidence for the requirement of Gα13 in this process (15Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A Rho-selective exchange factor, p115 RhoGEF, directly links G13 to regulation of RhoA. This exchange factor contains an N-terminal domain that is homologous to the family of RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and acts as a GTPase-activating protein for the Gα12 and Gα13 proteins (16Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activated form of Gα13, in vitro, stimulates the ability of p115 RhoGEF to catalyze dissociation of GDP from RhoA by 3–4-fold (17Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either Gα13 or p115 RhoGEF has been shown to potentiate transcription of a reporter gene that is regulated by the modified serum response element (SRE.L) (18Mao J. Yuan H. Xie W. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); this response element drives transcription when activated by Rho-dependent mechanisms (19Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). Regulation of p115 RhoGEF by Gα13 provides the first potential molecular mechanism for mediating cytoskeletal changes attributed to G protein-coupled receptors. Whereas direct stimulation by Gα13 serves as one way to regulate the exchange activity of p115 RhoGEF, we report here that other mechanisms are also likely to modulate the activity of this protein. Either the RGS domain or the PH domain may alter activity through localization of p115 RhoGEF to the membrane. Careful examination of different p115 RhoGEF domains highlights interactions involving the C terminus and N terminus of the molecule that are important for nucleotide exchange activity in vitro. These studies also define a clear dichotomy between activities observedin vitro and in vivo and point toward a role for the C terminus in maintaining low basal activity of p115 RhoGEF within the cell. The vector expressing C. botulinum C3 toxin (20Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R.

The SRE.L promoter (22Treisman R. Alberts A.S. Sahai E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was provided by Silvio Gutkind. The SRE.L promoter was inserted in front of the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 basic mammalian expression vector (Promega). The cDNA encoding full-length p115 RhoGEF (23Hart M.J. Sharma S. El Masry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was used for amplification of the p115 RhoGEF fragments by the polymerase chain reaction. All fragments were amplified with an N-terminalEcoRI site and a C-terminal HindIII site for cloning into the pCMV5 (provided by David Russell), pCMV5-myc (Melanie Cobb), and pGEX-KG (24Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar) expression vectors. Fragments were transferred via EcoRI/XbaI sites from pCMV5 into pVL1392-EE, pVL1392 (Invitrogen) which has been modified to provide an N-terminal EE tag (EYMPME) (23Hart M.J. Sharma S. El Masry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragment of p115 RhoGEF encoding amino acids 1–252 was cloned into pGEX-KG and pTrc D. The latter was constructed from pTrc C (Invitrogen) by replacing the intervening sequence between the His tag and the EcoRI restriction site with the amino acids, MGA. The different pieces of p115 RhoGEF are named by the primers used for their amplification followed by the vector into which they were cloned. All DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm correct amplification and construction. Baculoviruses were produced through co-transfection of Sf9 cells with pVL1392-EE vectors and BakPak6-digested with Bsu36I (CLONTECH). Recombinant EE-tagged proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells after infection and purified from lysates by affinity chromatography with immobilized antibodies to the EE tag (Babco) as described elsewhere (17Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 252 amino acids of p115 RhoGEF were expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in the BL21 DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose in 25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (2.5 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin A, 21 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 µg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 21 µg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, and 21 µg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester). Purified GST fusion protein was then cleaved at a unique thrombin site between the GST tag and the rest of the fusion protein. Free GST was removed by absorption to glutathione-Sepharose. The RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin (aa 7–89) was expressed as a fusion protein with GST (GST-RBD) in E. coli and purified for use with glutathione-Sepharose as described previously (25Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Meredith Jr., J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). GST-RhoA was expressed in E. coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose. Prenyl RhoA was obtained by co-expression of RhoA with a GST-tagged guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor via baculovirus in Sf9 cells. Lysates were prepared by treating pelleted cells with three cycles of freeze-thawing in 25 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. After removing cell debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was passed over a glutathione-Sepharose column, and bound RhoA was eluted with the same solution containing 1% cholate. Prenyl RhoA was concentrated, and cholate was removed by diluting samples in 25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors, followed by concentration via pressure filtration through an Amicon PM10 membrane. The following three purified protein fragments of p115 RhoGEF, aa 1–252, EE-tagged aa 288–637, and EE-tagged aa 760–912, were separately mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and used to immunize rabbits. Sera were collected and screened by immunoblot analysis. Sera specific for aa 1–252, 288–637, and 760–912 were termed U2760, U2762, and U2764, respectively. The B860 antibody specific for Gα13 was described previously (27Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the Myc tag (catalog number Sc-789) and a polyclonal antibody raised against RhoA (catalog number Sc-179) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal antibody used to detect the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Babco. Immobilized RhoA was used to assess the relative ability of EE-tagged p115 RhoGEF constructs to bind RhoA (Fig. 3). Five pmol of each EE-tagged p115 RhoGEF piece were mixed with 20, 50, and 500 pmol of GST-RhoA, which was bound to glutathione-Sepharose in incubation buffer (25 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After incubation with mixing for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform, the Sepharose beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 20 s. The supernatant, which contains the unbound fraction of p115 RhoGEF piece, was removed, and the beads were washed three times with 400 µl of incubation buffer. p115 RhoGEF that was bound to the Sepharose beads was released by boiling in SDS-PAGE disruption buffer. The relative amounts of p115 RhoGEF bound to Sepharose beads and in the free fraction were compared by immunoblot analysis using the U2762 antibody. Binding of GTPγS to 2 µm RhoA was assayed at 30 °C in 20 µl of a solution containing 20 µm GTPγS, [35S]GTPγS (200,000 cpm), 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. After mixing, assays were stopped at various times by the addition of 2 ml of filtration buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl), and the proteins were immediately collected by filtration through BA-85 filters (Intermountain Scientific). The amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to RhoA on each dried filter was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The apparent rates of guanine nucleotide exchange for RhoA were examined at 3–4 concentrations of each p115 RhoGEF piece in order to determine its average apparent turnover rate (Table I). All assays were performed so that no more than 20% of the total RhoA had bound GTPγS at the final time point.Table IRates of nucleotide exchange on RhoA stimulated by mutated forms of p115 RhoGEFp115 RhoGEF constructsRate of turnoverR 2valueFraction of full-length activitymin−1p115 full-length1400.991.0p115-(3–14)600.990.4p115-(ΔNH2)600.990.4p115-(Δ252–288)340.990.2p115-(ΔCOOH)140.990.09p115-(19–11)120.980.09p115-(4–11)70.990.05p115-(4–14)60.990.04p115-(1–10)30.990.02p115-(19–10)0.50.990.003p115-(4–10)0.50.990.003p115-(5–10)0.50.990.003The apparent turnover rate for each p115 RhoGEF construct was expressed as moles of RhoA bound to GTPγS/min/mol GEF or as the number of GTPγS molecules that bind to RhoA per min in the presence of one molecule of exchange factor. This was determined by measuring the amount of RhoA that bound [35S]GTPγS over time and at multiple concentrations of exchange factor as described under “Materials and Methods.” The rates from each time course were plotted against the amount of exchange factor used, and an average apparent turnover rate was determined by linear regression analysis. The coefficient of determination, R 2, measures the degree to which the data fit a linear regression model. The last column expresses the activity of each construct relative to the activity of the full-length enzyme. For a description of the constructs see Fig.1 A.

This was determined by measuring the amount of RhoA that bound [35S]GTPγS over time and at multiple concentrations of exchange factor as described under “Materials and Methods.” The rates from each time course were plotted against the amount of exchange factor used, and an average apparent turnover rate was determined by linear regression analysis. The coefficient of determination, R 2, measures the degree to which the data fit a linear regression model. The last column expresses the activity of each construct relative to the activity of the full-length enzyme. For a description of the constructs see Fig.1 A. Endogenous p115 RhoGEF was detected in cytosol and membranes of NIH3T3 and COS cells by immunoblot analysis. Cells were grown to 90% confluence in 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Inc.). After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were collected by scraping and lysed with a glass Dounce homogenizer. Particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 700 × g. Membranes and cytosol were then separated by centrifugation of samples at 100,000 ×g. Samples of each fraction were solubilized by boiling in sample buffer, and SDS-PAGE was utilized to separate 50 µg of either membrane-associated or cytosolic proteins. The relative amounts of p115 RhoGEF were then visualized by immunoblot analysis using the U2764 antibody. pCMV5-myc vectors encoding fragments of p115 RhoGEF were transfected into COS cells grown to ∼80% confluence in 35-mm wells. Transfections were accomplished using the Fugene method (Hoffmann-La Roche). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described for endogenous p115 RhoGEF. Two micrograms of total protein derived from either membrane or cytosolic fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the relative amounts of the recombinant p115 RhoGEF pieces were visualized by immunoblot analysis using an antibody directed against the Myc tag. A mutated serum-response element (SRE), SRE.L, which lacks the c-Fos ternary complex-binding site and responds to RhoA more specifically than the wild type SRE promoter (19Hill C.S. Wynne J.

Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), was used to monitor activation of RhoA. Equal amounts (0.22 µg) of the pGL3 basic vector containing the firefly (P. pyralis) luciferase gene under transcriptional regulation by the SRE.L promoter and the pRL-TK vector containing the Renilla(R. reniformis) luciferase gene under transcriptional regulation by the thymidine kinase promoter were transfected into monolayers of 60–70% confluent NIH3T3 cells in 17-mm wells. Either the pCMV5-myc vector or pCMV5-myc vectors containing cDNA pieces of p115 RhoGEF were also transfected into these cells using the method described by Life Technologies, Inc., for their LipofectAMINE reagent. After transfection, cells were incubated for 16 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Assays measuring luciferase activity were performed as described in the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Activities are expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase activity overRenilla luciferase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. Recombinant and endogenous RhoA in the GTP state were measured by their association with the RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) as described by Ren and Schwartz (25Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayers of NIH3T3 or HEK293 cells in 100-mm plates were starved overnight in DMEM. Cells were then either left untreated or exposed for 5 min to 3 µm lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), 1 µmsphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), or 10% FBS. Cells were immediately lysed in 500 µl of 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1% octyl glucoside, 0.5% sodium cholate, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors as described above. Each lysate was incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with 40 µg of GST-RBD, which was immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed three times with 500 µl of cold wash buffer (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 1% octyl glucoside, 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl) and protease inhibitors and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins within the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and examined by immunoblot analysis for the content of RhoA. To assess differential activation of RhoA by p115 RhoGEF piecesin vivo, HEK293 cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33Google Scholar) with p115 RhoGEF and HA-tagged RhoA. After 16 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were lysed and probed with the GST-RBD domain as described above. In this case the samples were immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody specific for the HA tag (Babco). Lysates were also immunoblotted for the expression of p115 RhoGEF or mutants of p115 RhoGEF using the U2762 antibody. Initial characterization of p115 RhoGEF in vitro has established two functional motifs. The N-terminal third of the protein, which contains the RGS homology region, acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Gα12 and Gα13 (16Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The rest of the protein, which contains the predicted DH and PH domains, is an effective exchange factor for the Rho GTPase (23Hart M.J. Sharma S. El Masry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which G13effects stimulation of exchange activity for Rho or the regulatory properties of this protein in the cellular milieu are undefined. In order to gain insight into these mechanisms, a more specific deletion analysis of the protein was undertaken. The sequences of the mutated constructs used in this study are described in Fig.1 A. All of these constructs can be expressed by transfection of mammalian cells or via infection of Sf9 cells with baculoviruses. Examples of purified proteins, obtained after expression in Sf9 cells and affinity isolation via N-terminal EE tags, are shown in Fig. 1 B. Three subdomains of p115RhoGEF (aa 1–252 (RGS), aa 353–637 (DH), and aa 760–912 (C-terminal)) could be readily expressed in bacteria and were purified to homogeneity (data not shown). These were used to generate these polyclonal antisera as described under “Materials and Methods”: U2760 (anti-RGS), U2762 (anti-DH), and U2764 (anti-C-terminal). Each antisera specifically recognized the antigenic target to which it was generated as well as full-length p115 RhoGEF (Fig. 2 A). Since the polyclonal antisera also recognize the N-terminal EE tag that was part of the purified antigens, proteins were expressed either without a tag or with an N-terminal Myc tag. All three antisera could detect recombinant and endogenous p115 RhoGEF by immunoblot analysis (Figs.2 B and 5 A). The U2762 (DH) and U2764(C-terminal) antibodies could also be used to detect endogenous protein by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and specifically immunoprecipitated endogenous exchange factor (Fig. 7 D).Figure 5Domain analysis of p115 RhoGEF activation of SRE .L driven transcription of Luciferase. A, mutants of p115 RhoGEF that lack the C-terminal 150 amino acids strongly activate transcription of luciferase. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected with different vectors encoding thymidine kinase-dependentRenilla luciferase and SRE.L-dependent firefly luciferase and pCMV5 vectors encoding p115 RhoGEF constructs. After growth in DMEM lacking serum for 16 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The expression of firefly luciferase was normalized to expression of the Renilla luciferase enzyme. Activities expressed in the presence of different p115 RhoGEF constructs are presented as fold stimulation over the normalized luciferase activity from cells transfected with control vector. B, LPA enhances SRE.L-mediated transcription of luciferase by p115 RhoGEF. NIH3T3 cells were transfected as described in A. After 14 h, cells were incubated for 4 h with serum-free DMEM or DMEM containing 1 µm LPA.

InEscherichia coli, this process involves eight membrane proteins encoded by the ccmABCDEFGH operon. CcmE binds heme covalently and transfers it to apocytochromes c in the presence of other Ccm proteins. CcmC is necessary and sufficient to incorporate heme into CcmE. Here, we report that the CcmC protein directly interacts with heme. We further show that CcmC co-immunoprecipitates with CcmE. CcmC contains two conserved histidines and a signature sequence, the so-called tryptophan-rich motif, which is the only element common to cytochrome c maturation proteins of bacteria, archae, plant mitochondria, and chloroplasts. We report that mutational changes of these motifs affecting the function of CcmC in cytochrome c maturation do not influence heme binding of CcmC. However, the mutants are defective in the CcmC-CcmE interaction, suggesting that these motifs are involved in the formation of a CcmC-CcmE complex. We propose that CcmC, CcmE, and heme interact directly with each other, establishing a periplasmic heme delivery pathway for cytochrome c maturation.

During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in their biogenesis, which involves the transport of both the apoprotein and heme across membranes and their covalent ligation (1Thöny-Meyer L.

Three different systems for the maturation of c-type cytochromes have been identified in living cells (2Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

In systems I and II (eubacteria, plant, and protist mitochondria, chloroplasts), cytochrome cmaturation proteins contain at least one membrane protein with several membrane-spanning segments that possesses the well conserved, tryptophan-rich sequence motif WGXXWXWD in an extracytoplasmically oriented domain, which represents the only signature common to cytochrome c maturation factors of all three kingdoms. In contrast, system III operating in mitochondria of animals and fungi does not involve such a protein. In Gram-negative bacteria, the synthesis of heme and apocytochromec takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas the covalent attachment of heme to the conserved cysteines in the CXXCH heme binding site of the polypeptide is a periplasmic process. This key step of cytochrome c maturation referred to as heme ligation occurs after both heme and the apocytochrome have been translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane (6Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli,apocytochrome c is translocated via the general type II secretion (sec) pathway of protein translocation to the periplasm (7Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, no system for directed translocation of heme between the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments has yet been described. Recently, it was shown that heme can be transported into everted membrane vesicles of E. coli by an energy-independent mechanism, but no evidence for a specific heme export system was obtained (8Cook G.M. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In E. coli, eight genes essential for cytochromec maturation (ccmA–H)1 have been identified (9Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Grove J. Tanapongpipat S. Thomas G. Griffith L. Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 467-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Analysis of mutants with deletions in individual ccm genes showed that each of the gene products is essential for c-type cytochrome biogenesis (11Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L.

Hofer T. Thöny-Meyer L. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A key player in the maturation pathway has been identified in the heme chaperone CcmE, which binds heme covalently at a single histidine residue and subsequently transfers it to apocytochrome c(11Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The attachment of heme to CcmE requires the function of another Ccm protein, CcmC, and can be improved by the small, integral membrane protein CcmD, which apparently stabilizes CcmE in the membrane (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It was also reported that CcmC of Pseudomonas fluorescens andParacoccus denitrificans had an additional function in the biogenesis and/or secretion of the iron chelator pyoverdine (16Gaballa A. Koedam N. Cornelis P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,17Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The membrane topology of the Rhodobacter capsulatus CcmC homologue HelC (18Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and the P. fluorescens CcmC (19Gaballa A. Baysse C. Koedam N. Muyldermans S. Cornelis P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has been established. CcmC contains six transmembrane helices, separated by two cytoplasmic and three periplasmic loops. A conserved tryptophan-rich motif is present in the second periplasmic loop, which is flanked by two conserved histidines located in the first and third periplasmic loops (3Xie Z. Merchant S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol.

Ritz D. Hennecke H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In E. coli, site-directed mutagenesis of each of these histidines (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the tryptophan-rich motif (21Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) affected the function of CcmC. It has been speculated that the tryptophan-rich motif of CcmC provides a hydrophobic platform for the interaction of CcmC with heme, with the two histidines operating as axial heme ligands (18Goldman B.S. Beck D.L. Monika E.M. Kranz R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5003-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, no biochemical approach has been used to support this hypothesis. Here, we tested whether CcmC is a heme-binding protein and investigated the prediction that CcmC interacts directly with CcmE in the course of the heme transfer. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. E. coliC600ΔhemA::kan and pFR2 were gifts from C.

Primers 5′-tggtggaacaccctggctcaggggtcgacgc-3′ and 5′-gcgtcgacccctgagccagggtgttccacca-3′ were purchased from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). The mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 500 µl (A 600 = 0.5) cells were precipitated with 250 µl of trichloroacetic acid (30%) on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min. The pellets were resuspended in 13 µl of 2× SDS loading dye and neutralized with 5 µl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). Holo-CcmE formation was analyzed after SDS-PAGE by heme stain (11Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Periplasmic fractions of 500-ml anaerobically grown cultures were isolated by treatment with polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, washed with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended (2 ml/g of wet cells) in cold extraction buffer (1 mg/ml polymyxin B sulfate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The suspension was stirred for 60 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant contained the periplasmic fraction. Membrane fractions of 500-ml anaerobically grown cultures were prepared as follows. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g, washed with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, resuspended in 2 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 µg/ml DNase I and passed three times through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa. Cell debris was separated by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 150,000 × gfor 60 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction (pellet) was washed once with 1 ml of cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) and resuspended in 200 µl of the same buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Heme staining of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was carried out usingo-dianiside (Sigma) as substrate. The gel was incubated for 10 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After extensive washing with water, the gel was stained using 20 mg of o-dianisidine freshly dissolved in 20 ml of 50 mm tri-sodium citrate, pH 4.4, 0.7% H2O2 (11Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the histidine-tagged versions of CcmC (His6-CcmC) was performed using monoclonal tetra-His antibodies (Qiagen) at a dilution of 1:2000. Antibodies directed against CcmE (11Schulz H. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Science. 1998; 281: 1197-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) were used at a dilution of 1:5000. Signals were detected using goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad), respectively, as secondary antibody and CSPD (3-(4-methoxyspiro(1,2- dioxethan-3,2′·(5′chloro)tricyclo(3.3.1.13,7)decan)-4-yl)phenyl-phosphate) (Roche Diagnostics) as substrate. 150 µg of total membrane proteins were solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% lauroylsarcosine). After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with 10 µl of hemin-agarose (Sigma, 7.7 µmol of hemin/ml of packed gel) on a rotating wheel at 30 °C for 1 h. Aminododecyl-agarose beads (Sigma) were used as control to rule out nonspecific interactions between membrane proteins and agarose. Agarose beads were washed three times with solubilization buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound material. Agarose beads were then treated with 2× SDS loading dye (containing 50 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were visualized by immunoblot analysis. Membrane proteins (150 µg) were solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (see above). After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was incubated with different concentrations of hemin: 0, 5, 10, 20, and 50 µm at 30 °C for 30 min on a rotating wheel. Heme was dissolved in 20 mm NaOH (final concentration, 10 mm). The mixture was then centrifuged at room temperature at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further incubated with 10 µl of hemin-agarose at 30 °C on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The agarose beads were collected and washed. 30 µl of SDS loading dye (containing 50 mm dithiothreitol) were added to resuspend the agarose beads. Samples were then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The proteins (20 µl) were subjected to a 12% SDS-gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antisera directed against the tetra-His-tag. 500 µg of total membrane proteins were solubilized in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 15 000 g for 20 min, 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with 5 µl of CcmE antibodies or 10 µl of tetra-His antibodies (0.2 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 1.5 h on a rotating wheel. 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was pretreated by washing twice with 1 ml of HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.5), twice with 1 ml of HNMG (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 10% glycerol). Protein A-Sepharose was then added to the membrane/antibody mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1.5 h on a rotating wheel. The Sepharose was precipitated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 min, washed three times with 1 ml of solubilization buffer, and washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The proteins associated with the antibody-protein A-Sepharose complex were treated with 2× SDS-loading dye (containing 50 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The proteins were subjected to 12% SDS gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with antisera against the tetra-His-tag or CcmE. Previously, it was shown that CcmC is sufficient to trigger heme binding to CcmE, and the conserved histidines, as well as the tryptophan-rich motif of CcmC are required for heme transfer to CcmE (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In an attempt to look for minor phenotypic variations between the different mutants, experimental conditions were improved such that detection of holo-CcmE became more sensitive (see under “Experimental Procedures”). With the optimized conditions, we found that the individual histidines (His-60 and His-184) of CcmC are not absolutely required for heme transfer to CcmE. The Δccm mutant EC06, in which the ccmA–Hgenes are deleted (9Thöny-Meyer L. Fischer F. Künzler P. Ritz D. Hennecke H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4321-4326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was co-transformed with plasmid pEC410 (pccmE) and with plasmids expressing differentccmC mutant alleles. Fig.1A (lanes 1–6) shows that in the presence of wild-type CcmC heme was incorporated into CcmE (lane 2), whereas in the negative control (vector only) and in all tested ccmC mutants, no heme attachment to CcmE was detected (lanes 1 and3–6). A different picture emerged when the Δccm mutant was transformed with pEC408 (pccmDE) and the plasmids expressing differentccmC mutant alleles. Fig. 1 A (lanes 7–12) shows that in the presence of wild-type CcmC, heme binding to CcmE was enhanced (lane 8), whereas in the negative control (vector only), no heme attachment to CcmE occurred (lane 7). In contrast to former results (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), upon enhanced expression of ccmD, the single CcmC histidine point mutants (H60A and H184A) showed some activity of heme attachment to CcmE (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9 and 10). However, substitution of both histidines by alanines (H60A/H184A) abolished detection of heme binding to CcmE (lane 11). As reported previously, mutations within the tryptophan-rich motif (W119A/(W122-D126)A) resulted in loss of heme transfer to CcmE at our level of detection (lane 12). When the 5-fold amount of membrane proteins was analyzed from these samples, the same results were obtained (not shown). These results demonstrate that the conserved histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif are necessary for holo-CcmE formation in the absence of CcmD. Expression ofccmD partially suppressed the phenotype of the single histidine mutants. The differing abilities of the ccmCmutants to form holo-CcmE observed in Fig. 1 A were not due to different levels of CcmE or CcmC (Fig. 1, B andC) but rather to different activities of CcmC mutant proteins. The ability of the CcmC point mutants to support cytochromec maturation was also tested. The periplasmic B. japonicum cytochrome c 550 encoded bycycA can be expressed in E. coli from plasmid pRJ3291 upon induction with arabinose (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). E. coli strain EC28 (13Throne-Holst M. Thöny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), containing a ccmC in-frame deletion, was transformed with pRJ3291 and with plasmids expressing differentccmC alleles. Upon induction of cycA expression, holocytochrome c formation was analyzed by heme staining of periplasmic proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 D, wild-typeccmC (lane 2) and the ccmC mutants containing the H60A or the H184A (lanes 3 and 4) were able to complement the ΔccmC mutant phenotype, although the mutants H60A and H184A showed a significant reduction in cytochrome c formation. As expected, the mutants H60A/H184A and W119A/(W122-D126)A did not synthesize detectable amounts of holocytochrome c (Fig. 1 D, lanes 5 and6). These results substantiate our finding that both histidines together and the tryptophan-rich motif per se are important for CcmC-mediated heme transfer during cytochromec maturation (12Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Is CcmC a heme transporter? If so, it might be possible to restore holo-CcmE formation in a ΔccmC mutant by adding heme to the medium, provided heme can pass the outer membrane and becomes available in the periplasm for interaction with the CcmE biosynthetic apparatus. An E. coli hemA mutant deficient in the synthesis of the heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid cannot grow under respiratory conditions unless δ-aminolevulinic acid is added to the medium. Heme can only be used to restore this auxotrophy when an outer membrane heme receptor is co-expressed in E. coli. To create a ccmC-deficient strain that can be used to test for extracellular heme complementation, we transduced thehemA::kan allele into the ΔccmCmutant EC28. The resulting heme auxotroph transductant was co-transformed with the plasmids pFR2 (hasR expressed from an arabinose-inducible promotor) and pEC406 (pccmCDE) or pEC408 (pccmDE). HasR, an outer membrane heme receptor ofSerratia marcescens, is sufficient for heme uptake inE. coli (24Ghigo J.M. Létoffé S. Wandersman C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3572-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The recombinants were grown in MS minimal medium in the presence and absence of heme (5 µm) and induced with 0.02% arabinose. Without heme supplied, no growth was observed. Cells grown in the presence of heme were collected, and holo-CcmE formation was analyzed by heme stain. Fig.2shows that in the presence of CcmC, heme was incorporated into CcmE from cells grown with external heme (lane 1), whereas in the absence of CcmC, holo-CcmE was not formed (lane 2). Cell growth indicated that the externally added heme had been taken up. Nevertheless, exogenous heme did not complement CcmC function. Similar findings have been reported forP. denitrificans ccmA and ccmB mutants (27Page M.D. Pearce D.A. Norris H.A. Ferguson S.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Does CcmC directly interact with heme or does it indirectly assist heme delivery? To tackle this question, we tested the ability of CcmC to bind heme by affinity chromatography on hemin-agarose. The Δccm mutant EC06 containing plasmid pEC422 expresses a histidine-tagged (His6-) CcmC protein (Fig.3A, lane 3). Membranes of anaerobically grown cells were solubilized with various detergents and tested for specific binding to hemin-agarose. It was found that lauroylsarcosine could solubilize CcmC without causing nonspecific interactions between CcmC and hemin-agarose. Solubilized proteins before (Fig. 3 A) and after (Fig. 3 B) incubation with hemin-agarose were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-His antibodies. Membrane proteins of a control strain containing vector only and membrane proteins containing His6-CcmC incubating with agarose rather than hemin-agarose were used as negative controls. The wild-type CcmC was able to bind to hemin-agarose (Fig.3 B, lane 3), whereas the negative controls did not give any detectable CcmC signal on the immunoblot (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1and 2), ruling out the possibility of nonspecific interactions. We conclude that CcmC is a heme-binding protein. If the tryptophan-rich motif and the two histidines of CcmC constitute a heme binding site, we should expect reduction or loss of heme binding in mutants with changes in these motifs. Therefore, we performed hemin-agarose affinity chromatography with the different ccmC mutant proteins. When membrane preparations containing similar amounts of CcmC proteins (Fig.3 A) were applied under identical conditions as for the wild type, the H60A, H184A, H60A/H184A, and W119A/(W122-D126)A mutant proteins bound hemin-agarose at wild-type levels (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–7). Hence, the two conserved histidines together or the tryptophan-rich motif alone might be sufficient for heme binding of CcmC. In consequence, three mutants were constructed, in which the double mutant pairs H60A/W119A/(W122-D126)A and W119A/(W122-D126)A/H184A, and the triple mutant H60A/W119A/(W122-D126)A/H184A were combined. Further affinity chromatography analysis of these three mutants with hemin-agarose revealed that heme binding was not affected (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 8–10). To confirm the specificity of heme binding to CcmC, pretreatment of the membrane proteins with heme before applying hemin-agarose was done in a titration experiment. Membrane preparations containing CcmC or the triple mutant H60A/W119A/(W122-D126)A/H184A were first incubated with different concentrations of free heme, followed by addition of hemin-agarose. Proteins bound to hemin-agarose were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The more CcmC protein can be saturated with free heme, the less will bind to hemin-agarose. Fig.4reveals that with the increase of free heme, the amount of both wild-type and mutant CcmC decreased on the immunoblot (Fig. 4). Saturation appeared to be reached at a concentration of 50 µm free heme, because neither of the CcmC proteins could be detected on the immunoblot (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that heme binding of CcmC is independent on residues His-60, His-184, and the tryptophan-rich motif. It has been speculated that the heme chaperone CcmE forms a protein complex with CcmC during heme transfer to CcmE (21Schulz H. Pellicioli E.C. Thöny-Meyer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether CcmE interacts with CcmC, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Treatment of membranes containing CcmE and/or CcmC proteins with various detergents revealed thatn-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside could solubilize the majority of both proteins. Immunoprecipitation of detergent-solubilized proteins was performed with the anti-His antibodies or with the anti-CcmE serum proteins. The precipitated complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Anti-His-tag precipitates were probed with anti-CcmE immunoglobulins to detect co-immunoprecipitated CcmE protein (Fig. 5A). Anti-CcmE precipitates were analyzed for the presence of CcmC using anti-His antibodies (Fig. 5 B). In membrane preparations containing both CcmE and CcmC, the CcmC immunoprecipitates contained CcmE antigen (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 3), and the CcmE precipitates contained CcmC (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and3). In contrast, the control membrane preparations with either CcmC or CcmE alone did not contain the corresponding co-precipitates (lane 1 in A and B,respectively). When CcmD was present, more CcmE could be detected in the CcmC immunoprecipitates compared with when CcmD was absent (Fig.5 A, lane 3 versus lane 2), whereas the amount of CcmC in the CcmE immunoprecipitates was not influenced by the absence of CcmD (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that CcmC interacts with CcmE, resulting in a macromolecular CcmCE complex. The finding that the conserved histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif of CcmC are not essential for heme binding prompted us to test other possible functions of these motifs, such as interaction with CcmE. Fig.6A shows that CcmE did not co-immunoprecipitate with the CcmC mutants even in the presence of CcmD (lanes 3–6), albeit the abundance of CcmE and CcmC polypeptides in the membrane fractions (Fig. 6, B andC, respectively) was not affected drastically by the point mutations. Thus, both conserved histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif are required for the formation of a complex between CcmC and CcmE. Our understanding of the mechanism of Ccm protein action is very limited. The present paper extends previous knowledge on the function of CcmC by providing evidence that (i) CcmC interacts directly with heme; (ii) CcmC interacts directly with CcmE; and (iii) contrary to previous suggestions (see “Introduction”), the conserved residues in CcmC are not essential for binding heme but are involved in forming a CcmC-CcmE complex. In Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria, plant and protist mitochondria, and chloroplasts, at least one cytochrome cmaturation protein contains a strictly conserved tryptophan-rich motif, which is the only common element shared between system I and II of cytochrome c maturation (5Thöny-Meyer Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this work we addressed for the first time the question of whether these proteins physically interact with heme using CcmC as a model. We could show that CcmC binds heme. Histidines are common axial ligands of heme-iron in proteins (28Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution, and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Menlo Park, CA1983: 19-65Google Scholar,29O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, the functionally important, conserved histidine residues of CcmC are not essential for heme binding. Similar results have been reported for the heme receptor protein HemR of Yersinia enterocolitica, where mutations of two conserved histidines (His-128 and His-461) did not affect heme binding to HemR (30Bracken C.S. Baer M.T. Abdur-Rashid A. Helms W. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6063-6072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydrophobic nature of the tryptophan-rich motif gave rise to the speculation that it functions as a heme binding site. However, according to our analysis of mutants with amino acid substitutions in this motif, the heme binding characteristics were not changed. Even the construction of a triple mutant with both histidines and the tryptophan-rich motif changed did not decrease the binding of CcmC to hemin agarose, suggesting that heme binding occurs elsewhere in the polypeptide. It is important to state that this result does not preclude any kind of transient interaction of the conserved sequence motifs with heme. It is possible that CcmC is also involved in translocating heme across the cytoplasmic membrane. In this case, one would expect a heme binding site to lay on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. However, the cytoplasmically oriented domains of CcmC are not particularly well conserved. Alternatively, heme may insert spontaneously into the lipid bilayer and just involve periplasmic domains of the protein for passing it onto CcmE. They would constitute a heme delivery site that is not designed to hold heme, but rather provides a path or physical connection to the heme recipient, CcmE. Our attempts to bypass the lack of CcmC by providing heme in the medium and transport it across the outer membrane with the help of the heme receptor HasR were not successful. Because we controlled for heme uptake of the cells by using a hemA mutant that can only grow on glycerol-minimal medium when heme is available, the failure of the experiment can be explained in different ways: (i) heme transport is directly linked to heme delivery, which is in agreement with our finding that CcmC interacts with CcmE, or (ii) heme uptake by HasR and translocation to the cytoplasm are coupled such that heme cannot be released into the periplasm. Certainly, CcmC cannot be a general heme exporter, because a ccmC mutant still incorporates heme into periplasmic cytochrome b 562 (13Throne-Holst M. Thöny-Meyer L. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At present, we cannot exclude a role of CcmC in heme transport across the membrane. In vivo function of CcmC as the only factor strictly required for heme insertion into CcmE suggested a protein-protein interaction between CcmC and CcmE. Here, we showed by co-immunoprecipitation that a complex between the two polypeptides is formed in the membranes. Clearly, the conserved sequence motifs of CcmC contribute to this interaction. The formation of a CcmC-CcmE complex is in agreement with a function of CcmC in heme transfer that involves a directed, perhaps even stereospecific positioning of heme onto apo-CcmE to catalyze the formation of the covalent heme-histidine bond. Our findings support a new model for holo-CcmE synthesis, which takes into account that the conserved histidines and tryptophan-rich motif of CcmC may not be involved in binding heme, but rather in the delivery of heme to CcmE. Our data give experimental evidence for the first time that CcmC functions as a CcmE heme lyase. We gratefully acknowledge C. Wandersman for providing strain C600ΔhemA and plasmid pFR2. We thank K.

Dimers of class II MHC proteins coupled in a variety of orientations and topologies each were able to activate CD4+ T-cells, indicating that triggering was not dependent on a particular receptor orientation. In contrast to the minimal influence of receptor orientation, T-cell triggering was affected by the inter-molecular distance between MHC molecules, and MHC dimers coupled through shorter cross-linkers were consistently more potent than those coupled through longer cross-linkers.

Monomeric reagents generally are not able to induce a response in T-cells, although some exceptions have been reported, particularly for CD8+ T-cells (7Yoon S.T. Dianzani U. Bottomly K.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 467-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These considerations have led to the understanding that T-cells can be triggered by oligomerization of their surface TCR, although the full cellular activation response requires additional (co-stimulatory) signals from the antigen-presenting cell in addition to the antigenic signal transduced by the TCR (10Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Several studies have pointed to formation of a TCR dimer as the key event for triggering T-cell activation. Quantitative analyses of the dependence of T-cell activation on the surface density of MHC-peptide complexes presented on the surface antigen presenting cells (11Bachmann M.F. Ohashi P.S. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Sousa J. Carneiro J. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1987; 138: 3367-3374PubMed Google Scholar), have suggested a crucial role of dimer formation in triggering a T-cell response. For soluble class II MHC oligomers, the minimal MHC valency required to initiate signaling in CD4+ T-cells appears to be a dimer (14Boniface J.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Wulfing C. Hampl J. Reich Z.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Higher valency MHC oligomers can activate more potently than dimers, but this is due only to their increased binding avidity (15Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stern L.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which dimerization of TCR triggers cytoplasmic signaling cascades is unknown. Receptor dimerization as the proximal activating stimulus is consistent with several potential molecular mechanisms, including formation of a specific TCR dimer in an activating conformation (as observed for receptor tyrosine kinases (16Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)), molecular rearrangement of a pre-existing receptor dimer (as observed for the bacterial aspartate receptor (17Falke J.J. Bass R.B. Butler S.L. Chervitz S.A. Danielson M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 457-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar)), or nonspecific co-localization of receptor cytoplasmic domains (18Klemm J.D. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 569-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Experimental discrimination between these potential mechanisms can be difficult, and recent evidence has suggested that some systems originally thought to occur through a mechanism of receptor oligomerization may in fact involve allosteric rearrangements in a pre-existing receptor oligomer (reviewed in Ref. 19Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In support of a nonspecific dimerization model, T-cell activation has been induced by many different anti-receptor antibodies (6Bekoff M. Kubo R. Grey H.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1411-1419PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yoon S.T. Dianzani U. Bottomly K. Janeway Jr., C.A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 563-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and by oligomerization of a variety of chimeric TCR cytoplasmic domains (20Romeo C. Amiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Letourneur F. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The exact stoichiometry of the unliganded form of the TCR complex is unknown, but has been proposed to contain two αβ TCRs (23San Jose E. Sahuquillo A.G. Bragado R. Alarcon B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Fernandez-Miguel G. Alarcon B. Iglesias A. Bluethmann H. Alvarez-Mon M. Sanz E. de la Hera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1995; 32: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that molecular rearrangement of a pre-existing receptor oligomer may be a potential activation mechanism. However, it is possible that the presence of two antigen-binding domains could serve only to facilitate the large-order clustering and oligomerization of receptors on the cell-surface that has been observed physiologically (26Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). To investigate these possible mechanisms, dimeric MHC-peptide complexes were prepared in a variety of intermolecular orientations and topologies, and used to probe the effects of receptor orientation and topology on T-cell triggering. Receptor orientation was not critical for T-cell signaling, as a variety of conformationally constrained MHC dimers coupled through either the α- or β-subunit each were able to induce T-cell activation processes. However, efficient T-cell triggering was dependent on receptor proximity, as activation was diminished when MHC dimers were coupled through longer cross-links. Collectively, these results suggest that T-cells are triggered by a mechanism of generalized intermolecular receptor proximity that does not depend on the intermolecular receptor orientation. HLA-DR1 (A*0101, B1*0101) α- and β-subunits, or modified versions carrying a C-terminal cysteine residue (Cysα,βCys) (27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells as described (28Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subunits included the peptide binding and membrane-proximal immunoglobulin domains (α1–182 and β1–190). In some experiments a longer version of the β-subunit (βL-Cys) was used, which included also the “connecting peptide” β191–198 (RSESAQSK). Recombinant MHC-peptide complexes were folded by dilution of urea-solubilized subunits in the presence of peptide and redox buffers, and isolated by ion-exchange chromatography, as previously described (28Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). HLA-DR1 complexes carried antigenic peptide Ha (resiudes 306–318) (PKYVKQNTLKLAT), derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin (29Roche P.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1849-1856PubMed Google Scholar), or control endogenous peptide A2 (residues 103–117) (VGSDWRFLRGYHQYA), derived from class I MHC HLA-A2 (30Chicz R.M. Strominger J.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). HLA-DR1 used in preparation of MHC dimers carried a cysteine residue at either the α or β C terminus. To prevent oxidation of the introduced cysteine residues, MHC-peptide complexes containing introduced cysteines were purified in 5 mm dithiothreitol, which was removed immediately prior to cross-linking. The introduced cysteines undergo facile reaction with thiol-specific reagents, allowing specific cross-linking at the α- or β-subunit termini. Polypeptide-based cross-linkers were synthesized by Fmoc chemistry on a solid-phase peptide synthesizer as previously described (27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. All cross-linker peptides were capped at their N termini by reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate. To introduce thiol-reactive maleimide groups, purified peptides (2–5 mg) were reacted through their lysine ε-amino groups withN-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide ester (Pierce), by dissolving 5-fold molar excess in N,N-dimethylformamide and adding it to peptide in 10 mm Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl. After 1.5 h at room temperature, the modified peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C18 column (Vydac), and the presence of both maleimide functional groups was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. For direct disulfide bond formation between the introduced thiols, 0.25 mmCuSO4 and 1.3 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to MHC-peptide complexes in 50 mm HEPES, (pH 8) (31Bubis J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12995-12999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for at least 1 h at room temperature. For dimerization through the thiol-reactive maleimide groups on the synthetic peptide-based cross-linkers X3X, X9X, and X14X (Fig. 1A), the cross-linker was added in small batches to MHC-peptide complexes in 10 mm Na-phosphate (pH 7), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA over ∼5 h at room temperature, to a final cross-linker:MHC ratio of 1:2. Cross-linked MHC-peptide complexes were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex-200, using two HR 10/30 FPLC columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) linked in series. The integrity of covalent thiol linkages and the presence of bound antigenic peptide were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Maleimide-to-maleimide distances for cross-linkers in extended conformations were estimated using molecular models. ApparentM r (M r,app) values for MHC-peptide dimers were determined from elution volumes obtained by gel filtration chromatography, by reference to a calibration curve obtained from the elution volume of knownM r standards (Bio-Rad). The Stokes radii (R S) of the MHC dimers were derived from theM r,app as previously described (32Zarutskie J.A. Sato A.K. Rushe M.M. Chan I.C. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Stern L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5878-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except the following equation was used to calculate the hydrated volume (V H), VH=Mr,app(psv+(hydprotein)(ρwater))N(Eq. 1) where hydprotein is the estimated extent of hydration in the protein (0.35 g of water/g of protein), ρwater is the density of water at 20 °C (0.998 g/cm3), N is Avogadro's number, and psv is the partial specific volume of HLA-DR1-Ha (0.738 cm3/g) calculated from the amino acid composition.

Lake P. Woody J.N. Green N. Nature. 1982; 300: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) is a well studied human CD4+ T-cell clone that responds to the Ha peptide bound to HLA-DR1. The HLA-DR1-restricted, Ha peptide-specific polyclonal T-cell line (designated 1H) was raised from the mononuclear cell fraction of peripheral blood from an HLA-DR1 homozygous individual, by repeatedin vitro stimulation with Ha peptide. HA1.7 and 1H were maintained in RPMI containing 5% human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), with antigenic stimulation every 2 weeks using 120 IU/ml IL-2 (BIOSOURCE) and an irradiated mixture of nonspecific peripheral blood lymphocytes and EBV1.24, a DR1+ B-cell line, pulsed with 1 µmHa peptide. T-cells were rested for a minimum of 7 days after stimulation before use in activation and binding assays. Soluble MHC-peptide complexes were added to 5 × 104 T-cells in complete medium in round-bottom polypropylene 96-well plates. After the desired incubation time at 37 °C and 7% CO2, cells were placed on ice and levels of cell surface markers were determined using the following fluorescent monoclonal antibodies: phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD3 (clone UCHT-1, Pharmingen), or allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled anti-CD25 (M-A251, Pharmingen), APC-anti-CD69 (FN50, Pharmingen), and APC-anti-CD71 (T56/14, Leinco Technologies). After 1 h at 4 °C, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% sodium azide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Fluorescence data were obtained with a Becton-Dickinson FACS Calibur flow cytometer and analyzed using Cell Quest software. The number of CD3 molecules per cell was determined from the mean PE fluorescence using SPHERO rainbow calibration particles (Spherotech) containing known amounts of PE equivalents. Experiment to experiment variation was observed in the overall time course and extent of activation, which appeared to be dependent on the length of time the T-cells had been in culture, but relative levels of activation induced by the various dimers were the same in different experiments. Competitive binding assays were performed as previously described (15Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stern L.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrin-labeled, streptavidin-coupled MHC oligomers (SA-PE), prepared by binding biotinylated MHC monomers to streptavidin preparations (34Cameron T.O. Cochran J.R. Yassine-Diab B. Sekaly R.-P. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), were used as a binding probe, with competition by unlabeled or fluorescein-labeled MHC-peptide oligomers. These SA-PE oligomers exhibit a strong fluorescence from the R-phycoerythrin conjugate and bind to T-cells in an antigen-specific manner (34Cameron T.O. Cochran J.R. Yassine-Diab B. Sekaly R.-P. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of MHC dimers and monomer were incubated with a constant amount of SA-PE oligomer ([MHC]= 4 µg/ml) and 5 × 104 HA1.7 T-cells in 96-well round-bottomed plates for 3 h at 37 °C, 7% CO2. Cells were washed and fluorescence arising from bound SA-PE oligomer was measured by flow cytometry as described above. To investigate the orientation requirements of T-cell triggering, we prepared soluble dimers of the human class II MHC protein HLA-DR1, with a variety of different intermolecular orientations and conformational constraints. The oligomerization strategy involved specific cross-linking at the sulfhydryl moiety of a cysteine residue introduced either at the C terminus of the α-subunit immunoglobulin domain (α182), the C terminus of the β-subunit immunoglobulin domain (β190), or after the β-subunit connecting peptide region (β191–198), which immediately precedes the native transmembrane domain (Fig.1 B). Proteins carrying the introduced cysteine residues (Cysαβ, αβCys, or αβL-Cys, respectively) were produced by in vitro folding in the presence of antigenic (Ha) or endogenous (A2) peptides, using previously described protocols (27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Frayser M. Sato A.K. Xu L. Stern L.J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). MHC-peptide complexes were dimerized either by using a direct disulfide bond between the introduced cysteine thiols (31Bubis J. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12995-12999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or using a sulfhydryl-reactive synthetic cross-linking reagent of varying length (Fig. 1 A). The synthetic cross-linkers X3X, X9X, and X14X are based on a flexible peptide scaffold containing glycine, serine, and glutamic acid residues, and each carry an N-terminal fluorophore and two maleimidylcaproyl (X) groups, attached as amides to lysine residues. MHC-peptide dimers coupled by direct disulfide bonds (S-S) or by the synthetic cross-linkers, through either the α- or β-subunit, each had the desired covalent linkage (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Each of the dimers retained the ability to tightly bind peptide antigen, as demonstrated by resistance to SDS-induced chain dissociation (35Stern L.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 68: 465-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C, left panel), and exhibited the expected apparent molecular weight with no tendency to aggregate, as determined by gel filtration chromatography (see below). The orientation dependence for T-cell activation was investigated by comparing the dose-response curves of MHC dimers linked through the α- or β-subunit. MHC dimers were tested for their ability to trigger T-cell activation processes in HA1.7, a well characterized human T-cell clone (33Lamb J.R. Eckels D.D. Lake P. Woody J.N. Green N. Nature. 1982; 300: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) specific for an antigenic peptide derived from influenza virus hemagglutinin (Ha) as presented by the class II MHC protein HLA-DR1 (29Roche P.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1849-1856PubMed Google Scholar). T-cells down-regulate engaged TCR (CD3), as part of the activation process (36Itoh Y. Hemmer B. Martin R. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2073-2080PubMed Google Scholar, 37Valitutti S. Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The down-modulation of TCR in response to the soluble MHC dimers was measured by flow cytometry using a PE-labeled antibody against the TCR CD3ε subunit. Disulfide-linked dimers of MHC proteins, complexed with Ha peptide and cross-linked through either the α- or β-subunit (Cysαβ S-S and αβCys S-S), induced TCR down-regulation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2A, open and closed circles). Dimers coupled with a long, flexible cross-linker (Cysαβ X14X and αβCys X14X,open and closed squares), or dimers carrying the additional flexible connecting peptide linker on the β-subunit (αβL-Cys X14X, open diamonds) also induced CD3 down-regulation. The level of activation induced by dimers linked through either the α- or β-subunit was similar for complementary pairs of disulfide-bonded dimers, and for complementary pairs of dimers coupled through the peptide-based cross-linkers. As previously observed (15Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stern L.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), neither MHC-peptide monomers (Fig. 2 A, ×), nor oligomers carrying the non-antigenic, endogenous peptide A2 (data not shown), induced significant T-cell triggering in the concentration range tested. Down-regulation of CD3 induced by the MHC dimers was observed as early as 2 h and continued to increase over time, with similar time courses for complementary dimers linked through the α- or β-subunits (Fig. 2 B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that receptor orientation is not crucial for signaling, as in each case dimers linked through the α- or β-subunit induced T-cell activation to an equivalent extent. Similar responses were observed for other measures of T-cell activation processes, including up-regulation of the early T-cell activation marker CD69 (38Testi R. D'Ambrosio D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A), up-regulation of the low-affinity IL-2 receptor α-subunit (CD25) (39Waldmann T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 875-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B), and up-regulation of transferrin receptor (CD71) (40Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1111-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 C). In these assays, dimers with a range of cross-linker lengths were used. For each T-cell activation marker studied, MHC dimers coupled through the α- or β-subunit with direct disulfide bonds (S-S) induced the most potent response. As the dimer cross-linker length was increased, an incremental decrease in the extent of T-cell activation was observed. Dimers coupled through MHC-peptide complexes carrying the additional flexible connecting peptide regions on the β-subunit (LX14X) exhibited the least potent activation. These data indicate a systematic activation dependence on linker length, with only a slight dependence on inter-molecular orientation. To address whether the observed activation responses were due to idiosyncratic aspects of the long-term T-cell clone HA1.7, we repeated the activation experiments using a polyclonal T-cell line raised from the peripheral blood of a DR1+individual (designated 1H). The 1H polyclonal T-cell line exhibited CD3 down-regulation in response to MHC dimers, with dose-response curves for disulfide-linked and X14X-linked MHC dimers (Fig.4A) that were similar to those observed for the HA1.7 T-cell clone. Activation of CD3 down-regulation (Fig. 4 B) and CD69 up-regulation (Fig. 4 C) in the 1H polyclonal line were relatively independent of intermolecular orientation, but were dependent on cross-linker length, with the shortest cross-links (S-S) exhibiting the most potent signal, as observed for the HA1.7 clone. The observed dependence of T-cell triggering on cross-linker length was investigated in more detail. To evaluate the actual intermolecular spacing in the intact oligomers, an apparent hydrodynamic radius was characterized for each of the various dimers by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5A). For the Cysαβ dimer series, a systematic dependence of apparent hydrodynamic radius (R S) on cross-linker length was observed (Table I), with dimers coupled through short disulfide cross-links (S-S) exhibiting the most compact conformation. Similar hydrodynamic behavior was observed for the αβCys dimer series (Table I). Dimers linked through the β-subunit exhibited slightly but systematically larger apparent hydrodynamic radii than the corresponding dimers linked through the α-subunit. Plots of the apparent hydrodynamic radiusversus the T-cell response induced by the MHC dimers exhibited a striking linear dependence. This dependence was observed in the HA1.7 T-cell clone for CD3 down-regulation (Fig. 5 B), CD69 up-regulation (Fig. 5 C), and CD25 up-regulation (Fig.5 D), and was also evident in the 1H polyclonal line (not shown). Thus, T-cell activation is more efficiently triggered by more compact dimers, for each of the responses studied. The observed dependence of T-cell triggering on linker length could possibly be due to decreased binding for the dimers coupled through longer cross-links. To address this possibility the relative binding of the MHC dimers was measured, using a competitive binding assay in which unlabeled dimers compete for the T-cell surface with streptavidin-linked, phycoerythrin-labeled (SA-PE) MHC oligomers (34Cameron T.O. Cochran J.R. Yassine-Diab B. Sekaly R.-P. Stern L.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). MHC dimers linked through the α-subunit with the X3X, X9X, and X14X cross-linkers each exhibited essentially identical competition curves (Fig.6A), with half-maximal inhibitions of ∼0.3 µm. Dimers linked though the α-subunit with a direct disulfide bond (S-S) exhibited slightly weaker binding, with a half-maximal inhibition of ∼0.8 µm (Fig. 6 A, filled circles). MHC dimers linked through the β-subunit with the X3X, X9X, and X14X cross-linkers or direct disulfide bonds (S-S) bound similarly (IC50 ∼0.3 µm) (Fig. 6 B). Overall, the MHC dimers competed for binding more efficiently than monomeric MHC-peptide complexes, which exhibited an IC50 of ∼2.5 µm (Fig. 6 A, ×), as previously observed (15Cochran J.R. Cameron T.O. Stern L.J. Immunity. 2000; 12: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 27Cochran J.R. Stern L.J. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W1975089320,"Covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to Mdm2 requires the activation of a heterodimeric Aos1-Uba2 enzyme (ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)) followed by the conjugation of Sumo-1 to Mdm2 by Ubc9, a protein with a strong sequence similarity to ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s). Upon Sumo-1 conjugation, Mdm2 is protected from self-ubiquitination and elicits greater ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity toward p53, thereby increasing its oncogenic potential. Because of the biological implication of Mdm2 sumoylation, we mapped Ubc9 binding on Mdm2. Here we demonstrate that Ubc9 can associate with Mdm2 only if amino acids 40–59 within the N terminus of Mdm2 are present. Mdm2 from which amino acids 40–59 have been deleted can no longer be sumoylated. Furthermore, addition of a peptide that corresponds to amino acids 40–59 on Mdm2 to a sumoylation reaction efficiently inhibits Mdm2 sumoylation in vitro and in vivo. In UV-treated cells Mdm2 exhibits reduced association with Ubc9, which coincides with decreased Mdm2 sumoylation. Our findings regarding the association of Ubc9 with Mdm2, and the effect of UV-irradiation on Ubc9 binding, point to an additional level in the regulation of Mdm2 sumoylation under normal growth conditions as well as in response to stress conditions. Covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to Mdm2 requires the activation of a heterodimeric Aos1-Uba2 enzyme (ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)) followed by the conjugation of Sumo-1 to Mdm2 by Ubc9, a protein with a strong sequence similarity to ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s). Upon Sumo-1 conjugation, Mdm2 is protected from self-ubiquitination and elicits greater ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) activity toward p53, thereby increasing its oncogenic potential.

Here we demonstrate that Ubc9 can associate with Mdm2 only if amino acids 40–59 within the N terminus of Mdm2 are present. Mdm2 from which amino acids 40–59 have been deleted can no longer be sumoylated. Furthermore, addition of a peptide that corresponds to amino acids 40–59 on Mdm2 to a sumoylation reaction efficiently inhibits Mdm2 sumoylation in vitro and in vivo. In UV-treated cells Mdm2 exhibits reduced association with Ubc9, which coincides with decreased Mdm2 sumoylation. Our findings regarding the association of Ubc9 with Mdm2, and the effect of UV-irradiation on Ubc9 binding, point to an additional level in the regulation of Mdm2 sumoylation under normal growth conditions as well as in response to stress conditions. ubiquitin-activating enzyme ubiquitin carrier protein ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase amino acid(s) wild type hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Regulation of protein stability is important in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and response to stress. A delicate balance between protection of a protein from, or targeting it for, degradation underlies the regulation of proteolysis and determines the duration and magnitude of activities elicited by key regulatory proteins. Conjugation of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins is mediated by multiple enzymatic reactions catalyzed by a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1),1 a few ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2s), and when applicable, by a large variety of ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3s) (reviewed in Refs.1Hershko A.

Human Ubc9, which is composed of 158 amino acids, consists of conserved cysteines within the ubiquitin-accepting domain. Structure analysis of Ubc9 revealed important differences when compared with other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Within the amino-terminal helix both structural and sequence alignments do not match to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes due to one mismatched amino acid, which confers a different recognition surface on Ubc9 (12Liu Q.

As an oncogene, Mdm2's transforming potential is largely attributed to its ability to down-regulate the functions of the p53 tumor suppressor protein.

Mdm2 mediates p53 ubiquitination through the carboxyl-terminal RING finger domain, which serves as a bona fide RING finger E3 (45Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

E3 activity of Mdm2 is directed toward self- and targeted ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor protein p53; thus, it maintains low levels of p53 under normal nonstressed conditions. Central to Mdm2 E3 activities is its Sumo modification, which attenuates self-ubiquitination and increases Mdm2-targeted ubiquitination of p53 (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of Mdm2 takes place on a lysine residue at position 446, which also serves as the primary site for ubiquitin conjugation to Mdm2. Thus, upon its Sumo modification, Mdm2 is no longer subject to ubiquitination, gaining stability and greater ubiquitin-ligase activity toward p53. In response to radiation the degree of Mdm2 sumoylation decreases in a manner that coincides with the increased level of p53 (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Here we identify a 19-aa region on Mdm2 that is required for Ubc9 association and demonstrate the ability to alter the degree of Mdm2 sumoylation with a peptide corresponding to this region. We further illustrate the change in Ubc9 binding to Mdm2 after exposure to UV treatment, which coincides with altered Mdm2 sumoylation. Wild type Mdm2 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (HiFi Taq polymerase, Life Technologies, Inc.) and unidirectionally cloned, with the addition of two NH2-terminal FLAG tags, between theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (19Buschmann T.

The sequence of the Ubc9 binding domain on Mdm2 (aa 40–59, mdm2 Ubc9 binding site; mu9bs) in wt or scrambled orientation (mu9sb) was cloned in frame between EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites into pcDNA3 that carries the penetratin sequence, followed by the sequence encoding the HA tag.

Transfections were performed by lipofection (LipofectAMINE Plus, Life Technologies, Inc.). Medium was changed 5 h after transfection, and cells were harvested 36 h later. To monitor noncovalent protein complexes, cells were lysed as described previously (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were carried out as described previously (44Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), except peptide analysis. To assure proper separation of small peptides Tricine gels were used according to standard protocol. Monoclonal antibodies against HA epitopes (HA11) were purchased from Babco. Antibodies (monoclonal) against SUMO-1 (GMP-1) were purchased (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Polyclonal antibodies against Sumo-1 were produced in rabbits and affinity-purified on His-Sumo columns. 2A10 monoclonal antibodies (Oncogene) were used for Mdm2 analysis. Monoclonal antibodies against ubc9 were purchased (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Glutathione beads (Sigma) were used to purify GST-Mdm2 as described previously (45Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed purified Mdm2 (1–2 µg) proteins were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-SUMO-1 (TNT, Promega), purified Aos1/Uba2 (15 ng), and Ubc9 (0.5 µg) for 30 min at 37 °C in conjugation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 unit of creatine phosphokinase). Bead-bound complexes were washed (3× TBS, 0.5% Triton X-100) before denaturating for 5 min at 95 °C in 3× sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE. Gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). For competition with in vitro sumoylation of Mdm2, a peptide corresponding to the Ubc9 binding region on Mdm2 (aa 40–59) or a nonspecific peptide aa was added as indicated in results. Immunobilization of peptides to the Amino Link column was carried out exactly according to Pierce protocol. In brief, the column was equilibrated with coupeling buffer, and 1 column volume of solution containing 1 mg of peptide was incubated with gel for 6 h. Later the column was drained and washed with coupeling buffer. Coupeling buffer was replaced by quenching buffer containing a reducing solution to block remaining active sites for 30 min. Final washing steps were carried out with washing buffer. The column was stored in storage buffer at 4 °C. Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids to analyze sumoylation or ubiquitination, respectively. Harvested cell pellets were lysed by incubation with 1 volume of 2% SDS in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at 95 °C for 10 min. Nine volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS were added, and lysates were sonicated for 2 min. The solution was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with protein A/G beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and clarified by 30-min centrifugation (14,000 rpm) at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. For immunoprecipitation 500 µg of protein was incubated with the appropriate antibodies at 4 °C overnight before protein A/G beads (25 µl) were added for 2 h. Beads were washed with 0.5 m LiCl in TBS followed by two additional washes with TBS. Proteins were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies and ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UV irradiation was administered as described previously (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were subjected to UV-C irradiation (254 nm) in calibrated areas within the tissue culture hood. The medium that was removed prior to irradiation was returned to minimize serum-induced changes. As noted, binding of Ubc9, which serves as an E2-conjugating enzyme for SUMO-1 (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), is prerequisite to Mdm2 sumoylation. To map the Ubc9 binding site on Mdm2, we incubated a series of 35S-labeled Mdm2 deletion mutants with GST-Ubc9. These GST pull-down assays enabled us to determine which of the Mdm2 forms lost the ability to associate with Ubc-9. As shown in Fig.1A, Mdm2 from which aa 40–59 had been deleted was the only construct that was no longer capable of associating with Ubc9. This finding suggests that Ubc9 binding may require aa 40–59 of the amino-terminal domain of Mdm2. Forced expression of Mdm2 that lacks aa 40–59 confirmed that this protein is no longer associated with Ubc9 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore Mdm2Δ40–59 migrates as a 75-kDa protein, which represents the nonsumoylated from of Mdm2 (Fig. 1B). These data confirm that aa 40–59 of Mdm2 are required for Ubc9 association. To further assess the role of the Ubc9 binding domain in Mdm2 sumoylation, we synthesized a peptide that corresponds to aa 40–59 of Mdm2. We first tested whether the peptide is capable of associating with Ubc9. We coupled either the wt peptide (mu9bs =mdm2 Ubc9bindingsite) or a scrambled peptide (mu9sb) to an Amino Link column. Bead-coupled peptides were incubated with cell lysates, and bound proteins were analyzed in Western blots using antibodies to Ubc9. The wt, but not mutant (scrambled), peptide captured Ubc9 (Fig. 2A). To further confirm the ability of the peptide corresponding to mu9bs to associate with Ubc9, we carried out in vivo reactions. We have cloned the 19-aa peptide into an HA-tagged mammalian expression vector that also carried the penetratin peptide in frame, assuring its localization into the nucleus. This expression vector was found useful for the expression of short peptides in mammalian cells (52Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 44Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the peptide from cells (with antibodies to HA tag) followed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to Ubc9 revealed that the mu9bs peptide, but not its scrambled counterpart, associated with Ubc9 (Fig. 2B). These data establish that the region corresponding to aa 40–59 of Mdm2 serves as a Ubc9 binding site. To test the effect of the mu9bs peptide on Mdm2 sumoylation, we first determined the kinetics of this reaction. Efficient sumoylation was observed as early as 30 min after initiation of the in vitro sumoylation reaction, and it reached maximal levels within 50–60 min (Fig.3A). Addition of the wt mu9bs peptide for different periods of time during the in vitrosumoylation reaction was sufficient to attenuate Mdm2 sumoylation in a manner that coincided with the length of the incubation (Fig.3B, 0′ reflects no addition of peptide and thus maximal degree of sumoylation; 10′ reflects the degree of sumoylation when the peptide was added for 10 min of the reaction; and50′ represents the reaction in which the peptide was added for 50 (out of 60′) of the reaction). Similarly, addition of increasing concentrations of mu9bs to the in vitro sumoylation reaction led to a dose-dependent decrease of Mdm2 sumoylation (Fig.3C). These observations suggest that the presence of the peptide that corresponds to the Ubc9 association site on Mdm2 is sufficient to attenuate Mdm2 sumoylation in vitro. Important confirmation of the effect of the Mdm2-driven peptide on Mdm2 sumoylation comes from in vivo studies. Co-expression of the mu9bs peptide with Mdm2 in p53/Mdm2 double null cells led to a dose-dependent decrease in the degree of Mdm2 sumoylationin vivo, whereas the mu9sb peptide had no effect (Fig.3D). Together, these observations identify a Mdm2 domain that is required for Ubc9 binding and consequent sumoylation of Mdm2. Given the proximity of p53 association on the Mdm2 and Ubc9 binding domains, we tested whether inhibition of Mdm2 sumoylation by overexpression of the mu9bs peptide would also affect degree of Mdm2 association with p53. To do so, we transfected human fibroblasts with mu9bs or mu9sb peptides. Immunoprecipitation of p53 was followed by Western blot analysis to determine the type and level of Mdm2 bound to p53 under each of these conditions. As revealed in Fig. 4, both the 75- and the 90-kDa forms of Mdm2, reflecting the non- and the sumoylated forms, respectively, were found in complex with p53. Whereas expression of the control peptide mu9sb did not affect the association with either form of Mdm2, cells expressing the mu9bs exhibit p53 association only with the nonsumoylated form of Mdm2 (Fig. 4). Forced expression of wt Mdm2 resulted in an association of p90 with p53, whereas expression of the K1 form (a mutant form of Mdm2 on aa 446, which cannot be ubiquitinated or sumoylated; Ref. 19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) revealed an association of the nonsumoylated form with p53 (Fig. 4). Effect of mu9bs expression on the form of Mdm2 associated with p53 is expected to also affect the level of p53 in the cell. Indeed, overall levels of p53 expression coincided with the type of peptide expressed; mu9bs expression led to an increased level of p53, in accord with decreased sumoylation of Mdm2, which is the potent form for mediating p53 degradation. These data suggest that Ubc9 binding does not affect Mdm2 association with p53, but rather, the form of Mdm2 expressed and associated with p53. A specific mutation of conserved cysteine (C93S) was previously shown to abrogate Ubc9 ability to conjugate SUMO-1 to the androgen receptor while increasing the androgen receptor's transcriptional activities (53Poukka H. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ubc9 association with Mdm2 may affect its ability to target p53 ubiquitination, we have tested the effect of this mutant form of Ubc9. Addition of Ubc9C93S to in vitro sumoylation reaction of Mdm2 revealed that it failed to cause Mdm2 sumoylation and was capable of decreasing wt Ubc9-mediated Mdm2 sumoylation (Fig.5A). Corresponding to decreased Mdm2 sumoylation has been the increase in its self-ubiquitination (Fig. 5A). In vivo analysis was carried out via transfection of wt or mutant Ubc9 together with HA-Ub into normal human fibroblasts. Whereas expression of wt Ubc9 increased the level of Mdm2 sumoylation in these cells, the expression of mutant Ubc9C93S resulted in decreased Mdm2 sumoylation (Fig. 5B). Changes in Mdm2 sumoylation will lead to altered p53 ubiquitination. Dose-dependent increase of transfected mutant Ubc9C93S revealed a corresponding decrease in the level of p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 5B). Similarly, co-expression of the K1 mutant (Mdm2 form that is mutated on aa 446, which is the sumoylation and ubiquitination site), which elicits efficient ubiquitination of p53, did not alter its effect on p53 ubiquitination in vivo, suggesting that Ubc9 binding is not required for K1 ability to mediate efficient p53 ubiquitination and degradation (data not shown). It is likely that the conformational change elicited by the Lys446 mutation confers on Mdm2 better E3 activities, in addition to greater stability. These observations suggest Ubc9 binding to Mdm2 without conjugation of Sumo (i.e. Ubc9 binding per se) are not sufficient to increase Mdm2's ability to target p53 ubiquitination, but rather increases Mdm2 self-ubiquitination and decreases p53 ubiquitination. Since UV irradiation has been shown to reduce the degree of Mdm2 sumoylation, we have monitored possible changes in the association of Ubc9 with Mdm2 in UV-treated cells. UV irradiation of NIH3T3 cells that were co-transfected with Mdm2 and Sumo revealed a time-dependent decrease in the binding of Ubc9 to Mdm2, which coincided with decreased Mdm2 sumoylation (Fig. 6). This observation demonstrates that Ubc9 binding to Mdm2 is under a dynamic regulation and affected by changes elicited upon stress and DNA damage, as shown here for UV irradiation. Our finding further establishes the requirement for Ubc9 binding to enable sumoylation of Mdm2. Conjugation of Sumo-1 to Mdm2 is a key event underlying Mdm2's ability to elicit efficient degradation of p53 (19Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Increased Mdm2 E3 activity toward p53 is explained in light of attenuated Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, since sumoylation of Mdm2 displaces its primary ubiquitin conjugation site. The biological importance of Mdm2 sumoylation requires a better understanding of the regulation of Mdm2 sumoylation be better understood. Central to the covalent attachment of Sumo-1 to Mdm2 is the conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Here we identify the Ubc9 binding domain on Mdm2, which is required for Mdm2 sumoylation and concomitant Mdm2 E3 activity toward p53. Mdm2, whose Ubc9 association domain has been deleted, is no longer capable of either association with Ubc9 or of sumoylation. Furthermore, expression of the peptide that corresponds to this region efficiently inhibited Mdm2 sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. This region, which was mapped in the current study, is sufficient for Mdm2 association as revealed by in vitro and in vivo data. The proximity of the Ubc9 binding site on Mdm2 to that required for association with p53 led us to explore possible effects on Mdm2 association with p53; we found that the Ubc9 association does not affect the Mdm2-p53 association, but rather the form (sumoylated or not) of Mdm2 that is bound to p53. Importantly, changes in the form of Mdm2 that bound to p53 was also reflected in the relative levels of p53 expression. Inhibition of Ubc9 binding led to increased levels of p53. Interestingly, a recent study by Matunis and colleagues (55Sampson D.A. Wang M. Matunis M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21664-21669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) identified, based on the analysis of 11 proteins that were reported to undergo sumoylation, that the LLKXE motif serves as the target site for Ubc9 binding. A similar sequence (LLKE) is found on aa 37–40 of Mdm2, proximal to aa 40–59, which was characterized in the present studies. The deletion mutant of Mdm2 that encompass aa 1–49 revealed a noticeable binding to Ubc9, suggesting that the actual domain engaged in binding of Mdm2 is indeed within aa 40–59. Of interest, note that association of Ubc9 may affect protein function even if sumoylation would not take place. The C93S substitution of Ubc9 prevents Sumo-1 conjugation by abrogating the formation of a thiol ester bond between Sumo-1 and Ubc9. Expression of the C93S form was found to elicit stimulation of androgen receptor-dependent transactivation similar to wt Ubc9. This finding implies that Ubc9 association per se may be sufficient for changes in protein conformation and function (53Poukka H. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Along those lines we have tested whether the ability of Mdm2 mutant at aa 446 (K1) to elicit stronger E3 activity toward p53 may be attributed to Ubc9 association, since this mutant can no longer be sumoylated. Our data suggest that K1 elicits its efficient targeting of p53 ubiquitination independent of Ubc9, since the mutant form of Ubc9 did not affect K1 activities. Possible changes in conformation of the Mdm2 RING, which are expected to take place due to the Lys446mutation, may contribute to its elevated E3 activities, in addition to increased stability of this mutant. Support for the dynamic regulation of Ubc9's association with Mdm2 comes from the observation that UV irradiation decreases binding of Ubc9 while increasing the association of p19ARF. It is likely that UV irradiation decreases the association of Ubc9 as a result of phosphorylation of Mdm2 by stress kinases, including ATM (54Maya R. Balass M. Seong-Tae K. Shkedy D. Juan-Fernando M.T. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Gene (Amst.) Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which are expected to elicit conformational changes in Mdm2, resulting in an altered subset of its associated proteins. The distant location of Ubc9 binding (aa 40–59) from that of Mdm2 sumoylation (aa 446) further supports the importance of Mdm2 conformation in relation to its ability to undergo sumoylation. Overall, the present study adds important new information regarding Mdm2's association with Ubc9, which is a prerequisite for Mdm2's sumoylation. Our data provide evidence for the existence of dynamic regulation of Ubc9 association, which is altered upon UV treatment. We further demonstrate for the first time a case where Ubc9 association is distant to the site of SUMO-1 conjugation, suggesting that the regulation of Mdm2 sumoylation is highly dependent on its proper conformation. Experiments performed in our laboratory over the past few weeks revealed that K446 is not the site for Sumo-1 conjugation to Mdm2. K446 is the primary site for Mdm2 self-ubiquitination, explaining why this mutant is more potent than wild-type Mdm2 in its effect on p53, and the nature of its prolonged half-life. Whereas sumoylation of Mdm2 in vitrodecreases its self ubiquitination and increases its ubiquitin ligase activity, this change can no longer be attributed to displacement of ubiquitin with Sumo-1 at the same site, but possibly to conformationally based effects. Accordingly, it is clear that the relationship between Ubc9 association- and Sumo-1 conjugation-sites requires additional studies. These new results do not, however, affect the conclusions of this paper. We thank Dr. R. Hay for SUMO-1 construct, Dr. D. Bohmann for Ub-HA construct, Drs. A. Weissman and J.

The pattern of glycolipid expression varies according to cell type and is developmentally regulated. Functionally, glycolipids have been implicated in various biological processes related to cell activation (1Felding-Habermann B. Igarashi Y. Fenderson B.A. Park L.S. Radin N.S. Inokuchi J.

Glycolipids also play important roles in infectious diseases, because they function as receptors for some viruses (7Bhat S. Spitalnik S.L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Silberberg D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Hakomori S.-I. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. Ostrander G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15649-15658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be of prognostic and diagnostic values. Glycolipids can be classified according to their respective core oligosaccharide structures. In mammals, four major classes can be distinguished (13Fenderson B.A. Eddy E.M. Hakomori S.-I. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Isoglobo-, globo-, lacto- and ganglio-series glycolipids are differentiated by the third saccharide unit added after the common lactosyl core (Fig. 1). This selective step is achieved by specific glycosyltransferase enzymes, which by their presence or absence in cells control the nature of the glycolipid repertoire. The molecular cloning of key glycosyltransferase genes allows a precise analysis of the dynamics of glycolipid expression and the possible correlatation of changes in glycolipids with specific biological processes. The β1,3 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Lc31 synthase is the key enzyme controlling the expression of lacto-series glycolipids. This class comprises both neutral and charged compounds and are characteristic glycolipids of human colonic carcinomas and leukemia cells (12Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. Ostrander G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15649-15658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hu J. Stults C.L. Holmes E.H. Macher B.A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A number of sialosyl-, disialosyl-, fucosyl- and sulfoglucuronosyl-lactoglycolipids have been characterized in the nervous system (15Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C. Quarles R.H.

The pattern of expression of the HNK-1-reactive sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGL) and other neolacto-glycolipids have been shown to be conditioned by the key Lc3 synthase activity (17Chou D.K. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21727-21733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Lc3 synthase enzyme is highly regulated during development, being most active by embryonic day 15 (E15) in the rat cerebral cortex and then decreasing to undetectable levels by postnatal day 10. In the adult cerebellum, the Lc3 synthase activity is restricted to Purkinje cells (18Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Restoration of SGGL synthesis in primary granule neuron culture promotes neurite outgrowth and cell aggregation (19Chou D.K. Tobet S.A. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8508-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) suggesting that the control of SGGL expression by Lc3 synthase may have significance during development of the nervous system. In the present report, we describe the cloning of a Lc3 synthase gene and the characterization of the corresponding recombinant Lc3 synthase enzyme. Also, using in situ hybridization, we provide evidence that the Lc3 synthase gene is broadly expressed in the nervous system and other tissues during mouse embryonic development but is restricted to some cell types in adult. These findings extend our understanding of this important gene in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, for which the human and rat orthologs were recently reported (20Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R.

The mouse cDNA was subcloned as a SalI-XbaI 1.8-kbp fragment into the pFastbac1 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) opened with the same enzymes, whereas the human cDNA was subcloned as a 1.2-kbp DraI-DraI fragment into pFastbac1 vector linearized with StuI. The recombinant enzymes were produced with the baculovirus Sf9 insect cell system as described previously (21Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol.

Donor and acceptor substrates were from Sigma, except for the O(CH2)8CO2Me-derivatized acceptors, which were kindly provided by Dr. Markus Streiff (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). Sf9 cells (5 × 106) infected with wild-type or with recombinant baculoviruses were lysed at 72 h post infection in 1 ml of 2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) on ice for 15 min. After removal of the nuclei by centrifugation, glycosyltransferase activity was assayed using 10 µl of cell lysate in 50 µl of 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, 20 mm MnCl2, 5% Me2SO, 0.75 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UDP-sugar donor substrate including 5 × 104 cpm of the corresponding UDP-[14C]sugar (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and various acceptors. Quantification of the reaction products was performed as described (21Hennet T. Dinter A. Kuhnert P. Mattu T.S. Rudd P.M. Berger E.G. J. Biol.

The full-length coding region of the mouse and human Lc3 synthase gene were excised from pFastbac1 byBamHI and XbaI digestion and subcloned into pcDNA3 for transient transfection of CHOP2/1 cells. This Chinese hamster ovary glycosylation mutant is defective in Golgi sialic acid transport and in the Mgat1 gene required for initiation ofN-linked glycan chain synthesis (24Cummings L. Warren C.E.

As a result of these modifications these cells have greatly reduced glycoconjugate sialylation and N-linked glycosylation. After 70 h, cells were harvested by scraping, hand-homogenized in isopropanol:hexane:H2O (55:25:20), and dried under nitrogen. The residue was partitioned in chloroform:methanol:0.9% saline (20:10:6), and the lower phase was re-extracted with theoretical upper phase-saline (methanol:0.9% saline:chloroform, 48:47:3). The lower phase was extracted twice more with theoretical upper phase saline and dried under nitrogen. To reduce contaminating phospholipids, the residue was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis overnight with 0.2m NaOH, neutralized with HCl, and purified by reverse phase C18-column chromatography. Glycolipid products were separated on aluminum high performance thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using a solvent system of chlorofrom:methanol:0.25% CaCl2 (50:40:10) and immunostained using monoclonal antibodies TE-8 or 1B2 (each at 1:5 dilution), essentially as described (25Zhou D.

The Lc3 synthase mRNA levels were detected using multiple-tissue membranes of mouse adult tissue and embryonic stage RNA from Sigma. A 1.8-kbpSalI-XbaI fragment from the mouse Lc3 synthase cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]CTP (Hartmann Analytics, Braunschweig, Germany) by random priming and hybridized to the poly(A)+ RNA blots. Blots were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS heated up to 55 °C and exposed for 4 days between intensifying screens at −70 °C. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized using a DIG RNA synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from a 0.7-kbpHindIII-BglII fragment of the mouse Lc3 synthase cDNA subcloned into the plasmid pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer. For in situ analysis of spleen Lc3 synthase expression, spleens from C57BL/6 mice aged 8–12 weeks were frozen in Tissue-Tek (Miles, Elkhart, IN). Cryostat sections of 10 µm were cut at −20 °C and thaw-mounted on Superfrost plus microscope slides (Menzel-Gläser, Freiburg, Germany). Sections were dried and fixed for 1 h in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.4, and acetylated for 10 min with 0.25% acetic anhydride in 1% triethanolamine. Forin situ analysis of brain tissues (E14 and older), deeply anesthetized C57BL/6 mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer. Brains were removed and further fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C followed by immersion in 30% sucrose. Dissected samples were frozen on dry ice and sectioned at 25–35-µm thickness with a sliding microtome and then mounted on Superfrost plus microscope slides. Whole E11 embryos were prepared by direct overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by immersion in 30% sucrose. Cryostat-cut sections of 16–20-µm thickness were prepared at −20 °C and thaw-mounted on Superfrost plus slides. After prehybridization and hybridization, the DIG-labeled RNA hybrids were detected with an anti-DIG Fab fragment conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a dilution of 1:2000. The color reaction was performed with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate with levamisole added to block endogenous phosphatase activity. Cryostat sections adjacent to those used for in situ hybridization were air-dried, fixed in acetone for 10 min, and incubated for 5 min in 0.5% H2O2 in methanol to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Slides of spleen sections were first incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (3% goat or rabbit serum in PBS) and then incubated for 30 min with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution, followed by 30 min with biotin-labeled secondary antibodies diluted in PBS. The slides were washed in PBS and stained using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) with diaminobenzidine substrate (Sigma). Rat anti-mouse CD19 monoclonal antibody MB19–1 (Pharmingen) was used as primary antibody. The biotinylated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody was from Vector Laboratories. Comparative analysis of HNK-1 and calbindin localization in cerebellum sections was performed by immunofluorescence analysis. Samples were blocked with 4% normal goat serum for 2 h and then incubated with HNK-1 hybridoma supernatant (1:5) and anti-calbindin antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:50 in 1% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. HNK-1 and calbindin reactivity was localized with goat anti-mouse IgM-Cy3 and goat anti-mouse IgG-Cy2, respectively (Jackson Immunoresearch).

This structural conservation allows the identification of possible additional β1,3 glycosyltransferase genes from genome data bases. Using this approach, we have isolated a candidate gene encoding a protein showing 40 to 50% similarity with the query β1,3 glycosyltransferase proteins. The candidate mouse protein was 376 amino acids long, respectively, with a predicted transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids at the N-terminal region (Fig. 2). The human orthologous gene (GenBankTM accession number AF368169), which we isolated from a brain cDNA library, coded for a protein of 378 amino acids displaying 77% identity with its mouse counterpart (data not shown). This cDNA was identical to the human β3Gn-T5 cDNA recently published by Togayachi et al.(20Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J. Irimura T.

The mouse and human cDNA were expressed as recombinant baculoviruses in insect Sf9 cells and assayed for glycosyltransferase activity. AnN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity was detected toward several Gal-based acceptors, including significant utilization of lactosyl ceramide Gal(β1,4)Glc-Cer (TableI). This strong activity toward lactosyl ceramide (1.23 nmol/min/mg protein) suggested that this protein may represent an Lc3 synthase, the key enzyme in lacto-series glycolipid biosynthesis. By contrast, two previously cloned β1,3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase had no significant activity toward lactosyl ceramide. To confirm that this enzyme could function as an Lc3 synthase in vivo, the novel mouse cDNA, as well as its human ortholog, was overexpressed in CHOP2/1 cells, which are devoid of the Lc3 synthase activity and sialylation (24Cummings L. Warren C.E. Granovsky M. Dennis J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Extracted glycolipids from cells transfected with a mock vector or vectors expressing the mouse and human cDNAs of interest were separated by high performance thin-layer chromatography. The Lc3 product was readily detected in cells transfected with mouse and human cDNAs by immunostaining using the specific antibody TE-8 (Fig.3). As expected, a significant portion of the Lc3 product was further modified by endogenous β1,4 galactosyltransferase activity to form Gal[β1, 4]GlcNAc[β1,3]Gal[β1, 4]Glc-Cer, which was localized by the 1B2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3). In contrast, significant levels of Lc3 and nLc4 were not detected in mock transfected cells. Thus, this experiment clearly shows that the cDNA clones encode Lc3 synthase enzymes.Table IAcceptor substrate specificity of the Lc3 synthase enzyme and other β1,3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferasesSf9 mock1-aLysate of Sf9 cells infected with a wild-type baculovirus.Lc3 synthase1-bLysate of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus.β3GnT-I1-bLysate of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus.β3GnT-III1-bLysate of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus.pmol/min/mg prot addedUDP-GlcNAc1-cCarbohydrate donor.Gal(α1-OpNP)296264Gal(β1-OpNP)3230895GalNAc(α1-OpNP)31842GalNAc(α1-OpNP)31135Gal(β1,4)Glc-Cer11230101Gal(β1,4)Glc(β1-OBn)392412645Gal(β1,3)GlcNAc(octyl)1-d(octyl), O(CH2)8CO2Me.565115Gal(β1,3)GalNAc(octyl)1-d(octyl), O(CH2)8CO2Me.270103Lac-N-tetrarose1-eLac-N-tetraose, Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc; Lac-N-neo-tetraose, Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc.3293463Lac-neo-N-tetrarose1-eLac-N-tetraose, Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc; Lac-N-neo-tetraose, Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc.35006174Gal(β1,4)Glc35124834Gal(β1,4)GlcNAc35055754asialo α1-glycoprotein824334613asialo-fetuin71043677UDP-Gal1-cCarbohydrate donor.Gal(α1-OpNP)6658Gal(β1-OpNP)21152622GalNAc(α1-OpNP)87119GalNAc(β1-OpNP)1243GlcNAc(α1-OpNP)2212GlcNAc(β1-OpNP)3222UDP-GalNAc1-cCarbohydrate donor.Gal(α1-OpNP)6554Gal(β1-OpNP)41053All acceptors were assayed at 5 mm except the (octyl)-derived acceptors, which were assayed at 2 mm, and Gal(β1,4)Glc-Cer assayed at 0.25 mm.1-a Lysate of Sf9 cells infected with a wild-type baculovirus.1-b Lysate of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus.1-c Carbohydrate donor.1-d (octyl), O(CH2)8CO2Me.1-e Lac-N-tetraose, Gal(β1–3)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc; Lac-N-neo-tetraose, Gal(β1–4)GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–4)Glc.

Unexpectedly, the enzyme also strongly utilized several gangliosides with exposed Gal(β1,3)GalNAc-R structures, including GA1, GM1, and GD1b (TableII).

Open table in a new tab To delineate the pattern of Lc3 synthase gene expression in vivo we have analyzed mRNA levels in mouse tissues by Northern blotting. Strong hybridization signals were detected in adult spleen and placenta, whereas faint signals were found in adult brain, lung, thymus, and muscle tissues (Fig. 5). During development, the Lc3 synthase gene was maximally expressed by E11. Then, the mRNA levels progressively decreased but remained elevated up to the day of birth (Fig. 5). The expression pattern of the Lc3 synthase was also localized byin situ hybridization with whole E11 embryonic mice (Fig.6, A and B). Most tissues demonstrated significant expression of Lc3 synthase mRNA, consistent with the intense signal detected at E11 by Northern analysis. Expression was relatively high in several regions of proliferative neuroepithelium in the developing central nervous system, including cerebral ventriclular zones, which give rise to neurons of the adult cortex and the neuroepithelium of the neural tube. Additionally, elevated expression was found in derivatives of the somitic mesoderm, including dorsal root ganglia and the sclerotome compartment, which gives rise to the axial skeleton. The mandibular component of the first brachial arch and the lens of the primordial eye (Fig. 6, C and D) were also well stained at E11. To investigate Lc3 synthase gene expression in the developing central nervous system in more detail, brain sections from later embryonic time points were examined. By E14 widespread expression was detected throughout the rostral caudal extent of the telencephalon (Fig.7, A and B). Intense expression was maintained in the proliferative ventricular and subventricular zone, with the exception of the ventromedial wall of the caudal telencephalon (Fig. 7 A, arrows). This discontinuous ventricular expression pattern is very similar to that reported previously with monoclonal antibodies 7A in the mouse (29Yamamoto M. Boyer A.M. Schwarting G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and FORSE-1 in the rat (30Tole S. Kaprielian Z. Ou S.K. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 957-969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both antibodies recognize fucosylated neolacto-glycolipids bearing Lewis-X structures (3′-fucosyllactosamine), which are the predominant carriers of the Lewis-X determinant in the embryonic rodent cortex. At E17 additional staining in the expanding cortical plate became evident (Fig. 7,C and D). At this time point, neurons migrate from the ventricular zone through the intermediate zone to form the characteristic laminar organization of the cortical plate in the adult forebrain. The accumulation of migrated cells from the strongly labeled ventricular zone may account for this signal. Substantial expression was also found in thalamic nuclei, the precerebellar neuroepithelium, and postmitotic neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (Fig. 7,E and F). Several nuclei of the brainstem, including the inferior olive and pontine nuclei, also labeled strongly (not shown). In the adult cerebellum, strong Lc3 synthase expression was found exclusively in Purkinje cell bodies in the Purkinje cell layer. The cell-specific expression pattern was confirmed by colocalization with the Purkinje cell-specific marker calbindin (31Nordquist D.T. Kozak C.A. Orr H.T. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4780-4789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.8 A). HNK-1 reactivity was confined to Purkinje cell bodies and their dendrites in the molecular layer, which precisely correlated with the Purkinje cell-specific expression of the Lc3 synthase gene (Fig. 8 B). The Northern analysis of adult mouse tissues also suggested the spleen to be a potential site of lacto-series glycolipid synthesis. In situ hybridization analysis of adult spleen revealed that Lc3 synthase-positive cells were localized in the follicle region. The hybridization signal matched with B-lymphocyte populations as shown by CD19 immunostaining (Fig. 9). By contrast, splenic regions enriched in T-lymphocytes did not yield a hybridization signal with the Lc3 synthase antisense probe. We have reported here the molecular cloning of a β1,3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase gene coding for an Lc3 synthase enzyme involved in lacto-series glycolipid biosynthesis. The Lc3 synthase protein included several of the structural motifs previously identified in members of the β1,3 glycosyltransferase superfamily. This conservation suggests a common origin, indicating that a basic glycosyltransferase has likely evolved by gene duplication events, thereby allowing a qualitative expansion of oligosaccharide structures in higher organisms. In fact, structurally related β1,3 glycosyltransferases are involved in nearly all types of glycoconjugate synthesis, including proteoglycan glycosaminoglycans,N-linked and O-linked glycans, and glycolipids. Understanding the roles of specific classes of glycolipids in biological processes requires a clear view of the localization of these molecules in animal tissues. However, the in vivo detection of glycolipids themselves is hampered by the scarcity of reagents available that distinctly recognize specific structures. Furthermore, a selective detection of glycolipids can be difficult when the oligosaccharide moiety resembles those found on other classes of glycoconjugates. This last point is especially true for lacto-series glycolipids, which share several oligosaccharide structures with glycoproteins. Therefore, the availability of specific genetic probes, as represented by core-specific glycosyltransferase genes, constitutes an essential tool in the study of glycolipids in vivo. Along this line, the molecular cloning of the Lc3 synthase gene now enables a detailed investigation of the processes in which lacto-series glycolipids have been implicated. Noteworthy, the monoclonal antibodies recognizing lacto-series glycolipids such as TE-8 and 1B2 cannot be applied to detect the presence of the corresponding glycolipidsin situ as they also recognize carbohydrate epitopes on glycoproteins. Previous studies have documented the expression of Lc3 synthase enzyme activity as a key regulatory step in the synthesis of lacto-series glycolipids in different tissues (12Holmes E.H. Hakomori S.

This is also true for the developing brain where the expression of Lc3 synthase enzyme activity specifically regulates the expression of SGGLs (18Chou D.K.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28868-28874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In situ colocalization of this new gene with HNK-1-reactive Purkinje cells supported its identity as the Lc3 synthase involved in SGGL synthesis. Additionally, the overlapping expression pattern of the Lc3 synthase with neolacto-glycolipids in the embryonic telencephalon (29Yamamoto M. Boyer A.M. Schwarting G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3045-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the lens of the developing rodent eye (35Ogiso M. Saito N. Hoshi M. Komoto M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), indicates that this Lc3 synthase may be regulatory for expression of other brain neolacto-series glycolipids, as suggested previously from enzyme data (16Chou D.K. Suzuki Y. Jungalwala F.B. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The regulation of SGGL synthesis in neural tissue has been related to changes in morphological and adhesion properties of neurons (19Chou D.K. Tobet S.A. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8508-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Experiments where Lc3 synthase gene expression can be controlled in cell culture models will enable the role of SGGL in these biological processes to be assessed. Likewise, the high level expression of Lc3 synthase in zones of the proliferating neuroepithelium in the developing neural tube, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar anlage suggests potential roles for this class of glycolipids in early neuronal development that require further investigation. Earlier reports based on the study of cell lines showed that the Lc3 synthase activity was not expressed in lymphoid cells (34Stults C.L. Macher B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Macher B.A. Lee W.M. Westrick M.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1982; 47: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data clearly indicate that splenic B-lymphocytes express this gene. The discrepancy likely reflects differences in the glycolipid patterns between cells in vivo and transformed cell lines. Similar differences in glycolipid profiles between normal tissues and transformed cell lines have been noted in several other instances (11Singhai A. Hakomori S.-I. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and support the notion that in situ studies are better suited to investigate the physiological status of the glycolipid repertoire. The mouse Lc3 synthase gene described here is the ortholog to the human cDNA published recently by Togayashi et al. (20Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22032-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the latter paper, the authors reported that the human gene is widely expressed based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction data performed on adult tissue RNA and transformed cell lines. By contrast, our results in adult mouse tissues indicate that the Lc3 synthase gene expression is more restricted. This discrepancy likely reflects species differences. In fact, a Northern blot analysis of human adult tissue mRNAs revealed a broader pattern of Lc3 synthase expression (data not shown) than that detected in the mouse survey. However, we also cannot discount disparities accounted for by the different sensitivities of the respective detection systems or the difficult problem of genomic DNA amplification encountered with polymerase chain reaction quantitation of single exon genes from total RNA (20Togayachi A. Akashima T. Ookubo R. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Iwasaki H. Natsume A. Mio H. Inokuchi J. Irimura T. Sasaki K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22032-22040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The expression of Lc3 synthase in splenic B-cells is interesting in light of the high level of activity with gangliosides GA1, GM1, and GD1b. A rare species of hybrid ganglioside structures containing extended lactosamine structures on a GM1 core was identified previously in glycolipid extracts of splenic B-cells but not T-cells (37Nohara K. Nakauchi H. Spiegel S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4661-4666Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These were structurally identified as having the core structure GlcNAc(β1–3)Gal(β1–3)GalNAc-R. It seems likely that the Lc3 synthase is involved in the synthesis of this GlcNAcβ1,3 linkage. Although the structural confirmation and significance of these awaits further analysis, these results may reveal a previously undescribed role for the Lc3 synthase in regulating synthesis of these unique glycolipids. The exact functions of lacto-series glycolipids have remained elusive with the exception of few specific processes. The disruption of the Lc3 synthase gene in mice should provide valuable insight into the functional involvement of this glycolipid class in developmental and physiological pathways. We thank Rosmarie Lang and Dr. Laurent Pays for assistance in the in situhybridization procedure, Dr. Eric Holmes for providing the TE-8 antibody, and Dr. James Dennis for providing the CHOP2/1 cells. We are also grateful to Dr. Denise Chou for advice on glycolipid isolation and immunostaining procedures."

To better understand these and other interactions mediated by endophilin I, we screened a rat brain expression library with the endophilin I SH3 domain. We identified synaptojanin 1 and dynamin 1, and surprisingly, we also identified and cloned a rat homologue of the human germinal center kinase-like kinase (hGLK). hGLK was identified originally based on its homology to members of the germinal center kinase (GCK) family of protein kinases (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is a group I GCK (22Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Group I GCKs are mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) that function upstream of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in a variety of cell types (22Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Group I GCKs are composed of an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain with multiple SH3 domain consensus-binding sites (22Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which events at the cell surface are linked to activation of GLK and other GCKs remain poorly understood. Moreover, the identity of SH3 domain-containing binding partners for GLK and the potential role for such proteins in regulation of GLK function have not been addressed. The identification of rat GLK (rGLK) as an endophilin I-binding partner suggests a role for endophilin in the regulation of GLK function. To explore this role, we first confirmed the rGLK-endophilin I interaction in multiple systems in vitro and by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Overlay assays of rat brain extracts revealed endophilin I as a major SH3 domain-binding partner for rGLK. Moreover, endophilin I was found to regulate GLK-mediated JNK activation. These data implicate endophilin I in the activation of JNK and provide evidence of a link between the endocytic machinery and the JNK signaling pathway. An oligo(dT)-primed λ-ZAP II rat brain cDNA expression library, size-selected for clones greater than 4 kilobase pairs (Ref. 23Snutch T.P. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc.

Positive plaques were purified by two additional rounds of screening, and the cDNAs were isolated and identified by DNA sequence analysis.

Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and anti-phospho-JNK (Thr183-Tyr185) antibodies were purchased from Sigma and New England Biolabs, respectively. GST fusion proteins encoding full-length endophilin I or its isolated SH3 domain were described previously (9Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein constructs of rGLK encoding various regions of the regulatory domain were generated using an rGLK cDNA clone as a template in PCR reactions. The reactions were performed with the forward primer 5′-GCGGGATCCCCTCTGACGAGGTCTTTG (nucleotides 826–843) and the following reverse primers: GST-GLK-(276–541), 5′-GCGCCCGGGTCAGGCACAGTGGATTTTCAAG (nucleotides 1605–1623); GST-GLK-(276–498), 5′-GCGCCCGGGTCAGTTCGTGCCTCTCTGCTC (nucleotides 1477–1494); GST-GLK-(276–445), 5′-GCGCCCGGGTCACCCTGATGAGGGACATC (nucleotides 1319–1335); GST-GLK-(276–406), 5′-GCGCCCGGGTCACAAGGTTGAATGTTTAGAGTC (nucleotides 1198–1218). The resulting PCR products were subcloned into the correspondingBamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the resulting GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified using standard procedures. Mammalian expression constructs for full-length endophilin I and endophilin I lacking the SH3 domain (delta SH3) were generated by digesting the corresponding GST fusion protein constructs (9Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with BamHI and EcoRI with the resulting inserts subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). An N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mammalian expression construct for the SH3 domain of endophilin I was generated by PCR using the full-length cDNA (11Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) as a template, with the forward primer 5′-GCGAGATCTCTCAGCCAAGAAGGGAATATC and the reverse primer 5′-GCGGAATTCTCAATGGGGCAGAGCAACCAG. The resulting PCR product was digested with BglII and EcoRI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). To generate a construct encoding rGLK with an N-terminal FLAG tag, PCR was performed with the forward primer 5′-GCGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAACCGCAGGAGGACTTCG (nucleotides 34–49), which includes an initiation ATG codon within the context of a Kozak consensus sequence (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), and the reverse primer 5′-GCGGGATCCTCACTGTGTGACAAAGGGATG (nucleotides 808–825). The resulting PCR product was digested with HindIII andKpnI and subcloned into the same sites at the 5′-end of the longest rGLK library clone in pBluescript. The resulting FLAG-tagged rGLK construct was then digested with HindIII andBamHI sites, and the insert was subcloned into the same sites in pcDNA3. FLAG-tagged GCK (27Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and JNK constructs were generous gifts from Dr. John Kyriakis (Massachusetts General Hospital) and Dr. Nathalie Lamarche-Vane (McGill University), respectively. For cultured cells, 10-cm2dishes of transfected HEK-293T cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and scraped into buffer A (20 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin). The cells were sonicated and passed through a 25- 58-gauge needle, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and following incubation for 20 min at 4 °C the samples were centrifuged at 75,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA 100.1 rotor. Aliquots of the soluble supernatant were diluted to 2 mg of protein/ml in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100, and 1-ml samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ∼25 µg of GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose. The bead samples were subsequently washed in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and prepared for Western blot analysis. For brain extracts, adult rat brains were homogenized in buffer B (20 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 µg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 µg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged at 750 ×g max for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Sorval T-865 rotor for 1 h, and the soluble supernatant was diluted to 2 mg/ml in buffer B. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and 1-ml aliquots were incubated o/n at 4 °C with ∼25 µg of GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were subsequently washed three times in 1 ml of buffer B with 1% Triton X-100, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and prepared for Western blot analysis. Overlay assays were performed as described (24McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Extracts from HEK-293T cells transfected with various cDNA constructs were prepared as described above and were precleared with either protein A-Sepharose or protein G-agarose beads. The precleared supernatants were then incubated with pre-immune serum or anti-endophilin I antibody (1903) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads or with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to protein G-agarose beads. After 5 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed extensively in buffer A with 1% Triton X-100 and prepared for Western blotting analysis. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged JNK and a variety of constructs as indicated in the figure legends. 48 h post-transfection, the medium was removed and the cells were scraped and boiled in sample buffer. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and used for Western blot analysis. To better understand the complete range of endophilin I functions, we sought to identify its full complement of SH3 domain-binding partners. We thus screened a rat brain expression library with a GST fusion protein encoding the SH3 domain of endophilin I. From a total of approximately 600,000 clones screened, 18 encoded potential endophilin I-binding proteins (data not shown). As expected, the majority of the clones (eight) encoded for synaptojanin 1. Only one clone was found to correspond to dynamin 1. Interestingly, three independent, non-amplified isolates were found to encode for a rat homologue of the human serine/threonine protein kinase, hGLK (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is particularly striking that more independent clones of rGLK were isolated than for dynamin I, which is an abundant brain protein and is a well established endophilin I-binding partner (9Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with a high affinity interaction between endophilin I and rGLK. The longest rGLK clone isolated was sequenced on both strands to generate a coding sequence that aligned to hGLK, starting at amino acid 3 of its published sequence (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and appeared to be complete at the C-terminal end. To obtain the extreme 5′-end, we searched the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) with a sequence from near the 5′-end of our isolated clones. Four overlapping rat ESTs were identified leading to a complete rGLK coding sequence containing 11 additional amino acids (Fig.1 A). These amino acids, which extend the rGLK sequence 8 amino acids beyond the predicted start of hGLK, were homologous to other members of the GCK family (data not shown). The differences in the extreme N-terminal end of hGLK and rGLK may represent a species difference. However, multiple human EST clones were identified, which when aligned with the 5′-end of hGLK could define an N-terminal sequence identical to that for rGLK (data not shown). Protein alignments revealed that the N-terminal kinase domain of rGLK is 99 and 72% identical to hGLK and hGCK, respectively (Fig.1 B). The C-terminal regulatory domain of rGLK, which includes a proline-rich region, is 95% identical with hGLK and 44% identical with hGCK (Fig. 1 B). To confirm the endophilin I-rGLK interaction, we transfected HEK-293T cells with a construct encoding rGLK containing an N-terminal FLAG tag (FLAG-rGLK). The expressed protein bound strongly to a GST-endophilin I SH3 domain fusion protein (GST-SH3) but not to GST alone (Fig.2 A, upper panels). To further demonstrate the interaction specificity, we assessed the binding of FLAG-tagged GCK (27Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. John Kyriakis). No binding of FLAG-GCK to the SH3 domain of endophilin I was detected (Fig. 2 A, upper panels). We next performed the converse pull-down experiments. Full-length endophilin I expressed in HEK-293T cells bound specifically to a GST fusion protein encoding the proline-rich core of rGLK (GST-GLK-(276–541)) (Fig. 2 A, lower panels). In contrast, an endophilin I construct lacking the SH3 domain (endophilin I delta SH3) did not bind to the same rGLK fusion protein (Fig. 2 A, lower panels). The endophilin I-rGLK interaction was also demonstrated from brain tissue. GST-GLK-(276–541) strongly affinity-selected endophilin I from brain extracts, whereas amphiphysin I and II, two major SH3 domain-containing proteins in brain (25Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I.B. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), bound only weakly to the fusion protein (Fig. 2 B). The binding of amphiphysin I and II, although weak, is specific as neither protein nor endophilin I bound to GST alone (Fig.2 B). The proline-rich core of rGLK contains multiple consensus SH3 domain-binding sites. To begin to identify the proline-rich motif(s) responsible for endophilin I binding, we generated GST fusion protein constructs deleting increasing amounts of the C terminus of the rGLK regulatory domain (Fig. 3 A). Whereas constructs consisting of amino acids 276–541 (GST-GLK-(276–541)) and 276–498 of rGLK (GST-GLK-(276–498)) bound strongly to endophilin I from brain extracts, a construct encoding amino acids 276–445 (GST-GLK-(276–445)) showed weak binding, and a construct encoding amino acids 276–406 (GST-GLK-(276–406)) failed to bind (Fig. 3 B). The major endophilin I-binding site is thus located between amino acids 445 and 498 of rGLK with a second, weaker site between amino acids 405 and 446. Within the region of rGLK from amino acids 445–498 is the sequence PPRPPPPR (Fig. 3 C), which closely conforms to the previously described SH3 domain consenus-binding sequence for the endophilins (28Cestra G. Castagnoli L. Dente L. Minenkova O. Petrelli A. Migone N. Hoffmuller U. Schneider-Mergener J. Cesareni G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32001-32007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This sequence is thus the likely endophilin I-binding site in rGLK. Members of the GCK family have been reported to interact with a number of different SH3 domain-containing proteins (22Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether rGLK has multiple SH3 domain-binding partners, we performed overlay assays of brain extracts with the GST-rGLK fusion protein constructs described above. Remarkably, GST-GLK-(276–541) reacted with a single 40-kDa band that perfectly co-migrated with endophilin I as determined by Western blot with an endophilin I antibody (Fig.4 A). GST-GLK-(276–498), which like GST-GLK-(276–541) interacts with endophilin I in pull-down assays, also bound to the 40-kDa band. In contrast, GST-GLK-(276–445) and GST-GLK-(276–406), which bind to endophilin I in pull-down assays, either very weakly or not at all, do not recognize the 40-kDa band (Fig. 4 A). A similar specificity was seen with overlay assays of recombinant endophilin I (data not shown). These data thus suggest that endophilin I is the major rGLK-binding protein in the brain. Previously, we performed overlays with the SH3 domain of endophilin I that revealed dynamin I and synaptojanin 1 as the major endophilin I-binding partners in the brain (9Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, dynamin I and rGLK both migrate on SDS-PAGE at ∼100 kDa, so it is possible that the 100-kDa band detected in these experiments represented a mixture of dynamin I and rGLK. To further explore this issue, we performed overlays with GST or GST-endophilin I on brain extracts run on gels side-by-side with immunoprecipitated FLAG-rGLK and FLAG-GCK. Endophilin I reacted strongly with bands in the brain extract at 100 and 145 kDa, identified previously as dynamin and synaptojanin, respectively (9Micheva K.D. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Endophilin I also reacted with FLAG-rGLK, which migrated almost perfectly with dynamin, whereas no reactivity was seen with FLAG-GCK (Fig. 4 B). A Western blot with an anti-FLAG antibody confirmed the presence of FLAG-rGLK and FLAG-GCK in the immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 4 B). Together, these results suggest a strong and highly specific interaction of endophilin I with rGLK. To demonstrate the interaction in cells, lysates from HEK-293T cells co-transfected with FLAG-rGLK and full-length endophilin I were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with an anti-endophilin I antibody (1903) and an anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitation of either endophilin I or FLAG-rGLK led to the co-immunoprecipitation of the respective binding partner (Fig.5 A). In control experiments, no co-immunoprecipitation was seen when cells were co-transfected with FLAG-rGLK and an endophilin I construct lacking the SH3 domain (endophilin I delta SH3) (Fig. 5 A). It was previously reported that overexpression of hGLK leads to JNK activation in transfected HEK-293 cells (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We thus used this system to determine whether endophilin I functions in GLK-mediated JNK activation. Specifically, we monitored JNK activation using an anti-phospho-JNK antibody following transfection of GLK and different endophilin I constructs. Consistent with Diener et al. (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of rGLK is sufficient to activate JNK (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, overexpression of full-length, untagged endophilin I along with rGLK causes an increase in JNK activation versus expression of GLK alone (Fig.5 B). Quantitative analysis of eight independent experiments revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.05; two-tailed t test) 2.01-fold stimulation. Further, overexpression of a GFP-tagged form of the SH3 domain of endophilin I or of the untagged N terminus of endophilin I lacking the SH3 domain (delta SH3) completely blocked GLK-mediated JNK activation (Fig.5 B). Given that the SH3 domain of endophilin I was expressed with a GFP tag, we sought to further demonstrate the specificity of this construct to block rGLK-mediated JNK activation. Thus, JNK activation was measured following overexpression of rGLK with the GFP-SH3 domain construct or with GFP alone. Whereas the GFP-endophilin I SH3 domain blocked rGLK-mediated JNK activation, GFP alone had no effect (Fig. 5 C). Together, these data demonstrate that endophilin I can function to regulate GLK-mediated JNK activation. Previous studies have established a role for endophilin I in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (14Simpson F. Hussain N.K. Qualmann B. Kelly R.B. Kay B.K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Ringstad N. Gad H. Low P. Di Paolo G. Brodin L. Shupliakov O. De Camilli P.

Our data, demonstrating a functional role for endophilin I in rGLK-mediated JNK activation, suggest an additional and perhaps complementary role for endophilin I in signaling via the JNK pathway. Several recent studies have demonstrated that proteins that function in endocytosis can also function in the regulation of cell signaling. For example, both amphiphysin II and intersectin demonstrate SH3 domain-dependent interactions with the Ras-activating enzyme mSos (4Leprince C. Romero F. Cussac D. Vayssiere B. Berger R. Tavitian A.

Moreover, β-arrestin 1, a clathrin-binding protein that functions to target activated G protein-coupled receptors to clathrin-coated pits, also functions as a scaffolding protein for Erk1/2 and its upstream activating kinase, Raf-1 (29DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In fact, agonists of the Gαq-coupled proteinase-activated receptor 2 stimulate the formation of a complex containing receptor, β-arrestin 1, Raf-1, and activated Erk1/2 on endocytic vesicles (29DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins that function in endocytosis can also regulate the Erk MAP kinases. Recent studies have also suggested a function for endocytic proteins in regulation of the JNK MAP kinases. For example, following stimulation with ligand, the angiotensin II type 1A receptor is targeted to the endocytic pathway through interactions with β-arrestin 2 (30McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, β-arrestin 2 also binds to JNK3, and activation of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor leads to the formation of a receptor-β-arrestin 2-JNK3 complex on endocytic vesicles (30McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of this complex is necessary for ligand-induced JNK3 activation (30McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Fish et al. (31Fish K.N. Schmid S.L. Damke H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) determined that overexpression of wild-type dynamin II, but not a GTPase defective mutant of the protein, activates the transcription factor p53 and induces apoptosis. These data suggest a possible role for dynamin in JNK activation as JNKs are potent effectors of apoptosis (32Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Moreover, dynamin 1 binds directly to mixed lineage kinase 2, an upstream activator of JNK (33Rasmussen R.K. Rusak J. Price G. Robinson P.J. Simpson R.J. Dorrow D.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct protein components of the endocytic regulatory machinery appear to function in the activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways including those involving JNKs. The data presented here, demonstrating a functional interaction between endophilin I and rGLK, further support the importance of such a link. A clue to the mechanism by which endophilin I may regulate hGLK-mediated JNK activation has come from the study of Diener et al. (21Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) who determined that deletion of the regulatory domain of hGLK, including the SH3 domain-binding sites, resulted in a kinase that had full catalytic activity but that was significantly impaired in its ability to activate JNK. These data are consistent with a model in which the regulatory domain targets rGLK for the interactions necessary for JNK activation. Thus, endophilin I may function as an adaptor protein to target rGLK to an upstream activator or to a downstream effector functioning in JNK activation. In fact, other GCKs appear to undergo specific targeting events. For example, the group 1 GCK family member HPK1 is activated following its recruitment to the epidermal growth factor receptor via interactions with the SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb2 (34Anafi M. Kiefer F. Gish G.D. Mbamalu G. Iscove N.N. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). GCK itself is targeted to the Golgi complex via its interactions with the membrane-trafficking protein Rab8 (35Ren M. Zeng J. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Rosenfeld M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5151-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Regardless of its precise functional role, the data presented here unveil a novel interaction between endophilin and rGLK and strongly suggest a role for endophilin I in regulation of JNK activity.

At present, the structural and immunological aspects of antigenic mimicry, which translate into immunologic mimicry, as well as the functional correlates of each, are unknown. In contrast to screening peptide display libraries, we demonstrate the feasibility of a structure-assisted vaccine design approach to identify functional mimeotopes. By using concanavalin A (ConA), as a recognition template, peptide mimetics reactive with ConA were identified. Designed peptides were observed to compete with synthetic carbohydrate probes for ConA binding, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis. ITC measurements indicate that a multivalent form of one particular mimetic binds to ConA with similar affinity as does trimannoside. Splenocytes from mimeotope-immunized mice display a peptide-specific cellular response, confirming a T-cell-dependent nature for the mimetic. As ConA binds to the Envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), we observed that mimeotope-induced serum also binds to HIV-1-infected cells, as assessed by flow cytometry, and could neutralize T-cell line adapted HIV-1 isolates in vitro, albeit at low titers. These studies emphasize that mimicry is based more upon functional rather than structural determinants that regulate mimeotope-induced T-dependent antibody responses to polysaccharide and emphasize that rational approaches can be employed to develop further vaccine candidates.

Conversion of a polysaccharide (PS)1 antigen to a thymus-dependent antigen, by covalent coupling to an immunogenic protein carrier, alters the response to PS in several important ways (4Robbins J.B.

However, conjugation strategies that elicit carrier-specific T- and B-cell responses do not necessarily enhance PS immunogenicity (7McCool T.L. Harding C.V. Greenspan N.S. Schreiber J.R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4862-4869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) nor do PS conjugates elicit responses in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, in cases where a large number of carbohydrate antigens are required to afford protection, much like that representative of the large number of pneumococcal carbohydrate serotypes, PS conjugates will be far more complicated to produce (6Goldblatt D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).

In contrast to carbohydrate conjugates, peptide mimetic conjugates can facilitate cognate interactions between B and T cells after immunization of immunodeficient mice that lack Bruton's tyrosine kinase (10Cunto-Amesty G.

Peptide mimetics therefore afford a vaccine approach to break tolerance to carbohydrate self-antigens (13Kieber-Emmons T. Luo P. Qiu J. Chang T.Y., O, I. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Steplewski Z. Nat.

To further facilitate concepts for a structure-assisted vaccine design, we considered, as a model system, small molecule interactions with concanavalin A (ConA). The mannose/glucose-specific lectin ConA is the most extensively studied plant lectin, known for its application as a biochemical tool and as a model protein to gain further knowledge about lectin-ligand interactions (18Gupta D.

Consequently, defining peptide mimetics reactive with ConA may facilitate the development of immunogens to augment carbohydrate responses to HIV in future vaccine applications. Structural studies of peptidyl-ConA complexes suggest that the carbohydrate-binding site on ConA can accommodate an extended array of carbohydrate antigens that might lend to its biological properties (30Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5539-5543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,31Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We have further defined a peptide that binds at or near the carbohydrate-binding site of ConA that displays a free energy of association comparable to those reported for core trimannoside-ConA and pentasaccharide-ConA interactions. The designed peptide elicits a robust thymus-dependent response, stimulating splenocytes from peptide-immunized mice. We observe that the peptide, rendered as a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP), used to emulate the clustered array of Envelope protein of HIV (Env)-associated carbohydrates (32Zhu X. Borchers C. Bienstock R.J. Tomer K.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11194-11204Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) induced an antibody response reactive with cell-bound Env protein. We observe that serum induced to the peptide mimetic paralleled neutralization results obtained by using a mannan preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from Candida albicans (33Muller W.E.

By using the crystallographically positioned pentasaccharide structure within the ConA-combining site, we implemented the program Ligand-Design (LUDI (35Bohm H.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol.

This program identifies small molecular fragments in a data base and then docks them into the protein-binding site in such a way that hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions can be formed between the protein and the molecular fragments. The positioning of the small fragments is based upon rules about energetically favorable non-bonded contacts and on geometry between functional groups of the protein and the ligand. The center of search was defined using the crystallographic position of the central mannose residue and searching 15 Å surrounding the centroid of the sugar for potential contact sites on ConA. The search was performed using standard default values and a fragment library supplied with the program. Peptides were built using INSIGHTII (Micron Separations/Biosym Technologies) and accommodated in relation to the docked LUDI fragments. The peptide backbone and side chain torsion angles were rotated using a fixed docking algorithm (affinity program) within INSIGHTII, until the side chains of the peptide were approximated to the corresponding LUDI fragments. The peptide-ConA complex was subjected to energy optimization and molecular dynamic simulations, as described previously(36–39). Multivalent carbohydrates Lewis Y (LeY), α-d-mannose (Man-9), disialyl-biantennary (A2), asialo-biantennary (NA-2), and oligomannose 9 (Man-9), each attached to a polyacrylamide polymer of ∼30 kDa, were purchased from GlycoTech Corp., Rockville, MD. Methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside (MeαMan) was purchased from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized as MAP (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) synthesis on polylysine groups, resulting in the presentation of eight peptide clusters. Linear peptides were synthesized by standard solid phase (Research Genetic, Huntsville, AL) and were high pressure liquid chromatography-purified. The structures were confirmed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. ConA was either prepared from jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) seeds (Sigma), as described previously (20Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Sacchettini J.C. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32826-32832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or obtained from Sigma. The concentration of ConA was determined spectrophotometrically, at 280 nm, usingA 1%,1 cm = 13.7 (pH 7.2) and 12.4 (pH 5.2) and expressed in terms of monomer (M r = 25,600). BALB/c mice (n = 4 per group), 4–6 weeks of age, were immunized intraperitoneally three times, at intervals of 2 weeks, with 100 µg of a respective peptide or 50 µg of LeY, each combined with 20 µg of the adjuvant QS21 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Framingham, MA). A control group was immunized with QS21 alone. The LeY-expressing cell line MCF7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (40Soule H.D. Vazguez J. Long A. Albert S. Brennan M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar), without adjuvant, was also used to immunize groups of mice four times. Serum was collected at days 7 and 14 after the last immunization and stored at −80 °C until use. ELISAs were performed as described (41Luo P. Agadjanyan M. Qiu J. Westerink M.A. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 865-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Immulon-2 plates were coated overnight, at 4 °C, with 100 mm of a selected peptide or carbohydrate probe to assess the binding of sera to these antigens. After blocking the plates (PBS, 0.5% FCS, and 0.2% Tween 20), serial dilutions of sera were added and resolved with anti-mouse isotype-matched HRP (Sigma). To assess the binding of ConA to carbohydrates and peptides, serial concentrations (10 to 0.6 ng/ml) of ConA biotin-labeled (Sigma) were added to pre-coated plates and reacted with streptavidin-HRP (Sigma). All results were calculated from triplicate measurements. Immulon-2 plates pre-coated with 20 µg/ml peptide were blocked. The binding of ConA (0.4 µg/ml) biotin-labeled (Sigma) to peptides was assessed in the presence of serial concentrations of MeαMan (0.8–50 mm). Control wells with ConA, but not MeαMan, were also run. Plates were reacted with streptavidin-HRP (Sigma) and results calculated from triplicate measurements. Percentage of inhibition of ConA binding to peptides was calculates as 1 − (mean of test well/mean of control wells) × 100. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed using an MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 5 µl of peptides (0.4–5.2 mm) and concentration of ConA ranging from 0.025 to 0.2 mm were added from the computer-controlled microsyringe, at an interval of 4 min, into the lectin solution (cell volume = 1.3582 ml), while stirring at 350 rpm, at 27 °C. Both lectin and peptide were dissolved in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) or 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2), containing 5 mm CaCl2 and MnCl2. Control experiments were performed by making identical injections of peptide into a cell-containing buffer, where protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal Software. The quantity c = K a M t(0), where M t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration calorimetry. All experiments were performed with c values 1 <c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing RNase A and 2′-CMP, supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation, ΔG = −RT lnK a, where K a and ΔGare the association constant and changes in free energy, respectively;T is the absolute temperature, and R = 1.98 cal mol−1 K−1 . Measured volumes of known concentrations of lectin and peptide solutions (in 100 mmHEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and MnCl2) were mixed in a quartz cuvette, at room temperature, and the time-dependent development of turbidity was measured at 420 nm (42Bhattacharyya L. Fant J. Lonn H. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7523-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Absorbances were monitored continuously, until they remained constant. A portion of the precipitate was treated with 400 mm MeαMan, to check whether or not the precipitation was due to the binding of the peptide at the carbohydrate-binding sites of the lectin. Absorbancy of the solution was recorded at 420 nm, before and after the addition of MeαMan. Spleens were aseptically removed and splenocytes, as the responder cells, isolated by lysis of erythrocytes. Responder cells were used for detection of cell proliferation using CellTiter 96R Aqueous One Solution (Promega, Madison, WI), based on the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (2.5 × 105/well) were cultured in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate with 106-MAP, 911-MAP, or only medium RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. At the 3rd day of incubation, the provided solution was added to each well, and plates were incubated for an additional 1–2 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. As an indicator of cell proliferation, absorbancy was measured at 490 nm, using a 96-well plate reader (Spectra Fluor, Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC), Sup-T1, a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma cell line (43Smith S.D. Shatsky M. Cohen P.S. Warnke R. Link M.P. Glader B.E. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 5657-5660PubMed Google Scholar), and the same cells stably infected with HIV type 1, III-B (A1953), were kindly provided by Dr. J. Hoxie. The mouse monoclonal antibody 902, specific for gp120 of HIV-1 III-B (44Chesebro B. Wehrly K. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 3779-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pincus S.H. Wehrly K. Chesebro B. J.

The secondary antibody used was anti-mouse IgG (γ-specific), fluorescein-conjugated isothiocyanate (Sigma). Cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS. Acquisition of data was performed by using the FACSCAN flow cytometer and histogram analysis by using the CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mansfield, MA). CEM × 174 cells (1 × 105/ml), in RPMI 1640 media with 20% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1% l-glutamine, and 1% HEPES (R-20), were used to propagate the HIV-1 strains III-B (46Ratner L.

When most cells evidenced a virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), virus-containing supernatants were collected after centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min) and filtration (0.45 nm filters), to be stored at −80 °C, until use. The procedure was performed as reported (52Johnson V.A. Byington R.E. Aldovini A. Walker B. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 71-76Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 µl/well of a viral isolate, diluted 1:3 in R-20, were added in sextuplicates in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. 50 µl from these wells were admixed with 150 µl of R-20 in wells of the next row, and so, in successive rows (total of 20 serial dilutions). 2 × 104 MT2 cells (53Haertle T.

Cells were fed as necessary, all wells at the same time, and observed daily for presence of CPE. When no further migration of CPE was evident, wells were scored either positive (presence of CPE) or negative (absence of CPE), and TCID50 values were calculated by using the method of Reed and Muench (52Johnson V.A. Byington R.E. Aldovini A. Walker B. Techniques in HIV Research. Stockton Press, New York1990: 71-76Crossref Google Scholar). Test sera were obtained from immunized mice and control sera from pre-immune mice (normal mouse serum) and from normal and HIV-infected human individuals (IHS, respectively). Sera were inactivated at 56 °C for 1 h and sterilized by exposure to UV light. Determined dilutions of sera and viral outputs were admixed and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then added (25 µl) in triplicated or sextuplicated wells (round-bottomed 96-well plates) containing 104 CEMx174 cells resuspended in 175 µl of R-20. Plates were incubated for 24–40 h. Control wells without virus or serum (uninfected wells) or without serum but with a selected viral isolate (infected wells) were assayed. After incubation, cells were washed, resuspended in 200 µl of R-20, and transferred to homologous flat-bottomed 96-well plates. Media were replaced at the same time in all plates, as necessary. Cultures were maintained until no further progression of CPE was observed in infected control wells, and at this time 25 µl of supernatant per well were admixed with 225 µl of 0.5% Triton X-100 (lysing solution) for p24 antigen detection by ELISA. Samples were stored at −80 °C, until use. Percentage of neutralization was calculated as 1 − (mean absorbancy of test wells/mean absorbancy of infected control well) × 100. The assay was performed by using the HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Assay Kit from the AIDS Vaccine Program of the NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center (Frederick, MD). Briefly, plates pre-coated with a monoclonal anti-HIV-1 p24 antigen were washed and blocked with PBS, 0.5% FCS and 0.2% Tween 20. Supernatant lysates were added in duplicates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. A rabbit anti-HIV-1 p24 serum and a goat anti-rabbit IgG (H & L)-HRP-labeled antibody were used in successive steps. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine-peroxidase substrate (0.1 mg/ml) (Sigma), in 0.05 m phosphate-citrate buffer and 0.03% sodium perborate buffer (Sigma), was allowed to react for 20 min. Reaction was stopped with 4 nH2SO4, and plates were read as described (41Luo P. Agadjanyan M. Qiu J. Westerink M.A. Steplewski Z. Kieber-Emmons T. Mol.

Prototypic peptides that have been defined to bind ConA include 908 and 712 (Table I) (30Kaur K.J. Khurana S. Salunke D.M. J. Biol.

Secondary structure comparison of these two peptide sequences indicates similarities in tertiary class type, except in the all-β prediction, in which an extended structure spans the WYPY sequence tract of MYWYPYASGS (Table I) (57Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Although the YPY motif can be viewed as adopting a β-turn conformation that might emulate the spatial position of the trimannoside configuration (31Jain D. Kaur K.J. Goel M. Salunke D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), an extended conformation might also be plausible for mimetics to interact with ConA.

In this strain, the rnpBgene, coding for the RNA subunit of RNase P, has been placed under the control of the petJ gene promoter (PpetJ), which is repressed by copper, cell growth, and accumulation of RNase P RNA is inhibited in CT1 after the addition of copper, indicating that the regulation by copper is maintained in the chimerical PpetJ -rnpB gene and that RNase P is essential for growth in Synechocystis. We have analyzed several RNAs by Northern blot and primer extension in CT1. Upon addition of copper to the culture medium, precursors of the mature tRNAs are detected. Furthermore, our results indicate that there is a preferred order in the action of RNase P when it processes a dimeric tRNA precursor. The precursors detected are 3′-processed, indicating that 3′ processing can occur before 5′ processing by RNase P. The size of the precursors suggests that the terminal CCA sequence is already present before RNase P processing. We have also analyzed other potential RNase P substrates, such as the precursors of tmRNA and 4.5 S RNA.

In both cases, accumulation of larger than mature size RNAs is observed after transferring the cells to a copper-containing medium. ribonuclease P precursors of tRNA transfer messenger polymerase chain reaction Ribonuclease P (RNase P)1 is an ubiquitous enzyme responsible for generating the 5′ end of precursors of tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) by a single endonucleolytic cleavage (1Altman S. Kirsebom L.A. Gesteland R. Cech T. Atkins J. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 351-380Google Scholar, 2Frank D.N. Pace N.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the enzyme is composed of an RNA subunit and a protein subunit. Both subunits are essential in vivo. The RNA subunit is the catalytic component, and, under appropriate conditions in vitro, it can cleave substrates in the absence of the protein (3Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). In addition to processing by RNase P at the 5′ end, pre-tRNAs are also processed at the 3′ end, where several nucleases are involved (4Deutscher M.P. Söll D. RajBhandary U. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 51-65Google Scholar, 5Deutscher M.P. Li Z. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 67-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The precise order of events in the processing of pre-tRNAs in bacteria is not well known. It seems that 3′ processing precedes 5′ processing, but the maturation process, at least at the 3′ end, behaves as a random process with the participation of multiple redundant enzymatic activities (6Li Z. Deutscher M.P. Cell. 1996; 86: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, the 3′-CCA end of tRNAs is not encoded in the genome and must be added post-transcriptionally.In vitro, cyanobacterial RNase P prefers substrates lacking the 3′-CCA (7Pascual A. Vioque A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6672-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that RNase P cleavage might precede addition of CCA by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, but at present there is no knowledge on the in vivo pathway. Pre-tRNAs are not the only substrates of RNase P. Several other natural and artificial substrates have been identified. In Escherichia coli, RNase P processes RNAs such as the precursors to 4.5 S RNA (8Bothwell A.L. Garber R.L. Altman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7709-7716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tmRNA (9Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and a small phage RNA (10Hartmann R.K. Heinrich J. Schlegl J. Schuster H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5822-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We describe in this paper the construction of a strain fromSynechocystis that expresses conditionally the RNA component of RNase P. The analysis of this strain has shown that RNase P is essential in this cyanobacterium. In addition, we have determined thein vivo processing pathway of pre-tRNAs and established that other RNAs, such as 4.5 S RNA and tmRNA, are also dependent on RNase P for their processing. Synechocystis cells were grown photoautotrophically at 30 °C in BG11c medium (11Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) under continuous illumination conditions (50 microeinsteins of white light m−2s−1). For RNase P RNA depletion, cells were grown in BG11c medium with no CuSO4 added. When the culture was at a density of 2–3 µg of chlorophyll/ml, 5 µmCuSO4 was added to the medium and incubation continued for 48 h before RNA extraction. Chlorophyll concentration was determined as described previously (12MacKinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). All manipulations were performed by standard methods (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the manufacturers of the enzymes used. DNA was extracted from Synechocystis cells as described previously (14Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSCT1 was used to introduce a copy of the rnpB gene under the control of the petJpromoter (PpetJ) in the glnN locus ofSynechocystis. To construct pSCT1, a kanamycin resistance cassette (15Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), followed by PpetJ and by thernpB gene lacking its promoter (PpetJ-rnpB) was placed inside theglnN gene, which, in turn, was inserted within pBluescript. The PpetJ and rnpB DNA fragments were synthesized by PCR using oligonucleotides that contained convenient restriction sites for cloning. The sequences of both fragments were checked by sequencing. The PpetJ fragment extends from positions −472 to +3 of the petJ gene, relative to the start of translation. Therefore, it contains the transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences ofpetJ. The rnpB fragment extends from position 1 to 437, relative to the transcription start site of the gene. Since pSCT1 does not replicate in Synechocystis, after transformation and selection of kanamycin resistant cells, we expected to obtain transformants bearing the genomic structure indicated at the bottom of Fig. 1 A in the glnN locus. Detailed information on the construction of the pSCT1 plasmid is available from the authors. This plasmid can be used to insert different protein coding genes in the glnN locus and to express them under the control of the petJ promoter. For that purpose, the desired gene should be flanked by a SphI site containing the ATG start codon (in the case of a protein coding gene) and by aBstEII site located after the stop codon. Both restriction sites are unique in pSCT1, where they flank thernpB gene. Thus, a unique cloning step will be enough to replace the rnpB gene of pSCT1 by the desired gene. Since the SphI site of pSCT1 contains the ATG start codon of thepetJ coding region, the resulting construct will contain a perfect fusion of the desired protein, which will be translated using the ribosome binding site of petJ. Plasmid pSCT2 was used to mutate the wild type rnpB allele present in the Synechocystis strain bearing the PpetJ-rnpB chimerical gene. It was constructed using plasmid pAV1000, which contains a 4.2-kilobase pair fragment of genomic DNA from Synechocystis 6803 carrying the rnpB gene (16Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To construct pSCT2, pAV1000 was digested with EcoNI and NcoI and ligated with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (15Elhai J. Wolk C.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 119-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This plasmid does not replicate in Synechocystis. Thus, after selection of chloramphenicol-resistant cells, we expected to obtain transformants bearing the genomic structure indicated at the bottom of Fig.1 B in the rnpB locus. Total RNA was extracted from 25 ml of culture by vortexing cells in the presence of phenol-chloroform and acid-washed baked glass beads (0.25–0.3 mm in diameter; Braun, Melsungen, Germany) as described previously (17Garcı́a-Domı́nguez M. Florencio F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, samples containing about 15 µg of total RNA were separated on a 8% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N-plus,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with32P-labeled probes by standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA size markers were generated by digestion of pBR322 with HaeIII and labeling of the resulting fragments with [α-32P]dGTP using the Klenow DNA polymerase. RNA size markers were generated by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32P]CTP of a pre-tRNAGlnfrom Synechocystis with or without the 3′-terminal CCA sequence (7Pascual A. Vioque A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6672-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Primer extensions were performed by standard procedures with total RNA and the oligonucleotides described below labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used for PCR or primer extension: 10SAPE, 5′-CTAGGCTGCTATGGCTACC-3′; 4.5SPE1, 5′-CTTATTGCTGCTACCTTCCG-3′; 4.5SPE2, 5′-CTAACCTATCAACACTTTCCGTCG-3′; GlnR2, 5′-CCTAGGAATGGCGGGACC-3′; petf, 5′-TCATAGCAACGCATGCGAGAGTTAGGGAGGG-3′; petJ, 5′-CTAGCTTGGTTGAATAATTTAAACATTAGTTCTC-3′; petr, 5′-TCATACCTCAGGTAACCAAAAAAAGAGAGTTAGTC-3′; PTR3, 5′-GGTATTTTTCTGTGGCACTGTCC-3′; tRYTPE, 5′-GCTGGATTTGAACCAGCGTAGG-3′; trnFf, 5′-CCCATAACCGCTGGC-3′; trnFr, 5′-CGAGGATTTTCAGTCCACTG-3′; trnGf, 5′-CGGATGCATCCCATAGCAGTG-3′; trnGr, 5′-CTAAAGCATGGGAGGCTTTCG-3′; trnVf, 5′-GGCAAAAAGGGAATAGG-3′; trnVr, 5′-CATCCTGCTTGTAAGGCAGGCGC-3′. The following DNA probes were used in hybridization experiments: rnpB, 1.6-kilobase pairHindIII fragment from pAV1000 (16Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); trnQ(UUG), 120-base pair fragment from plasmid pT7Gln (18Pascual A. Vioque A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) digested with BamHI andHindIII; trnY(GUA)-trnT(GGU), a plasmid containing the gene for the dimeric precursor of tRNATyr and tRNAThr 2 was used to generate a probe specific for the tRNATyr by digestion withEcoRI and FokI or a probe specific for the tRNAThr by digestion with FokI andHindIII (see Fig. 5); trnF(GAA), a PCR fragment was obtained with oligonucleotides trnFf and trnFr. The fragment extends from position −105 to +46 with respect to the first nucleotide of the mature tRNAPhe; trnV(UAC), a PCR fragment was obtained with oligonucleotides trnVf and trnVr. The fragment extends from position −93 to +46 with respect to the first nucleotide of the mature tRNAVal; trnG(CCC), a PCR fragment was obtained with oligonucleotides trnGf and trnGr. The fragment extends from position −175 to +44 with respect to the first nucleotide of the mature tRNAGly; ffs (4.5 S RNA), a plasmid containing the genomic region around Synechocystis ffs gene 2M. Roche and A. Vioque, unpublished data. was used to generate a probe specific for the 4.5 S RNA by digestion withDdeI and SpeI. Oligonucleotides and probes were designed based on the published complete sequence of the Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genome (19Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar), available at www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html. Oligonucleotides and probes are specific for their target RNAs, with the exception of oligonucleotide trnVr, which is expected to hybridize significantly with a tRNAAla and PT3, which has several possible weak homologous regions in the Synechocystis genome (see “Results”). Two sequential steps were followed to create aSynechocystis strain with conditional expression of thernpB gene. First, a copy of the rnpB gene that was under the control of the copper-regulated petJ promoter was placed in the glnN locus (Fig.1 A). Then, the wild type allele of rnpB gene, which is constitutively expressed, was deleted from its regular locus (Fig. 1 B). ThepetJ gene encodes the cytochrome c553and is tightly repressed by micromolar concentrations of copper (20Zhang L. McSpadden B. Pakrasi H.B. Whitmarsh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19054-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected that the expression of the rnpBallele inserted in the glnN locus was repressed by copper. The glnN locus was selected for the insertion of PpetJ-rnpB because it is not essential in Synechocystis (21Reyes J.C. Florencio F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSCT1 was used to insert PpetJ-rnpB in theglnN locus (see “Experimental Procedures”). After transformation with pSCT1, transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing plates and replated several times until segregation was complete, as assessed by Southern blot with aglnN probe (data not shown). To inactivate the endogenousrnpB gene, one selected pSCT1 transformant was transformed with plasmid pSCT2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this case, transformants were selected in medium without added copper and in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Complete segregation of the double mutant (named CT1) was obtained after several rounds of replating. Southern blot of the CT1 strain with an rnpBprobe revealed no detectable hybridization band corresponding to the wild type rnpB gene. Only the bands corresponding in size to the chloramphenicol-replaced rnpB gene and the PpetJ -rnpB gene at the glnN locus were detected (Fig. 1 C). The expression of rnpB was analyzed in the wild type and in the CT1 strains by primer extension (Fig.2). The transcript synthesized from thepetJ promoter has 39 additional nucleotides at the 5′ end. This is the result expected if the PpetJ-rnpB gene fusion uses the same transcription start point as the petJ gene (determined by primer extension with a petJ-specific oligonucleotide; data not shown). Transcription from the rnpB locus is not observed in CT1. Fig. 2 shows that transcription of rnpBfrom the PpetJ promoter is fully repressed by copper in CT1. However, an additional band of unknown origin is observed in the CT1 strain. We attribute this band to nonspecific priming during the primer extension procedure. When the amount of RNase P RNA is reduced, competition by a nonspecific priming site would be facilitated. This could explain why the band is more abundant in the copper-treated CT1 cells, where no RNase P RNA-specific signal is detected. There is no indication that there is processing at the 3′ end of the normal rnpB transcript, and transcription seems to terminate at the mature 3′ end (16Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We have not characterized in detail the 3′ end of the PpetJ -rnpB transcript, but Northern blot (not shown) indicates that the PpetJ -rnpBtranscript is only slightly longer than the normal rnpBtranscript. The difference in size is fully explained by the 39 extra nucleotides at the 5′ end, suggesting that the PpetJ -rnpB transcript has the same 3′ end as the normal rnpB transcript. We anticipated that the RNase P RNA carrying a short segment of additional nucleotides would be functional, becauseSynechocystis RNase P RNAs with longer extensions at the 5′ or 3′ ends had been shown to be functional in vitro (16Vioque A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6331-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and because RNase P activity can be detected even when the RNase P RNA is part of a much larger RNA generated by rolling circle transcription (22Banta A.B. Haas E.S. Brown J.W. Pace N.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 911Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fact that the rnpB gene could be fully segregated in the CT1 strain indicates that the RNA transcribed from thepetJ-rnpB site, with the 39 additional nucleotides at the 5′ end, is functional in vivo. The steady-state levels of RNase P protein present in the wild type and CT1 strains in the presence or absence of copper did not change significantly, as determined by Western blot (not shown) with antibodies generated against the RNase P protein of Synechocystis (18Pascual A. Vioque A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the transcription level of the RNase P RNA is lower in CT1 grown in the absence of copper than in the wild type strain. However, it is enough to support normal growth of the cells, because in the absence of copper, strain CT1 grows at a rate similar to wild type (Fig. 3). Therefore, we conclude that under fully derepressed conditions of the petJ promoter (absence of copper) the steady-state levels of RNase P in CT1 cells are not limiting growth, even though the amount of RNase P RNA is lower than in wild type. The addition of 5 µm copper has no effect on wild type growth, whereas it inhibits the growth of CT1. The addition of copper results in repression of the petJpromoter and reduction of the amount of RNase P RNA and growth inhibition. We conclude that the RNase P RNA is required forSynechocystis survival. Transcripts from four different monomeric tRNA genes, trnQ(UUG),trnF(GAA), trnV(UAC), and trnG(CCC), coding, respectively, for tRNAGln, tRNAPhe, tRNAVal, and tRNAGly species were analyzed by Northern blot and primer extension. The Northern blot experiments (Fig.4 A) showed a single band with a size corresponding to the mature tRNA in the wild type strain. In the CT1 strain, an additional band of larger size was observed upon depletion of RNase P. In principle, this larger band could correspond to precursor RNAs not fully processed at the 5′ or 3′ ends. Primer extension experiments with oligonucleotides specific for each tRNA indicate the presence of 5′-extended tRNAs (Fig. 4 B). The larger total size of the precursors detected by Northern blot were fully explained by the extension at the 5′ end, indicating that those precursors were already processed at their 3′ end. In the case of tRNAGln we were able to determine that the precursor detected has a size that corresponds exactly to an in vitrotranscribed precursor with a processed 3′ end and containing the 3′-terminal CCA sequence. Therefore, it is probable that the precursors detected are already processed at the 3′ end, have the CCA added, and the increased size corresponds to the absence of 5′ processing by RNase P, as expected if expression of rnpB is limited. Alternatively, the final trimming of the three nucleotides that occupy the position of CCA might require previous processing by RNase P. Some precursor RNAs are observed in the CT1 strain even in the absence of copper. This can be explained by the weaker expression of thepetJ promoter, even under full derepression compared with the native rnpB promoter. Therefore, RNase P activity could be limiting for the processing of a subset of its substrates in strain CT1, even in the absence of copper from the medium, although this has no significant effect on growth rate. InSynechocystis, there are 42 tRNA genes all present as single copies, with the exception of the trnI(GAU), which is present in two copies in the duplicated rRNA gene clusters. The genes are scattered all over the genome as single units except fortrnY(GUA) and trnT(GGU), which are separated by only 9 base pairs (23Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Maturation of this dimeric precursor would require cleavage by RNase P at two positions, corresponding to the mature 5′ ends of tRNATyr and tRNAThr, respectively (Fig. 5 A). When RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot with a tRNATyr-specific probe (Fig. 5 B), two bands of larger size than mature tRNATyr were detected. One band, of about 180 nucleotides, corresponds to the dimeric precursor already processed at the 3′ end of tRNAThr but with no processing by RNase P. The other band corresponds to a precursor RNA already processed at the RNase P site of tRNAThr. However, with a tRNAThr-pecific probe, only the 180-p band was detected. No band corresponding to RNase P processing at only the tRNATyr site was observed, indicating that processing at the downstream tRNAThr site must precede RNase P cleavage at the tRNATyr site. In E. coli, RNase P is involved in the 5′ processing of some stable RNAs such as 4.5 S RNA and tmRNA (8Bothwell A.L. Garber R.L. Altman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7709-7716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Komine Y. Kitabatake M. Yokogawa T. Nishikawa K. Inokuchi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). To find out if Synechocystis RNase P is also involved in the processing of these RNAs, we determined whether precursors for those RNAs were accumulated upon addition of copper to cultures of CT1 cells. In the case of 4.5 S RNA, a band of about 180 nucleotides was detected in CT1 by Northern hybridization (Fig.6 B). This band may correspond to a 5′-extended RNA that could be detected by primer extension with a primer specific for the leader sequence (Fig. 6 D). The precursor has a leader sequence of 79 nucleotides (Fig. 6 E). This precursor seems to be very unstable, because it could only be detected with an oligonucleotide specific for the leader, and the signal was very weak (Fig. 6, C and D). In contrast, a strong signal for a precursor for tmRNA was detected by primer extension in CT1 (Fig. 7). In this case, the leader sequence is 11 nucleotides long (Fig. 7). These results indicate that 4.5 S RNA and tmRNA are synthesized as precursors that are processed by RNase P inSynechocystis.Figure 7RNase P is required for processing of tmRNA in Synechocystis. Primer extension of total Synechocystis RNA with primer 10SaPE specific for the tmRNA is shown. The sizes of the primer-extended products were estimated from a sequencing reaction generated with the same primer run in parallel. M, mature RNA; P, precursor RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mapping that we have performed of the 5′ end of pre-tRNAs provides the transcription start point for the corresponding tRNA genes. We have compared the putative promoter sequences of those genes for which we have mapped the 5′ end of the precursors (Fig. 8). −10 and −35 consensus sequences are detected at the appropriate distance from the first nucleotide of the precursor, although in the case oftrnV, trnG, and 4.5 S RNA, the −35 sequence has a poor agreement with the consensus. In the 4.5 S RNA gene there is a heptanucleotide direct repeat with a 5-base pair spacer just 4 base pairs upstream of the proposed −10 sequence. The high efficiency of RNA processing events in bacteria makes it very difficult to detect precursors or intermediates in the maturation process in conditions of steady state. The same is true for pre-tRNA. Pre-tRNAs were first detected in phage-infected cells (24Altman S. Smith J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) after quick phenol RNA extraction. In addition, conditional mutants in tRNA maturation have been useful in the detection of the corresponding precursors (25Schedl P. Primakoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A strain with conditional expression of thernpB gene was developed in E. coli (26Waugh D.S. Pace N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6316-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although it was not used for the study of the maturation pathway in vivo. In this report, we have used a Synechocystisstrain that expresses conditionally the rnpB gene to identify precursors in the maturation process of transfer and other stable RNAs. We have followed an original approach to isolate a mutant of Synechocystis 6803 that expresses conditionally thernpB gene from the petJ gene promoter, depending on the concentration of copper in the medium. This approach, using plasmid pSCT1 as a platform, can be used to obtain conditional mutants affected in other essential genes. A recent report (27Buikema W.J. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) describes the conditional expression of a regulatory gene from the cyanobacteriumAnabaena under the control of another copper-regulated promoter, the petE gene promoter. The regulation ofpetE is complementary to petJ, because it is expressed only in the presence of copper. Therefore, conditional expression form the petE or petJ promoters represents complementary systems that can be used in diverse cyanobacteria. The analysis of the conditional rnpB mutant has allowed us to identify and characterize 5′-extended pre-tRNAs. In five arbitrarily chosen tRNAs, we could detect 5′-extended precursors, as well as in other stable RNAs that are expected to be processed by RNase P, such as tmRNA and 4.5 S RNA. The 5′ ends determined for the precursor RNAs most probably correspond to the transcription initiation site. There are two arguments in favor of this idea. First, only RNase P has been implicated in 5′ maturation of pre-tRNAs that are not part of complex transcripts. Second, a sequence similar to the consensus −10 box is present at the appropriate distance of the precursor 5′ end; in most cases a canonical −35 box is also present (Fig. 8). The length of the leader sequences detected are rather short, around 10 nucleotides, with the exception of 4.5 S RNA, that has a leader sequence of 79 nucleotides. This is in agreement with the known fact that bacterial RNase P is highly tolerant with respect to size and sequence of the 5′ leader. The 5′-extended pre-tRNA detected in strain CT1 seems to be already processed at the 3′ end, because the size of the precursors determined by Northern blot correspond to that of the mature tRNA plus the 5′ leader sequence. These results indicate that there is a quick and efficient 3′ end processing, which is independent of RNase P activity. Do the 3′ processed precursors contain the 3′-CCA sequence? We have previously described (7Pascual A. Vioque A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6672-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that cyanobacterial RNase P has a preferencein vitro for pre-tRNAs lacking the 3′-CCA sequence (inSynechocystis, the 3′-CCA sequence is not encoded, but is added post-transcriptionally by nucleotidyltransferase). This prompted us to suggest that RNase P processing could precede addition of CCA in cyanobacteria (7Pascual A. Vioque A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6672-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of tRNAGln, we could compare the size of the in vivo accumulated precursor with the size of in vitro transcribed pre-tRNAGln containing or lacking the CCA sequence (Fig. 4 A). Clearly, the in vivo precursor comigrates with the CCA containing marker RNA and not with the CCA-lacking RNA. This result suggests that CCA addition by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase can occur in vivo before RNase P processing. However, the dominant order of events cannot be deduced from these results. RNase P processing might precede CCA addition under normal conditions in the wild type, despite the fact that in CT1, upon limitation of RNase P, the accumulated 5′ precursors are substrates of the nucleotidyltransferase. Alternatively, RNase P and nucleotidyltransferase might act on the pre-tRNA independently, giving a random processing pathway. A strain with conditional expression of nucleotidyltransferase may solve these questions. In the absence of copper, some accumulation of precursors is detected, indicating that the lower constitutive level of RNase P RNA in CT1, compared with wild type, is already limiting processing. The fact that the growth rate of CT1 in the absence of copper is similar to wild type indicates that accumulation of precursors is not a secondary effect of growth arrest, but a specific consequence of RNase P depletion. In the case of the only dimeric pre-tRNA in Synechocystis, our results indicate an obligate pathway of RNase P processing. The downstream site is used first. Processing at the upstream site cannot happen until the downstream tRNA has been released, because precursors processed only at the upstream site are not detected. A similarin vivo processing order was deduced for a dimeric precursor of a T4 tRNAPro-tRNASer in phage-infectedE. coli cells (28Schmidt F.J. McClain W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4730-4738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case the 3′ monomer has encoded the CCA sequence. Even after 48 h in the presence of copper, most of the RNAs are in the mature form, and only a small proportion of RNase P precursor is detected. This could be due to a longer half-life of mature tRNAs compared with their precursors. But it is interesting that growth arrest is immediate upon addition of copper even though the amount of mature tRNA in CT1 cells is similar in cultures with or without added copper. This might indicate that there is an unknown RNase P-dependent substrate whose abundance is critical for cell growth that has not been revealed in our study or that the accumulated precursors poison the cell despite the presence of a sufficient amount of properly processed RNAs. It is possible that there are other natural substrates for bacterial RNase P yet to be identified. Those hypothetical substrates might be difficult to identify if they are in low abundance, are present only under specific metabolic conditions, or are cryptic and only accessible to RNase P after some previous modification of the RNA. The construction of a strain in which expression of RNase P can be shut down under controlled experimental conditions could help identify these substrates. We are grateful to Dr. Jesús de la Cruz for critical reading."

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Indeed, retention and retrieval signals have been identified for many ER and Golgi complex resident proteins (2Teasdale R.D.

Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), whereas the search for anterograde signals proved fruitless until very recently. The p24 family of transmembrane proteins and ERGIC-53p, both of which recycle between the ER and the Golgi complex, have a double-phenylalanine signal on their cytosolic region that affects exit from the ER (7Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol.

Several other transmembrane proteins have a diacidic motif in the cytosolic domain that determines the rate of ER export (9Nishimura N. Balch W.E.

Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Moreover, protein movement along the secretory pathway may be metabolically controlled. Transport of the calcitonin receptor-like receptors Fas and neurotropin to the cell surface is regulated by the level of receptor activity-modifying proteins p53 and cAMP, respectively (13Bennet M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 14Meyer-Franke A. Wilkinson G.A. Kruttgen A. Minjie H. Munro E. Hanson M.G. Reichardt L.F. Barres B.A. Neurons. 1998; 21: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and export of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins from the ER is stimulated by insulin (15Malide D. Yewdell J.W. Bennik J.R. Cushman S.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consequently, nonselective and signal-mediated anterograde transport probably coexist. There is some evidence that a carboxyl-terminal valine residue at the cytosolic tail of cell surface transmembrane proteins is an anterograde signal. Deletion or substitution of the valine residues in proTGFα and MT1-MMP proteins results in lack of surface expression, ER accumulation, and proTGFα ectodomain shedding in the culture medium (16Briley, G. P., Hissong, M. A., Chiu, M. L., and Lee, D. C. Mol. Biol. Cell 8, 1619–1631.Google Scholar, 17Ureña J.M. Merlos-Suàrez A. Balsenga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings implicate the terminal valine in ER export but do not exclude effects on other steps of the secretory pathway. Anterograde signaling has been attributed to the two carboxyl-terminal residues, leucine and valine, of yeast Emp24p, a member of the p24 family of ER/Golgi recycling proteins (7Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 18Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this case, deletion or substitution of the terminal residue retards the ER-to-Golgi transport, as shown by α1,6-mannose modification of chimeric constructs between Emp24 and a hybrid invertase-Wbp1p protein (20Nakamura N. Yamazaki S. Sato K. Nakano A. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the role played by the carboxyl-terminal valine residue in the exocytic pathway has yet to be established. Lymphocyte CD8α glycoprotein, an O-glycosylated type I transmembrane protein of the cell surface, carries a carboxyl-terminal valine residue in all mammalian species in which it has been sequenced. CD8α is an excellent model system with which to evaluate the role of the terminal valine residue in anterograde transport. First, the protein moves rapidly from the ER to the plasma membrane, and its post-translational modifications are well documented (21Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, progress along the pathway can be monitored by metabolic labeling, because specific forms of the protein occur in the ER and in the cis- and trans-Golgi complex (22Pascale M.C. Erra M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25196-25201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by cell fractionation (23Erra M.C Iodice L. Lotti L.V. Bonatti S. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Third, CD8α has been used successfully as a reporter protein to define and characterize ER retrieval and localization signals (5Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 25Martire G. Mottola G. Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Turrini I. Serafini-Cassi F. Jackson M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol.

Therefore, we mutagenized the cytosolic tail of human CD8α extensively and performed a morphological, biochemical, and cell fractionation analysis of the transfected cells. The results of this study demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal valine residue is required for maximal transport from the ER to the intermediate compartment (IC) but does not affect the other steps of translocation to the plasma membrane or post-translational modifications of the protein. All culture reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. Solid chemicals and liquid reagents were from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy), Serva Feinbiochemica (Heidelberg, Germany), and BDH (Poole, United Kingdom). Radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and the ECL kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The enzymes used in molecular cloning were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England BioLabs (distributed by Microglass, Naples, Italy) or PromegaItalia srl (Milan, Italy). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Primm Srl (Milan, Italy). The following monoclonal antibodies were used: mouse OKT8 (anti-CD8 protein), mouse N1 (anti-CD8 protein), peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), and Texas Red conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA). The expression vector was the pFLTRβT8 plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the human protein CD8α (27Mottola G. Jourdan N. Castaldo G. Malagolini N. Lahm A. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G.

Mutants in the CD8α cytoplasmic domain were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used. All mutated plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing and transiently transfected into HuH-7 cells. Human hepatoma cells (HuH-7) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected with FuGENETM6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All analyses were performed 36–48 h after transfection. All of these procedures were performed as described previously (28Migliaccio G. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 185: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Bonatti S. Migliaccio G. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12590-12595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate CD8α protein from the plasma membrane, monolayers were incubated for 1 h at 0 °C (on a metal plate on ice) in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing the OKT8 antibody diluted 1/1000. The cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 0 °C for 30 min in buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100, and the lysates were incubated with protein A-Sepharose at 0 °C for 30 min on a rotating wheel. The immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed, and processed for SDS-PAGE analysis, and the supernatant was used to immunoprecipitate intracellular CD8α. To quantify the relative amount of [35S]methionine- and [35S]cysteine-labeled CD8α forms, the dried gels were analyzed with the Bio-Rad Molecular Imager Systems, model 525, using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst/Macintosh software. All manipulations were done at 4 °C. About 7–10 × 107 cells were homogenized by 10 passages through a cell cracker (8.020-mm chamber, 8.008-mm sphere) in Hepes/KOH, pH 7.3, 20 mm, 120 mm sucrose. A post-nuclear supernatant fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge and loaded on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient made up in the same buffer (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 60% (w/v)). The gradient was spun in a SW 50.1 rotor tube for 1 h at 43,000 rpm in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge, and fractions were collected with a peristaltic pump. CD8α protein was immunoprecipitated from each fraction, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and quantified with the PhosphorImager. The cytosolic tail of the CD8α is 28 residues long in all mammalian species in which it has been sequenced, except in the rat, where it has a deletion of four consecutive residues (Fig. 1). It has an identity of about 60% in all species examined so far and several conservative changes. The juxtamembrane half of the tail is more conserved than the external half (80 versus 35% identity). This portion of the tail binds p56lck, the lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase of the Src family (30Turner J.M. Brodsky M.H. Irving B.A. Levin S.D. Perlmuter R.M. Littman D.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 755-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 31Veillette A. Davidson D.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), thus the high level of identity may indicate strong evolutionary pressure toward this function. Differently, changes and deletions are present in the external half, where only five residues are conserved. Among them is the terminal valine, which is preceded at position 27 by tyrosine (except in rodents where isoleucine or phenylalanine is found) and at position 26 by a positively charged residue, either arginine or lysine. Interestingly, chicken CD8α, the only nonmammalian species known, retains a close identity with other species in the juxtamembrane half of the tail but has only the lysine and proline residues at position 20–21 in the external portion. However, chicken CD8α presents a terminal isoleucine preceded by histidine and the positively charged arginine. Thus, the terminal portion of the CD8α tail could have progressively evolved to an (R/K)YV sequence to fulfill a better signaling function. The O-glycosylation process, transport kinetics to the cell surface, and the steady-state distribution of protein CD8α stably expressed in tissue-cultured cells are reported elsewhere (21Pascale M.C.

The newly synthesized protein migrates as a 27-kDa unglycosylated form called “CD8u” on reducing SDS-PAGE. Soon (half-time of about 5 min after a 2.5-min pulse), it reaches the cis-Golgi complex where it is initially O-glycosylated and forms an intermediate transient 29-kDa precursor, CD8i. Later (half-time of about 15 min), the protein is terminallyO-glycosylated in the trans-Golgi complex, and on SDS-PAGE it appears as a 32–34-kDa mature doublet, CD8m. Finally, CD8m moves to the plasma membrane (half-time of about 30 min after a short pulse). Most of the steady-state CD8α protein is the CD8m form, about 75% resides on the cell surface, and the remainder is distributed among the Golgi complex and the endosomes (26Lotti L.V. Mottola G. Torrisi M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10413-10420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We modified the cytosolic tail of CD8α extensively at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2) to verify its role in transport along the exocytic pathway. The modified forms were expressed in HuH-7 cells by transient transfection, and their intracellular distribution and extent of terminal glycosylation at steady state were investigated by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, respectively. As a control, in addition to wild type CD8α, we used the tail-less form because its intracellular routing is significantly impaired (33Fung-Leung W.P. Louie M.C. Limmer A. Ohashi P.S. Ngo K. Chen L. Kawai K. Lacy E. Loh D.Y. Mak W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2834-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Wild type CD8α was distributed among the plasma membrane and Golgi complex (Fig. 3), whereas the tail-less CD8α was predominant in the ER and Golgi complex. Interestingly, immunofluorescence microscopy showed that no mutant carried the extreme phenotype of the tail-less protein, all being similar to the wild type. Weak labeling of the nuclear envelope and more pronounced Golgi labeling occurred in mutants ΔV28, ΔY27V28, and V28D (Fig. 3); all other mutants were almost indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Western blotting showed a greater effect in some species. As expected, all wild type CD8α was in the CD8m form, whereas CD8u was poorly converted to mature forms in the tail-less CD8α (Fig.4). ΔV28, ΔY27V28, and V28D contained relevant amounts of the unglycosylated form, R26A/Y27A/V28A, V28F, V28A, Y27A/V28A, Δ22, and Δ 17 low amounts of the unglycosylated form, and ΔY27, Y27A, R26A, K16A/K20A, G18A/D19A, and K20A/P21A were comparable with the wild type (Fig. 4 and data not shown). However, the mature form was the most prominent in all mutants except the tail-less mutant. In conclusion, the mutations affecting the carboxyl-terminal valine did not block terminal glycosylation and transport of CD8α along the exocytic pathway but may alter the rate of these processes.Figure 3The mutations in the cytosolic tail of CD8α have a minor effect on the distribution of the protein, but complete removal of the tail has a strong effect.

Note that the initially glycosylated form is not detected by Western blot. Only the relevant portion of the SDS-PAGE is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We measured the glycosylation rate of CD8α with pulse labeling, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE analysis. After a 30-min pulse with [35S]cysteine and -methionine, CD8m was slightly less than 60% of total labeled CD8α in the wild type, the remainder being CD8u and a small percent CD8i (Fig. 5). Conversely, in the tail-less mutant, the mature form was about 5% of the total. The most affected mutants were again ΔV28, ΔY27V28, and V28D (about 15% of CD8m) followed by Y27A/V28A, R26A/Y27A/V28A, and Δ 17 (about 20–25%) and V28A and V28F (about 35%) (Fig. 5). All other mutants scored between 40 and 50% (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Interestingly, even single conservative changes such as V28A and V28F were affected significantly. This analysis indicated that the carboxyl-terminal valine residue is very important for the normal rate of terminal glycosylation of CD8α and that Arg26 and Tyr27 play a minor role in the process. Pulse-chase labeling experiments confirmed that the production of CD8m by the most affected mutants was delayed by 4–5-fold (data not shown). Thus, because terminal O-glycosylation takes place in the trans-Golgi complex (22Pascale M.C. Erra M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25196-25201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lack of the carboxyl-terminal valine most likely delays one or more step(s) in the transport of CD8α between the ER and the trans-Golgi complex. Alternatively, the lack of the terminal valine residue affects directly glycosylation of the protein. Support for the former hypothesis comes from PhorphorImager results showing that the relative amount of CD8i versus CD8m did not increase in any mutant (Fig. 5). Conversely, the relative amount of both forms decreased in parallel strongly in favor of CD8u in the most affected mutants and less severely in the least affected ones. This parallel behavior of mature and initially glycosylated forms of CD8α suggests that valine-less mutants proceed at normal rate from the cis-Golgi (where CD8i is generated) toward the trans-Golgi region (where CD8m is produced). Consequently, the carboxyl-terminal valine signal is most likely required in the transport step between the ER and the cis-Golgi complex. The delayed glycosylation/transport rate may be due to various factors. One is a longer folding process, because only correctly folded proteins are exported from the ER. To investigate whether the terminal valine plays a fundamental role in CD8α folding, we examined the extent of dimerization of the mutant with respect to the wild type protein. CD8u folding in the ER results in the formation of homodimers stabilized by disulfide bridge(s), and these dimers are exported to the IC and Golgi complex (34Verde C. Pascale M.C. Martire G. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Helenius A. Bonatti S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 267-274PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the most relevant mutants were transfected in parallel to the wild type and the newly synthesized proteins analyzed after immunoprecipitation in SDS-PAGE in nonreducing conditions. The mutant and wild type CD8u forms contained the same relative amounts of dimers after a 15-min pulse (Fig. 6). This finding demonstrates that the cytosolic tail does not affect the overall folding of the protein or the ability of the ectodomain to establish inter-chain disulphide bond(s). Thus, the delayed glycosylation/transport rate can not be ascribed to a prolonged quality control process in the ER. If a terminal valine residue is needed for a maximal glycosylation/transport rate of CD8α, the addition of a valine to the truncated cytosolic tail of a mutant CD8α protein should improve this rate. To verify this prediction, we extended the carboxyl terminus of the Δ17 mutant with Val or Tyr-Val (Fig. 2). The results obtained from the assay described in Fig. 5 are clear; Δ17 had a slower glycosylation/transport rate, and Δ17 plus Val or Tyr-Val had the same rate as the wild type protein (Fig.7). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal valine may be sufficient to obtain maximal glycosylation/transport rate. The foregoing results strongly suggest that the carboxyl-terminal valine signal is required for a maximal rate of transport of newly synthesized CD8α protein from the ER to the Golgi complex but do not exclude the possibility that this signal also plays a role in transport from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. To address this question, and to exclude the unlikely hypothesis of a direct effect on the glycosylation process, we performed labeling experiments with [3H]glucosamine. [3H]Glucosamine specifically labels the CD8α forms in the Golgi complex, and most of this sugar is incorporated as GlncNAc, GalNAc, and NeuNAc in the terminal glycosylation process (21Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Serafini-Cessi F. Leone A. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9940-9947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were labeled for 2 h, and CD8α protein was immunoprecipitated first from the surface and then from the cell lysate. Finally, the immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Roughly the same relative amounts of mature forms were labeled by [3H]GlcN and expressed on the cell surface in wild type and ΔV28 transfected cells (Fig.8). Therefore, neither glycosylation nor transport of CD8α from the trans-Golgi complex to the plasma membrane requires the carboxyl-terminal valine. Having established that the carboxyl-terminal valine is required for transport of CD8α from the ER to the Golgi complex, we investigated whether the step specifically altered was export from the ER to the IC or from the IC to the Golgi complex. In the absence of post-translational modifications specific for the IC, we used cell fractionation after pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine and -cysteine. Transport of newly synthesized CD8α among the ER, IC, and Golgi complex can be analyzed by a simple fractionation procedure of stably transfected cells (23Erra M.C Iodice L. Lotti L.V. Bonatti S. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 26Lotti L.V. Mottola G. Torrisi M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10413-10420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.9, A–C, the CD8u form, labeled in a very short pulse, sediments mostly in the ER-enriched region of the discontinuous sucrose gradient, in both the ER and IC-enriched regions after a 5-min chase, and in the IC-enriched region after a 2-h chase at 15 °C (a condition that prevents transport to the Golgi complex and leads to accumulation in the IC). Conversely, the newly synthesized CD8u form of mutant ΔV28 invariably sedimented in the ER-enriched fractions, both after the pulse and after different chase times at 37 °C (Fig. 9, D and E and data not shown). The same result was obtained after a 2-h chase at 15 °C (Fig. 9 F). As expected, the initially and terminally glycosylated forms of both the wild type and ΔV28 generated during the chase sedimented in the center of the gradient (data not shown). Taken together, these results together indicate that the absence of the carboxyl-terminal valine impairs specifically the transport step between the ER and IC. The effect of this impairment is a slower and asynchronous exit of CD8α from the ER. We provide evidence that the carboxyl-terminal valine signal in the CD8α protein is important for protein transport to the ER. This anterograde signal is not required for any other step of the exocytic pathway that leads to the plasma membrane. Earlier studies suggested that the carboxyl-terminal valine is an anterograde signal in the exocytic pathway that increases the rate of ER to Golgi transport. The glycosylation rate of chimeric reporters from yeast Emp24p, a type I transmembrane protein recycling between the ER and the Golgi complex, and of protein Wbp1p was found to be optimal in the Golgi complex only in the presence of the two carboxyl-terminal residues of the cytosolic tail of Emp24, leucine and valine (20Nakamura N. Yamazaki S. Sato K. Nakano A. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3493-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Data obtained with engineered forms of human ERGIC-53p, another type I transmembrane protein recycling between the ER and the Golgi complex, support this finding (35Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (suppl.) (Abstr. 1086): 208aGoogle Scholar). Similarly, removal of the double-phenylalanine motif decreases the rate of exit from the ER, but the mutated protein retains its capacity to proceed in the exocytic pathway (7Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 8Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal valine signal appears to play a more restricted role in the type I transmembrane proteins proTGFα and MT1-MMP, which are normally localized on the cell surface (16Briley, G. P., Hissong, M. A., Chiu, M. L., and Lee, D. C. Mol. Biol. Cell 8, 1619–1631.Google Scholar, 17Ureña J.M. Merlos-Suàrez A. Balsenga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results obtained with valine-less constructs showed that both proteins accumulated in the ER. This finding is striking because substantial retention of surface protein in the ER seems to be a feature of remarkably misfolded/unfolded or unoligomerized proteins that fail to pass the quality control process (36Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), which does not seem to be the case of proTGFα and MT1-MMP (17Ureña J.M. Merlos-Suàrez A. Balsenga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies of the diacidic anterograde motif show that ER export is altered to a different extent upon removal or transfer of the signal to reporter proteins (9Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Sevier C.S. Weisz O.A. Davis M. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 2001; 291: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of transport from the ER to the Golgi complex seems to be differently altered by the carboxyl-terminal valine and by the other anterograde signals depending on the specific cargo protein. After establishing the role of the carboxyl-terminal valine signal, we addressed the issue of its function at molecular level. It is likely that a signal exposed at the end of the cytosolic tail would determine interaction with cytosolic factors or with factors exposed on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. These factors may favor concentration of the signal-bearing cargo proteins at ER exit sites. In exocrine pancreas, abundant soluble cargo proteins are concentrated equally at the exit sites and over the entire ER, whereas they are three times more concentrated in selected areas of the IC (37Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Conversely, proteins involved in the export or retrieval machinery are more concentrated at the ER exit sites and at different areas of the IC, respectively (37Martinez-Menarguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These results support a bulk flow mode of ER export for abundant proteins, coupled with selective sorting (and perhaps retrieval) processes in the IC (38Klumperman J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 12: 445-449Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein is more concentrated at the ER exit sites and in the IC than in the ER cisternae (39Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The latter findings could be reconciled with the former data assuming that the type of ER export mechanism differs depending on the concentration of the protein cargo or on whether the cargo consists of soluble or membrane proteins. This may apply to the export machinery proteins that, unlike cargo, must be continuously retrieved and reused. In a previous study, both immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed that wild type does not accumulate in the ER, which is compatible with rapid export of CD8α to the Golgi complex (26Lotti L.V. Mottola G. Torrisi M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10413-10420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, using immunofluorescence microscopy we found CD8α in the ER when the carboxyl-terminal valine was deleted or substituted. Thus, it would be interesting to investigate the distribution of these mutants in the ER by immunoelectron microscopy. The absence of protein concentration at exit sites would implicate the terminal valine in this step, whereas protein concentration would point to a different role, for example, in packaging in the transport vesicles. Vesicles involved in ER export are coated with COPII proteins (40Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 41Springer S. Spang A. Schekman R.

Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the double-phenylalanine motif binds COPII subunits in vitro (8Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and the same role has been attributed to the carboxyl-terminal valine signal (35Nufer O. Guldbrandsen S. Kappeler F. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (suppl.) (Abstr. 1086): 208aGoogle Scholar). However, the two-hybrid screen applied to the cytosolic tail of proTGFα led to the identification of a specific interacting protein, named TACIP18′ (43Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Ureña J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This is a PDZ protein that, at variance with other members of the family that interact with the cytosolic tail of transmembrane receptors at the plasma membrane, is apparently located in the initial compartments of the secretory pathway (43Fernandez-Larrea J.

Durr J. David G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). TACIP18 interacts only with immature forms of proTGFα containing the terminal valine; thus, it could represent a cell-surface targeting factor specific for proTGFα (43Fernandez-Larrea J.

Functional evidence is required to confirm this hypothesis, but similar cases have been described (46Herrmann J.M. Malkus P. Schekman R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Yeast permeases require a functional Shr3p protein to reach the cell surface; otherwise they are stored in the ER, which results in defective amino acid uptake (47Ljungdahl P.O. Gimeno C.J. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 463-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 48Gilstring C.F. Melin-Larsson M. Ljungdahl P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3549-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Work is in progress in our laboratory to verify whether TACIP18 also interacts with CD8α glycoprotein and to search for other partner proteins that assist export of CD8α from the ER. Finally, the mutational analysis data indicate that the arginine and tyrosine residues at position −2 and −1, respectively, play a minor role in ER export. However, a detailed analysis will be required to define precisely the sequence of a signal and the role of the surrounding amino acids. For instance, in the case of the diacidic signal, either an adjacent tyrosine-based motif or the flanking residues are important for ER export (11Sevier C.S. Weisz O.A. Davis M. Machamer C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 12Ma D. Zerangue N. Lin Y.F. Collins A., Yu, M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

PAKs typically have a carboxyl-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain preceded by an amino-terminal regulatory region.

In general, group II GCKs share significant homology with Group I GCKs in the catalytic domain; however, their carboxyl termini differ significantly from group I GCKs and are poorly understood. Biochemical evidence suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region of some group II GCKs may contain an autoinhibitory domain (3Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 537-4546Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Sid1p is a group II GCK required for cytokinesis in the fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Like other GCKs, Sid1p has an amino-terminal catalytic region containing the 11 conserved domains typical of PAK/GCKs. In addition, Sid1p contains ∼200 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain. No function has yet been attributed to this region. Cdc14p, a novel protein with previously unknown function, binds Sid1p throughout the cell cycle, and together they function as an intermediate component in a signaling pathway termed the septation initiation network (SIN). The SIN provides temporal and spatial regulation of cell division by signaling the initiation of cytokinesis once mitosis has completed (8Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Surana U. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1503-1513PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sawin K.E. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R547-R550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A key aspect of Sid1p/Cdc14p regulation is their temporal intracellular localization pattern; Sid1p/Cdc14p localizes asymmetrically to one spindle pole body (SPB) at the end of anaphase just prior to cytokinesis and leaves the SPB once septation completes (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Genetic studies indicate that Sid1p and Cdc14p require each other to localize; however, the functional role of Cdc14p in the SIN is unknown. In this study, we performed a structure/function analysis of Sid1p. We found that the carboxyl terminus of Sid1p is required to bind Cdc14p and promote the full catalytic activity of the kinase as well as to mediate the intracellular localization pattern of the protein. All S. pombe strains and methods were as described in Ref.7.sid1 constructs were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: Sid1N 5′, 5′-GGGGGATCCGATGTATCCTCTCAATGCTAAT-3′; Sid1N 3′, 5′-GGGGGGATCCCTAGTCTTTCACAGTTCCTGC-3′; Sid1C 5′, 5′-GGGGGATCCGATTATTCCTTTGCTTGTTCAG-3′; Sid1C 3′, GGGGGGATCCCTATCCATTTAGACTTCTTCTTTT-3′; and Sid1 C-trunc, 5′ GGGGGGATCCCTAGTTGTCTGGAGTAATTTGGTTAAC-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies). Each oligonucleotide incorporated 5′ and 3′ BamHI sites (underlined). Sid1 expresses the full 1478 nucleotides of the sid1 gene, whereas Sid1N and Sid1C correspond to nucleotides 1–800 and 801–1458, respectively. Sid1ΔC corresponds to nucleotides 1–1371. DNA products were subcloned into the BamHI site of pRep41HA or pRep42GFP vectors and transformed into S. pombe strains by electroporation. These vectors express inserts from the inducible weak nmt1promoter in the absence of thiamine and incorporate either an amino-terminal 3× HA or a GFP epitope tag (10Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). For rescue experiments, three (+) signs were assigned as a measure of wild-type rescue, and a (−) was assigned to no rescue. (−/+) was assigned to Sid1N and Sid1ΔC because most cells did not survive; however, a few cells could survive and form colonies but clearly did not exhibit wild-type growth kinetics. Because the pRep41HA vector contains aleu gene and thus cannot be used in the13myc-cdc14::leu1+ strain, co-immunoprecipitation studies used theura4+-based pRep42GFP expression vector. GFP-Sid1p is functionally equivalent to its HA-tagged counterpart (data not shown). GFP-Sid1K38R was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange (Stratagene) using pRep42GFP-Sid1 as the template. The mutant was sequenced and confirmed to be nonfunctional by plasmid rescue of sid1–125. For overexpression studies,BamHI fragments of sid1N and sid1Cwere excised from pRep41HA vectors and subcloned into theBamHI site of pRep1. pRep1 expresses the inserts from the full strength nmt1 promoter (which is ∼12× stronger than the weak (pRep41/42) nmt1 promoter (11Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In all cases, plasmid-based expression was induced by washing cells three times in thiamine-free medium and transferring to medium lacking thiamine. For the sequencing of sid1–125 andsid1–239, genomic DNA of the mutants was prepared, and thesid1 locus was amplified by PCR and sequenced by the University of Massachusetts Medical School sequencing facility. GFP-Sid1p constructs were induced in 13myc-cdc14 cells, and cells were grown to mid-log phase. Equal numbers of cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by vortexing the cell pellets with 425–600-µm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma). The protein lysate was removed from the glass beads by rinsing two times with 750 µl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 6 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mm NaH2PO4 plus protease inhibitors), and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The lysates were then split into two equal volumes, and 1 µl of a noncommercial GFP antibody (a gift of Pam Silver) or 1 µl of a noncommercial Myc antibody (a gift of Kathy Gould) was added. Antibodies were allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C while rocking. 40 µl of a 50:50 slurry of protein G beads (Sigma)/Nonidet P-40 buffer was then added to each lysate and allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C while rocking. Protein G beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. 30 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer was then added to each tube, and samples were boiled for 2 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. Immunopurified proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) for Western blot analysis. Membranes were probed with anti-GFP (1:1000) or anti-Myc (1:2000) (gifts of Kathy Gould). HA-taggedsid1 and cdc14 cDNAs were amplified from pRep41HA expression vectors by PCR using the 5′ oligonucleotide primer 5′-CCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGACTCGAGCCCATGGCATACCCTTAC-3′ that incorporated the T7 promoter (underlined) 5′ to the HA tag (Integrated DNA Technologies) and the 3′ primers 5′-GGGGGGATCCCTATCCATTTAGACTTC TTCTTTT-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGATCCCTAGTCGAATGTTTCGTCTAACTT-3′ that incorporated a stop codon for sid1 and cdc14, respectively (Integrated DNA Technologies). PCR products were cleaned and concentrated to 30 µl with Qiagen columns, and 2 µl of DNA was then added to a 25-µl TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). In addition, each reaction contained 12.5 µl of reticulocyte lysate, 1 µl of TnT® reaction buffer, 0.5 µl of TnT® T7-RNA polymerase, 0.5 µl of amino acid mixture (minus 1 mm methionine), 1 µl of Redivuel-[35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 µl (2 units) of RNasin (Promega), and 7.0 µl of nuclease-free water according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and then diluted to 0.5 ml with Nonidet P-40 buffer. For characterizing the catalytic role of Cdc14p, HA-Sid1 and HA-Cdc14 were made in duplicate, and one lysate of each was pooled with the other. A luciferase reaction (DNA provided by the manufacturer) was also carried out as a control. Reactions were then analyzed for kinase activity as described below. To confirm that equal amounts of protein were expressed in each reaction, 5 µl was removed prior to immunoprecipitation and boiled 2 min in 20 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were processed for fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Kinase assays are described in (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). For analyzing kinase activity of the Sid1 constructs, HA-tagged Sid1 proteins were induced in S. pombe cells from the pRep41HA vector as described above. Lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 µl of HA (12CA5) antibody (BAbCO) and protein G beads as described above. Protein G beads were further washed with kinase assay buffer (100 mm MgCl2/100 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and then each reaction was resuspended in 30 µl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 µg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), 50 µm ATP, and 0.5 µCi of Redivue [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with frequent mixing. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 µl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Samples were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, and products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and quantitative analysis was performed using Molecular Dynamics software. To monitor the protein level, proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blot analysis was performed as described above with HA antibody (12CA5–1:1000). The percent kinase activity was determined by calculating the relative activity compared with full-length Sid1, and the percent activity was corrected for protein level using a Bio-Rad Model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer and Multi-Analyst Software. For kinase assays of in vitro translation products, the procedure was the same except that diluted reticulocyte lysates were used as the source of protein (described above). The percent kinase activity was determined by calculating the activity relative to background. In all cases, kinase activity is expressed as the mean ± the range. Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described in Ref. 7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar. S. pombe cells carrying GFP-Sid1 constructs were grown in thiamine-containing medium and then fixed by suspending in 100% methanol at −20 °C for 8 min followed by two washes in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were streaked onto glass slides, stained with 4′6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) to label the DNA, and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope with a cooled CCD camera (Dage 300, MVI, Avon, MA) and IPab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics Corporation, Vienna, VA). Cells in late anaphase, as judged by DNA staining with DAPI, were scored for GFP-Sid1 signal at the SPB. For Sid1C competition experiments, Sid1N, Sid1C, or no insert were expressed from the full strength nmt1 promoter prior to fixation and microscopy. To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal nonkinase portion of Sid1p is important for Sid1p function, we created HA-tagged Sid1 constructs to express full-length Sid1 protein, the amino-terminal kinase domain (Sid1N), and carboxyl terminus (Sid1C). The carboxyl-terminal epitope-tagged Sid1p is nonfunctional. 2D. McCollum, unpublished observations. Therefore we also deleted the extreme carboxyl terminus of Sid1p (Sid1ΔC) to determine whether this region is crucial for function (Fig.1A). To determine whether the constructs were functional in vivo, HA-Sid1 constructs were tested for their ability to rescue sid1–125 andsid1–239 temperature-sensitive cells at a restrictive temperature (36 °C) when induced. sid1–125 contains a single amino acid change (L140P) in domain VI of the kinase domain (this study). sid1–239, a weaker allele, contains a single change (L12P) just upstream of domain I of the kinase domain (this study). Full-length HA-Sid1 rescued both alleles, whereas HA-vector and HA-Sid1C did not (Table I). HA-Sid1N and HA-Sid1ΔC did not rescue the sid1–125 strain; however, they slightly rescued sid1–239. We also examined the ability of each construct to rescue a sid1 deletion strain (sid1Δ::ura), and the results were identical to those with sid1–125. These data indicate that the carboxyl terminus is required for the essential function of Sid1p.Table IRescue of sid1 temperature-sensitive (sid1–125 and sid1–239) or sid1 deletion (sid1Δ) mutant S. pombe cells by Sid1, vector alone, Sid1N, Sid1C, or Sid1ΔC constructssid1–125sid1–239sid1ΔSid1+++++++++Vector−−−Sid1N−−/+−Sid1C−−−Sid1ΔC−−/+− Open table in a new tab Because the Sid1p carboxyl terminus is essential for viability, we next sought to identify its function. Sid1p is in a complex with Cdc14p (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); therefore we first tested whether the carboxyl terminus of Sid1p might mediate this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. To facilitate these studies, amino-terminal GFP-tagged versions of the gene constructs were expressed in S. pombe cells that contain 13myc-cdc14. 13Myc-Cdc14p was detected in GFP immunoprecipitates from cells expressing GFP-Sid1 and GFP-Sid1C but not GFP, GFP-Sid1N, or GFP-Sid1ΔC (Fig. 1 B,middle). To control for 13Myc-Cdc14p expression, a Myc immunoprecipitate and immunoblot were performed (Fig. 1 B,top). To control for GFP-Sid1p expression, a GFP immunoprecipitate and immunoblot were performed (Fig. 1 B,bottom). These data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal portion of Sid1p binds Cdc14p. Some evidence suggests that the carboxyl terminus of group II GCKs contain an autoinhibitory domain (3Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Pombo C.M. Bonventre J.V. Molnar A. Kyriakis J. Force T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 537-4546Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Therefore we next examined the kinase activity of the HA-Sid1 constructs immunopurified from S. pombe cell lysates to determine whether removal of the carboxyl terminus stimulated kinase activity. The expression of HA-Sid1 and the corresponding constructs was confirmed by Western blot analysis. (Fig. 2A). Relative kinase activity was high for HA-Sid1 immune complexes and barely above background for vector alone and Sid1C (Fig. 2 B). HA-Sid1N immune complexes, which are deleted for the carboxyl-terminal domain, exhibited a significant reduction in kinase activity (∼40% of Sid1). HA-Sid1ΔC immune complexes also had reduced kinase activity, though not as pronounced as Sid1N. These data show that the carboxyl noncatalytic region of Sid1p does not suppress activity but rather is important for the full activity of the kinase in vivo. Deletion of the entire carboxyl terminus or extreme carboxyl terminus of Sid1p results in decreased kinase activity. Because the carboxyl terminus contains the Cdc14p binding domain, we wondered whether Cdc14p was required for full Sid1p catalytic activity in vitro. To test this, we generated HA-tagged versions of Sid1p and Cdc14p by in vitro transcription/translation (Fig.2 C), immunopurified the products alone or in combination, and analyzed them for kinase activity (Fig. 2 D).No DNA, HA-Cdc14, andLuciferase exhibited only background levels of activity (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, HA-Sid1p reproducibly exhibited a moderate level of kinase activity, which increased in the presence of equal amounts of HA-Cdc14p. These data indicate that Cdc14p is required for full Sid1p catalytic activity in vitro. Genetic studies indicate that asymmetric SPB localization of Sid1p/Cdc14p in late anaphase requires Cdc14p function (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Because Cdc14p is required for full Sid1p catalytic activity, we tested whether both physical interaction between Sid1p and Cdc14p and Sid1p kinase activity were required for Sid1p SPB localization. We first tested whether Sid1 proteins that lack the ability to bind Cdc14p can still localize. Full-length GFP-Sid1 as well as GFP-Sid1C were detected at SPBs in nearly 100% of late anaphase cells (Fig.3, panels A and C, respectively), whereas GFP-Sid1N, GFP-Sid1ΔC, and GFP alone gave no SPB signal (Fig. 3, panels B, D, andF, respectively). These results indicate that the extreme carboxyl terminus of Sid1p, which is required for Cdc14p binding, is also required for SPB localization. The fact that GFP-Sid1C alone can localize to the SPB in the absence of a kinase domain strongly suggests that Cdc14p does not promote Sid1p localization by enhancing Sid1p kinase activity. To confirm this observation, we examined the localization of GFP-Sid1p (kinase-dead), which has a conserved lysine to arginine mutation (K38R) in domain I of the kinase domain (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Consistent with kinase activity not being required for localization, GFP-Sid1K38R localized efficiently to one SPB at the end of anaphase (Fig. 3, panel E). SIN proteins are essential for viability, and mutants exhibit a cytokinesis defect, becoming long and multinucleate and eventually lysing (13Balasubramanian M.K. McCollum D. Chang L. Wong K.C. Naqvi N.I. He X. Sazer S. Gould K.L. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sid1p requires Cdc14p for kinase activity and localization. Therefore we reasoned that high expression of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of Sid1p containing the Cdc14p binding domain might titrate Cdc14p from Sid1p and elicit a SIN phenotype. DNA staining indicates that high expression of Sid1C induces a SIN phenotype marked by long multinucleate cells (Fig.4A,panel 3) compared with cells expressing no insert (Fig. 4 A,panel 1) or Sid1N (Fig. 4 A, panel 2), which show normal division patterns. All cells grown in noninducing conditions as well as cells overproducing full-length Sid1p divide normally (data not shown). Cdc7p functions upstream of Sid1p in the SIN and localizes to the SPB just prior to Sid1p. The induction of Sid1C in strains that expressed chromosomal GFP-tagged versions of Cdc7p or Sid1p indicated that high expression of Sid1C specifically disrupts GFP-Sid1p localization (Fig. 4 B, panels 3 and4) but not Cdc7p-GFP (Fig. 4 B, panels 1 and 2). Sid1p is a group II PAK/GCK that binds Cdc14p and is required for cytokinesis in fission yeast (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Group II GCKs have an amino-terminal kinase domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain thought to be a regulatory region (1Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the case of Sid1p, we find that the carboxyl noncatalytic region of Sid1p contains the binding domain for Cdc14p, which is required for full Sid1p catalytic activity and intracellular localization. Thus the carboxyl terminus of Sid1p appears to have an important role in regulating Sid1p kinase activity and localization through binding Cdc14p. We favor a model in which Cdc14p binds the carboxyl terminus of Sid1p, and this alters the conformation of the carboxyl terminus such that it can be in a position to allow full activation of Sid1p kinase activity. This conformation is competent to localize to SPBs when signaled during late anaphase. Some GCK family members have autoinhibitory domains in their noncatalytic regulatory regions. It is possible that the function of Cdc14p is to bind a Sid1p autoinhibitory domain in the carboxyl terminus and relieve inhibition. However, we feel this is unlikely because the deletion of the carboxyl terminus or extreme carboxyl terminus of Sid1p does not stimulate the kinase activity of the protein when purified from S. pombe lysates. The observation that Sid1ΔC exhibits higher kinase activity than Sid1N may result from other endogenous factors that co-purify with and help to stabilize the protein. We observed that Sid1N and Sid1ΔC slightly rescue the weaksid1–239 allele, which contains a single amino acid change just outside the kinase domain, but not a sid1–125 allele, which contains a mutation within the kinase domain. One possible explanation of why Sid1N and Sid1ΔC can rescue sid1–239but not sid1–125 is that dimerization could occur between the weak mutant Sid1p and the kinase domain fragment, forming a functional enzyme, whereas the more severe mutation cannot be compensated for. It has been reported that some group II GCKs homodimerize (3Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); however, we have been unable to detect homodimerization of Sid1p (data not shown). Because thesid1–239 allele is significantly weaker thansid1–125, we suspect that simply overproducing the slightly active sid1N and sid1ΔC gene products with a slightly active sid1–239 gene product can result in synergistic complementation. The fact thatsid1–239 contains a single point mutation outside of the kinase domain supports this idea. Cdc14p is a novel protein with no significant homology to any other known protein (14Fankhauser C. Simanis V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Sid1p is in a complex with Cdc14p throughout the cell cycle, and the complex exhibits a modest peak in kinase activity around septation (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but until now little has been known about the biochemical role of Cdc14p in the SIN. Our observation that the domain in Sid1p that binds Cdc14p is also required for localization suggests that physical association of Cdc14p with the Sid1p carboxyl terminus is required for localization. Because both Sid1p and Cdc14p require each other to localize (7Guertin D.A. Chang L. Irshad F. Gould K.L. McCollum D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1803-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is possible that each subunit contacts an SPB component independently but only when both subunits are present. We also observe that Cdc14p is required for full Sid1p catalytic activityin vitro. Cdc14p may simply be required to structurally hold Sid1p in a conformation that can fully be activated. In addition, Cdc14p could provide substrate recognition information in vivo. Because Cdc14p is required for both full Sid1p catalytic activity and localization, it is interesting that Sid1p kinase activity is not required for localization in vivo. Perhaps Cdc14p has dual functions: one in maintaining Sid1p kinase in a state that can be fully active and another in contributing to SPB localization and/or substrate recognition. In this study, we have not only identified the carboxyl terminus of Sid1p as a regulatory domain required to bind Cdc14p but also characterized the previously unknown crucial role of Cdc14p in regulating both Sid1p kinase activity and localization. It will be interesting in future studies to determine whether the activation of Sid1p kinase activity and localization of the Sid1p/Cdc14p complex are mediated directly through Cdc14p or whether Cdc14p simply serves as a companion to Sid1p, required to maintain Sid1p in a fully functional state. Furthermore, Cdc14p is one of the first proteins known to interact with the carboxyl terminus of a group II GCK. It will be interesting to determine whether the carboxyl termini of other group II GCKs bind to proteins involved in the localization and activation of the kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2067931052,"Host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) is a cellular transcriptional coactivator which coordinates the assembly of enhancer complex through direct interactions with viral and cellular trans-activators such as VP16, Oct-1, LZIP, and GA-binding protein. These interactions are mediated by the beta-propeller domain comprising the first 380 residues of HCF-1 with six kelch repeats. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel HCF-like kelch repeat protein, designated HCLP-1. HCLP-1 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which is composed almost entirely of a six-bladed beta-propeller. HCLP-1 selectively interacts with LZIP but not with VP16. The physical interaction between HCLP-1 and LZIP leads to the repression of the LZIP-dependent transcription. The HCLP-1-binding domain of LZIP maps to residues 109-315, which contain the bZIP DNA-binding motif. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrates that HCLP-1 indeed interferes with the binding of LZIP to its DNA target. Thus, HCLP-1 serves a transcriptional co-repressor function mediated through its inhibitory interaction with the LZIP transcription factor. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for transcriptional regulation by HCF-like proteins."

Mencı́a M. Monsalve M. Salas M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 29-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and see Fig. 1). The transition between early and late transcription occurs 15–20 min postinfection when the late promoter A3 is activated, whereas early promoters A2b, A2c, and C2 become repressed. Two phage-encoded transcription regulators, proteins p4 and p6, are responsible for this transcriptional switch. In nonsuppressor bacteria infected with a nonsense mutant in gene 4, transcription from promoters A2b and A2c increases steadily as the infection goes on, and the activity of promoter A3 is almost undetectable (2Monsalve M. Mencı́a M. Rojo F. Salas M. Virology. 1995; 207: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the other hand, infection of nonsuppressor bacteria with a nonsense mutant in gene 6, sus6(626), shows a defect in the repression of early promoters, particularly promoter C2 (3Camacho A. Salas M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6927-6932Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, data obtained during the infection of suppressor bacteria with the sus6(626) mutant led to the proposal that repression of promoter C2 depends also on the amount of protein p6 synthesized. Under saturating concentrations of protein p6, the entire φ29 DNA molecule appeared as a continuous, uneven, and highly dynamic multiprotein complex (4Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 169-176Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the complex led to the proposal that p6 plays an architectural role in organizing the phage genome. The p6·nucleoprotein complexes formed at the genome ends are involved in different biological functions, such as activation of the initiation of DNA replication and repression of the transcription derived from promoter C2 (5Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Barthelemy I. Mellado R.P. Salas M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 460-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of p6 to form a multimeric nucleoprotein complex with the phage DNA enhances the function of p4 during the repression of early promoters A2b and A2c (7Elı́as-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the complex the DNA adopts a right-handed toroidal conformation winding around a core of protein p6 in which the DNA is remarkably curved, ∼66° every 12 bp1 (5Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), condensing the DNA up to 6-fold; this architectural alteration is likely to influence promoter C2 expression. On the other hand, repression of promoter activity depends on the rates at which repressor and RNA polymerase (RNAP) bind to their respective binding sites (8Lanzer M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 8973-8977Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Then competition between p6 and the RNAP for the sequence corresponding to promoter C2 might by crucial in the repression. We were interested to find out at what precise stage during transcription the observed inhibition occurs and what the underlying mechanism might be. Although nothing is known about the molecular mechanism by which p6 represses promoter C2, several alternative, although not mutually exclusive, models can be envisioned to explain the effect of p6 on promoter C2 activity: (i) the binding of p6 to the genome right end might occlude the promoter in the nucleoprotein complex; (ii) the p6-induced modification of promoter architecture might impair the RNAP bending needed for the formation of a stable transcription complex; (iii) protein p6 bound at the upstream sequence of the promoter might help to block transcription by impeding a postbinding step. In this work, we aimed to gain insight into the molecular bases of the repressive function of protein p6 on the C2 promoter. We show that the p6·DNA nucleoprotein complex does not seem to occlude the C2 promoter sequence to the RNAP but rather affects the stability of the closed complex. Bacillus subtilis RNAP was purified as described previously (9Sogo J.M. Inciarte M.R. Corral J. Viñuela E. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 127: 411-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein p6 was purified from bacteria infected with φ29 (10Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Garcı́a J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Unlabeled NTPs and dNTPs, [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 267-bp right terminal φ29 DNA fragment containing promoter C2 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification from full-length DNA with the synthetic primers (Isogen Bioscience): Primer-1: 5′-CTGTGTTTGTGTTGATGATGTC-3′ and Primer-2: 5′-GGCGCTTTAAAGTAGGGTACAGCGACAAC-3′. To label the DNA fragment at only one of the ends, the appropriate primer was treated with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP prior to the amplification reaction. The fragment was further purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. Binding reactions (10 µl) contained about 2 nm of a 5′-end-labeled 267-bp DNA fragment, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 µg of poly[d(I-C)], 1 µg of bovine serum albumin, and where indicated RNAP (70 nm) and/or protein p6 in the amounts indicated. The binding reaction was carried out at 4 °C for 15 min. Then 3 µl of 30% (v/v) glycerol was added to each sample before loading each reaction mixture onto a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 100 mm KCl. Electrophoresis was run at 25 mA/gel for 5 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and quantified by using a Fuji Bas-IIIs image analyzer. Binding reactions (10 µl) contained about 4 nm of end-labeled DNA (267 bp), 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 µg of poly[d(I-C)], 50 or 100 mm KCl, and where indicated protein p6 and/or RNAP in the amounts indicated. After 15–20 min of incubation at the indicated temperature, DNA was digested with RQ1-DNase I (Promega). When the reactions were carried out at 37 °C, DNA was digested at the same temperature with 0.05 units of DNase I for 2 min. When the closed complex was analyzed the assay was carried at 4 °C, and the DNA was digested at the same temperature for 5 min with 0.2 units of enzyme. Reactions were stopped by adding EDTA (10 mm) and 10 µg of tRNA. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Run-off transcription assays (25 µl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 µm each CTP, GTP, and ATP, 50 µm[α-32P]UTP (1 µCi), 1 µg of poly[d(I-C)], 10 units of RNasin, 4 nm of the 267-bp DNA fragment, and RNAP, protein p6, and salt where indicated in the amounts indicated. After 20 min at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.15% SDS and 2.5 mm EDTA. Nonincorporated NTPs were removed through Sephadex-G50 spin columns. Transcripts were precipitated with ethanol, resolved by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantified by using a Fuji Bas-IIIs image analyzer. Transcription from promoter C2 is salt-dependent. In the truncated transcription assay shown in Fig. 2, there was a stimulation of transcript production when the concentration of KCl increased. 12-fold more transcription was obtained when 200 mm KCl was added than in the absence of salt or when only 50 mm KCl was present. This salt-mediated activation seems to be favored by K+ ions because when NaCl was used instead only a 4-fold activation was observed, and the presence of ammonium sulfate did not affect the level of transcription. To gain insight into the step of the transcription favored by the K+ ions, closed and open complex formations were analyzed by band shift assays with the addition 50 or 200 mm KCl both in the reaction and in the gel solution. As shown in Fig. 3, no effect of the KCl was observed on closed complex formation at 4 °C. However, the RNAP·DNA complexes formed at 37 °C were favored by the increase of KCl concentration. At 200 mm KCl, up to 4-fold less RNAP was needed to form the same amount of RNAP·DNA complex; a similar result was obtained when 100 mm KCl was used (not shown).Figure 3Effect of KCl concentration on primary transcription complex formation at promoter C2. Shown is the quantitation of the transcription complexes formed at 4 °C or 37 °C with increasing amounts of RNAP in the presence of 50 or 200 mm KCl. Complexes were analyzed by gel retardation assay in 4% acrylamide, and the data was quantified using a Bas-IIIs image analyzer. The KCl was added to the assay and in the running gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Both low temperature (0 °C) and low salt concentrations greatly favor p6-DNA interaction (11Prieto I. Serrano M. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 314-318Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but these are not the best conditions for transcription at promoter C2 (see Fig. 2). Hence it was necessary to achieve conditions in which both transcription complexes and p6·DNA complexes could be formed. To this end, we analyzed the effect of KCl on the p6-mediated repression of promoter C2. In agreement with the data described above, up to 5-fold more truncated transcripts were obtained when the concentration of KCl was increased from 50 to 100 mm, and 15-fold more were obtained if the increase was up to 200 mm salt (Fig.4). On the other hand, the inhibition mediated by p6 was affected by the concentration of KCl. Transcription from promoter C2 was inhibited with 3.5 µm p6 in an assay containing 50 mm KCl, but 7 µm p6 was needed if the assay contained 100 mm KCl, and with 14 µm p6 only 2-fold inhibition was achieved in the presence of 200 mm salt. Because cations compete with proteins for DNA, the increased concentration of salt and more specifically the presence of KCl could affect the p6-mediated repression of promoter C2 by altering the binding capacity of the protein to DNA. Thus, the effect of KCl on the binding of both p6 and RNAP to the promoter was assayed by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 5). Protein p6 does not recognize a specific sequence on the viral DNA but exhibits a remarkable preference for two unrelated sequences, namednucleation sites, located between nucleotides 40–125 and 46–68 at the right and left phage genome ends, respectively (12Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Prieto I. Hermoso J.M. Salas M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1879-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The results showed that protein p6 cooperatively forms a nucleoprotein complex that could cover the 267-bp sequence of the genome right end used in this study, which includes promoter C2 with its +1 position located at 160 nucleotides from the end of the genome. Protein p6 binds the fragment including promoter C2 protecting the DNA strand with a characteristic pattern of strong hypersensitive bands every 24 bp. The pattern was identical at 50 and 100 mm KCl (Fig. 5,lanes d and h). RNA polymerase interacts with the late strand of promoter C2 protecting the sequence between positions −56 to +22 (Fig. 5, lanes b and f) with the resulting patterns again independent of the salt concentration used in this assay. However, a different picture was obtained when both proteins, p6 and RNAP, were added together. At 50 mm KCl, only the pattern corresponding to bound p6 was observed, whereas at 100 mm salt a mixed pattern of p6 and RNAP was present (Fig. 5, compare lane c with g). The RNAP bands at positions −37 and −29 could be observed over the regular pattern of bands between positions +14 and −132 because of p6 binding. It should be pointed out also the loss of the p6 pattern downstream position +14 (Fig. 5, compare lanes g and h). Taking into account these data and those described above, we used 100 mm KCl to study the effect of p6 on the transcriptional complex formation. We have analyzed the effect of the p6-derived nucleoprotein complex on the formation of transcription complexes at 4 °C and 37 °C. At 4 °C, only closed complex formation could be achieved, whereas at 37 °C the complex has been structurally characterized as open complex by probing with KMnO4 (data not shown). The DNase I footprints of the closed complexes indicated that RNAP contacts the late strand from approximately positions −37 to −5 and the early strand from positions −19 to +10 (Fig.6, lanes b and k). At 37 °C in the open complex, the RNAP binds both DNA strands also with a footprint of protections more extended toward the downstream promoter sequence (Fig. 6, compare lane b with fand lane k with o). Independently of the type of transcription complex formed, RNAP binding produced a specific hypersensitive band at position −37 in the late strand and at position −19 in the early strand, although it was more intense in the open complex footprint of the early strand. Protein p6 protected either DNA strand with the characteristic pattern of hypersensitivities every 24 bp similarly at either temperature (Fig. 6, lanes d, h, i, and m). When RNAP and p6 were added together and the assay was carried out at 37 °C, the RNAP-derived hypersensitivity at position −37 (late strand) and at position −19 (early strand) could be identified over the footprint pattern corresponding to p6 (Fig. 6, lanes g andn). This result suggests that RNAP is bound to the promoter with p6 attached to the DNA around the bound enzyme. However, at 4 °C, the RNAP-derived hypersensitive band at position −19 was greatly decreased, and the one located at −37 was almost undetectable (Fig. 6, lanes j and c), suggesting that p6 affects the closed complex but not the open complex. DNase I footprinting shows the binding positions of proteins to the sequence under study, but the bands in the footprints could potentially derive from a mixed population and therefore might not prove that both proteins are present on the same DNA molecule. To find out whether p6 affects the transcriptional closed complex, we analyzed the binding of RNAP to the DNA fragment containing the C2 promoter in the presence of increasing amounts of p6 by gel retardation assays at 4 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, independently of the concentration of p6 assayed, only a retarded DNA·protein complex can be observed, but the increase on protein concentration was reflected by differences on the relative mobility of the complexes (Fig. 7,lanes f–h). This result indicates that p6 will cooperatively bind along the fragment, and the differences in mobility might be due to the progressive occupation of the DNA fragment by the protein. However, because in this and other experiments always a unique band was obtained for each amount of protein used, most probably the architectural modification of the DNA upon binding of p6 is an additional factor responsible for the decreased mobility of the complex. RNAP, upon interaction with the C2 promoter, yields a retarded band corresponding to the transcriptional closed complex (Fig. 7,lane b). With increasing concentration of p6 the amount of closed complex formed was altered. At the lower concentration of p6, the reduced mobility of the transcriptional complex indicated additional binding of p6. However, increasing the amount of p6 from 7 to 10 µm results in the reduction of the intensity and mobility of the band containing RNAP·p6·DNA. Concomitant with the decrease of the p6·RNAP·DNA complexes, a new band most probably corresponding to p6·DNA complex appeared. Hence, we infer that progressive p6·DNA complex formation impairs the stability of the transcriptional closed complex. To get further insight into the RNAP and p6 mutual interaction, competition experiments varying either the relative amounts of p6/RNAP or the incubation time were carried out (Fig.8). In the absence of p6, 50 nm RNAP was sufficient to produce the DNase I footprint pattern characteristic of the transcriptional open complex (Fig. 8,lane b). When 7 µm p6 was added, the ratio of RNAP/p6 was determinant for transcriptional complex formation as could be deduced from the footprint patterns between positions −44 and +30 (Fig. 8, lanes g–i). In fact, at the lower concentration of RNAP, the footprint pattern corresponds to the p6·DNA complex except for the weak bands around position −19 that correspond to RNAP. However, raising the amount of the enzyme, the RNAP bands at position −19 became stronger, and the band at position −20 produced upon p6 binding became weaker, suggesting mutual competition between RNAP and p6 for the core promoter sequence. This competition was further studied by analyses of the complexes as a function of time (Fig. 8, lanes c–f). Here the patterns obtained indicated that mostly p6·DNA complexes were formed in the first 2 min of the reaction; however, after 4 min of incubation, RNAP seems to occupy the core position of promoter C2 surrounded by bound p6 dimers. A number of different regulatory functions have been assigned to protein p6. It has been characterized as an activator of the phage DNA initiation of replication and as a transcriptional regulator able to both activate late transcription and repress early promoters A2b and A2c in the presence of protein p4. In addition, protein p6 is the only factor required for repression of early promoter C2. For all these functions we are far from a molecular understanding of the mechanisms involved. Here we were interested in exploring some of the properties that make p6 an efficient transcriptional repressor of promoter C2. Protein p6 binds along the φ29 DNA molecule but exhibits preference for sequences at the genome ends called nucleation sites(10Pastrana R. Lázaro J.M. Blanco L. Garcı́a J.A. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3083-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Promoter C2 is located close to the genome right end with its −35 box adjacent to the nucleation site. Considering that the p6·DNA binding unit is formed by a protein dimer bound every 24 bp, the center of binding of the two monomers is flanked by DNase I-hypersensitive sites that are best explained as strong DNA bends (Fig. 5). Indeed it was demonstrated that the DNA in the p6·DNA complex is strongly bent (66° every 12 bp), untwisted (11.5 bp/turn), and compacted (5Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From its resistance to nucleases, we know that p6 binds to DNA immediately if enough protein is present 2A. Camacho, unpublished results. ; however, the apparent affinity constant (K eff 105m−1) of p6 for DNA and its cooperativity parameter (ω = 100) indicate that the complex is dynamic (4Gutiérrez C. Freire R. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 169-176Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All these characteristics are likely to influence the function of p6 as a transcriptional repressor of promoter C2. We have shown, by DNase I protection assays, the positions occupied when protein p6 is bound to promoter C2 (Figs. 5 and 6). To ensure the formation of the p6·nucleoprotein complex on every DNA molecule we had taken into account that the p6 units (dimers) are uniformly distributed along the 267-bp fragment containing the promoter, hence, that each DNA molecule should be saturated by about 12 dimers. Consequently in this study, we have used more than a 200-fold excess of p6 molecules with respect to DNA. Under these conditions the DNase I data indicate that p6 does not hide the promoter to the RNAP because a mixed footprint could be detected when the ternary complex RNAP·p6·DNA is allowed to form. Closed inspection (see Fig. 5, lane g) reveals that, when both RNAP and p6 are present, the footprint pattern obtained is not the average of the individual patterns. In fact, the hypersensitive bands at positions +14, −10, −29, −35, −37, and −59 are identical to the bands corresponding to the footprints of each of the proteins. Furthermore, RNAP seems to be able to displace p6 from the main core promoter and bind and form a transcriptional complex surrounded by p6 (Fig. 8). These results agree with the existence of the ternary p6·RNAP·DNA complex detected by gel retardation assay (Fig. 7). However, when the amount of p6 was increased, the RNAP was displaced from the transcriptional closed complex. This result is surprising if one considers that (i) the closed complex at promoter C2 is stable because at 4 °C it has a t 12 of 9 min (not shown), and (ii) the p6·DNA complex is unstable and has to be dynamic to cope with the DNA replication process occurring from this end of the genome. In fact, the low DNA binding constant of p6, the sensitivity of the p6·DNA complex to salt and temperature, and the high amount of protein p6 needed to form the complexes indicate unstable complexes. Therefore, we are tempted to speculate that it is not only the binding of p6 but also the p6-mediated bend at the promoter sequence that represses transcription. Recognition of promoter C2 by RNAP could occur as in the case of the lac UV5 promoter (13Buckle M. Pemberton I.K. Jacquet M.-A. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) where only the −35 region is contacted, leading to a stressed intermediate. The latter is relaxed when the extended closed complex footprint is formed by transferring the torsion stress to the DNA. Protein p6 could repress transcription by impeding this stress transference when the promoter is highly occupied by the repressor. The in vitro expression of promoter C2 is remarkably stimulated by the presence of salt, especially K+. Salt seems to favor specifically open complex formation at this promoter. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of protein p6 was also affected by the presence of K+. These results imply two possible effects of K+ on promoter C2 transcription: activation of the promoter transcription per se and modulation of the inhibitory effect of p6. A parallel case of K+ion-dependent regulation has been described for the H-NS-dependent repression of the Escherichia coli promoter proV of the proVWXoperon (14Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic transcription repression generally involves a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein whose binding site is close to a promoter sequence (15Rine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8309-8311Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Intimate contacts between the repressor and RNAP occur in many cases. In recent years, however, the role of nonsequence-specific DNA-binding proteins in repression of transcription has been well documented (16Adhya S. Geanacopoulos M. Lewis D.E.A. Roy S. Aki S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein p6 belongs to these so-called prokaryotic histone-like proteins, such as theE. coli proteins H-NS and HU (17Derlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein p6 is small (103 amino acids), very abundant, binds DNA in a nonsequence-specific manner preferentially to regions containing intrinsic curvature, produces the twist of the sequence, and generates high order DNA·multiprotein complexes (5Serrano M. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Serrano M. Salas M. Hermoso J.M. Science. 1990; 248: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarities between the mechanisms of HU, H-NS, and p6 actions are evident. Protein p6 acts as cofactor of the transcriptional regulator p4 in repression of the A2c promoter (7Elı́as-Arnanz M. Salas M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2502-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas HU represses GalR-mediated gal operon transcription (19Aki T. Choy H.E. Adhya S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein p6 is sufficient for repression of promoter C2, whereas H-NS represses proV promoter transcription initiation through its nonspecific binding to the upstream promoter sequence (14Ueguchi C. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recent results on the regulation of rRNA transcription modulated by FIS and H-NS indicate than in the absence of FIS, H-NS bound to the main promoter core sequence does not occlude the promoter to RNAP but impedes the transcriptional open complex (20Schröder O. Wagner R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 248-259Google Scholar). In this study we went a step further, demonstrating that the only element responsible for the repression of promoter C2, the multimeric p6·nucleoprotein complex, does not occlude the promoter sequence to RNAP but affects the transcriptional complex stability. We propose that a DNA domain with a precise topology is formed when p6 binds to certain regions of the phage DNA. In turn, p6-dependent changes in local DNA topology play a crucial role in transcription regulation. We thank Dr. F. Rojo for critical reading of the manuscript and J. M. Lázaro and L.
