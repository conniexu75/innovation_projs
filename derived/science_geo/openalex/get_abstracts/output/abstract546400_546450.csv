https://openalex.org/W2177873964,"The c-fos gene (also known as Fos) is induced by a broad range of stimuli and is a reliable marker for neural activity. Its induction mechanism and available reporter mouse lines are based exclusively on c-fos promoter activity. Here we demonstrate that multiple enhancers surrounding the c-fos gene are crucial for ensuring robust c-fos response to various stimuli. Membrane depolarization, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and forskolin activate distinct subsets of the enhancers to induce c-fos transcription in neurons, suggesting that stimulus-specific combinatorial activation of multiple enhancers underlies the broad inducibility of the c-fos gene. Accordingly, the functional requirement of key transcription factors varies depending on the type of stimulation. Combinatorial enhancer activation also occurs in the brain. Providing a comprehensive picture of the c-fos induction mechanism beyond the minimal promoter, our study should help in understanding the physiological nature of c-fos induction in relation to neural activity and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2177690692,"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are derived from thousands of loci in mammalian genomes and are frequently enriched in transposable elements (TEs). Although families of TE-derived lincRNAs have recently been implicated in the regulation of pluripotency, little is known of the specific functions of individual family members. Here we characterize three new individual TE-derived human lincRNAs, human pluripotency-associated transcripts 2, 3 and 5 (HPAT2, HPAT3 and HPAT5). Loss-of-function experiments indicate that HPAT2, HPAT3 and HPAT5 function in preimplantation embryo development to modulate the acquisition of pluripotency and the formation of the inner cell mass. CRISPR-mediated disruption of the genes for these lincRNAs in pluripotent stem cells, followed by whole-transcriptome analysis, identifies HPAT5 as a key component of the pluripotency network. Protein binding and reporter-based assays further demonstrate that HPAT5 interacts with the let-7 microRNA family. Our results indicate that unique individual members of large primate-specific lincRNA families modulate gene expression during development and differentiation to reinforce cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W2227016496,"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are conserved noncoding RNAs best studied as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) guides in RNA modification. To explore their role in cancer, we compared 5,473 tumor-normal genome pairs to identify snoRNAs with frequent copy number loss. The SNORD50A-SNORD50B snoRNA locus was deleted in 10-40% of 12 common cancers, where its loss was associated with reduced survival. A human protein microarray screen identified direct SNORD50A and SNORD50B RNA binding to K-Ras. Loss of SNORD50A and SNORD50B increased the amount of GTP-bound, active K-Ras and hyperactivated Ras-ERK1/ERK2 signaling. Loss of these snoRNAs also increased binding by farnesyltransferase to K-Ras and increased K-Ras prenylation, suggesting that KRAS mutation might synergize with SNORD50A and SNORD50B loss in cancer. In agreement with this hypothesis, CRISPR-mediated deletion of SNORD50A and SNORD50B in KRAS-mutant tumor cells enhanced tumorigenesis, and SNORD50A and SNORD50B deletion and oncogenic KRAS mutation co-occurred significantly in multiple human tumor types. SNORD50A and SNORD50B snoRNAs thus directly bind and inhibit K-Ras and are recurrently deleted in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2175546290,"TRIM protein family is an evolutionarily conserved gene family implicated in a number of critical processes including inflammation, immunity, antiviral and cancer. In an effort to profile the expression patterns of TRIM superfamily in several non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we found that the expression of 10 TRIM genes including TRIM3, TRIM7, TRIM14, TRIM16, TRIM21, TRIM22, TRIM29, TRIM59, TRIM66 and TRIM70 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with the normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line, whereas the expression of 7 other TRIM genes including TRIM4, TRIM9, TRIM36, TRIM46, TRIM54, TRIM67 and TRIM76 was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines compared with that in HBE cells. As TRIM59 has been reported to act as a proto-oncogene that affects both Ras and RB signal pathways in prostate cancer models, we here focused on the role of TRIM59 in the regulation of NSCLC cell proliferation and migration. We reported that TRIM59 protein was significantly increased in various NSCLC cell lines. SiRNA-induced knocking down of TRIM59 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of NSCLC cell lines by arresting cell cycle in G2 phase. Moreover, TRIM59 knocking down affected the expression of a number of cell cycle proteins including CDC25C and CDK1. Finally, we knocked down TRIM59 and found that p53 protein expression levels did not upregulate, so we proposed that TRIM59 may promote NSCLC cell growth through other pathways but not the p53 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2180878079,"Genetic profiling represents the future of neuro-oncology but suffers from inadequate biopsies in heterogeneous tumors like Glioblastoma (GBM). Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) targets enhancing core (ENH) but yields adequate tumor in only ~60% of cases. Further, CE-MRI poorly localizes infiltrative tumor within surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain-around-tumor (BAT), despite the importance of characterizing this tumor segment, which universally recurs. In this study, we use multiple texture analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze multi-parametric MRI, and produce new images indicating tumor-rich targets in GBM.We recruited primary GBM patients undergoing image-guided biopsies and acquired pre-operative MRI: CE-MRI, Dynamic-Susceptibility-weighted-Contrast-enhanced-MRI, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Following image coregistration and region of interest placement at biopsy locations, we compared MRI metrics and regional texture with histologic diagnoses of high- vs low-tumor content (≥80% vs <80% tumor nuclei) for corresponding samples. In a training set, we used three texture analysis algorithms and three ML methods to identify MRI-texture features that optimized model accuracy to distinguish tumor content. We confirmed model accuracy in a separate validation set.We collected 82 biopsies from 18 GBMs throughout ENH and BAT. The MRI-based model achieved 85% cross-validated accuracy to diagnose high- vs low-tumor in the training set (60 biopsies, 11 patients). The model achieved 81.8% accuracy in the validation set (22 biopsies, 7 patients).Multi-parametric MRI and texture analysis can help characterize and visualize GBM's spatial histologic heterogeneity to identify regional tumor-rich biopsy targets."
https://openalex.org/W2175952723,"The number of ambulatory patients seeking treatment for skin and skin structure infections (SSSI) are increasing. The objective of this study is to determine recent trends in hospital admissions and healthcare resource utilization and identify covariates associated with hospital costs and mortality for hospitalized adult patients with a primary SSSI diagnosis in the United States.We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis (years 2005-2011) of data from the US Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample. Recent trends, patient characteristics, and healthcare resource utilization for patients hospitalized with a primary SSSI diagnosis were evaluated. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted to assess patient and hospital characteristics.A total of 1.8% of hospital admissions for the years 2005 through 2011 were for adult patients with a SSSI primary diagnosis. SSSI-related hospital admissions significantly changed during the study period (P < .001 for trend) ranging from 1.6% (in 2005) to 2.0% (in 2011). Mean hospital length of stay (LOS) decreased from 5.4 days in the year 2005 to 5.0 days in the year 2011 (overall change, P < .001) with no change in hospital costs. Patients with postoperative wound infections had the longest hospital stays (adjusted mean, 5.81 days; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.80-5.83) and highest total costs (adjusted mean, $9388; 95% CI, $9366-$9410). Year of hospital admission was strongly associated with mortality; infection type, all patient refined diagnosis related group severity of illness level, and LOS were strongly associated with hospital costs.Hospital admissions for adult patients in the United States with a SSSI primary diagnosis continue to increase. Decreasing hospital inpatient LOS and mortality rate may be due to improved early treatment. Future research should focus on identifying alternative treatment processes for patients with SSSI that could shift management from inpatient to outpatient treatment settings."
https://openalex.org/W2200960418,"DNA lesions encountered by replicative polymerases threaten genome stability and cell cycle progression. Here we report the identification of mutations in TRAIP, encoding an E3 RING ubiquitin ligase, in patients with microcephalic primordial dwarfism. We establish that TRAIP relocalizes to sites of DNA damage, where it is required for optimal phosphorylation of H2AX and RPA2 during S-phase in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, as well as fork progression through UV-induced DNA lesions. TRAIP is necessary for efficient cell cycle progression and mutations in TRAIP therefore limit cellular proliferation, providing a potential mechanism for microcephaly and dwarfism phenotypes. Human genetics thus identifies TRAIP as a component of the DNA damage response to replication-blocking DNA lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2173733785,"Non-peptidic thrombin inhibitors (TIs; 177 compounds) with diverse groups at motifs P1 (such as oxyguanidine, amidinohydrazone, amidine, amidinopiperidine), P2 (such as cyanofluorophenylacetamide, 2-(2-chloro-6-fluorophenyl)acetamide), and P3 (such as phenylethyl, arylsulfonate groups) were studied using molecular modeling to analyze their interactions with S1, S2, and S3 subsites of the thrombin binding site. Firstly, a protocol combining docking and three dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship was performed. We described the orientations and preferred active conformations of the studied inhibitors, and derived a predictive CoMSIA model including steric, donor hydrogen bond, and acceptor hydrogen bond fields. Secondly, the dynamic behaviors of some selected TIs (compounds 26, 133, 147, 149, 162, and 177 in this manuscript) that contain different molecular features and different activities were analyzed by creating the solvated models and using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We used the conformational structures derived from MD to accomplish binding free energetic calculations using MM-GBSA. With this analysis, we theorized about the effect of van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions and solvation in the potency of TIs. In general, the contents reported in this article help to understand the physical and chemical characteristics of thrombin-inhibitor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2267877576,"DEAD-box proteins utilize ATP to bind and remodel RNA and RNA-protein complexes. All DEAD-box proteins share a conserved core that consists of two RecA-like domains. The core is flanked by subfamily-specific extensions of idiosyncratic function. The Ded1/DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box proteins is of particular interest as members function during protein translation, are essential for viability, and are frequently altered in human malignancies. Here, we define the function of the subfamily-specific extensions of the human DEAD-box protein DDX3. We describe the crystal structure of the subfamily-specific core of wild-type DDX3 at 2.2 Å resolution, alone and in the presence of AMP or nonhydrolyzable ATP. These structures illustrate a unique interdomain interaction between the two ATPase domains in which the C-terminal domain clashes with the RNA-binding surface. Destabilizing this interaction accelerates RNA duplex unwinding, suggesting that it is present in solution and inhibitory for catalysis. We use this core fragment of DDX3 to test the function of two recurrent medulloblastoma variants of DDX3 and find that both inactivate the protein in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results redefine the structural and functional core of the DDX3 subfamily of DEAD-box proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2175890235,"The Jaffe and enzymatic methods are the two most common methods for measuring serum creatinine. The Jaffe method is less expensive than the enzymatic method but is also more susceptible to interferences. Interferences can lead to misdiagnosis but interferences may vary by patient population. The overall risk associated with the Jaffe method depends on the probability of misclassification and the consequences of misclassification. This study assessed the risk associated with the Jaffe method in an outpatient population. We analyzed the discordance rate in the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine measurements obtained by the Jaffe and enzymatic method.Method comparison and risk analysis. Five hundred twenty-nine eGFRs obtained by the Jaffe and enzymatic method were compared at four clinical decision limits. We determined the probability of discordance and the consequence of misclassification at each decision limit to evaluate the overall risk.We obtained 529 paired observations. Of these, 29 (5.5%) were discordant with respect to one of the decision limits (i.e. 15, 30, 45 or 60 ml/min/1.73m2). The magnitude of the differences (Jaffe result minus enzymatic result) were significant relative to analytical variation in 21 of the 29 (72%) of the discordant results. The magnitude of the differences were not significant relative to biological variation. The risk associated with misclassification was greatest at the 60 ml/min/1.73m2 decision limit because the probability of misclassification and the potential for adverse outcomes were greatest at that decision limit.The Jaffe method is subject to bias due to interfering substances (loss of analytical specificity). The risk of misclassification is greatest at the 60 ml/min/1.73m2 decision limit; however, the risk of misclassification due to bias is much less than the risk of misclassification due to biological variation. The Jaffe method may pose low risk in selected populations if eGFR results near the 60 ml/min/1.73m2 decision limit are interpreted with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2175239220,"Rap1A is a member of small G proteins belonging to the Ras family. Recently, an integration of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression profiling study revealed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within human Rap1A were strongly associated with narrow neck width in women. However, the regulatory role of Rap1A in osteoblasts remains to be elucidated. Here we report that Rap1A is a key regulator in osteoblast differentiation. Rap1A expression and activity were gradually enhanced during the induced differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells (C2C12) and preosteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). Knockdown of endogenous Rap1A significantly inhibited the osteogenic marker gene expression and matrix mineralization in cells with osteogenesis. In addition, knockdown of endogenous Rap1A suppressed the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), while overexpression of Rap1A accelerated osteoblast differentiation and enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK and p38. Taken together, our study suggests that Rap1A regulates osteoblast differentiation through modulating the ERK/p38 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2172673923,"The present study addressed whether the combination of metformin and ionizing radiation (IR) would show enhanced antitumor effects in radioresistant p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells, focusing on repair pathways for IR-induced DNA damage. Metformin caused a higher reduction in clonogenic survival as well as greater radiosensitization and inhibition of tumor growth of p53-/- than of p53+/+ colorectal cancer cells and xenografts. Metformin combined with IR induced accumulation of tumor cells in the G2/M phase and delayed the repair of IR-induced DNA damage. In addition, this combination significantly decreased levels of p53-related homologous recombination (HR) repair compared with IR alone, especially in p53-/- colorectal cancer cells and tumors. In conclusion, metformin enhanced radiosensitivity by inducing G2/M arrest and reducing the expression of DNA repair proteins even in radioresistant HCT116 p53-/- colorectal cancer cells and tumors. Our study provides a scientific rationale for the clinical use of metformin as a radiosensitizer in patients with p53-deficient colorectal tumors, which are often resistant to radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2173419199,"Diabetes is accompanied by a marked reduction in patient's quality of life (QOL) and leads to higher disability-adjusted life years than most diseases. Depression further deteriorates QOL and is associated with poor treatment outcomes and lowered glycemic control in diabetes. We analysed the QOL and depression among the people living with diabetes in Nepal.We conducted a cross-sectional survey among a random sample of 157 diabetic patients visiting diabetes clinic at a major teaching hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. We administered the Nepali version of WHO-BREF for face to face interviews to obtain data on QOL scores. The Nepali version of Patient Health Questionnaire-9was also used to record responses on depression items.More than half of the respondents (54.1%) experienced depression with mean PHQ-9 score of 6.15 ± 5.01 on a scale of 0-27. On a scale of 0 to 100, highest QOL mean score was reported in social relationship domain (57.32 ± 11.83), followed by environment domain (54.71 ± 7.74), psychological health (53.25 ± 10.32) and physical health (50.74 ± 11.83). After adjusting for other covariates, urban residence decreased the physical health score by 4.74 (β = -4.74, 95% CI: -8.664,-0.821), social relationship domain score by 3.420 (β = -3.420, 95% CI: -6.433,-0.406) and the overall QOL by 2.773 (β = -2.773, 95% CI: -5.295,-0.252). Having diagnosed with diabetes since more than 10 years increased physical health by 5.184 score points (β = 5.184; 95% CI: 0.753, 9.615).Similarly, having severe depression decreased social relation domain score by 6.053 (β = -6.053, 95% CI:-11.169,-.936).Having urban residence significantly decreased the physical health and social relation domain scores as well as the overall QOL scores. Similarly, having diagnosed since more than 10 years increased physical health domain score. Severe depression decreased social relationship domain score. Since depression affects QOL, we suggest early diagnosis and prompt treatment of depression in T2DM people as part of their routine primary care in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W2219110856,"Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development and plasticity through mechanisms that include trans-synaptic adhesion and recruitment of diverse synaptic proteins. We found that the immunoglobulin superfamily member 11 (IgSF11), a homophilic adhesion molecule that preferentially expressed in the brain, is a dual-binding partner of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs). IgSF11 required PSD-95 binding for its excitatory synaptic localization. In addition, IgSF11 stabilized synaptic AMPARs, as determined by IgSF11 knockdown-induced suppression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission and increased surface mobility of AMPARs, measured by high-throughput, single-molecule tracking. IgSF11 deletion in mice led to the suppression of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus and long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. IgSF11 did not regulate the functional characteristics of AMPARs, including desensitization, deactivation or recovery. These results suggest that IgSF11 regulates excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity through its tripartite interactions with PSD-95 and AMPARs."
https://openalex.org/W2179154122,"Objective Acute care readmission risk is an increasingly recognized problem that has garnered significant attention, yet the reasons for acute care readmission in the inpatient rehabilitation population are complex and likely multifactorial. Information on both medical comorbidities and functional status is routinely collected for stroke patients participating in inpatient rehabilitation. We sought to determine whether functional status is a more robust predictor of acute care readmissions in the inpatient rehabilitation stroke population compared with medical comorbidities using a large, administrative data set. Methods A retrospective analysis of data from the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation from the years 2002 to 2011 was performed examining stroke patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation facilities. A Basic Model for predicting acute care readmission risk based on age and functional status was compared with models incorporating functional status and medical comorbidities (Basic-Plus) or models including age and medical comorbidities alone (Age-Comorbidity). C-statistics were compared to evaluate model performance. Findings There were a total of 803,124 patients: 88,187 (11%) patients were transferred back to an acute hospital: 22,247 (2.8%) within 3 days, 43,481 (5.4%) within 7 days, and 85,431 (10.6%) within 30 days. The C-statistics for the Basic Model were 0.701, 0.672, and 0.682 at days 3, 7, and 30 respectively. As compared to the Basic Model, the best-performing Basic-Plus model was the Basic+Elixhauser model with C-statistics differences of +0.011, +0.011, and + 0.012, and the best-performing Age-Comorbidity model was the Age+Elixhauser model with C-statistic differences of -0.124, -0.098, and -0.098 at days 3, 7, and 30 respectively. Conclusions Readmission models for the inpatient rehabilitation stroke population based on functional status and age showed better predictive ability than models based on medical comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2265727213,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an important regulator of osteoblast function and is the only anabolic therapy currently approved for treatment of osteoporosis. The PTH receptor (PTH1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that signals via multiple G proteins including Gsα. Mice expressing a constitutively active mutant PTH1R exhibited a dramatic increase in trabecular bone that was dependent upon expression of Gsα in the osteoblast lineage. Postnatal removal of Gsα in the osteoblast lineage (P-GsαOsxKO mice) yielded markedly reduced trabecular and cortical bone mass. Treatment with anabolic PTH(1–34) (80 μg/kg/day) for 4 weeks failed to increase trabecular bone volume or cortical thickness in male and female P-GsαOsxKO mice. Surprisingly, in both male and female mice, PTH administration significantly increased osteoblast numbers and bone formation rate in both control and P-GsαOsxKO mice. In mice that express a mutated PTH1R that activates adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA) via Gsα but not phospholipase C via Gq/11 (D/D mice), PTH significantly enhanced bone formation, indicating that phospholipase C activation is not required for increased bone turnover in response to PTH. Therefore, although the anabolic effect of intermittent PTH treatment on trabecular bone volume is blunted by deletion of Gsα in osteoblasts, PTH can stimulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Together these findings suggest that alternative signaling pathways beyond Gsα and Gq/11 act downstream of PTH on osteoblast differentiation.

Osteoporosis is one of the most common degenerative diseases of aging with an estimated 50% of postmenopausal women and 25% of older men at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture and economic costs exceeding $19 billion annually in the United States (1Burge R. Dawson-Hughes B. Solomon D.H. Wong J.B. King A. Tosteson A. Incidence and economic burden of osteoporosis-related fractures in the United States, 2005–2025.J. Bone Miner.

The low bone mass underlying osteoporosis results from an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption that leads to bone loss that becomes more pronounced with age (2Raisz L.G. Pathogenesis of osteoporosis: concepts, conflicts, and prospects.J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar).

Gsα is required for commitment of mesenchymal progenitors to the osteoblast lineage rather than the adipocyte lineage, likely mediated at least in part by alterations in Wnt signaling (33Sinha P.

Constitutive activation of Gs-dependent signaling in osteoblasts throughout embryogenesis results in a dramatic increase in trabecular bone volume (28Hsiao E.C. Boudignon B.M. Chang W.C. Bencsik M.

Halloran B.P. Nissenson R.A. Conklin B.R. Gs G protein-coupled receptor signaling in osteoblasts elicits age-dependent effects on bone formation.J. Bone Miner.

Therefore Gsα-dependent signaling may have different functions during embryogenesis compared with postnatal skeletal homeostasis. Mice with Gsα deleted throughout embryonic development in Osx-expressing osteoprogenitors die before weaning (35Wu J.Y. Aarnisalo P. Bastepe M. Sinha P. Fulzele K. Selig M.K. Chen M. Poulton I.J.

Investig. 2011; 121: 3492-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By administering doxycycline to suppress the expression of Cre recombinase, we delayed ablation of Gsα in the osteoblast lineage until birth (postnatal or P-GsαOsxKO mice), allowing us to examine the role of Gsα in osteoblasts in the postnatal skeleton. Here we report that Gsα is required for the high trabecular bone mass observed with constitutive activation of PTH1R. P-GsαOsxKO mice have severe osteoporosis, and when treated with anabolic PTH, there was no increase in trabecular bone volume or cortical thickness. However, osteoblast numbers and bone formation rate still increased along the trabecular surface of P-GsαOsxKO mice. We also examined the effects of anabolic PTH on PLC-defective mutant (D/D) mice that express only a mutated PTH1R that activates adenylyl cyclase normally but cannot activate PLC and found that PTH significantly increased almost all parameters of bone formation in tibiae of both wild type (WT) and D/D mice. Together these data demonstrate the involvement of other downstream mediators beyond activation of PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) in the anabolic action of PTH. Generation of GsαOsxKO mice has been described previously (34Wu J.Y. Purton L.E. Rodda S.J. Chen M. Weinstein L.S. McMahon A.P. Scadden D.T. Kronenberg H.M.

https://openalex.org/W2173195894,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein receptors 1 and 2 (LRP1 and LRP2) are emerging as important cell signaling mediators in modulating neuronal growth and repair. We examined whether LRP1 and LRP2 are able to mediate a specific aspect of neuronal growth: axon guidance. We sought to identify LRP1 and LRP2 ligands that could induce axonal chemoattraction, which might have therapeutic potential. Using embryonic sensory neurons (rat dorsal root ganglia) in a growth cone turning assay, we tested a range of LRP1 and LRP2 ligands for the ability to guide growth cone navigation. Three ligands were chemorepulsive: α-2-macroglobulin, tissue plasminogen activator, and metallothionein III. Conversely, only one LRP ligand, metallothionein II, was found to be chemoattractive. Chemoattraction toward a gradient of metallothionein II was calcium-dependent, required the expression of both LRP1 and LRP2, and likely involves further co-receptors such as the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor. The potential for LRP-mediated chemoattraction to mediate axonal regeneration was examined in vivo in a model of chemical denervation in adult rats. In these in vivo studies, metallothionein II was shown to enhance epidermal nerve fiber regeneration so that it was complete within 7 days compared with 14 days in saline-treated animals. Our data demonstrate that both LRP1 and LRP2 are necessary for metallothionein II-mediated chemotactic signal transduction and that they may form part of a signaling complex. Furthermore, the data suggest that LRP-mediated chemoattraction represents a novel, non-classical signaling system that has therapeutic potential as a disease-modifying agent for the injured peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2176076766,"Learning a motor task with temporally spaced presentations or with other tasks intermixed between presentations reduces performance during training, but can enhance retention post training. These two effects are known as the spacing and contextual interference effect, respectively. Here, we aimed at testing a unifying hypothesis of the spacing and contextual interference effects in visuomotor adaptation, according to which forgetting between trials due to either spaced presentations or interference by another task will promote between-trial forgetting, which will depress performance during acquisition, but will promote retention. We first performed an experiment with three visuomotor adaptation conditions: a short inter-trial-interval (ITI) condition (SHORT-ITI); a long ITI condition (LONG-ITI); and an alternating condition with two alternated opposite tasks (ALT), with the same single-task ITI as in LONG-ITI. In the SHORT-ITI condition, there was fastest increase in performance during training and largest immediate forgetting in the retention tests. In contrast, in the ALT condition, there was slowest increase in performance during training and little immediate forgetting in the retention tests. Compared to these two conditions, in the LONG-ITI, we found intermediate increase in performance during training and intermediate immediate forgetting. To account for these results, we fitted to the data six possible adaptation models with one or two time scales, and with interference in the fast, or in the slow, or in both time scales. Model comparison confirmed that two time scales and some degree of interferences in either time scale are needed to account for our experimental results. In summary, our results suggest that retention following adaptation is modulated by the degree of between-trial forgetting, which is due to time-based decay in single adaptation task and interferences in multiple adaptation tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2172715200,"The post-translational protein modification O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a proposed nutrient sensor that has been shown to regulate multiple biological pathways. This dynamic and inducible enzymatic modification to intracellular proteins utilizes the end product of the nutrient sensing hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, UDP-GlcNAc, as its substrate donor. Type II diabetic patients have elevated O-GlcNAc-modified proteins within pancreatic beta cells due to chronic hyperglycemia-induced glucose overload, but a molecular role for O-GlcNAc within beta cells remains unclear. Using directed pharmacological approaches in the mouse insulinoma-6 (Min6) cell line, we demonstrate that elevating nuclear O-GlcNAc increases intracellular insulin levels and preserves glucose-stimulated insulin secretion during chronic hyperglycemia. The molecular mechanism for these observed changes appears to be, at least in part, due to elevated O-GlcNAc-dependent increases in Ins1 and Ins2 mRNA levels via elevations in histone H3 transcriptional activation marks. Furthermore, RNA deep sequencing reveals that this mechanism of altered gene transcription is restricted and that the majority of genes regulated by elevated O-GlcNAc levels are similarly regulated by a shift from euglycemic to hyperglycemic conditions. These findings implicate the O-GlcNAc modification as a potential mechanism for hyperglycemic-regulated gene expression in the beta cell."
https://openalex.org/W2175677383,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway that is involved in plant development and stress responses. As the first component of this phosphorelay cascade, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) act as adaptors linking upstream signaling steps to the core MAPK cascade to promote the appropriate cellular responses; however, the functions of MAPKKKs in maize are unclear. Here, we identified 71 MAPKKK genes, of which 14 were novel, based on a computational analysis of the maize (Zea mays L.) genome. Using an RNA-seq analysis in the leaf, stem and root of maize under well-watered and drought-stress conditions, we identified 5,866 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 8 MAPKKK genes responsive to drought stress. Many of the DEGs were enriched in processes such as drought stress, abiotic stimulus, oxidation-reduction, and metabolic processes. The other way round, DEGs involved in processes such as oxidation, photosynthesis, and starch, proline, ethylene, and salicylic acid metabolism were clearly co-expressed with the MAPKKK genes. Furthermore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to assess the relative expression levels of MAPKKKs. Correlation analysis revealed that there was a significant correlation between expression levels of two MAPKKKs and relative biomass responsive to drought in 8 inbred lines. Our results indicate that MAPKKKs may have important regulatory functions in drought tolerance in maize."

Using three different strains of mouse (BALB/c, C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN), we show that a single vaccination results in induction of both CD4 and CD8 T cells, displaying capacity to produce multiple cytokines together with cytolytic activity targeting a large array of epitopes. As expected, dominance of responses was linked to the mouse haplotype although for a given haplotype, responses specific of at least one antigen per phase could always be detected. Vaccination of non-human primates with the 14 antigens MVA-TB candidate resulted in broad and potent cellular-based immunogenicity. The remarkable plasticity of MVA opens the road to development of a novel class of highly complex recombinant TB vaccines to be evaluated in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings."

However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear.Malignant stromal cells induced by glioma stem/progenitor cell 2 (GSC-induced host brain tumor cells, ihBTC2) were isolated and identified from the double color-coded orthotopic glioma nude mouse model. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was used to evaluate the radiation resistance of ihBTC2, the human glioma stem/progenitor cell line SU3 and its radiation-resistant sub-strain SU3-5R and the rat C6 glioma cell line. The mRNA of Notch 1 and Hes1 from ihBTC2 cells were detected using qPCR before and after 4 Gy radiation. The expression of the Notch 1, pAkt and Bcl-2 proteins were investigated by Western blot. To confirm the role of the Notch pathway in the radiation resistance of ihBTC2, Notch signaling blocker gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) were used.The ihBTC2 cells had malignant phenotypes, such as infinite proliferation, hyperpentaploid karyotype, tumorigenesis in nude mice and expression of protein markers of oligodendroglia cells. The SF2 of ihBTC2 cells was significantly higher than that of any other cell line (P<0.05, n = 3). The expression of Notch 1 and Hes1 mRNAs from ihBTC2 cells was significantly increased after radiation. Moreover, the Notch 1, pAkt and Bcl-2 proteins were significantly increased after radiation (P<0.05, n = 3). Inhibition of Notch signaling markedly enhanced the radiosensitivity of ihBTC2 cells.In an orthotopic glioma model, the malignant transformation of host stromal cells was induced by glioma stem/progenitor cells. IhBTC2 cells are more radiation-resistant than the glioma stem/progenitor cells, which may be mediated by activation of the Notch signaling pathway."

However, slow accumulation of Fe3O4 NPs by magnets may limit broad applications of Fe3O4 NP-based nanomaterials. In this study, we report fabrication of Fe3O4 NPs double-layered silica nanoparticles (DL MNPs) with a silica core and highly packed Fe3O4 NPs layers. The DL MNPs had a superparamagnetic property and efficient accumulation kinetics under an external magnetic field. Moreover, the magnetic field-exposed DL MNPs show quantitative accumulation, whereas Fe3O4 NPs single-layered silica nanoparticles (SL MNPs) and silica-coated Fe3O4 NPs produced a saturated plateau under full recovery of the NPs. DL MNPs are promising nanomaterials with great potential to separate and analyze biomolecules."
https://openalex.org/W2174314301,"Ferredoxin (Fd) protein as unique electron acceptor, involved in a variety of fundamental metabolic and signaling processes, which is indispensable for plant growth. The molecular mechanisms of Fd such as regulation of electron partitioning, impact of photosynthetic rate and involvement in the carbon fixing remain elusive in rice. Here we reported a heading date delay and yellowish leaf 1 (hdy1) mutant derived from Japonica rice cultivar “Nipponbare” subjected to EMS treatment. In the paddy field, the hdy1 mutant appeared at a significantly late heading date and had yellow-green leaves during the whole growth stage. Further investigation indicated that the abnormal phenotype of hdy1 was connected with depressed pigment content and photosynthetic rate. Genetic analysis results showed that the hdy1 mutant phenotype was caused by a single recessive nuclear gene mutation. Map-based cloning revealed that OsHDY1 is located on chromosome 3 and encodes an ortholog of the AtFdC2 gene. Complementation and overexpression, transgenic plants exhibited the mutant phenotype including head date, leaf color and the transcription levels of the FdC2 were completely rescued by transformation with OsHDY1. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression product of OsHDY1 was detected in almost all of the organs except root, whereas highest expression levels were observed in seeding new leaves. The lower expression levels of HDY1 and content of iron were detected in hdy1 than WT’s. The FdC2::GFP was detected in the chloroplasts of rice. Real-time PCR results showed that the expression of many photosynthetic electron transfer related genes in hdy1 were higher than WT. Our results suggest that OsFdC2 plays an important role in photosynthetic rate and development of heading date by regulating electron transfer and chlorophyll content in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2173825152,"14-3-3s are a class of conserved regulatory proteins ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, which play important roles in a variety of cellular processes including response to diverse stresses. Although much has been learned about 14-3-3s in several plant species, it remains unknown in common bean. In this study, 9 common bean 14-3-3s (PvGF14s) were identified by exhaustive data mining against the publicly available common bean genomic database. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that each predicted PvGF14 was clustered with two GmSGF14 paralogs from soybean. Both epsilon-like and non-epsilon classes of PvGF14s were found in common bean, and the PvGF14s belonging to each class exhibited similar gene structure. Among 9 PvGF14s, only 8 are transcribed in common bean. Expression patterns of PvGF14s varied depending on tissue type, developmental stage and exposure of plants to stress. A protein-protein interaction study revealed that PvGF14a forms dimer with itself and with other PvGF14 isoforms. This study provides a first comprehensive look at common bean 14-3-3 proteins, a family of proteins with diverse functions in many cellular processes, especially in response to stresses."

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the PNPLA3-gene is associated with development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and a worse outcome in alcoholic liver disease. However, the role of PNPLA3 rs738409 SNP on liver fibrosis and steatosis, portal hypertension, and virological response in HIV/HCV coinfection remains unclear.In this cross-sectional study PNPLA3 (rs738409) and IL28B (rs12979860) SNPs were determined in 177 HIV/HCV coinfected patients. Liver fibrosis and steatosis-staged by liver biopsy and transient elastography using the Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP)-and portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient, HVPG) were compared across PNPLA3 genotypes.75 (42.4%) patients tested positive for a PNPLA3 minor/major risk allele (G/C:66; G/G:9) showed comparable fibrosis stages (median F2 vs. F2; p = 0.292) and similar amounts of hepatic steatosis (CAP: 203.5 ± 41.9 vs. 215.5 ± 59.7 dB/m; p = 0.563) as compared to patients without a PNPLA3 risk allele. Advanced liver fibrosis was neither associated with PNPLA3 (p = 0.253) nor IL28B-genotype (p = 0.628), but with HCV-GT3 (p = 0.003), higher BMI (p = 0.008) and higher age (p = 0.007). Fibrosis progression rate (0.27 ± 0.41 vs. 0.20 ± 0.26 units/year; p = 0.984) and HVPG (3.9 ± 2.6 vs. 4.4 ± 3.0 mmHg; p = 0.472) were similar in patients with and without PNPLA3 risk alleles. SVR rates to PEGIFN/RBV therapy were similar across PNPLA3 genotypes.The presence of a PNPLA3 risk allele had no independent impact on liver disease or virological response rates to PEGIFN/RBV therapy in our cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected patients."
https://openalex.org/W2176454978,"Epidemic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found worldwide among the cystic fibrosis (CF) patient population. Using pulse-field gel electrophoresis, the Prairie Epidemic Strain (PES) has recently been found in one-third of patients attending the Calgary Adult CF Clinic in Canada. Using multi-locus sequence typing, PES isolates from unrelated patients were found to consistently have ST192. Though most patients acquired PES prior to enrolling in the clinic, some patients were observed to experience strain replacement upon transitioning to the clinic whereby local non-epidemic P. aeruginosa isolates were displaced by PES. Here we genotypically and phenotypically compared PES to other P. aeruginosa epidemic strains (OES) found around the world as well as local non-epidemic CF P. aeruginosa isolates in order to characterize PES. Since some epidemic strains are associated with worse clinical outcomes, we assessed the pathogenic potential of PES to determine if these isolates are virulent, shared properties with OES, and if its phenotypic properties may offer a competitive advantage in displacing local non-epidemic isolates during strain replacement. As such, we conducted a comparative analysis using fourteen phenotypic traits, including virulence factor production, biofilm formation, planktonic growth, mucoidy, and antibiotic susceptibility to characterize PES, OES, and local non-epidemic isolates. We observed that PES and OES could be differentiated from local non-epidemic isolates based on biofilm growth with PES isolates being more mucoid. Pairwise comparisons indicated that PES produced significantly higher levels of proteases and formed better biofilms than OES but were more susceptible to antibiotic treatment. Amongst five patients experiencing strain replacement, we found that super-infecting PES produced lower levels of proteases and elastases but were more resistant to antibiotics compared to the displaced non-epidemic isolates. This comparative analysis is the first to be completed on a large scale between groups of epidemic and non-epidemic CF P. aeruginosa isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2252515498,"TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates cell proliferation, cell immortalization, and cell death, acting as a key homeostatic mediator in various cell types and tissues. Autophagy is a programmed mechanism that plays a pivotal role in controlling cell fate and, consequently, many physiological and pathological processes, including carcinogenesis. Although autophagy is often considered a pro-survival mechanism that renders cells viable in stressful conditions and thus might promote tumor growth, emerging evidence suggests that autophagy is also a tumor suppressor pathway. The relationship between TGFβ signaling and autophagy is context-dependent and remains unclear. TGFβ-mediated activation of autophagy has recently been suggested to contribute to the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ in hepatocarcinoma cells. In the present study, we define a novel process of TGFβ-mediated autophagy in cancer cell lines of various origins. We found that autophagosome initiation and maturation by TGFβ is dependent on the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein/E2 promoter binding factor (pRb/E2F1) pathway, which we have previously established as a critical signaling axis leading to various TGFβ tumor suppressive effects. We further determined that TGFβ induces pRb/E2F1-dependent transcriptional activation of several autophagy-related genes. Together, our findings reveal that TGFβ induces autophagy through the pRb/E2F1 pathway and transcriptional activation of autophagy-related genes and further highlight the central relevance of the pRb/E2F1 pathway downstream of TGFβ signaling in tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2175966342,"Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) are found in various tumors, involved in forming tumor blood vessels and expressing several important proangiogenic factors. The goals of this study were to evaluate the value of TEMs in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Flow cytometry was performed to identify and count TEMs in peripheral blood monocytes from HCC patients (n = 84) receiving hepatectomy, HBV cirrhotic patients (n = 21), benign tumors patients (n = 15) and healthy volunteers (n = 23). Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) levels in the plasma were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The distribution of TEMs in tumor tissue was observed by immunofluorescence staining. Then we determined the vascular area as a percentage of tumor area (vascular area/tumor area) by immunohistochemical staining. Finally the prognostic significance of TEMs and other clinicopathologic factors was evaluated.Percentage of TEMs in peripheral blood monocytes significantly increased in HCC patients compared with HBV cirrhotic patients and healthy donors (both P< 0.001). However there was no significance in benign liver tumor (P = 0.482). In addition, the percentage of circulating TEMs was positively correlated with plasma Ang-2 concentration (P<0.001, r2 = 0.294) and vascular area/tumor area (P<0.001, r2 = 0.126). Furthermore the percentage of intratumoral TEMs was significantly higher than that of paratumoral TEMs (P<0.001). Increased circulating TEMs was associated with poor overall survival (P = 0.043) and a shorter time to recurrence (P = 0.041). Multivariate Cox analysis also revealed that the percentage of TEMs in peripheral blood was an independent factor for HCC patients' prognosis.TEMs may promote angiogenesis in HCC regarding the angiopoietin/Tie2 signal pathway. Percentage of TEMs in peripheral blood monocytes may be applied as a biomarker for identifying HBV-related HCC and predicting the prognosis of these patients after resection."
https://openalex.org/W2269392870,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of partially replacing dry ground corn with glycerin on ruminal fermentation using a dual-flow continuous culture system. Six fermenters (1,223 ± 21 ml) were used in a replicated 3x3 Latin square arrangement with three periods of 10 d each, with 7 d for diet adaptation and 3 d for sample collections. All diets contained 75% concentrate and three dietary glycerin levels (0, 15, and 30% on dry matter basis), totaling six replicates per treatment. Fermenters were fed 72 g of dry matter/d equally divided in two meals/d, at 0800 and 2000 h. Solid and liquid dilution rates were adjusted daily to 5.5 and 11%/h, respectively. On d 8, 9, and 10, samples of 500 ml of solid and liquid digesta effluent were mixed, homogenized, and stored at -20°C. Subsamples of 10 ml were collected and preserved with 0.2 mL of a 50% H2SO4 solution for later determination of NH3-N and volatile fatty acids. Microbial biomass was isolated from fermenters for chemical analysis at the end of each experimental period. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure in SAS with α = 0.05. Glycerin levels did not affect apparent digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0.13; PQuad. = 0.40), OM (PLin. = 0.72; PQuad. = 0.15), NDF (PLin. = 0.38; PQuad. = 0.50) and ADF (PLin. = 0.91; PQuad. = 0.18). Also, glycerin inclusion did not affect true digestibility of DM (PLin. = 0.35; PQuad. = 0.48), and OM (PLin. = 0.08; PQuad. = 0.19). Concentrations of propionate (P < 0.01) and total volatile fatty acids (P < 0.01) increased linearly and concentrations of acetate (P < 0.01), butyrate (P = 0.01), iso-valerate (P < 0.01), and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids, as well as the acetate: propionate ratio (P < 0.01) decreased with glycerin inclusion. Linear increases on NH3-N concentration in digesta effluent (P < 0.01) and on NH3-N flow (P < 0.01) were observed due to glycerin inclusion in the diets. Crude protein digestibility (P = 0.04) and microbial N flow (P = 0.04) were greater in the control treatment compared with the other treatments and responded quadratically with glycerin inclusion. Furthermore, the inclusion of glycerin linearly decreased (P = 0.02) non-ammonia N flow. Glycerin levels did not affect the flows of total N (PLin. = 0.79; PQuad. = 0.35), and dietary N (PLin. = 0.99; PQuad. = 0.07), as well as microbial efficiency (PLin. = 0.09; PQuad. = 0.07). These results suggest that partially replacing dry ground corn with glycerin may change ruminal fermentation, by increasing total volatile fatty acids, and propionate concentration without affecting microbial efficiency, which may improve glucogenic potential of beef cattle diets."
https://openalex.org/W2274299805,"The sediment-water interface of freshwater lakes is characterized by sharp chemical gradients, shaped by the interplay between physical, chemical and microbial processes. As dissolved oxygen is depleted in the uppermost sediment, the availability of alternative electron acceptors, e.g. nitrate and sulfate, becomes the limiting factor. We performed a time series experiment in a mesocosm to simulate the transition from aerobic to anaerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface. Our goal was to identify changes in the microbial activity due to redox transitions induced by successive depletion of available electron acceptors. Monitoring critical hydrochemical parameters in the overlying water in conjunction with a new sampling strategy for sediment bacteria enabled us to correlate redox changes in the water to shifts in the active microbial community and the expression of functional genes representing specific redox-dependent microbial processes. Our results show that during several transitions from oxic-heterotrophic condition to sulfate-reducing condition, nitrate-availability and the on-set of sulfate reduction strongly affected the corresponding functional gene expression. There was evidence of anaerobic methane oxidation with NOx. DGGE analysis revealed redox-related changes in microbial activity and expression of functional genes involved in sulfate and nitrite reduction, whereas methanogenesis and methanotrophy showed only minor changes during redox transitions. The combination of high-frequency chemical measurements and molecular methods provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of the interplay between microbial activity and specific redox transitions at the sediment-water interface."
https://openalex.org/W2285363331,"While several phylogenetically diverse species have proved capable of learning abstract concepts, previous attempts to teach fish have been unsuccessful. In this report, the ability of archerfish (Toxotes chatareus) to learn the concepts of sameness and difference using a simultaneous two-item discrimination task was tested. Six archerfish were trained to either select a pair of same or different stimuli which were presented simultaneously. Training consisted of a 2-phase approach. Training phase 1: the symbols in the same and different pair did not change, thereby allowing the fish to solve the test through direct association. The fish were trained consecutively with four different sets of stimuli to familiarize them with the general procedure before moving on to the next training phase. Training phase 2: six different symbols were used to form the same or different pairs. After acquisition, same/different concept learning was tested by presenting fish with six novel stimuli (transfer test). Five fish successfully completed the first training phase. Only one individual passed the second training phase, however, transfer performance was consistent with chance. This individual was given further training using 60 training exemplars but the individual was unable to reach the training criterion. We hypothesize that archerfish are able to solve a limited version of the same/different test by learning the response to each possible stimulus configuration or by developing a series of relatively simple choice contingencies. We conclude that the simultaneous two-item discrimination task we describe cannot be successfully used to test the concepts of same and different in archerfish. In addition, despite considerable effort training archerfish using several tests and training methods, there is still no evidence that fish can learn an abstract concept-based test."
https://openalex.org/W2176257877,"Background Chromodomain helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1-like gene (CHD1L), also known as ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1 gene), is a new oncogene amplified in many solid tumors. Whether this gene plays a role in invasion and metastasis of breast cancer is unknown. Methods Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of CHD1L in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and normal mammary glands. Chemotaxis, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays were also performed to examine cell migration and invasion. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the expression of CHD1L, MMP-2, MMP-9, pAkt/Akt, pARK5/ARK5, and pmTOR/mTOR. Moreover, ELISA was carried out to detect the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Nude mice xenograft model was used to detect the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cell lines. Results CHD1L overexpression was observed in 112 of 268 patients (41.8%). This overexpression was associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008), tumor differentiation (P = 0.020), distant metastasis (P = 0.026), MMP-2 (P = 0.035), and MMP-9 expression (P = 0.022). In the cell experiment, reduction of CHD1L inhibited the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells by mediating MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. CHD1L knockdown via siRNA suppressed EGF-induced pAkt, pARK5, and pmTOR. This knockdown inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells into the lungs of SCID mice. Conclusions CHD1L promoted the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells via the PI3K/Akt/ARK5/mTOR/MMP signaling pathway. This study identified CHD1L as a potential anti-metastasis target for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2178531279,"Background The role of regulatory CD4 T cells (Treg) in immune-mediated liver disease is still under debate. It remains disputed whether Treg suppress T cell-mediated hepatitis in vivo and whether hepatic regulatory T cells are functional in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. Methods We used TF-OVA mice, which express ovalbumin in hepatocytes, to investigate the impact of Treg in a model of autoimmune hepatitis. Treg isolated from inflamed livers of TF-OVA mice were tested for their functionality in vitro. By employing double transgenic TF-OVAxDEREG (DEpletion of REGulatory T cells) mice we analyzed whether Treg-depletion aggravates autoimmune inflammation in the liver in vivo. Results CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells accumulated in the liver in the course of CD8 T cell-mediated hepatitis. Treg isolated from inflamed livers were functional to suppress CD8 T-cell proliferation in vitro. Depletion of Treg in TF-OVAxDEREG mice dramatically amplified T cell-mediated hepatitis. Repeated administration of antigen-specific CD8 T cells led to a second wave of inflammation only after depletion of Treg. Conclusion Our data add to the evidence for an important role of Treg in autoimmune hepatitis and show that Treg reduce the severity of T-cell mediated hepatitis in vivo. They constitute a key immune cell population that actively maintains a tolerogenic milieu in the liver and protects the liver against repeated inflammatory challenges."

Two series of experiments were carried out in 8 Lan-Yu and 3 Göttingen mini-pigs, respectively. A 2mm central full thickness corneal perforation was made with surgical scissors and 2mm trephines. The perforations were sealed immediately by suturing BioCornea to the wounded cornea. The conditions of each patched cornea were followed-up daily for 3 or 4 days. Status of operated eyes was assessed with slit lamp examination or optical coherence tomography (OCT). Animals were sacrificed after the study period and the corneas operated were fixated for histological examination. Both OCT imaging and handheld slit lamp observations indicated that a stable ocular integrity of the perforated corneas was maintained, showing no leakage of aqueous humor, normal depth of anterior chamber and only mild swelling of the wounded cornea. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the patched cornea showed no epithelial ingrowths to the perforated wounds and no severe leucocyte infiltration of the stroma. The fish scale-derived BioCornea is capable to seal full-thickness corneal perforation and stabilize the integrity of ocular anterior chamber in pre-clinic mini-pig models. BioCornea seems to be a safe and effective alternative for emergency treatment of corneal perforations."
https://openalex.org/W2180571027,"Objective Leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (lgr5) is a candidate marker for colorectal cancer stem cells (CSC). In the current study, we investigated the methylation status within thelgr5 promoter and evaluated its relationship with CSC differentiation, prognosis for colorectal cancer, and its clinicopathological features. Methods The methylation status within Lgr5 promoter was detected with a methylation-specific PCR in six colorectal cancer cell lines as well as 169 primary colorectal tumor tissues. Differentiation of CSC was examined with immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry. Down-regulation of lgr5 was achieved with gene-specific siRNA. The associations between lgr5 methylation and the clinicopathological features as well as survival of patients were analyzed with statistical methods. Results The lgr5 promoter was methylated to different degrees for the six colorectal cell lines examined, with complete methylation observed in HCT116 cells in which the lgr5 expression was partially recovered following DAC treatment. The stem-cell sphere formation from HCT116 cells was accompanied by increasing methylation within the lgr5 promoter and decreasing expression of lgr5. Knocking down lgr5 by siRNA also led to stem-cell spheres formation. Among primary colorectal tumors, 40% (67/169) were positive for lgr5 methylation, while none of the normal colon tissues were positive for lgr5 methylation. Furthermore, lgr5 methylation significantly associated with higher tumor grade, and negative distant metastasis (p < 0.05), as well as better prognosis (p = 0.001) in patients with colorectal cancer. Conclusions Our data suggests that lgr5 methylation, through the regulation of lgr5 expression and colorectal CSC differentiation, may constitute a novel prognostic marker for colorectal cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2296798777,"Lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is often exacerbated following acute upper respiratory tract infections caused by the human rhinovirus (HRV). Pathophysiology of these exacerbations is presently unclear and may involve deficient innate antiviral or exaggerated inflammatory responses in CF airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, responses of CF cells to HRV may be adversely affected by pre-exposure to virulence factors of Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa, the microorganism that frequently colonizes CF airways. Here we examined production of antiviral cytokine interferon-β and inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8, expression of the interferon-responsive antiviral gene 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), and intracellular virus RNA load in primary CF (delF508 CFTR) and healthy airway epithelial cells following inoculation with HRV16. Parallel cells were exposed to virulence factors of P. aeruginosa prior to and during HRV16 inoculation. CF cells exhibited production of interferon-β and interleukin-8, and expression of OAS1 at levels comparable to those in healthy cells, yet significantly higher HRV16 RNA load during early hours post-inoculation with HRV16. In line with this, HRV16 RNA load was higher in the CFBE41o- dF cell line overexpessing delF508 CFTR, compared with the isogenic control CFBE41o- WT (wild-type CFTR). Pre-exposure to virulence factors of P. aeruginosa did not affect OAS1 expression or HRV16 RNA load, but potentiated interleukin-8 production. In conclusion, CF cells demonstrate elevated HRV RNA load despite preserved interferon-β and OAS1 responses. High HRV load in CF airway epithelial cells appears to be due to deficiencies manifesting early during HRV infection, and may not be related to interferon-β."

Machine learning offers a novel and powerful tool to advance classification and modeling solutions in molecular biology. However, these methods have been less frequently used with empirical population genetics data. In this study, we developed a new combined approach of data analysis using microsatellite marker data from our previous studies of olive populations using machine learning algorithms. Herein, 267 olive accessions of various origins including 21 reference cultivars, 132 local ecotypes, and 37 wild olive specimens from the Iranian plateau, together with 77 of the most represented Mediterranean varieties were investigated using a finely selected panel of 11 microsatellite markers. We organized data in two ‘4-targeted’ and ‘16-targeted’ experiments. A strategy of assaying different machine based analyses (i.e. data cleaning, feature selection, and machine learning classification) was devised to identify the most informative loci and the most diagnostic alleles to represent the population and the geography of each olive accession. These analyses revealed microsatellite markers with the highest differentiating capacity and proved efficiency for our method of clustering olive accessions to reflect upon their regions of origin. A distinguished highlight of this study was the discovery of the best combination of markers for better differentiating of populations via machine learning models, which can be exploited to distinguish among other biological populations."
https://openalex.org/W2284499312,"The lack of a cell wall, flagella, fimbria, and other extracellular appendages and the possession of only a single membrane render the mycoplasmas structurally simplistic and ideal model organisms for the study of glycoconjugates. Most species have genomes of about 800 kb and code for few proteins predicted to have a role in glycobiology. The murine pathogens Mycoplasma arthritidis and Mycoplasma pulmonis have only a single gene annotated as coding for a glycosyltransferase but synthesize glycolipid, polysaccharide and glycoproteins. Previously, it was shown that M. arthritidis glycosylated surface lipoproteins through O-linkage. In the current study, O-linked glycoproteins were similarly found in M. pulmonis and both species of mycoplasma were found to also possess N-linked glycans at residues of asparagine and glutamine. Protein glycosylation occurred at numerous sites on surface-exposed lipoproteins with no apparent amino acid sequence specificity. The lipoproteins of Mycoplasma pneumoniae also are glycosylated. Glycosylation was dependent on the glycosidic linkages from host oligosaccharides. As far as we are aware, N-linked glycoproteins have not been previously described in Gram-positive bacteria, the organisms to which the mycoplasmas are phylogenetically related. The findings indicate that the mycoplasma cell surface is heavily glycosylated with implications for the modulation of mycoplasma-host interactions."

However, based on the effect sizes (0.02-0.14), no significant effects were found at the 4 post-test time points. Small effects were found on the psychological domain (effect sizes = 0.25-0.37) and environmental domains (effect size = 0.27) at follow-ups.Combining a BoNT-A injection with OT not only reduced the muscle tone and increased ROM but also improved the upper limb function and self-care capability in children with CP.

Initiation of comet tail assembly is more efficient in cytosol than it is under defined conditions, indicating that unknown factors contribute to the reaction. We therefore fractionated cytosol and identified CRMP-1 as a factor that facilitates Arp2/3-dependent Listeria actin cloud formation in the presence of Arp2/3 and actin alone. It also scored as an important factor for Listeria actin comet tail formation in brain cytosol. CRMP-1 does not nucleate actin assembly on its own, nor does it directly activate the Arp2/3 complex. Rather, CRMP-1 scored as an auxiliary factor that promoted the ability of Listeria ActA protein to activate the Arp2/3 complex to trigger actin assembly. CRMP-1 is one member of a family of five related proteins that modulate cell motility in response to extracellular signals. Our results demonstrate an important role for CRMP-1 in Listeria actin comet tail formation and open the possibility that CRMP-1 controls cell motility by modulating Arp2/3 activation.

A number of bacterial and viral pathogens use eukaryotic host proteins to assemble an actin cytoskeleton to propel themselves through the host's cytoplasm, a process that helps spread the pathogen from cell to cell (1Welch M.D. Way M. Arp2/3-mediated actin-based motility: a tail of pathogen abuse.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 14: 242-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Details of how host components are hijacked to form these pathogen-associated cytoskeletal networks are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions. The relative simplicity of these actin networks also allows detailed dissection of the biochemical mechanisms underlying their assembly and dissection of the molecular mechanisms controlling their morphogenesis (2Loisel T.P.

Furthermore, understanding how parasites build an actin cytoskeleton frequently provides new insight in the functioning of the more complicated actin networks that drive eukaryotic cell motility. The actin comet tail of Listeria monocytogenes (hereafter referred to as Listeria) is the most extensively characterized, physiologically relevant actin network. Listeria propulsion is driven by actin polymerization, which is assembled by frequent, Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation reactions to form a Listeria actin comet tail (3Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Actin polymerization is induced by Arp2/3 protein complex at the surface of Listeria monocytogenes.Nature. 1997; 385: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Listeria propulsion and comet tail formation are preceded by the formation of an actin cloud that assembles at the bacterial surface (3Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J.

Arp2/3 and actin alone are sufficient to initiate formation of the actin cloud, but other host factors are necessary for propulsion and formation of the comet tail (2Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R.

Arp2/3 is a protein complex that nucleates the de novo formation of new actin polymer from monomeric actin subunits (6Goley E.D. Welch M.D. The ARP2/3 complex: an actin nucleator comes of age.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). However, Arp2/3 itself is largely inactive, displaying only weak actin nucleation activity on its own (7Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J.

In the case of Listeria, ActA, which is expressed by Listeria on the bacterial surface, recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex to locally stimulate actin polymerization (3Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A.

Arp2/3 and actin alone are therefore sufficient to form an actin cloud on the surface of Listeria. Actin cloud formation is more efficient in cytosol than with Arp2/3 and actin alone, implying the existence of unknown cytosolic factors that promote the reaction (3Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A.

In this study, we identified collapsin response mediator protein-1 (CRMP-1) 2The abbreviation used is: CRMP, collapsin response mediator protein. as one factor that enhances Listeria actin cloud assembly and characterized its basic biochemistry. Human CRMP-1 was cloned into pET30a. Listeria ActA was a gift from the Mullins lab (14Akin O. Mullins R.D. Capping protein increases the rate of actin-based motility by promoting filament nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.Cell. 2008; 133: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Rosetta Escherichia coli cells (EMD Millipore) were used for expressing recombinant His-tagged CRMP-1 and His-tagged ActA. Arp2/3 complex was purified from calf thymus as described (3Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Actin polymerization is induced by Arp2/3 protein complex at the surface of Listeria monocytogenes.Nature. 1997; 385: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Expression of His-tagged CRMP-1 and His-tagged ActA was induced at room temperature with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h and then purified according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). In brief, the bacterially expressed His-tagged CRMP-1 was pelleted and lysed with lysozyme in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). For His-tagged ActA, we used denaturing condition, in which 3 m guanidine hydrochloride was added to the lysis buffer. We applied the supernatant to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was then washed with lysis buffer and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. The final eluted fraction of CRMP-1 was dialyzed against a different buffer according to the experimental need. Final elution of His-tagged ActA was dialyzed into 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, or Hepes, pH 8.0. Filamin was purified from chicken gizzard as described previously (15Shizuta Y. Shizuta H. Gallo M. Davies P. Pastan I. Purification and properties of filamin, and actin binding protein from chicken gizzard.J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6562-6567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Listeria actin assembly reactions were performed in perfusion chambers as described previously (5Brieher W.M. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Fascin-mediated propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes independent of frequent nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, Listeria absorbed to glass coverslips in perfusion chambers were incubated for 5 min with brain cytosol, column fractions, or recombinant protein at concentrations listed below. Chambers were washed three times with buffer A (1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8). Chambers were then filled with a solution containing 100 nm Arp2/3 complex and 2 μm G-actin labeled with Oregon Green (10% labeled). After 10 min, this solution was washed out of the chamber, and actin cloud and comet tail assembly was imaged with a 20× (NA 0.7) objective attached to a 1,000 × 1,000 charge-coupled device camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics) on a Zeiss Axio Imager with the Colibri illumination system using the Zeiss acquisition software (Carl Zeiss). All chromatographic media were purchased from GE Healthcare. 150 grams of frozen bovine calf brain (Animal Technologies, Tyler, TX) was homogenized in 2 volumes of buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm PMSF). The homogenate was first centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was applied to a 60-ml DE-52 column equilibrated in buffer A. The flow-through, which contained the activity, was applied to a 70-ml S HP column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 500-ml gradient to 400 mm NaCl in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled, and solid ammonium sulfate was added slowly to a final concentration of 1.25 m. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 70-ml Phenyl HP column equilibrated in 1.25 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 1-liter gradient to buffer A. Active fractions were concentrated in a Centricon with a 100-kDa nominal cutoff, and the retentate was applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled, diluted with an equal volume of water, and applied to a Mono S column equilibrated in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 20 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 25 column volume gradient to 300 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Gel slices were destained in 50% acetonitrile + 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, crushed using a plastic pestle, and dried. The dried gel was suspended in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and digested with MSG-Trypsin (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) at a ratio of 1:10 to 1:50 using a CEM Discover microwave digester (Mathews, SC) at 55 °C and maximum power of 60 watts for 15 min. Digested peptides were extracted using 50% acetonitrile + 5% formic acid twice and lyophilized. The digested peptides were dissolved in 5% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid for LC/MS. LC/MS was performed using a Thermo Dionex Ultimate RSLC3000 operating in nano mode at 300 μl/min with a gradient from 0.1% formic acid to 100% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid in 120 min. The trap column used was a Thermo Acclaim PepMap 100 (100 μm × 2 cm), and the analytical column was a Thermo Acclaim PepMap RSLC (75 μm × 15 cm). The Xcalibur raw file was converted by Mascot Distiller into peak lists that were submitted to an in-house Mascot Server and searched against specific NCBI-NR protein databases. Polyclonal rabbit anti-CRMP antibodies were raised against purified recombinant human CRMP-1. The CRMP-1 antiserum itself was specific and sufficient for all Western blotting procedures. For immunodepletion experiments, however, the antibodies were affinity-purified using recombinant CRMP-1 coupled to Affi-Gel 10 gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The affinity-purified antibodies were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads at a ratio of 1 mg of protein to 1 ml of beads. For immunodepletion of CRMP-1 from brain cytosol, 100 μl of affinity-purified anti-CRMP-1-antibody-coated beads or beads coupled with non-immune rabbit IgG was added to 200 μl of brain cytosol and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant tumbling. Beads were then pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 1:3 into buffer A supplemented with 0.2 mm ATP and with additional 62.5 nm Arp2/3 complex and 2 μm 25% fluorophore-labeled actin. This mixture was applied to a perfusion chamber, containing L. monocytogenes, for 5 min at room temperature. In rescue experiments, recombinant CRMP was added in the same amount as endogenous CRMP-1 (0.01 mg/ml), which was determined by Western blot, into the perfusion chamber to preincubate with Listeria. Comet tail assembly was analyzed by fluorescence imaging using a 63× objective lens (NA 1.4) under a Hamamatsu camera described above. The number of Listeria with actin tail and the actin tail length were quantified using Fiji software (16Schindelin J. Arganda-Carreras I. Frise E. Kaynig V. Longair M. Pietzsch T. Preibisch S. Rueden C. Saalfeld S. Schmid B. Tinevez J.Y. White D.J. Hartenstein V. Eliceiri K. Tomancak P. Cardona A. Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (30105) Google Scholar). Depletion of CRMP-1 was confirmed by Western blotting. Pyrene actin was prepared as described (17Bryan J. Coluccio L.M. Kinetic analysis of F-actin depolymerization in the presence of platelet gelsolin and gelsolin-actin complexes.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1236-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Actin polymerization was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 410 nm. The reaction contains 2.5 μm actin (25% pyrene-labeled), 50 nm Arp2/3, 17.5 nm ActA, and various concentrations of CRMP-1 protein in buffer B (1 mm EGTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) with 2 mm ATP. Prepolymerized filaments were first prepared by incubating 2.5 μm Alexa Fluor 647-labeled actin (10% labeled) in buffer B for 30 min at room temperature. These filaments were then diluted 10-fold into solutions containing 2.5 μm Alexa Fluor 647-labeled G-actin with or without 0.6 μm Arp2/3, 0.4 μm ActA, and/or 0.125 μm CRMP-1, for 10 min. The filaments from this reaction were then diluted 1:50 into Buffer B with 15 mm glucose, 20 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase, and 1 mm TROLOX and then immediately applied into the chambers, which had been precoated with 40 μg/ml filamin. Filaments were allowed to attach to the chamber for 10 min and then detected by fluorescence imaging using a 63× objective lens as described above. Four sets of co-sedimentation experiments were conducted. Two sets used CRMP-1 concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 2.5 μm. Two other sets used CRMP-1 concentrations of 0.75, 1.25, 2.5, and 4 μm. Actin was provided at a constant 2 μm with various concentrations of CRMP-1 in different tubes. Actin was polymerized at 4 °C overnight in buffer B and 2 mm ATP in the absence or presence of various concentrations of CRMP-1. The tubes were then centrifuged in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor at 350,000 × g (k factor, 8.1) for 20 min at 4 °C to separate supernatant and pellet fractions. The fractions were separated using SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and analyzed using Fiji software. Curve fitting was done using OriginLab software. The affinity of ActA for CRMP-1 was determined using the approach described by Pollard (18Pollard T.D. A guide to simple and informative binding assays.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 4061-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Recombinant ActA was immobilized onto Affi-Gel 10 gel (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, after the Affi-Gel 10 gel was activated, recombinant ActA protein was added to the gel solution containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8. ActA was allowed to couple onto the gel overnight at 4 °C. The final coupling density was 1.5 mg of ActA per ml of gel. The gel was blocked in casein solution for 30 min and then washed with buffer A before use. The control gel was coated only with casein. 12.5 μl of the ActA-coated gel was used to incubate with various concentrations of CRMP-1 to a final volume of 112.5 μl. For control reactions, the blank gel was used. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the gel was pelleted using centrifugation. The supernatant was carefully separated from the gel, and then separated on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using our custom polyclonal antisera (not affinity-purified) against CRMP-1. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, catalogue number: 1706515) and chemiluminescence were used to visualize the amount of CRMP-1 in the supernatants by exposing the blots to autoradiography film. Multiple exposures were obtained to ensure that the signals were in the linear range. The amount of CRMP-1 bound to ActA was determined by subtracting the total amount of CRMP-1 in the control condition from the amount of CRMP-1 left in the supernatant. This approach permitted the estimation of binding affinity from the concentration of CRMP-1 required for half-maximal binding to ActA beads. The results from three independent Western blots were analyzed using Fiji software, and the curve was fitted using OriginLab software. Previous work demonstrated that brain cytosol contains factors that associate with the Listeria cell surface and promote Arp2/3-dependent actin cloud formation (5Brieher W.M. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Fascin-mediated propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes independent of frequent nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used a visual assay to score for the unknown factors that promote actin cloud formation (Fig. 1A). In this assay, Listeria are introduced into a perfusion chamber, where they passively adhere to glass coverslips. Brain cytosol or chromatographic fractions of cytosol are then introduced into the chamber and allowed to incubate for 5 min. No actin assembly occurs under these conditions in this amount of time. The cytosol within the perfusion chamber is washed out with buffer and then replaced with a solution containing pure Arp2/3 and fluorescently labeled actin to initiate actin cloud formation, which is then assessed by fluorescence imaging. Using this assay, we confirmed previous results showing that a greater fraction of Listeria forms actin clouds when the Listeria are preincubated with brain cytosol than when the Listeria are preincubated with buffer alone (5Brieher W.M. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Fascin-mediated propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes independent of frequent nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To purify these factors, we used conventional chromatography and the visual assay described above to score column fractions of brain cytosol for the cloud-enhancing activity. Using this approach, we were able to track an activity across several different columns, resulting in the isolation of two polypeptides of ∼65 kDa that were both identified as CRMP-1 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1B). Twelve peptides were identified in the upper band, representing 33% coverage of CRMP-1 by mass and 34% coverage by amino acid count. 11 peptides were identified in the lower band, corresponding to 28% coverage of CRMP-1 by mass and 28% coverage by amino acid count (Fig. 1C). We do not know why the protein runs as a doublet. CRMP proteins are known to be phosphorylated (19Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Ménager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K.

Biochem. 2010; 111: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which could alter the mobility of the protein on SDS gels. However, others have commented that the positively charged C terminus of CRMP family members is highly susceptible to proteolysis (23Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. Structural bases for CRMP function in plexin-dependent semaphorin3A signaling.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Ponnusamy R. Lohkamp B. Insights into the oligomerization of CRMPs: crystal structure of human collapsin response mediator protein 5.J. Neurochem. 2013; 125: 855-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recombinant CRMP-1 purified from E. coli also runs as a doublet, which is most likely explained by proteolysis as reported by others. Recombinant CRMP-1 expressed and purified from E. coli also scored in the assay, confirming that we had purified the right factor (Fig. 1D). Quantification demonstrated that increasing concentrations of CRMP-1 induced a greater fraction of Listeria to form actin clouds. Using an equal concentration of Arp2/3, 80% of Listeria formed a detectable actin cloud when preincubated with 350 nm CRMP-1 as compared with only 15% of Listeria with clouds in the absence of CRMP-1 (Fig. 1E). To address the importance of CRMP-1 for Listeria actin tail formation in a complex system, we immunodepleted it from brain cytosol. We were able to deplete 50–70% of CRMP-1 from the extract (Fig. 1G). Listeria actin comet tail formation was diminished in cytosol depleted of CRMP-1 but not in mock-depleted controls (Fig. 1, F and H). Only 46% of Listeria formed a detectable actin signal around the bacteria in depleted cytosol as compared with 90% in mock-depleted controls. Comet tails that did manage to form in CRMP-1-depleted cytosol were shorter than controls (2 μm for depleted cytosol and 14 μm for mock-depleted controls). These phenotypes could be rescued by adding pure, recombinant CRMP back to the extracts. These results reveal an important role for CRMP-1 in boosting the efficiency and robustness of Listeria actin cloud and comet tail assembly in complex cytosolic extracts. We considered several alternative mechanisms through which CRMP-1 might possibly promote Arp2/3-dependent Listeria actin cloud and comet tail formation. CRMP-1 could itself be a novel actin nucleation factor. Alternatively, CRMP-1 could function as a nucleation-promoting factor that directly activates the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, CRMP-1 could act as a coactivator for ActA, which is the only factor expressed by Listeria that is known to activate the Arp2/3 complex (13Kocks C. Gouin E. Tabouret M. Berche P. Ohayon H.

We used pyrene actin polymerization assays along with pure proteins to distinguish among these possibilities. We did not detect any stimulation of actin assembly by CRMP-1 alone (Fig. 2A) or by CRMP-1 in combination with ActA (Fig. 2B), nor could we detect any activation of the Arp2/3 complex by CRMP-1 alone (Fig. 2C). These negative results demonstrate that CRMP-1 is not itself an actin nucleation factor, nor is it a direct activator of the Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, CRMP-1 was able to stimulate ActA-activated, Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Thus CRMP-1 is a new factor that works in concert with ActA to enhance Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation. Arp2/3 produces branched actin filaments, yet not all Arp2/3 activators increase the density of filament branches (6Goley E.D. Welch M.D. The ARP2/3 complex: an actin nucleator comes of age.Nat. Rev.

Mutation of the four Runx1 C-terminal tyrosines to aspartate or glutamate to mimic phosphorylation increases trans-activation of the reporter in 293T cells and allows induction of Cebpa or Pu.1 mRNAs in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells, whereas mutation of these residues to phenylalanine to prevent phosphorylation obviates these effects. Three mechanisms contribute to increased Runx1 activity upon tyrosine modification as follows: increased stability, reduced histone deacetylase (HDAC) interaction, and increased DNA binding. Mutation of the five modified Runx1 tyrosines to aspartate markedly reduced co-immunoprecipitation with HDAC1 and HDAC3, markedly increased stability in cycloheximide or in the presence of co-expressed Cdh1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase coactivator, with reduced ubiquitination, and allowed DNA-binding in gel shift assay similar to wild-type Runx1. In contrast, mutation of these residues to phenylalanine modestly increased HDAC interaction, modestly reduced stability, and markedly reduced DNA binding in gel shift assays and as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with the −14-kb Pu.1 or +37-kb Cebpa enhancers after stable expression in 32Dcl3 cells. Affinity for CBFβ, the Runx1 DNA-binding partner, was not affected by these tyrosine modifications, and in vitro translated CBFβ markedly increased DNA affinity of both the translated phenylalanine and aspartate Runx1 variants. Finally, further supporting a positive role for Runx1 tyrosine phosphorylation during granulopoiesis, mutation of the five Src-modified residues to aspartate but not phenylalanine allows Runx1 to increase Cebpa and granulocyte colony formation by Runx1-deleted murine marrow.

Consequent reduction in Pu.1 and Cebpa transcription likely contributes to impaired differentiation and myeloid transformation (14Friedman A.D. C/EBPα in normal and malignant myelopoiesis.Int. J.

In addition, Src phosphorylates Runx1(Tyr-260), and a cluster of C-terminal tyrosines, Tyr-375, Tyr-378, Tyr-379, and Tyr-386; Runx1(5F), in which these five tyrosines are changed to phenylalanine, preventing phosphorylation, induces megakaryopoiesis from wild-type marrow and rescues CD8 T cell development from Runx1-deleted marrow more potently than Runx1(5D), in which these tyrosines are changed to aspartic acid to mimic phosphorylation or wild-type Runx1; and SHP2 interacts with Runx1 and reduces its tyrosine phosphorylation (28Huang H. Woo A.J. Waldon Z. Schindler Y. Moran T.B. Zhu H.H. Feng G.S. Steen H. Cantor A.B. A Src family kinase-Shp2 axis controls RUNX1 activity in megakaryocyte and T-lymphocyte differentiation.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Neither the effect of Runx1 tyrosine modification on intrinsic Runx1 trans-activation potency nor the role of Runx1 tyrosine phosphorylation during normal granulopoiesis has been previously investigated. We find that activated Src strongly increases Runx1 activity in 293T cells and that conversion of the five Runx1 tyrosines modified by Src to phenylalanine to generate Runx1(5F) markedly reduces activation of a model reporter in 293T cells, and Runx1(4F) induces Pu.1 or Cebpa less effectively than wild-type Runx1 in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. Potentially accounting for these findings, Runx1 tyrosine modification on these residues markedly reduces HDAC1 and HDAC3 interaction and increases steady-state Runx1 expression and stability, although lack of phosphorylation reduced DNA affinity in gel shift or myeloid chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. In addition, Runx1(5D) rescues formation of granulocyte progenitors from Runx1-deleted marrow more potently than does Runx1(5F). 293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS, Hyclone) and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were conducted for 48 h as described (26Zhang L. Fried F.B. Guo H. Friedman A.D.

Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of Runx1 or its variants with FLAG-HDAC1 or FLAG-HDAC3, or of Runx1 variants with HA-ubiquitin, in 293T cells was assessed in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% deoxycholate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) as described (23Guo H.

For analysis of Runx1-ER(T) tyrosine phosphorylation in 32Dcl3 cells, Western blotting for Tyr(P) was conducted after similar IP using ERα antiserum, after the 32Dcl3 cells were pretreated with 1.25 mm sodium orthovanadate for 15 min to inhibit endogenous tyrosine phosphatases. To analyze interaction of FLAG-BioRunx1 with CBFβ, these proteins were co-expressed with birA in 293T cells, followed by agarose-streptavidin pulldown and CBFβ Western blotting, as described (28Huang H. Woo A.J. Waldon Z. Schindler Y. Moran T.B. Zhu H.H. Feng G.S. Steen H. Cantor A.B. A Src family kinase-Shp2 axis controls RUNX1 activity in megakaryocyte and T-lymphocyte differentiation.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1587-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Retroviral vectors were packaged by transient transfection into 293T cells with pkat2ecopac, and supernatants were filtered and used to transduce marrow isolated from 14- to 16-week-old Runx1(f/f) mice that had been subjected to one 5-fluorouracil injection 6 days prior to marrow harvest, as described (4Guo H. Ma O. Speck N.A. Friedman A.D. Runx1 deletion or dominant inhibition reduces Cebpa transcription via conserved promoter and distal enhancer sites to favor monopoiesis over granulopoiesis.Blood. 2012; 119: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Four days after initiating transduction, cells were lineage-depleted, and GFP+ cells were isolated by flow cytometry and plated at 1E3/ml in methylcellulose with IMDM, 10% HI-FBS (Methocult 3231, Stem Cell Technology) supplemented with 10 ng/ml murine IL-3, 10 ng/ml murine IL-6, and 10 ng/ml murine stem cell factor (PeproTech). Hematopoietic colonies were enumerated 8 days later based on colony structure. Means and standard errors are shown. The Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons. Band intensities were quantified with ImageJ software from National Institutes of Health. The locations of the five Runx1 tyrosines modified by Src are diagrammed, and tyrosine clusters changed to aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), or phenylalanine (Phe) are listed (Fig. 1A). (Runx1)4TKLUC, containing four Runx1 consensus sites positioned upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase cDNA, was co-transfected into 293T cells with CMV expression vectors for wild-type Runx1 (WT) or its 5F, 5D, 4F, 4D, 1F, or 1D variants (Fig. 1B, top). Relative to empty CMV vector, Runx1 activated the reporter 5-fold, on average, and 5F and 4F showed minimal activation, whereas 1F had activity similar to WT. 5D was twice as active as WT, and 4D or 1D showed mildly increased activity. Total cellular proteins obtained after transfection of equal quantities of each expression vector were assessed for Runx1 and actin expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1B, bottom). Despite having markedly reduced activity, 5F and 4F were expressed at levels equal to or greater than WT. 4D was expressed at mildly increased levels and 5D at markedly increased levels, potentially accounting in part for their increased activity. 4D and 5D also manifested slower mobility, likely reflecting their increased negative charge. We then assessed the effect of co-expressed activated Src on the activities of Runx1 or its 5F variant (Fig. 1C, top). Src generated 2.5-fold, Runx1 4.2-fold, and their combination 31-fold activation, displaying marked synergy, whereas Src only increased activation by 5F 2.6-fold, essentially identical to the activity of Src alone. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Src also increased the expression of Runx1, including acquisition of a more slowly migrating band, with these effects also evident to a lesser extent with 5F (Fig. 1C, bottom). During granulopoiesis, G-CSF receptor signaling not only activates Src kinases but also JAK kinases, and Fes tyrosine kinase is preferentially active in myeloid cells (33Kim J. Ogata Y. Ali H. Feldman R.A. The Fes tyrosine kinase: a signal transducer that regulates myeloid-specific gene expression through transcriptional activation.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2004; 32: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); however, neither activated Fes, JAK2, nor JAK2(V617F) increased activation of (Runx1)4TKLUC by Runx1 (data not shown). As the 4F mutation largely obviated Runx1 activity, we generated the 2F*, 2E*, 2F, and 2E variants, mutating Tyr-375/378 or Tyr-379/386 to Phe or Glu. We chose Glu rather than Asp as Glu has an extra methyl group and so might better mimic a bulky tyrosine residue. Runx1(2F*) was inactive, and Runx1(2F) had reduced activity, despite expression above WT, whereas the 2E* and 2E variants demonstrated increased activity, with expression similar to or less than WT (Fig. 1D). We also took advantage of the availability of single residue tyrosine variants and 2F in the context of FLAG-BioRunx1 to compare their activities (Fig. 1E). 2F again manifested reduced activity, whereas each of the single residue variants had full activity, with expression of each variant similar to WT on Western blot analysis. Thus, dephosphorylation of at least two Runx1 C-terminal tyrosine residues is required to reduce trans-activation in 293T cells. The CBFβ subunit increases the DNA affinity of Runx1 and protects Runx1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradat"
https://openalex.org/W2179488047,"We have previously reported that Ahnak-mediated TGFβ signaling leads to down-regulation of c-Myc expression. Here, we show that inhibition of Ahnak can promote generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) via up-regulation of endogenous c-Myc. Consistent with the c-Myc inhibitory role of Ahnak, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Ahnak-deficient mouse (Ahnak(-/-) MEF) show an increased level of c-Myc expression compared with wild type MEF. Generation of iPSC with just three of the four Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (hereafter 3F), was significantly enhanced in Ahnak(-/-) MEF. Similar results were obtained when Ahnak-specific shRNA was applied to wild type MEF. Of note, expressionof Ahnak was significantly induced during the formation of embryoid bodies from embryonic stem cells, suggesting that Ahnak-mediated c-Myc inhibition is involved in embryoid body formation and the initial differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The iPSC from 3F-infected Ahnak(-/-) MEF cells (Ahnak(-/-)-iPSC-3F) showed expression of all stem cell markers examined and the capability to form three primary germ layers. Moreover, injection of Ahnak(-/-)-iPSC-3F into athymic nude mice led to development of teratoma containing tissues from all three primary germ layers, indicating that iPSC from Ahnak(-/-) MEF are bona fide pluripotent stem cells. Taken together, these data provide evidence for a new role for Ahnak in cell fate determination during development and suggest that manipulation of Ahnak and the associated signaling pathway may provide a means to regulate iPSC generation."
https://openalex.org/W2219387868,"The lack of high-quality data to support evidence-based policies continues to be a concern in African cities, which present marked social, economic and cultural disparities that may differently impact the health of the groups living in different urban contexts. This study explores three urban units--formal, transition and informal--of the capital of Cape Verde, in terms of overweight/obesity, cardiometabolic risk, physical activity and other aspects related to the urban environment.Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used in this intra-urban study. A proportional stratified random sample (n = 1912 adults), based on geographical coordinates of private households, was selected to apply the UPHI-STAT questionnaire. In a second stage (n = 599), local nutritionists collected anthropometric measurements (e.g., height, waist circumference) and body composition by bioelectric impedance (e.g., body weight, body fat, muscle mass). In a third stage, pedometers were used to count study participants' steps on working and non-working days for one week (n = 118). After a preliminary statistical analysis, a qualitative study was developed to complement the quantitative approach. Generalized linear models, among others, were used in the multivariate analysis.Insecurity was the main concern among survey respondents in the three units, notwithstanding with significant differences (p < 0.001) among units. About three-quarters (76.6%) of the participants of the informal unit emphasised the need for more security. The formal unit presents an older age structure (61.3% above 40 years old) and the transition unit a younger age structure (only 30.5% above 40 years old). Some health-related variables were analysed in each unit, revealing an excess of chronic conditions reported by inhabitants of informal unit, compared with the formal unit despite the informal unit's younger age profile. The self-reported hypertension varied significantly among urban units (p < 0.001), with 19.3% in the formal unit, 11.4% in the transition unit and 22.5% in the informal unit. Women of the urban units present significant differences (5% level) for body mass index calculated from self-reported measures (p < 0.001), fat mass (p = 0.005), waist circumference (p = 0.046) and waist-to-height ratio (p = 0.017). For women, overall physical activity was 67.4% (95%CI [64.8,70.0]), with differences among urban units (p = 0.025). For men it was of 85.2% (95%CI [82.3,87.6]), without significant differences among urban units (p = 0.266). The percentage of women and men who reported physical activity in leisure time was discrepant, with 95%CI [22.6, 27.4] and [53.2, 60.2], respectively. The results of pedometers also indicated that men walk significantly more than women (p < 0.001), with a difference of approximately 2000 steps/day.The data collection process itself also gave us some clues on the involvement of local communities, exploring the potential of social capital of these settings and the role of the woman in family and society in Cape Verde. The higher participation of women and residents of informal unit (the most disadvantaged groups) suggests these as the priority target groups for health promotion campaigns. The link between health planning, urban planning and security of the city needs to be reinforced to minimize health, social and gender inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W2274437658,"Progress towards genetic sequencing of human parasites has provided the groundwork for a post-genomic approach to develop novel antigens for the diagnosis and treatment of parasite infections. To fully utilize the genomic data, however, high-throughput methodologies are required for functional analysis of the proteins encoded in the genomic sequences. In this study, we investigated cell-free expression and in situ immobilization of parasite proteins as a novel platform for the discovery of antigenic proteins. PCR-amplified parasite DNA was immobilized on microbeads that were also functionalized to capture synthesized proteins. When the microbeads were incubated in a reaction mixture for cell-free synthesis, proteins expressed from the microbead-immobilized DNA were instantly immobilized on the same microbeads, providing a physical linkage between the genetic information and encoded proteins. This approach of in situ expression and isolation enables streamlined recovery and analysis of cell-free synthesized proteins and also allows facile identification of the genes coding antigenic proteins through direct PCR of the microbead-bound DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2173893537,"Background Covering insertion sites with chlorhexidine impregnated dressings has been proven to be clinically effective in reducing catheter related blood stream infections (CR-BSI). Two chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-impregnated dressings are commercially available, a polyurethane foam disk and a film dressing containing a chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated gel pad. While both have demonstrated efficacy in clinical settings, the major drawback of high cost and impaired IV insertion site visibility limits their usage. A new, simple film dressing containing CHG within its adhesive layer is now available. The objective of this study was to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the new dressing in comparison to the CHG-impregnated gel dressing. Methods Quantitative aliquots of suspensions (concentration of 1.0x106 to 5.0x106 cfu/sample) of clinically relevant challenge organisms (Staphylococcus species, gram-negative bacilli, Candida albicans) were incubated in contact with the new CHG-containing film dressing, a placebo version of the same (negative control) and the commercially available CHG-impregnated gel dressing (positive control). Serial dilutions of the surviving organisms were quantified using the pour plate after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days of incubation in order to calculate an antimicrobial log10 reduction for each organism/dressing combination at each point in time. Results The new CHG-containing film dressing delivered greater than 5.0 log10 reduction throughout the 7 days on all aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus species tested. As of day 1 the CHG-containing film dressing provided greater than 5.0 log10 reduction on Candida albicans. There were no statistically significant differences in the log10 reduction between the two dressings tested. Conclusion The new CHG-containing film dressing was found to be as effective as the chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated gel dressing on clinically relevant microbes."
https://openalex.org/W2281529770,"Mechanisms driving alteration of lung function in response to inhalation of a methacholine aerosol are incompletely understood. To explore to what extent large and small airways contribute to airflow limitation and airway closure in this context, volumetric capnography was performed before (n = 93) and after (n = 78) methacholine provocation in subjects with an intermediate clinical probability of asthma. Anatomical dead space (VDaw), reflecting large airway volume, and the slope of the alveolar capnogram (slope3), an index of ventilation heterogeneity linked to small airway dysfunction, were determined. At baseline, VDaw was positively correlated with lung volumes, FEV1 and peak expiratory flow, while slope3 was not correlated with any lung function index. Variations in VDaw and slope3 following methacholine stimulation were correlated to a small degree (R2 = -0.20). Multivariate regression analysis identified independent associations between variation in FEV1 and variations in both VDaw (Standardized Coefficient-SC = 0.66) and Slope3 (SC = 0.35). By contrast, variation in FVC was strongly associated with variations in VDaw (SC = 0.8) but not Slope3. Thus, alterations in the geometry and/or function of large and small airways were weakly correlated and contributed distinctly to airflow limitation. While both large and small airways contributed to airflow limitation as assessed by FEV1, airway closure as assessed by FVC reduction mostly involved the large airways."
https://openalex.org/W2180388173,"Previous studies in HIV patients have reported autoantibodies to several human proteins, including erythropoietin (EPO), interferon-α (IFN-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and HLA-DR, as potential mediators of anemia or immunosuppression. The etiology of these autoantibodies has been attributed to molecular mimicry between HIV epitopes and self-proteins. Here, the Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS) was used to investigate the presence of such autoantibodies in HIV-infected adults. High levels of antibodies to HIV proteins such as capsid (p24), matrix (p17), envelope (gp41), and reverse transcriptase (RT) were detected using LIPS in both untreated and anti-retroviral-treated HIV-infected individuals but not in uninfected controls. LIPS readily detected anti-EPO autoantibodies in serum samples from subjects with presumptive pure red cell aplasia but not in any of the samples from HIV-infected or uninfected individuals. Similarly, subjects with HIV lacked autoantibodies to IFN-α, IL-2, HLA-DR and the immunoglobulin lambda light chain; all purported targets of molecular mimicry. While molecular mimicry between pathogen proteins and self-proteins is a commonly proposed mechanism for autoantibody production, the findings presented here indicate such a process is not common in HIV disease."
