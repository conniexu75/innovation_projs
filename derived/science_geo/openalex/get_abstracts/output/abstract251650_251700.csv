https://openalex.org/W2148693026,"The mechanisms through which hematopoietic cytokines accelerate revascularization are unknown. Here, we show that the magnitude of cytokine-mediated release of SDF-1 from platelets and the recruitment of nonendothelial CXCR4+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitors, 'hemangiocytes,' constitute the major determinant of revascularization. Soluble Kit-ligand (sKitL), thrombopoietin (TPO, encoded by Thpo) and, to a lesser extent, erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induced the release of SDF-1 from platelets, enhancing neovascularization through mobilization of CXCR4+VEGFR1+ hemangiocytes. Although revascularization of ischemic hindlimbs was partially diminished in mice deficient in both GM-CSF and G-CSF (Csf2−/−Csf3−/−), profound impairment in neovascularization was detected in sKitL-deficient Mmp9−/− as well as thrombocytopenic Thpo−/− and TPO receptor–deficient (Mpl−/−) mice. SDF-1–mediated mobilization and incorporation of hemangiocytes into ischemic limbs were impaired in Thpo−/−, Mpl−/− and Mmp9−/− mice. Transplantation of CXCR4+VEGFR1+ hemangiocytes into Mmp9−/− mice restored revascularization, whereas inhibition of CXCR4 abrogated cytokine- and VEGF-A–mediated mobilization of CXCR4+VEGFR1+ cells and suppressed angiogenesis. In conclusion, hematopoietic cytokines, through graded deployment of SDF-1 from platelets, support mobilization and recruitment of CXCR4+VEGFR1+ hemangiocytes, whereas VEGFR1 is essential for their angiogenic competency for augmenting revascularization. Delivery of SDF-1 may be effective in restoring angiogenesis in individuals with vasculopathies."

Mutations in DUOX2 produce congenital hypothyroidism in humans. However, no functional DUOX-based NADPH oxidase has ever been reconstituted at the plasma membrane of transfected cells. It has been proposed that DUOX retention in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) of heterologous systems is due to the lack of an unidentified component required for functional maturation of the enzyme. By data mining of a massively parallel signature sequencing tissue expression data base, we identified an uncharacterized gene named DUOX maturation factor (DUOXA2) arranged head-to-head to and co-expressed with DUOX2. A paralog (DUOXA1) was similarly linked to DUOX1. The genomic rearrangement leading to linkage of ancient DUOX and DUOXA genes could be traced back before the divergence of echinoderms. We demonstrate that co-expression of DUOXA2, an ER-resident transmembrane protein, allows ER-to-Golgi transition, maturation, and translocation to the plasma membrane of functional DUOX2 in a heterologous system.

Tags with scores >–1 were mapped to the human genome assembly using BLAST. DUOXA homologs were identified by tBLASTn searches against the NCBI nr data base and trace archive and BLAT queries (at genome.ucsc.edu/) against assembled whole genome sequences. Orthologs were operationally defined as reciprocal best BLAST hits. Gene structures were deduced by spliced alignment maintaining maximum homolog similarity of the open reading frames (ORFs) and consensus splice junctions. Cladograms were constructed from ClustalX alignments (BLOSUM weight matrix, excluding gaps) using the Jones, Taylor, and Thornton (JTT) substitution model in PHYML 2.4.4 (10Guindon S. Gascuel O.

Northern Blot Analysis—A human multiple tissue Northern blot (Origene) was hybridized with DUOXA2 (125–470 of DQ489734) and DUOXA1 (1244–1623 of BC020841) probes. Heterologous Expression of DUOX2 and DUOXA2 Constructs—cDNA was synthesized with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) by oligo(dT) priming of total RNA from a normal human thyroid gland. The DUOX2 and DUOXA2 ORFs were amplified using native Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Epitope-tagged constructs and fusions with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were prepared by replacement or splicing-by-overlap extension using specifically designed primers. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HeLa cells were cultured and transfected as described (13Grasberger H. Ringkananont U. Lefrancois P. Abramowicz M. Vassart G. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence of permeabilized cells has been described previously (13Grasberger H. Ringkananont U. Lefrancois P. Abramowicz M. Vassart G. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For surface staining, cells were incubated with rat anti-HA clone 3F10 and/or mouse anti-c-myc clone 9E10 (both from Roche Applied Science) at 1 μg/ml in Hank's buffered saline solution/10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-calnexin was obtained from StressGen. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse E800 equipped with PCM2000. Analysis of N-Glycosylation—Postnuclear supernatants (in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and proteinase inhibitors) were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, 0.4 mm dithiotreitol and denatured, at room temperature, for 30 min. Samples were deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (both from New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's recommendations, followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotting as described (13Grasberger H. Ringkananont U. Lefrancois P. Abramowicz M. Vassart G. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Measurement of H2O2 Generation—Release of H2O2 was determined by reaction with cell-impermeable 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (14Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) (Amplex Red reagent, Invitrogen) in the presence of excess peroxidase, producing fluorescent resorufin. Briefly, cell monolayers were incubated, with or without 10 μm diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 50 μm Amplex Red reagent and 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 37°C. Relative fluorescence units (excitation/emission: 535/595) were corrected for Amplex Red oxidation in wells containing non-transfected cells and converted into H2O2 concentrations using a calibration curve. Renilla luciferase activity from co-transfected pRL-Tk plasmid (Promega) was used as internal control as described (13Grasberger H. Ringkananont U. Lefrancois P. Abramowicz M. Vassart G. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1779-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Identification of Novel Genes in the DUOX1/DUOX2 Intergenic Region—We used MPSS data for 32 normal human tissues (9Jongeneel C.V. Delorenzi M. Iseli C. Zhou D. Haudenschild C.D. Khrebtukova I. Kuznetsov D. Stevenson B.J. Strausberg R.L. Simpson A.J. Vasicek T.J. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) to identify novel transcripts with predominant expression in thyroid gland. One of the extracted tags mapped to an uncharacterized locus (LOC405753) oriented head-to-head to DUOX2 in the ∼16-kbp DUOX1/DUOX2 intergenic region. For reasons outlined below, we called the corresponding gene DUOX maturation factor 2 (DUOXA2). 3The gene name and symbol have been approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. Based on human-mouse homology (Riken clone 9030623N16Rik), and supported by contig assembly of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), it comprises six exons, confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from human thyroid tissue (GenBank™ accession number DQ489734). The putative transcription start site defined by clone DKFZp686C04213 maps to a GpC rich region (Fig. 1A). This site is 135 bp from the 5′ terminus of a spliced DUOX2 EST (BI045475) on the opposite strand. A single polyadenylation signal (Fig. 1A) is supported by all mapped 3′ ESTs. We confirmed a specific transcript of the expected size (1.3 kbp) by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B), which also validated the MPSS-based expression profiling: DUOXA2 mRNA was by far most abundant in thyroid, with lower levels in salivary glands reflecting the known expression profile of DUOX2 (1Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D. Virion A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37265-37269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 2De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C.

Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The DUOXA2 ORF is initiated within a Kozak consensus (gcagcATGa) and spans all six exons. The encoded 320-amino acid protein was strongly predicted to comprise five membrane-integral regions, including a reverse signal anchor with external N terminus (type III) (Fig. 1C). The three NX(S/T) consensus sites for N-glycosylation are clustered within an extended external loop connecting the second and third transmembrane helices. We identified a single DUOXA2 paralog in the human genome. We will refer to this locus, annotated as “homolog of Drosophila Numb-interacting protein,” as DUOXA1. It is immediately adjacent, in tail-to-tail orientation to DUOXA2 and extends, via untranslated exons, into the DUOX1 promoter region. DUOXA1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in thyroid gland and, at lower level, in esophagus (Fig. 1B). Two transcripts of ∼2.9 and ∼3.5 kbp were detected, compatible with alternative splicing of 5′-untranslated exons and the use of alternative 3′-polyadenylation signals (data not shown). The DUOXA1 ORF was confirmed by sequencing from human thyroid cDNA (GenBank™ accession number DQ489735). By spliced alignment, we deduced the gene structures of all DUOXA homologs in 10 other vertebrate whole genome assemblies. The splicing sites of all structures were conserved at the single codon level (exon alignment shown in Fig. 2S in the on-line supplement). Remarkably, the bidirectional DUOX/DUOXA arrangement was conserved throughout the vertebrate lineage (Fig. 1E, accession numbers of genomic contigs available in Table 4S in the on-line supplement). Teleosts have a single DUOX/DUOXA arrangement, which has undergone tandem duplication to an inverted repeat (DUOX2/DUOXA2/DUOXA1/DUOX1) before the amphibian divergence. Analyzing unassembled genomic contigs, we mapped the evolutionary event leading to the bidirectional association of DUOX and DUOXA before the divergence of echinoderms, since linkage of the loci was present in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Thus, conserved microsynteny in deuterostomes was a strong predictor for cooperation between DUOX and DUOXA. The protostomes C. elegans and D. melanogaster lack a DUOXA homolog in the vicinity of their respective duox loci. They do, however, each harbor a single ancient DUOXA homolog. For instance, Drosophila moladietz (mol) encodes a 474-amino acid protein that exhibits 39% amino acid identity over 256 amino acids with human DUOXA1. Functional Rescue of DUOX2 by DUOXA2—To test whether DUOXA2 can reconstitute DUOX2 activity in a heterologous system, we expressed either DUOX2, DUOXA2, or both in HeLa cells and measured H2O2 released into the culture medium. Transfection of either DUOX2 or DUOXA2 alone did not result in increased H2O2 generation compared with nontransfected cells, confirming previous results for DUOX2 (2De Deken X. Wang D. Many M.C. Costagliola S. Libert F. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Miot F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23227-23233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 4De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Remarkably, co-transfection of DUOX2 with DUOXA2 rescued DUOX2 activity as indicated by the significant amounts of H2O2 released from the cells (Fig. 2A). The H2O2 release triggered by DUOX2/DUOXA2 co-transfection was completely blocked by the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI (Fig. 2A). Co-expression of DUOXA2 Permits ER-Exit of DUOX2 and Plasma Membrane Targeting via the Secretory Pathway—Lack of DUOX2 activity in heterologous systems has been associated with absence of DUOX2 at the plasma membrane (4De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To directly test whether reconstitution of active DUOX2 by DUOXA2 is indeed due to translocation of DUOX2 to the plasma membrane, we HA-tagged DUOX2 at its extracellular domain (HA-DUOX2; tag inserted between Asp27 and Ala28). Non-permeabilized cells showed strong anti-HA plasma membrane signals in cells co-transfected with HA-DUOX2 and DUOXA2 (Fig. 2B). Untransfected cells, or cells transfected with either DUOXA2 or HA-DUOX2 alone, were devoid of surface fluorescence (Fig. 2B and data not shown). To determine whether DUOXA2-induced surface expression of DUOX2 involved ER-to-Golgi transition of DUOX2, we analyzed the maturation of DUOX2 N-glycan moieties using specific glycosidases. Whereas all N-glycans are cleavable by PNGase F, the ER-derived high-mannose type N-glycans become resistant to Endo H once they have been modified by Golgi-localized enzymes. HA-DUOX2 expressed in HeLa cells migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE and was sensitive to full deglycosylation by Endo H, consistent with published data (4De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast, co-transfection with DUOXA2 resulted in the appearance of a second DUOX2 species with slightly decreased mobility and complete resistance to deglycosylation by Endo H (Fig. 2C). These findings resembled those previously obtained with endogenous DUOX2 protein (4De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Morand S. Chaaraoui M. Kaniewski J. Deme D. Ohayon R. Noel-Hudson M.S. Virion A. Dupuy C.

Physiol. 2005; 288: G933-G942Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that expression of DUOX2 in our reconstituted system involved normal maturation of DUOX2 within the secretory pathway. Characterization of DUOXA2 as ER-resident Protein—DUOXA2 could be an integral part of a DUOX2 complex, endowing a holocomplex with the ability to exit the ER and reach the plasma membrane. We, therefore, determined whether myc-tagged DUOXA2 alone or in combination with DUOX2 would be detectable at the plasma membrane. Of several constructs tested, only DUOXA2 with N-(myc-DUOXA2) or C-terminal (DUOXA2-myc/His) attached myc tags were fully functional in rescuing DUOX2 activity as assessed by H2O2 generation and HA-DUOX2 plasma membrane targeting (data not shown). However, neither myc-DUOXA2 nor DUOXA2-myc/His was detectable at the plasma membrane (data not shown), although they had the expected size on Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A) and intracellularly co-localized with HA-DUOX2 (Fig. 3B). To exclude that this was due to a discrepancy between the modeled and actual DUOXA2 membrane topology or due to masking of the N-terminal epitope tag, we fused EGFP/myc to the C terminus of DUOXA2 (an N-terminal fusion was not functional). As shown in Fig. 3C, DUOXA2-EGFP/myc did not co-localize with HA-DUOX2 at the plasma membrane, the latter delineated by anti-HA surface staining. The intracellular distribution of DUOXA2-EGFP/myc (and of DUOXA2-myc/His) showed a similar distribution pattern as the ER-marker calnexin (Fig. 3D). To further corroborate that DUOXA2 is indeed an ER-resident protein, we analyzed the maturation of DUOXA2-myc/His N-glycosylation in cells co-expressing HA-DUOX2. We found that the N-glycans of DUOXA2-myc/His were exclusively of the high-mannose type (Fig. 3E). In contrast, detection of HA-DUOX2 in the same samples demonstrated, again, that about half of DUOX2 protein had been subject to Golgi modification of its glycosylation (data not shown, compare Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results indicate that DUOXA2 is not an integral part of a DUOX2 enzyme complex at the plasma membrane but an ER-resident protein promoting ER exit and maturation of DUOX2. It should be noted that N-glycosylation of DUOXA2 supports our topology model (Fig. 1C), since the apparent molecular weight of the N-glycan moieties (∼10 kDa) indicates N-glycosylation of all three consensus sites. An Evolutionary Perspective on the Physiological Role of DUOXA—The DUOX/DUOXA transcriptional unit is an excellent example of bidirectional transcription of tightly linked genes that are not structurally related but are involved in the same pathway, an arrangement considered equivalent to a prokaryotic operon (17Gavalas A. Dixon J.E. Brayton K.A. Zalkin H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4784-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast to the organization in deuterostomes, the two protostomal DUOXA-homologs analyzed were not genetically linked to duox; in fruit flies, there is also evidence for a distinct functional speciation. The Drosophila DUOXA-homolog (mol) encodes a plasma membrane protein (mol-PA) implicated in the polarized recruitment of a cytosolic signal mediator (Numb) to the plasma membrane (18Qin H. Percival-Smith A. Li C. Jia C.Y. Gloor G. Li S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11304-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). That mol-PA may not cooperate with Drosophila Duox is also suggested by the distinct phenotypes caused by deficiency of mol (memory loss; listed as CG4482 in Ref 19Dubnau J. Chiang A.S. Grady L.

Science. 2005; 310: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this functional divergence relates to a distinct topology prediction of the region likely crucial for functional speciation of mol-PA and DUOXA. In DUOXA, the second and third transmembrane helices are connected by an extended luminal loop consistent with N-glycosylation of DUOXA2 (Figs. 1C and 3E). In mol-PA, the equivalent region harbors a binding motif crucial for recruitment of Numb (18Qin H. Percival-Smith A. Li C. Jia C.Y. Gloor G. Li S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11304-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which, therefore, would have to be cytosolic. Analysis of the residue-wise posterior probabilities for a given state (inside/outside/transmembrane) in the 1-best Phobius topology models indeed supports such a scenario of distinct membrane topologies: the profile of transmembrane probabilities in mol-PA, but not vertebrate DUOXA, indicates the potential for two additional membrane-spanning helices (Fig. 1D), which would flank the Numb-binding motif resulting in its cytosolic exposure. If, as we propose, DUOX expression in Drosophila does not require mol, what could have been the advantage of a DUOX/DUOXA system that caused its maintenance in deuterostomes over more than 500 million years (21Douzery E.J. Snell E.A. Bapteste E. Delsuc F. Philippe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15386-15391Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) of divergent evolution? For unexplained reasons, in sea urchin eggs (22Wong J.L. Creton R. Wessel G.M. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 801-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and likewise in follicular thyroid cells (4De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the bulk of DUOX protein is not detected at the cell surface but in intracellular compartments, which could provide a stimulus-recruitable pool. Thus, from an evolutionary perspective, the emergence of DUOXA may have provided an additional level of DUOX regulation, specifically, the control of DUOX translocation to the plasma membrane. The ability to reconstitute active DUOX enzyme will provide the tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying DUOX expression in diverse model systems.

https://openalex.org/W2064438779,"Local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites is critical for synaptic plasticity. However, the signaling cascades that couple synaptic activation to dendritic protein synthesis remain elusive. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of glutamate receptors and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in regulating dendritic protein synthesis in live neurons. We first characterized the involvement of various subtypes of glutamate receptors and the mTOR kinase in regulating dendritic synthesis of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter controlled byαCaMKII 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions in cultured hippocampal neurons. Specific antagonists of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), and metabotropic glutamate receptors abolished glutamate-induced dendritic GFP synthesis, whereas agonists of NMDA and metabotropic but not AMPA glutamate receptors activated GFP synthesis in dendrites. Inhibitions of the mTOR signaling, as well as its upstream activators, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT, blocked NMDA receptor-dependent dendritic GFP synthesis. Conversely, activation of mTOR signaling stimulated dendritic GFP synthesis. In addition, we also found that inhibition of the mTOR kinase blocked dendritic synthesis of the endogenous αCaMKII and MAP2 proteins induced by tetanic stimulations in hippocampal slices. These results identify critical roles of NMDA receptors and the mTOR signaling pathway for control of synaptic activity-induced dendritic protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons. Local protein synthesis in neuronal dendrites is critical for synaptic plasticity. However, the signaling cascades that couple synaptic activation to dendritic protein synthesis remain elusive. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of glutamate receptors and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in regulating dendritic protein synthesis in live neurons.

Despite these important observations, the role of glutamate receptors in regulating dendritic protein synthesis in live neurons has not been systematically investigated. Besides synaptic activity, other factors such as estrogen and BDNF also regulate dendritic protein synthesis (21Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M.

Miniature activities may play a critical role in repressing dendritic mRNAs from translation (26Sutton M.A. Wall N.R. Aakalu G.N. Schuman E.M. Science. 2004; 304: 1979-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).

The mechanisms that couple synaptic activities to the activation of dendritic protein synthesis are poorly understood. The Aurora signaling was suggested to control activity-dependent translational activation by regulating polyadenylation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-containing mRNAs (e.g. αCaMKII) (32Wu L.

Neuronsci. 2001; 21: 9541-9548Crossref Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-dependent polyadenylation of the αCaMKII mRNA in neurons is also regulated by CaMKII signaling (35Atkins C.M. Nozaki N. Shigeri Y. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5193-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MAPK signaling was found to be required for NMDA receptor-mediated activation of Mnk1 kinase, which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) (36Banko J.L. Hou L. Klann E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of MAPK signaling impaired not only l-LTP and memory consolidation, which are protein synthesis-dependent, but also activity-regulated phosphorylation of multiple translation initiation factors (37Kelleher R.J. III Govindarajan Jung A. Kang H.Y. H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, mTOR signaling regulates translation by modulating the activity of eIF-4E, the cap-binding protein, and other proteins that are involved in translation initiation and elongation such as p70S6K, eIF-4GI, eIF-4B, and eEF2 (38Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The mTOR signaling pathway is present in the hippocampal neurons at the synaptic region (39Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 942-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Despite the suggestive evidence, the role of the mTOR signaling in control of synaptic activity-dependent dendritic proteins remains to be directly demonstrated. In this study, we specifically tested the role of glutamate receptors and the mTOR signaling pathway in regulating activity-dependent protein synthesis in the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Using a GFP reporter with the αCaMKII 5′ and 3′ UTRs (21Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we first investigated the role of NMDA, AMPA, and mGlu receptors and mTOR signaling in regulation of dendritic protein synthesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. We found that NMDARs, AMPARs, and mGluRs are required for glutamate-induced dendritic GFP synthesis, whereas activation of NMDARs and mGluRs but not AMPARs led to GFP synthesis in dendrites. Inhibition of mTOR signaling abolished NMDAR- and mGluR-dependent synthesis of dendritic GFP. Similarly, inhibition of the mTOR upstream activators PI3K and AKT also disrupted NMDA receptor-dependent dendritic GFP synthesis. On the other hand, activation of mTOR signaling was sufficient to induce GFP synthesis in dendrites. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that tetanus-induced dendritic synthesis of the αCaMKII protein in hippocampal slices also required the activation of NMDA receptors and the mTOR signaling. Reagents—All cell culture media and Lipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen; phosphatidic acid (1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl) from Avanti Polar Lipids; Ascomycin and SH-6 from Calbiochem; LY294002 and wortmannin from BioMol; poly-d-lysine, laminin, glutamate, anisomycin, rapamycin, d-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), NMDA, AMPA, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), (+)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), and trans-ACPD from Sigma; anti-rat CaM kinase II monoclonal antibodies from Affinity BioReagents; and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The rapamycin-resistant mTOR mutant cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Jie Chen. Neuron Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from E17 mouse embryos as previously described (61Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 1998: 339-370Google Scholar). Neurons were plated at a density of 200-400 cells/mm2 on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. Cells were maintained in 24-well plates with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27 and 0.5 mm l-glutamine for 10-14 days before use. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-5′UTR-dGFP-3′UTR plasmids (1 μg/coverslip), using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. In co-transfection experiments, 1 μg of GFP reporter DNA and 2 μg of rapamycin-resistant mTOR expression DNA were used. Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. Electrophysiology—For all electrophysiology experiments, hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 6-8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Area CA1 of the hippocampal slice was divided into two separate sections by introducing a lesion extending from stratum pyramidal through stratum radiatum up to the hippocampal fissure. Prior to recording, slices were allowed to recover first for 2 h at room temperature in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 26.2 mm NaHCO3, 11.0 mm glucose), and then for 30 min at 27 °C in the submerged recording chamber that was continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials of Schaffer Collateral-Commissural pathway synapses were evoked with concentric bipolar tungsten stimulating electrodes and recorded with low-resistance glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m NaCl every 2 min. Both stimulating and recording electrodes were visually placed in the middle of stratum radiatum in the section of area CA1 proximal to CA3. LTP was induced by high-frequency stimulations (4 trains of 1-s 100 Hz stimulations spaced by 30-s intervals). All drugs in oxygenated ACSF were perfused into the recording chamber throughout the entire duration of the recording. Immunohistochemistry—Hippocampal slices (400 μm) after electrophysiology experiments were immediately fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% glutaraldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 1 h. Slices were sectioned (25 μm) using a Vibratome 3000, permeabilized in 0.7% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h, washed with PBS (2 × 5 min), rinsed in 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 1 h, treated with 1% sodium borohydride in ddH2O at room temperature for 20 min, and incubated in pre-block buffer (0.05% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum in PBS) for 90 min and then with primary antibody (1:100) in pre-block buffer overnight (4 °C). After three washes (3 × 30 min) with the pre-block buffer at room temperature, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:100) in the pre-block buffer at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed with PBS (3 × 5 min) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagents (Molecular Probes). Image Acquisition and Analysis—For culture neurons, 24 h after transfection, neurons on coverslips were placed in a 35-mm dish containing HEPES-buffered solution (62Malgaroli A. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) without glycine or picrotoxin. Healthy pyramidal neurons that expressed GFP were chosen for experimentation. Selected dendrites were photobleached by exciting GFP at 494 nm (100-W mercury lamp) for 10-60 s until the GFP signals were barely seen. Appropriate drugs were added to the medium immediately after photobleaching. Images were acquired (Olympus BX61 coupled with an FV12 CCD camera) every 15 min immediately after photobleaching and drug applications. Same acquisition parameters and settings were applied to controls and experiments. Fluorescent images were analyzed with MicroSuite software (Olympus). Fluorescent intensity in a distal segment (>100 μm from the cell body) of the photobleached dendrites was quantified with Image J (NIH). Changes of the mean fluorescent intensity in dendrites over time were determined by ΔF = (Ft - F0)/F0 (F, mean fluorescent intensity in dendrites; ΔF, the difference of the mean fluorescent intensity in dendrites between time t and time 0 (immediately after photobleaching and drug applications); Ft, mean fluorescent intensity of photobleached dendrites after treatments at time t; F0, mean fluorescent intensity of the dendritic segment at time 0). Statistical significance of differences between groups was determined by independent Student's t tests or analysis of variance (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Hippocampal Sections—Fluorescent images of the whole hippocampal section after immunostaining were acquired with a ×4 object on an Olympus BX61 microscope. Acquisition parameters were optimized to avoid signal saturation. To quantify fluorescent signals, we used Image J software (NIH) to select regions of interest (ROIs) in stimulated and control sides of original images. ROI is a square (100 × 100 μm) 100 μm away from the cutting edge and the CA1 cell body layer. The mean pixel intensity of individual ROIs was quantified with Image J. The ratio of mean intensities between stimulated and control ROIs was determined. Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of ratio differences between groups. Membrane Depolarization Activates NMDA Receptor-dependent Synthesis of the GFP Reporter Protein in Dendrites of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—We adapted the GFP imaging approach developed by Aakalu et al. (21Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) to monitor dendritic protein synthesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. Briefly, primary mouse hippocampal neurons were transfected with the GFP reporter plasmid that contains the 5′ and 3′ UTRs from αCaMKII; selective dendrites were photobleached to enhance the detection sensitivity of newly synthesized GFP; GFP recovery in photobleached dendrites was monitored by time lapse imaging. Because the GFP was tethered to membrane by a myristoylation sequence to limit its movement, GFP recovery in dendritic segments distal to the cell body (>100 μm) was due to new protein synthesis rather than diffusion from other cell compartments (21Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To determine whether neuronal activities can stimulate GFP synthesis in dendrites, we examined the effect of KCl-mediated depolarization on GFP recovery in photobleached dendrites. Compared with sham treatments, KCl (35 mm) stimulation dramatically increased the magnitude of GFP recovery in distal dendrites (Fig. 1). Consistent with previous observations that the BDNF-induced GFP increase in dendrites was sensitive to translation inhibitors (21Aakalu G. Smith W.B. Nguyen N. Jiang C. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2001; 30: 489-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), the KCl-stimulated enhancement of dendrite GFP recovery was blocked by anisomycin (Fig. 1). These observations strongly suggest that the recovery of GFP in photobleached dendrites was due to in situ protein synthesis. Depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane can activate NMDA receptors by relieving the Mg2+ block. To determine whether NMDA receptors are required for KCl-stimulated GFP protein synthesis in dendrites, we determined the effect of the NMDA receptor antagonist d-APV on GFP recovery. The results showed that the KCl-stimulated dendrite GFP recovery was abolished in the presence of APV (50 μm) (Fig. 1). This result suggests that NMDA receptor signaling plays a critical role in KCl-activated dendrite protein synthesis. Activation of Glutamate Receptors Stimulates GFP Synthesis in Dendrites—The results described above suggest that pan neuronal activity evoked by KCl-mediated membrane depolarization is sufficient to induce dendritic GFP synthesis. To test if the direct activation of excitatory synapses can also stimulate GFP synthesis in dendrites, we treated transfected neurons with glutamate (10 μm), which is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in vivo, to activate glutamate receptors. We observed that application of glutamate significantly enhanced GFP recovery in photobleached dendrites compared with sham treatments (Figs. 2, 4, and 5, A and B). These results suggest that activation of glutamate receptors leads to translational activation in dendrites. We next sought to investigate the role of specific classes of glutamate receptors in dendritic GFP synthesis.FIGURE 4Requirements of AMPA receptors for glutamate-induced GFP synthesis in dendrites.

Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Involvement of NMDA Receptors in Dendritic GFP Synthesis—NMDA receptors are a major class of glutamate receptors that are critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We wished to investigate if disruption of NMDA receptor signaling can block glutamate-stimulated GFP synthesis in dendrites. Toward this end, we used the NMDA receptor antagonist APV. We demonstrated that APV (50 μm) was able to completely abolish glutamate-induced dendritic GFP synthesis (Fig. 2). These observations indicated that NMDA receptors are required for glutamate-induced GFP synthesis in dendrites. We next determined if the direct activation of NMDA receptors is able to cause GFP synthesis in dendrites. The results showed that NMDA treatments enhanced GFP recovery in photobleached dendrites; this GFP recovery was blocked by APV and anisomycin (Fig. 3). The NMDA-induced GFP recovery was also abolished by another translation inhibitor emetine (supplemental Fig. 1). These results indicate the GFP recovery induced by NMDA receptor activation was due to protein synthesis rather than other posttranslational processes such as protein transport from cell bodies. To further exclude the contribution of GFP and mRNA transport, we determined the effect of nocodazole and cytochalasin B, the inhibitors for microtubule- or actin-based cytoskeleton, respectively. The result showed that NMDA still stimulated GFP recovery in the presence of these inhibitors (supplemental Fig. 2). Both nocodazole and cytochalasin B induced an appreciable but not significant decrease of GFP recovery, probably due to their effects on cell healthiness. Together, these observations suggest that NMDAR activation induced GFP synthesis in dendrites of live neurons. Involvement of AMPA Receptors in Dendritic GFP Synthesis—The AMPA class of glutamate receptors plays a critical role in gating the activity of NMDA receptors (44Malenka R.C. Bear M.F. Neuron. 2004; 44: 5-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2976) Google Scholar). We sought to investigate whether AMPA receptors are involved in regulation of glutamate-stimulated GFP synthesis in dendrites. For this purpose, we used CNQX, a specific antagonist for AMPA receptors. We observed that applications of CNQX (10 μm) abolished glutamate-induced GFP synthesis (Fig. 4). These results suggest a requirement of AMPA receptor dendritic GFP synthesis activated by glutamate stimulations. We also determined the effect of AMPA, a specific agonist for AMPA receptors. In contrast to NMDA treatments, applications of AMPA (10 μm) showed an inhibitory effect on GFP recovery in photobleached dendrites (supplemental Fig. 3). Involvement of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors in Dendritic GFP Synthesis—mGluRs are a class of G protein-coupled glutamate receptors that regulate Ca2+ release from intracellular calcium stores. We first studied the effect of MCPG, a specific antagonist for group I and II mGluRs. The results showed that applications of MCPG (200 μm) abolished glutamate-induced GFP synthesis in dendrites (Fig. 5, A and B). These observations indicate a requirement of group I and II mGluRs in dendritic GFP synthesis induced by glutamate stimulations. To investigate if the activation of mGluRs is able to induce dendritic GFP synthesis, we used trans-(±)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) to stimulate group I and II mGluRs. We found that applications of ACPD (50 μm) stimulated GFP synthesis in dendrites (Fig. 5, C and D). This ACPD-stimulated GFP synthesis was blocked by MCPG (Fig. 5, C and D). These results suggest that the activation of group I and II mGluRs is sufficient to induce GFP synthesis in dendrites. However, in contrast to the stimulation effects of glutamate and NMDA (Figs. 2, 3, 4), ACPD-induced GFP synthesis did not reach a significant level at 15 min compared to the sham control (Fig. 5D). This observation suggests that the kinetics of group I and II mGluR-activated GFP synthesis was slower than that induced by NMDA receptor activation (Fig. 3C).

Here we found that the spike timing of CB1R-expressing basket cells, a major target for cannabinoids in the rat hippocampus, was distinct from the other main group of basket cells, the CB1R-negative. Despite receiving the same afferent inputs, the synaptic and biophysical properties of the two cell types were tuned to detect different features of activity. CB1R-negative basket cells responded reliably and immediately to subtle and repetitive excitation. In contrast, CB1R-positive basket cells responded later and did not follow repetitive activity, but were better suited to integrate the consecutive excitation of independent afferents. This temporal separation in the activity of the two basket cell types generated distinct epochs of somatic inhibition that were differentially affected by endocannabinoids."

https://openalex.org/W2005458602,"Dynamin I is dephosphorylated at Ser-774 and Ser-778 during synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) in nerve terminals. Phosphorylation was proposed to regulate the assembly of an endocytic protein complex with amphiphysin or endophilin. Instead, we found it recruits syndapin I for SVE and does not control amphiphysin or endophilin binding in rat synaptosomes. After depolarization, syndapin showed a calcineurin-mediated interaction with dynamin. A peptide mimicking the phosphorylation sites disrupted the dynamin-syndapin complex, not the dynamin-endophilin complex, arrested SVE and produced glutamate release fatigue after repetitive stimulation. Pseudophosphorylation of Ser-774 or Ser-778 inhibited syndapin binding without affecting amphiphysin recruitment. Site mutagenesis to alanine arrested SVE in cultured neurons. The effects of the sites were additive for syndapin I binding and SVE. Thus syndapin I is a central component of the endocytic protein complex for SVE via stimulus-dependent recruitment to dynamin I and has a key role in synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1992298828,"The neurofibromatosis type 2 NF2 gene product, merlin, is a tumor suppressor frequently inactivated in malignant mesothelioma (MM). To investigate a possible correlation between merlin inactivation and MM invasiveness, we restored merlin expression in NF2-deficient MM cells. Re-expression of merlin markedly inhibited cell motility, spreading and invasiveness, properties connected with the malignant phenotype of MM cells. To test directly whether merlin inactivation promotes invasion in a nonmalignant system, we used small interfering RNA to silence Nf2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and found that downregulation of merlin resulted in enhanced cell spreading and invasion. To delineate signaling events connected with this phenotype, we investigated the effect of merlin expression on focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key component of cellular pathways affecting migration and invasion. Expression of merlin attenuated FAK phosphorylation at the critical phosphorylation site Tyr397 and disrupted the interaction of FAK with its binding partners Src and p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. In addition, NF2-null MM cells stably overexpressing FAK showed increased invasiveness, which decreased significantly when merlin expression was restored. Collectively, these findings suggest that merlin inactivation is a critical step in MM pathogenesis and is related, at least in part, with upregulation of FAK activity."

https://openalex.org/W2098679175,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in embryogenesis and has been linked to the development of several human malignancies. The transcription factor Gli2 plays a key role in the transduction of Hh signals by modulating transcription of some Hh target genes, yet the mechanisms that control Gli2 protein expression are largely unknown. Here we report that beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase is required for Gli2 degradation. beta-TrCP2 directly binds wild type Gli2 and promotes its ubiquitination. Single amino acid substitution in Gli2 putative binding site inhibits its interaction with beta-TrCP2, its ubiquitination, and stabilizes the Gli2 protein. Stable Gli2 mutant is expressed in higher levels and is more potent in the activation of Gli-dependent transcription as compared with wild type Gli2. We also found that GLI2 protein is expressed highly in prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumors, whereas the level of GLI2 mRNA is not appreciably different in normal and neoplastic prostate. These data identify beta-TrCP2 as a pivotal regulator of Gli2 expression and point to an important role for posttranslational modulation of GLI2 protein levels in Hh pathway-associated human prostate cancer."

In functional experiments, tet-regulated induction of CD44s potentiated the migration and invasion of MCF7F cells through HA-supplemented Matrigel. EMS1/cortactin was identified by expression profiling as a novel transcriptional target of HA/CD44 signaling, an association validated by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting experiments in a range of breast cancer cell lines. The mechanistic basis underpinning CD44-promoted transcription of EMS1/cortactin was shown to be dependent upon a NFκB mechanism, since pharmacological inhibition of IκKinase-2 or suppression of p65 Rel A expression attenuated CD44-induced increases in cortactin mRNA transcript levels. Overexpression of a c-myc tagged murine cortactin construct in the weakly invasive, CD44-deficient MCF7F and T47D cells potentiated their invasion. Furthermore, the functional importance of cortactin to CD44s-promoted metastasis was demonstrated by selective suppression of cortactin in CD44-expressing MCF7F-B5 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using RNAi, which was shown to result in attenuated CD44-promoted invasion and CD44-promoted adhesion to bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs)."
https://openalex.org/W2059272440,"X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) plays a key role in DNA base excision repair and cells lacking its activity are hypersensitive to DNA damage. Recently, we reported a SNP (rs3213245, −77T>C) in the XRCC1 gene 5′ untranslated region (UTR) was significantly associated with the risk of developing esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Computer analysis predicted that this SNP was in the core of Sp1-binding motif, which suggested its functional significance. Gel shift and super shift assays confirmed that −77T>C polymorphic site in the XRCC1 promoter was within the Sp1-binding motif and the T>C substitution greatly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1 to this region. Luciferase assays indicated that the Sp1-high-affinity C-allelic XRCC1 promoter was associated with a reduced transcriptional activity. The association between −77T>C and three other amino-acid substitution-causing polymorphisms in XRCC1 and risk of lung cancer was examined in 1024 patients and 1118 controls and the results showed that only the −77T>C polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that an increased risk of lung cancer was associated with the variant XRCC1 −77 genotypes (TC and CC) compared with the TT genotype (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.18–1.82; P=0.001) and the increased risk was more pronounced in smokers (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.20–2.21) than in non-smokers (OR=1.28, 95% CI=0.94–1.76). Taken together, these results showed that the functional SNP −77T>C in XRCC1 5′UTR was associated with cancer development owing to the decreased transcriptional activity of C-allele-containing promoter with higher affinity to Sp1 binding."
https://openalex.org/W2155317973,"A major obstacle for clinicians in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer is the inevitable progression to chemoresistance, especially to docetaxel. It is essential to understand the molecular events that lead to docetaxel resistance in order to identify means to prevent or interfere with chemoresistance. In initial attempts to detect these events, we analysed genomic differences between non-resistant and docetaxel-resistant prostate tumor cells and, of the genes modulated by docetaxel treatment, we observed Stat1 and clusterin gene expression heightened in the resistant phenotype. In this study, we provide biochemical and biological evidence that these two gene products are related. Stat1 and clusterin protein expression was induced upon docetaxel treatment of DU145 cells and highly overexpressed in the docetaxel-resistant DU145 cells (DU145-DR). The increase in total Stat1 corresponded to an increase in phosphorylated Stat1. Interestingly, there was no detectable difference between DU145 and DU145-DR cells expression of total Stat3 and phosphorylated Stat3. Treatment of DU145-DR cells with small interfering RNA targeted for Stat1 not only resulted in the knockdown of Stat1 expression, but it also caused the inhibition of clusterin expression. Thus, Stat1 appears to play a key role in the regulation of clusterin. Remarkably, inhibition of Stat1 or clusterin expression resulted in the re-sensitization of DU145-DR cells to docetaxel. These results offer the first evidence that Stat1, and its subsequent regulation of clusterin, are essential for docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer. Targeting this pathway could be a potential therapeutic means for intervention of docetaxel resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2069484009,"Pax9 and Msx1 encode transcription factors that are known to be essential for the switch in odontogenic potential from the epithelium to the mesenchyme. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these molecules play an important role in the maintenance of mesenchymal Bmp4 expression, which ultimately drives morphogenesis of the dental organ. Here we demonstrate that Pax9 is able to directly regulate Msx1 expression and interact with Msx1 at the protein level to enhance its ability to transactivate Msx1 and Bmp4 expression during tooth development. In addition, we tested how a missense mutation (T62C) in the paired domain of PAX9 that is responsible for human tooth agenesis (1) affects its functions. Our data indicate that although the mutant Pax9 protein (L21P) can bind to the Msx1 protein, it fails to transactivate the Msx1 and Bmp4 promoter, presumably because of its inability to bind cognate paired domain recognition sequences. In addition, synergistic transcriptional activation of the Bmp4 promoter was lost with coexpression of mutant Pax9 and wild-type Msx1. This suggests that Pax9 is critical for the regulation of Bmp4 expression through its paired domain rather than Msx1. Our findings demonstrate the partnership of Pax9 and Msx1 in a signaling pathway that involves Bmp4. Furthermore, the regulation of Bmp4 expression by the interaction of Pax9 with Msx1 at the level of transcription and through formation of a protein complex determines the fate of the transition from bud to cap stage during tooth development."

Mer is not normally expressed in thymocytes or lymphocytes; however, ectopic Mer RNA transcript and protein expression is found in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patient samples, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis. To investigate the oncogenic potential of Mer in vivo, we created a transgenic mouse line (MerTg) that expresses Mer in the hematopoietic lineage under control of the Vav promoter. Ectopic expression and activation of the transgenic Mer protein was demonstrated in lymphocytes and thymocytes of the MerTg mice. At 12–24 months of age, greater than 55% of the MerTg mice, compared to 12% of the wild type, developed adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and circulating lymphoblasts. Histopathological analysis and flow cytometry were consistent with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Mer may contribute to leukemogenesis by activation of Akt and ERK1/2 anti-apoptotic signals, which were upregulated in MerTg mice. Additionally, a significant survival advantage was noted in MerTg lymphocytes compared to wild-type lymphocytes after dexamethasone treatment. These data suggest that Mer plays a cooperative role in leukemogenesis and may be an effective target for biologically based leukemia/lymphoma therapy."

In addition, we show for the first time that C5b-9 induces cell migration through the release of soluble factors. For C5b-9-induced endothelial cell proliferation, we studied the requirement of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the role of FOXO1. We show that PI3K/Akt is required for endothelial cell cycle activation by C5b-9, and this leads to the inactivation of FOXO1. C5b-9 induces phosphorylation of FOXO1, unbinding from DNA, and cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1. All of these effects require Akt as shown by using SH-5, a pharmacological inhibitor of Akt, and Akt siRNA.

AEC basal medium with growth supplements was from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD).Primary Aortic Endothelial Cell (AEC) Culture—Primary human AEC (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) were cultured in endothelial cell growth media (EGM) that contained basal medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 2 ng/ml human fibroblast growth factor, 5 μg/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, 0.1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.5 μg/ml heparin. After 3–5 passages, cells were starved for 18 h in endothelial cell basal media without serum and growth supplements. All cells were positive for von Willebrand factor antigen, when stained with monoclonal anti-von Willebrand Antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) using indirect immunoperoxidase method.Activation of Serum Complement and Terminal Complement Complex (TCC) Assembly—Pooled normal human sera (NHS) from healthy adult donors were used as a source of serum complement. Pooled human sera immunochemically depleted of C7, C8, or C9 (C7D, C8D, or C9D, respectively) and purified human complement proteins were from Quidel (San Diego) and Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego). To assemble TCC, AEC were sensitized with anti-human HLA class A, B, and C monoclonal IgG (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and then exposed with NHS or K76-treated NHS (1:30 dilution). As described previously, K76 COONa (K76) (Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co, Tokyo, Japan) prevents C5b-9 assembly in serum by binding to C5 (36Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar, 37Niculescu F. Rus H. van Biesen T. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4405-4412PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, complement-deficient serum (1/10) and replacement of the missing component (10 μg/ml) were added after antibody sensitization. The sublytic serum complement was titrated previously by using limited doses of antibody and excess NHS and then measuring lactate dehydrogenase release as an indication of cell death (38Carney D.F. Lang T.J. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 623-629PubMed Google Scholar). We also assembled C5b-9 by treating cells sequentially with C5b6, C7, and C8/C9, as described previously (36Rus H.G. Niculescu F. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4892-4900PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay—BrdUrd incorporation was performed using the BrdUrd flow kit (Pharmingen) as described previously (39Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Fosbrink M. Sorana H. Rus V. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, AEC were stimulated with C5b6, C5b-7, C5b-8, and C5b-9 assembled from purified components for 24 h and then labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h. AEC were harvested by trypsinization and then permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer provided by the manufacturer. BrdUrd and DNA were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd and 7-amino-actinomycin D, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-color flow cytometric analysis enumerates and characterizes cells that are actively synthesizing DNA in S-phase. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer and Consort-40 software. Cell number was determined using a Cell Titer 96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (13Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Assay for DNA Synthesis—DNA synthesis was tested as described previously (13Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, AEC treated with antibody and deficient serum were incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine in endothelial cell basal media without serum and growth supplements for 18 h at 37 °C. After washing in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in 0.3 m NaOH. Lysates were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid and then filtered through a Whatman GF/A glass fiber filter (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). The radioactivity on the dried filter was counted by liquid scintillation. In some experiments AEC were pretreated 30 min with wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (25–50 μm) to inhibit PI3K and SH-5 (10 μm) to inhibit Akt. The dose of each inhibitor was predetermined, and used in all experiments.Cell Migration Assay—It has been shown previously that C5b-9 assembly induces the release of growth factors and cytokines (40Benzaquen L.R. Nicholson-Weller A. Halperin J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine whether these released growth factors or cytokines may induce AEC migration, conditioned media from AEC after C5b-9 assembly were used as a chemoattractant. Serum- and growth factor-starved AEC were stimulated with C5b-9 generated from purified components for 6 h. The conditioned media were then used as a chemoattractant. To measure cell migration, Innocyte 96-well cell migration assay (EMD Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the conditioned media were added to the lower chamber, whereas trypsinized AEC were added to the upper chamber of the cell migration chamber. The cells were allowed to migrate through an 8-μm pore size membrane for 18 h. The cells were detached from the membrane and quantitated by labeling with calcein-AM.Angiogenic Factor Protein Array—To identify which growth factors are released after C5b-9 stimulation, RayBio® human angiogenesis antibody array 1.1 (RayBiotech Inc. Norcross, GA) was used to detect the expression of the most important angiogenic factors (angiogenin, epidermal growth factor, ENA-78, basic fibroblast growth factor, GRO, interferon-γ, insulin-like growth factor-1, IL-6, IL-8, leptin, MCP-1, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, PlGF, RANTES, transforming growth factor-β, TIMP-1, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and VEGF-D) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, AEC were cultured in serum- and growth factor-free media for 18 h. They were treated with C5b-9 or C5b6 assembled from purified components for 1 h. The conditioned media were incubated with the array overnight at 4 °C. The array was washed with Wash Buffer I, three times at room temperature, and then Wash Buffer II, two times at room temperature. Biotin-conjugated anti-angiogenic factors primary antibodies were added at room temperature for 1 h. The array was washed, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the array was developed using ECL, and the proteins were quantitated by densitometry scanning and expressed as the C5b-9/C5b6 ratio.In Vitro Kinase Assays—The activities of PI3K and Akt were determined by in vitro kinase assays as described previously (15Soane L. Cho H.J. Niculescu F. Rus H. Shin M.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2305-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For Akt kinase, the cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt IgG (4μg) and protein A/G-agarose (10 μl). Agarose beads were then incubated in a reaction buffer with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, Akt-specific peptide (RPRAATF) (10 μm) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and 40 μm of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 10 min at 30 °C. Supernatants (5μl) were spotted on P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). After washing three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid and in acetone, the radioactivity of each P81 paper square was counted by liquid scintillation counting. For PI3K, the cell lysates treated with anti-p85 PI3K IgG, as above, were assayed using 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 40 μg of phosphatidylinositol. After 30 min at 37 °C, reaction was terminated, and samples were spotted on TLC plate (Merck). Spots corresponding to phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol were excised and counted (13Niculescu F. Badea T. Rus H. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—For experiments using either SH-5 or Akt siRNA, cells were kept in basal media with 0.5% FBS for 18 h. Treated cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 nm calyculin A. 20–30 μg of protein were loaded, electrophoresed using SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody, followed by incubation with 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized by ECL and quantitated by densitometric scanning.siRNA Transfection—AEC were transfected with a final concentration of 25 nm siRNA using TransIT siQuest reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) for 6 h and then transfected again for another 24 h. Cells were then cultured in basal media supplemented with FBS and growth factors for 18 h.siRNA Target Sequences—siRNA were synthesized by Qiagen (for Akt and CTR siRNA) and by Biopolymer/Genomics core facility at University of Maryland, Baltimore (FOXO1 siRNA). The validated target sequences were as follows: for Akt siRNA (siAkt), 5′-CCTGCCCTTCTACAACCAGGA-3′ (41Katome T. Obata T. Matsushima R. Masuyama N. Cantley L.C. Gotoh Y. Kishi K. Shiota H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28312-28323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar); for FOXO1 siRNA (siFOXO), 5′-GAGCGTGCCCTACTTCAAG-3′ (29Potente M. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Fleming I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29619-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); and for control siRNA (siCTR), 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′.Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Extract Preparation and DNA Binding Assay—To prepare nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts, NE-PER kit was used (Pierce). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and resuspended in cytoplasmic extraction reagent I (CERI) and incubated on ice. Cytoplasmic extraction reagent II (CERII) was then added, and the extracts were further incubated on ice. The extracts were then centrifuged for 15 min, and the cytoplasmic fraction was transferred to a new tube. Nuclear extraction reagent was added to the pellet, and the nuclear pellet was incubated on ice for 40 min while vortexing every 10 min. The extract was centrifuged for 15 min, and the nuclear fraction was transferred to a new tube. CER I and nuclear extraction reagents were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, and 25 nm calyculin A. DNA binding assay was performed using EMSA “Gel-Shift” kit (Panomics Inc., Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2.5 μg of nuclear extract was mixed with biotin-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the FKHR (FOXO1) consensus binding site 5′-CAAAACAA-3′. The reaction was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% TBE-polyacrylamide gel. The DNA-protein complexes were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immobilized by UV irradiation. The membrane was then incubated with streptavidin-HRP, and DNA-protein complexes were detected by ECL.Immunohistochemistry—AEC were cultured on plastic slides and stimulated with C5b-9 for 4 h. The slides were washed in PBS, and the cells were fixed for 20 min in acetone with 3% hydrogen peroxide to inhibit endogenous peroxidase. Slides were washed in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FOXO1 antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS and then with goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was developed using Nova RED (Vector Laboratories) as a substrate, and the slides were then washed in distilled water and counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin (Sigma) and mounted with permanent mount.RESULTSC5b-9 Induces AEC Proliferation—To show that C5b-9 was responsible for cell cycle activation (Fig. 1), AEC were exposed to anti-HLA I antibody + C7-deficient serum (C5b6), C8-deficient serum (C5b-7), C9-deficient serum (C5b-8), or basal media (unstimulated). To assemble C5b-9, C7-deficient serum reconstituted with purified C7 was used. C5b-9 caused a 3.6-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with C5b6 (Fig. 1A), whereas C5b-7 and C5b-8 induced a smaller increase. To show that C5b-9 induces not only S-phase induction but also G2/M-phase entry, AEC were exposed to C5b-9 assembled from purified components and then pulsed with BrdUrd for 1 h, and cell cycle induction was assayed by FACS analysis (Fig. 1B). About 99% of unstimulated cells were arrested in the G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle after 24 h of starvation (Fig. 1B). Treatment of cells with C5b6 failed to induce S-phase entry, whereas C5b-7 and C5b-8 caused 8–9% of cells to enter S-phase with no G2/M-phase entry. When cells were treated with C5b-9, a significant number of cells progressed from G0/G1-phase to S-phase (22%) and G2/M-phase (30%) (Fig. 1B). C5b-9 also induced a 2.2-fold increase in cell number over the C5b6 level after 48 h of stimulation, as determined by MTS cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (data not shown).C5b-9 Induces AEC Migration and Growth Factor Release—One consequence of AEC activation and proliferation is the process of angiogenesis. In angiogenesis, AEC migrate before new blood vessel formation. Because C5b-9 can induce AEC to release pro-angiogenic factors fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (40Benzaquen L.R. Nicholson-Weller A. Halperin J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and IL-8 (42Rus H.G. Vlaicu R. Niculescu F. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 127: 263-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we used C5b-9-stimulated AEC conditioned medium in a chemotactic chamber to test cell migration. AEC were stimulated with C5b-9 assembled from purified components, and the conditioned media were used as a chemoattractant in a cell migration assay. Media from C5b-9-treated cells induced a 2-fold increase in cell migration compared with media from unstimulated or C5b6-treated cells (Fig. 2) suggesting that pro-angiogenic factors released may be implicated in C5b-9-induced AEC migration. EGM, which contains FBS and growth factors, induced the largest increase in AEC migration (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2C5b-9 induces cell migration. AEC were serum- and growth factor-starved for 18 h and then stimulated with C5b-9 or C5b6 assembled from purified components for 6 h. The growth media were transferred to the bottom chamber of Innocyte cell migration assay plate. As a positive control EGM, which contains FBS and growth factors, was used. Trypsinized AEC were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in the upper chamber. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C overnight. The migrated cells were detached from the filter and labeled with calcein-AM. Media from C5b-9 treated cells caused a 2-fold increase in AEC migration over C5b6-treated cells. EGM induced a 4-fold increase over unstimulated (unstim.) cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine what soluble factors are released after C5b-9 stimulation of AEC, an antibody array detecting factors involved in angiogenesis was used. The conditioned media from AEC stimulated with C5b-9 assembled from purified components in serum- and growth factor-free media were used to probe the antibody array. Table 1 lists"

Estradiol (E2) induces human prolactin receptor (hPRLR) gene expression through stimulation of its generic promoter (PIII). This study identifies a novel E2-regulated non-estrogen responsive element-dependent transcriptional mechanism that mediates E2-induced hPRLR expression. E2 stimulated transcriptional activity in MCF7A2 cells transfected with PIII lacking an estrogen responsive element, and increased hPRLR mRNA and protein. The abolition of the E2 effect by mutation of Sp1 or C/EBP elements that bind Sp1/Sp3 and C/EBPβ within PIII indicated the cooperation of these transfactors in E2-induced transcription of the hPRLR. DNA affinity protein assay showed that E2 induced estrogen receptor α (ERα) binding to Sp1/Sp3 and C/EBPβ DNA-protein complexes. The ligand-binding domain of ERα was essential for its physical interaction with C/EBPβ, and E2 promoted this association, and its DNA binding domain was required for transactivation of PIII. Co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed tethering of C/EBPβ to Sp1 by E2-activated ERα. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that E2 induced recruitment of C/EBPβ, ERα, SRC1, p300, pCAF, TFIIB, and Pol II, with no change in Sp1/Sp3. E2 also induced promoter-associated acetylation of H3 and H4. These findings demonstrate that an E2/ERα, Sp1, and C/EBPβ complex with recruitment of coactivators and TFIIB and Pol II are required for E2-activated transcriptional expression of the hPRLR through PIII. Estradiol produced in breast stroma and adipose tissue, which are major sources of estrogen in post-menopausal women, could up-regulate hPRLR gene expression and stimulate breast tumor growth.

Prolactin is a major factor in the proliferation and differentiation of breast epithelium and is the primary hormone in the stimulation and maintenance of lactation. Prolactin is a tumor promoter in rodents (1Wennbo H. Gebre-Medhin M. Gritli-Linde A. Ohlsson C. Isaksson O.G. Tornell J. J. Clin.

The hPRLR has several forms, including long form (stimulatory) and short form(s) (inhibitory) (3Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. Trends Endocrinol.

There is local production of PRL in mammary epithelial cells, and increased expression of the PRLR long form occurs in a significant number of human mammary tumors (9Abu-Bedair F.A.

A lower ratio of short (inhibitory forms)/long (activating form) receptors reported in breast tumor tissues could cause unopposed prolactin-mediated stimulatory actions of the long form and may contribute to breast tumor development and progression (7Meng J.

Moreover, the PRL antagonist G129R was reported to cause apoptosis in breast cancer cells (8Chen W.Y. Ramamoorthy P. Chen N. Sticca R. Wagner T.E. Clin.

Stromal and adipose tissue are the major sources of estrogen in post-menopausal women, and could exert paracrine control of prolactin and prolactin receptor expression in adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our previous studies on the hPRLR gene revealed its complex 5′ genomic structure, with multiple (six) alternative non-coding exons 1 and promoter utilization (15Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Leondires M.

These include the preferentially utilized, generic promoter 1/exon-1 (PIII/hE13), which is also present in rat and mouse, and five human specific exon-1/promoters (hE1N1-5) (15Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2139-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that E2 induced increases of PRLR non-coding exon-1 hE13 (generic) mRNA transcripts directed by promoter III (hPIII) in breast cancer cells. Also, in transfection studies E2 activated the hPIII promoter (18Leondires M.P. Hu Z.Z. Dong J. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The lack of a formal ERE in the hPIII promoter suggested that the effect of estradiol is mediated through association of the activated ER with relevant DNA binding transfactors. Thus, although there is not a classical ERE within the hPRLR promoter/5′-flanking region of hPIII, our initial studies demonstrated an estrogen regulatory role in hPRLR expression. In this study we have investigated control mechanism(s) underlying human PRLR gene expression, and characterized a novel non-classical ERE-independent mechanism by which estrogen regulates hPRLR gene expression.

The hPRLR PIII reporter pGL2 gene constructs have been previously described (16Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2139-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These include constructs of the pGL2 reporter gene plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) with insertion of DNA fragment (-931/-112 bp) containing the 5′-flanking region/promoter/exon 1 of hPRLR hPIII or the hPIII promoter/exon 1 (-480/-112 bp), either wild-type or harboring mutations in Sp1 and/or C/EBP (within the hPIII) or the ERE half-site (upstream to the promoter) (Fig. 1A). The constructs were numbered relative to the translation initiation codon (ATG +1) in exon 3 (E3) (Fig. 1A). All plasmid constructs were restriction mapped and sequenced. The hERα/pcDNA 3.1 expression constructs containing specific deletions, and C-terminal fusion of a V5 tag (Fig. 6A) with inclusion of Kozak sequence were generated by conventional PCR. ERα and its truncated forms were synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7 Quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). One-tenth of the individual reactions (5 μl) were assessed as input of the pulldown analysis (45 μl). The GST C/EBPβ fusion expression construct was prepared by inserting full-length C/EBPβ cDNA into the pET41a vector (Novagen, Madison WI) at EcoRI and XhoI sites in-frame with 5′ GST. Bacterial BL21a (DE3) pLysS strains transformed with pET41a or the pET41a/C/EBPβ-GST fusion construct were cultured at 37 °C for 16 h (A600 of 0.6 to 0.7). Cells were then incubated with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37°C. Cells harvested and lysed by sonication in B-PER bacterial lysis buffer were subjected to affinity purification using immobilized glutathione resin included in the B-PER GST Spin Purification Kit (Pierce). GST Pulldown Assays—TNT-expressed ERα/V5 and truncated/V5 forms (45 μl of reaction mixture) were subjected to pulldown assays by incubation with GST (control) or GST-C/EBPβ (attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads) for 16 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 100 nm E2 in a total volume of 500 μl of the binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and proteases inhibitors mixture). Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in 500 μl of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors mixture). Washed beads suspended in 20 μl of sample buffer (Tris glycine, 2× SDS, Invitrogen) were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. The soluble fraction was recovered by centrifugation, and resolved in 4-20% Tris glycine gels (Invitrogen). Interactions were evaluated by Western blot analysis using V5 antibody and quantitated by densitometry. -Fold increases induced by E2 were derived from bound values (percent of input). GST was used as a control. All experiments were performed at least three times. Total cell and nuclear extracts from HCC1806 breast cancer cells transfected with wild-type ERα or deletion constructs with V5 tag were assessed by Western blots for expression of constructs. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—MCF-7A2 cells (MCF-7) (20Ujhazy P. Klobusicka M. Babusikova O. Strausbauch P. Mihich E. Ehrke M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Erica Berleth, C. Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY. HCC 1806 breast cancer cells (ER negative expression) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in six-well plates under very low serum and steroid-free conditions in phenol red-free media without supplemental growth factors with 5 and 1% dextran charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum for 3 days at each serum concentration. MCF-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with 0.8 μg of wild type, various mutant constructs of PIII, and the 5′-flanking region of hPRLR with the reporter PGL2 gene or empty vector (basal control). HCC 1806 cells plated were cotransfected with wild-type PIII (-480/-112 bp) reporter pGL2 construct (0.5 μg), wild-type ERα and deletion constructs (1 μg), and 0.2 μg of pCMVSport/β-galactosidase construct (for normalization) using the Lipofectamine Plus reagents following the procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For Western analysis of total and nuclear expression of wild-type and deleted ERα constructs, 10-cm culture plates were used for transfection and all plasmid additions were increased 5-fold. After incubation for 5 h, cells were treated with 17β-estradiol (Sigma) (100 nm in 0.01% ethanol), and the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI), 5 μm in 0.1% Me2SO (Fig. 1), or the highly selective ERα antagonist, MPP dihydrochloride (1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methyl-5,[4-(2 piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride) (1 μm) (Tocris, Ellisville, Mo), and 0.01% ethanol with or without 0.1% Me2SO as vehicle control in fresh medium. Cell lysates were prepared after 24 h treatment, and luciferase assays were performed using luciferase protocol (Promega) and transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments in triplicate. Real-time PCR Quantitation of hPRLR mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from MCF-7 cells treated with 17β-estradiol (0-100 nm) for the times indicated, using the RNA isolation kit (Stratagene). Prior to reverse transcription reaction, total RNA was treated with DNase I to remove any possible copurified DNA. 2 μg of DNA was reversed transcribed using a SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) containing a mixture of oligo(dT)20 and random hexamer primers. The first-strand DNA from 100 ng of RNA was used as a template in real-time PCR with SYBR Green Master Mix and an ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosynthesis). The cycling program was set as follows: denature at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The primers utilized for PCR to detect hPRLR mRNA transcribed from promoter hPIII were a specific forward primer derived from non-coding exon 1 (hE13) (-135/-114); 5′-TGATGTGGCAGACTTTGCTCCC-3′, and a reverse primer 5′-CCATTCAGAAGGCAGGTGTTGAG-3′ from sequences located in common hE3 (+49/+71). The primers for detecting β-actin were 5′-CTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAAT-3′ and 5′-AATGTCACGCACGATTTCCCGC-3′. The specificity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analyses at the end of the PCR. The standard curves were created by a 10-fold serial dilution of the pcDNA/PRLR vector. Results presented are from two individual experiments, each sample was assayed in triplicate, and normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA and expressed as -fold change from controls. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 and HCC1806 cells treated with 100 nm 17β-estradiol alone and/or 1 μm MPP or 5 μm ICI 182,780, or vehicle control for 18 h, were prepared as described previously (21Hu Z. Zhuang L. Guan X. Meng J. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14263-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6958-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 30 μgof nuclear protein was separated on 10% NuPAGE (MCF-7) or 4-20% Tris glycine gels (HCC1806) (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were then incubated with primary antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, C/EBPβ, ERα, SRC-1, p300, pCAF, RNA Pol II and TFIIB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-AcH3 and AcH4 (Upstate Biotechnology). PRLR protein in cell extracts was assessed by Western blot using a PRLR monoclonal antibody (Affinity BioReagents Inc., Golden, CO). After adding the appropriate secondary antibodies, the immunolabeled bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and the signals were recorded on x-ray films. Histone deacetylase-1 was used to evaluate the purity of the nuclear preparation and found to be unchanged by estradiol treatment. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts Immunodepleted of ERα—Antibody-conjugated agarose beads were used to deplete ERα from nuclear extracts of MCF-7 cells as previously described (22Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6958-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, 40 μg of ERα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) was incubated with 200 μl of protein A-agarose beads in 1 ml of binding buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.008 m sodium phosphate, 0.002 m potassium phosphate, and 0.01 m KCl) for 2 h, and subsequently washed three times with PBST (PBS buffer, 0.02% Tween 20) buffer and twice with PBS buffer. The beads were then incubated with 100 μg of nuclear protein for 2 h at 4°C with rotation. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to one more round of depletion by re-incubation for 1 h with 200 μl of 50% slurry protein A-agarose bead antibody. The ERα-depleted nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blots to confirm the removal of ERα from the nuclear protein extracts. DNA Affinity Protein Assay (DAPA)—DAPA were performed essentially as previously described (23Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33431-33438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). 5′-Biotin end-labeled sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild-type Sp1 binding site (-375CACTGACTCCTCCTCTCATGA-355) and its mutant (5′-CACTGAaTaCTaaTCTCATGA-3′, and to the C/EBP wild-type binding site (-388ATAAATGTTGCAACACTGACT-368) and its mutant (5′-ATAAATaccatAtaACTGACT-3′) of the hPRLR promoter III were custom made by GeneProbe Technology, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The oligomers were annealed and gel purified by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 50 μg of nuclear extracts were preincubated with 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose (50% slurry from Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The supernatant collected by centrifugation was incubated with 0.2 μg of wild or mutant biotin-labeled probe in binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. DNA-protein complexes were then incubated with 40 μl of 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose (pre-equilibrated in the binding buffer for 1 h) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. DNA-protein complexes were washed five times with the binding buffer, the pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of 2× protein sample buffer (Invitrogen) and then boiled for 5 min to dissociate the complexes. The proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blot detection with specific antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturers specifications and following previously described methodology (23Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33431-33438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly 5 × 106 MCF-7 cells under different treatments for the times indicated in the corresponding experiments were used for each ChIP reaction. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and lysed in lysis buffer. Soluble chromatin was prepared by sonication following by immunoclearing. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C overnight utilizing specific antibodies to transcription factors (Sp1, Sp3, and C/EBPβ), coactivators (SRC-1, p300, and pCAF), acetylated histones H3 and H4, TFIIB, Pol II, and ERα and ERβ. Following immunoprecipitation, protein A-Sepharose beads and salmon sperm DNA were added. After several rounds of washing the precipitates were extracted three times with 1% SDS, 0.1% NaHCO3. After reversal of cross-linking by heating the samples at 65 °C for 6 h, these were treated with proteinase K, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA was analyzed by conventional PCR and real-time PCR for the presence of the human prolactin receptor PIII fragment-497/-321 bp using primers 5′-CTTCGCAGGATTCCAGCTCCCCCAAC-3′ (forward), 5′-GAAGCTCAACTCGGTGCACTTGTTC-3′ (reverse), and for the fragment -881 to -703 bp upstream to the promoter, primers 5′-TATGGCAGGAGAATAAACAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATTGAACAGCAGCTATAT-3′ (reverse) (Fig. 7). Titration of PCR cycles was performed to ensure that measurements were made in the linear range of amplification. PCR amplification of 1% of the soluble chromatin prior to immunoprecipitation was used as input control. The ChIP-precipitated DNA and input DNA were subjected to real-time PCR analyses using SYBR Green Master mixture in an ABI 7500 sequence detection system, and samples from two individual ChIP assays were analyzed in triplicate. The samples normalized by input were expressed as -fold increase over control untreated cells in basal conditions (C) designated as 1. ChIP Re-immunoprecipitation—Complexes were eluted from the primary immunoprecipitation by incubation with 5 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 20 min and diluted with buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.1) followed by re-immunoprecipitation with a different relevant antibody. Subsequent steps of ChIP reimmunoprecipitations were as for the initial immunoprecipitations. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—100 μg of nuclear protein prepared from MCF7 cells were initially subjected to preclearing by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-agarose (50% of slurry) and 2 μg of normal rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the immunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The recovered supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of an antibody to a member of the complex for 2 h at 4°C in the presence of 1× protease inhibitor mixture. Then, 50 μl of protein A-agarose in 50% slurry was added, and the incubation was continued for overnight. Protein A-precipitated protein complex was recovered by brief centrifugation, followed by three times washes with immunoprecipitation assay buffer. The harvested beads resuspended in 25 μl of 2× protein sample buffer containing 5% of β-mercaptoethanol were boiled for 5 min to release the bound protein. The samples were then analyzed by Western blot with a specific antibody to another member of the complex. For Co-IP of ERα with C/EBPβ we utilized ERα antibody cross-linked to protein G-agarose beads to immunoprecipitate ERα employing the Size X Protein G Kit (Pierce). This avoided masking of the C/EBPβ band (45 kDa) by the immunoglobulin heavy chain dissociated from the immunoprecipitates. Identification of Sites Critical for E2-induced Transcriptional Activation of the hPRLR Gene—Previous studies demonstrated that the hPIII promoter (-480/-112) contains C/EBP and Sp1 functional elements that bind C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3 and that both contribute to basal transcriptional activity (16Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2139-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5′-flanking regions to the promoter did not influence basal transcriptional activity in T-47D and MCF-7 cells (16Hu Z.Z. Zhuang L. Meng J. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2139-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition E2 was found to activate PIII in T-47 D cells transfected with the hPIII-luciferase construct (18Leondires M.P. Hu Z.Z. Dong J. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study we initially explored the functional domains within the hPIII promoter and 5′-flanking region involved in the E2 activation of transcriptional activity in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1). E2 stimulated the hPRLR -480/-112 hPIII promoter/luciferase construct 6-8-fold, and neither the addition of 5′-flanking sequences (-481/-931) nor the mutation of ER one-half element at -802GGTCA-798 had effect in the E2 activation of transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). The E2 activation was inhibited to basic construct levels by the addition of the E2 receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 to the cultures (Fig. 1C). Mutation of either Sp1 or C/EBP sites inhibited E2 activation to near basic control values in both the -931/-112 construct or in the -480/-112 promoter construct (Fig. 1, B and C). This indicated a requirement of cooperative effects of transfactors C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3 in E2 activation of hPRLR transcription through hPIII. Estrogen Activated the Transcription of hPRLR and Caused Increases in mRNA and Receptor Protein Expression—The hPRLR promoter activity was dose dependently increased by E2 treatment of MCF-7 cells for 24 h (Fig. 2A). Induction of promoter activity was observed with 1 nm E2 (2-3-fold), and a 6-8-fold increase was observed with 100 nm E2 (Fig. 2A). In temporal studies, 100 nm E2-induced increases in promoter activity were initially observed at 6 h (1-fold), and continue to increase at 12 (3-4-fold) and 24 h (6-8-fold) (Fig. 2B). In parallel studies, we evaluated whether the endogenous expression of the hPRL gene governed by its natural promoter could be regulated by E2. Real-time PCR analysis of RNA from E2-treated and -untreated MCF-7 cells demonstrated a dose-dependent increase of mRNA levels (Fig. 2C). These results paralleled those obtained for the activation of promoter activity (Fig. 1A). A significant activation of endogenous hPRLR exon 1 (E13) gene transcripts directed by the hPIII promoter was observed following 6 h incubation of the cells with 100 nm E2 (2-fold), and further increases were observed at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, PRLR protein dose-related increases were induced by E2 (Fig. 2E) and these were observed at 12 and 24 h of treatment with 100 nm estradiol (Fig. 2D). Our results showed clear correlation between the transcriptional responses of the hPRLR gene to E2 and demonstrated that hPRLR transcription markedly induced by E2 caused significant activation of hPRLR gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Interaction of ERα with C/EBPβ and Sp1/Sp3 in the Activation of hPRLR Gene Transcription—Our results from transient transfection studies indicated that DNA-bound Sp1 and C/EBPβ have a central role in E2-induced hPRLR gene"

However, whether the different PKD isoforms could be selectively regulating the traffic of their specific substrates remains unexplored. We identified the C terminus of the different PKDs that constitutes a postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif in PKD1 and PKD2, but not in PKD3, to be responsible for the differential control of kinase D-interacting substrate of 220-kDa (Kidins220) surface localization, a neural membrane protein identified as the first substrate of PKD1. A kinase-inactive mutant of PKD3 is only able to alter the localization of Kidins220 at the plasma membrane when its C terminus has been substituted by the PDZ-binding motif of PKD1 or PKD2. This isoform-specific regulation of Kidins220 transport might not be due to differences among kinase activity or substrate selectivity of the PKD isoenzymes but more to the adaptors bound to their unique C terminus. Furthermore, by mutating the autophosphorylation site Ser916, located at the critical position -2 of the PDZ-binding domain within PKD1, or by phorbol ester stimulation, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of this residue is crucial for Kidins220-regulated transport. We also discovered that Ser916 trans-phosphorylation takes place among PKD1 molecules. Finally, we demonstrate that PKD1 association to intracellular membranes is critical to control Kidins220 traffic. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which PKD localization and activity control the traffic of Kidins220, most likely by modulating the recruitment of PDZ proteins in an isoform-specific and phosphorylation-dependent manner.

PKDs contain several well characterized domains, including two cysteine-rich repeats (C1a and C1b) that constitute a C1 domain (CR), a pleckstrin homology domain, and a catalytic domain at the C terminus. The CR domain binds DAG and phorbol esters with high affinity (1Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The pleckstrin homology domain is an autoinhibitory domain that regulates the activity of this kinase (13Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PKD is activated by the phosphorylation of two activation loop sites within the catalytic domain through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway, which stabilizes the enzyme in an active conformation (14Iglesias T.

Activated PKD1 autophosphorylates at Ser916 present at the very C terminus, and this phosphorylation event is frequently used to determine the activation state of this kinase (16Matthews S.A.

PKD1 was first implicated in the control of constitutive membrane protein secretion from the TGN to the cell surface in HeLa cells, by regulating the fission of vesicles originating from this compartment (19Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Jamora C. Yamanouye N. Lint J.V. Vandenheede J.R. Faulkner D.J. Malhotra V.

It has been also reported that PKD isoforms differentially regulate the exit of vesicle-derived exocytic carriers from the TGN to the basolateral membrane in polarized epithelial cells, supporting the idea that each isoform could be controlling the transport of a subset of vesicular cargoes to the plasma membrane, probably by recognizing them as specific substrates (22Yeaman C. Ayala M.I. Wright J.R. Bard F. Bossard C. Ang A. Maeda Y. Seufferlein T. Mellman I. Nelson W.J. Malhotra V. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Very recently, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ, a Golgi membrane-localized lipid kinase that plays a key role in the structure and function of this organelle, has been found to be a physiological substrate of PKD. All three PKD isoforms, PKD1, PKD2, and to a lesser extent PKD3, phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ and stimulate its kinase activity, enhancing vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein transport to the plasma membrane (23Hausser A. Storz P. Martens S. Link G. Toker A. Pfizenmaier K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This novel discovery has helped to reveal some of the molecular events that enable transport-carrier formation at the TGN. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the different PKD isoforms could be selectively regulating the traffic of some of their specific substrates to the cell surface remain widely unexplored. A few years ago we cloned kinase D-interacting substrate of 220 kDa (Kidins220) from PC12 cells (24Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P. Rozengurt E. Schiavo G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40048-40056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and we identified this novel protein as the first physiological substrate for PKD1. Kidins220, also known as ARMS (ankyrin-rich membrane spanning; see Ref. 25Kong H. Boulter J. Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is an integral plasma membrane protein predominantly expressed in brain and neurons that presents a polarized location in neural cells, concentrating at the tip of extending neurites and in plasma membrane micro-domains corresponding to lipid rafts (18Cabrera-Poch N. Sanchez-Ruiloba L. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Iglesias T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28592-28602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N.

The primary amino acid sequence of Kidins220 reveals 11 ankyrin repeats, 4 trans-membrane domains, a proline-rich region, a sterile-α motif (or SAM) domain, and a type I postsynaptic density-95/discs large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ)-binding motif at the very C terminus (24Iglesias T.

Weber J.L. Lai C. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 176-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consensus PDZ-binding domains are sequences of four amino acids present at the C terminus of many membrane proteins (ion channels, transporters and receptors) that bind to PDZ proteins (26Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence of type I PDZ-binding motifs is X-3(Ser/Thr)-2X-1ϕ0, where X is any amino acid, ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid and -3, -2, -1, and 0 refer to the position starting from the C-terminal residue. Amino acids at position 0 and -2 are the critical determinants for the binding of specific type I PDZ domains to these ligands (26Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDZ domains are found as single or multiple repeats in nearly 400 unrelated PDZ proteins (26Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By binding PDZ ligands, PDZ proteins play a crucial role in cellular polarization as well as in the different processes that control the correct surface expression and function of membrane proteins, including scaffolding and/or retention at the plasma membrane, endocytosis, and asymmetrical delivery from the TGN to the different domains at the cell surface (27Roh M.H. Margolis B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F377-F387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Rongo C.

In this study, we report that PKD1 and also PKD2, but not PKD3, specifically regulate the surface localization of Kidins220 in cells of nervous origin such as primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells. Importantly, the differential control exerted by PKD isoforms relies on a newly identified domain, a type I PDZ-binding motif present at the very C-terminal end of PKD1 and PKD2 that is absent in the PKD3 sequence. Importantly, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation or homologous transphosphorylation of the critical Ser916 at position -2 within this motif in PKD1 is crucial for Kidins220 correct localization at the plasma membrane, likely by modulating the recruitment of PDZ proteins at the TGN. Furthermore, we show by deleting the CR domain that PKD1 association with intracellular membranes is critical to control Kidins220 traffic. Collectively, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which PKD intracellular localization and activity specifically regulate the surface localization of Kidins220 and raise the possibility of PKD1 and PKD2 interacting with PDZ proteins. This interaction may be crucial for the association of these isoforms with other proteins and the phosphorylation of other downstream targets, as well as for the regulation of protein cellular trafficking.

RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNAs from PC12 cells, primary cortical neurons, or NB69 cells were isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and then were reverse-transcribed into cDNAs. These cDNAs were PCR-amplified for 40 cycles using pairs of primers specific for rat PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 (PKD1, sense at position 1106, 5′-GCC AAGGCC TTA AAT GTG AA-3′, antisense at position 1402, 5′-GGA GCT TGT CGA GCT GAA TC-3′; PKD2, sense at position 231, 5′-CTC GGA TCT CCA GTC TCT GC-3′, antisense at position 531, 5′-CAG AAC CAC CTC CAC CAA GT-3′; PKD3 sense at position 594, 5′-TGG TAA TGT GCA GGG TCA AA-3′, antisense at position 894, 5′-GGC TCC TCT GAG TCA TCC AA-3′) or human PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 (PKD1/PKDmu sense at position 881, 5′-CGC ACA TCA TCT GCT GAA CT-3′, antisense at position 1181, 5′-CTT TCG GTG CAC AAC GTT TA-3′; PKD2, sense at position 1717, 5′-GGG CAG TTT GGA GTG GTC TA-3′, antisense at position 2018, 5′-ACC AGG ATC TGG GTG ATG AG-3′; PKD3/PKDnu sense at position 1835, 5′-CCA GCA GGG ATA ACC TGA GA-3′, antisense at position 2134, 5′-TTG CTT TTT CCC AGC TCT GT-3′). After amplification, the primers yielded specific PCR fragments of 300 bp, whose identity was verified by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer. cDNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—GFP-PKD1-WT and a kinase-deficient mutant GFP-PKD1-KD (with the mutation D733A) have been described previously (14Iglesias T.

The forward primer used (5′-CCC TCA TGC CTG TTA CTC CTC AAG C-3′) was annealing at position 1589, close to the EcoRV restriction site (located at position 1705), within the hPKD3 cDNA sequence. The reverse primers (annealing at position 2670) contained a new XbaI site (underlined) and introduced mutations at the three last residues (boldface), EDP to SIL (GAA GAT CCT to AGC ATT CTT, 5′-GCT CTA GAG CTC AGT GAT TAA AGA ATG CTT TC-3′) or to SVL (GAA GAT CCT to AGC GTT CTT, 5′-GCT CTA GAG CTC AGT GAT TAA AGA ACG CTT TC-3′). PCR fragments were digested with EcoRV/XbaI to substitute the same sequence in pcDNA4/TO-GFP-hPKD3-KD. The site-specific mutations within the PDZ-binding motif of PKD1, resulting in Ser916 substitution, were generated by overlap PCR using pBluescript SK(+)-PKD1-KD as a template. Mutants were made by using an oligonucleotide annealing at position 2729, close to the NheI restriction site (located at position 2814), within the PKD1 cDNA sequence and a sequence downstream from the stop codon, corresponding to pBluescript SK(+), near the polylinker region as external forward (5′-TAC CCA CGA AAG CGA TGA CTC CAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCT CAC TAA AGG GAA CAA AAG CTG-3′) primers, together with internal reverse and forward primers complementary to each other and containing the Ser916 substitutions. The sense primers containing the sequence changes encoding the desired mutations were as follows: PKD1-KDS916E (5′-TGA GCG TGT CGA GAT CCT CTG ATT-3′) and PKD1-KDS916A (5′-TGA GCG TGT CGC CAT CCT CTG ATT-3′). After the second PCR, the amplified product, cut with NheI-/XbaI, was used to replace the original NheI/XbaI segment in pEFBos-GFP-PKD1-KD. The mutant GFP-PKD1S916A was made by replacing the original NheI/XbaI segment of pEFBos-GFP-PKD1 with the same PCR product utilized to generate PKD1-KDS916E. To generate the mutant GFP-PKD1STOP, a new primer introducing a Stop codon (underlined) was used (5′ TGA GCG TGT CTG AAT CCT CTG ATT 3′). The mutant GFP-ΔCR-PKD1-KD was generated by replacing the SphI-XbaI fragment in the mutant GFP-ΔCR-PKD1 (described in Ref. 17Matthews S.A. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) by the same fragment coming from the kinase-dead mutant PKD1-D733A (14Iglesias T. Waldron R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Constructs were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer before they were used in transient expression experiments. Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary dissociated E19 rat cortical primary cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of 19-day-old fetal Wistar rats as described (18Cabrera-Poch N. Sanchez-Ruiloba L. Rodriguez-Martinez M. Iglesias T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28592-28602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, meninges were removed from the embryonic brains, and cortices were dissected. Tissue was resuspended in Neurobasal medium complemented with B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were counted and seeded on laminin (4 μg/ml) and polylysine (10 μg/ml)-covered 35-mm dishes or glasses at a final concentration of 5 × 105 and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were used after 7 days in culture, as indicated in the text. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum, 7.5% horse serum, and 2 mm glutamine, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When required, cells were treated with GF I (3.5 μm) for 1 h or PDBu (200 nm) for 2.5 h, as specified in the text. For transfection, PC12 cells and primary neurons were seeded at 50-60% confluence on laminin (4 μg/ml) and polylysine (10 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips. Cells were transfected in serum-free medium by using 1 μg of DNA and 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000® reagent (Invitrogen) per 35-mm dish, according to the manufacturer's specifications, and 48 h later the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. RNAi—Human NB69 neuroblastoma cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pSuper or pSuper-PKD1-RNAi and pSuper-PKD2-RNAi vectors (kindly provided by Drs. A. Toker and P. Storz). Experiments were performed 72 h after transfection. The levels of PKD1/2 were examined by Western blot, and actin signal was used as loading control. For immunofluorescence analysis, pSuper vectors were cotransfected with pEFBos-GFP in a ratio of 10:1 in order to study Kidins220 localization in the green population of cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Transfected PC12 cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 30 min at 4 °C, and lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. When needed, GFP-PKD1-KD was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies. For Western blot analysis, total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% low-fat milk powder and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the different primary antibodies in blocking solution. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to peroxidase as before, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vitro Kinase Assays—GFP-PKD1 and GFP-PKD1-KD autophosphorylation or trans-phosphorylation by recombinant active PKD1 were determined in GFP-PKD1 or GFP-PKD1-KD immunoprecipitates by the in vitro kinase assay as described previously (14Iglesias T. Waldron R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and twice with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing a 100 μm final concentration of [γ-32P]ATP, in the absence or presence of purified active GSTPKD1 (100 ng), for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or Western blotting with anti-PKD1-Ser(P)916-specific antibody. Peptide phosphorylation of Kidins220-Ser919 and Kidins220-Ala919 was determined by in vitro kinase assays as described previously (24Iglesias T. Cabrera-Poch N. Mitchell M.P. Naven T.J.P.

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—For immunofluorescence, transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 2 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, followed by methanol for 2 min at -20 °C. After blocking (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min), cells were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoreactivity was detected with the suitable fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody before mounting on slides with Mowiol 4-88 (Harland Co., UK). All confocal images were acquired using an inverted Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser confocal microscope (Germany) with a 63× Plan-Apochromatic oil immersion objective and were normalized for each color separately. Confocal images presented are single sections of a series as specified in the text and figure legends. Images were processed for presentation with Zeiss LSM5 Image Browser and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.). Quantitative Analysis—PC12 cells were transfected with the different PKD mutants. After immunostaining with Kidins220 antibody, 20-30 transfected cells were examined. Positive cells for GFP-PKD aggregates, Kidins220 aggregates, and aggregates where both proteins colocalized were counted (Figs. 1, 4, and 6). The percentage was calculated related to the total number of transfected cells examined.FIGURE 4A type I PDZ-binding motif identified in PKD1 and PKD2 C-terminal sequence is responsible for the control of Kidins220 surface localization. Scheme showing the last six amino acids within the C-terminal sequence of PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 (CR, cysteine-rich domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; C, catalytic domain; PDZ L, PDZ ligand) (A). Note that the C-terminal end of PKD3 does not constitute a PDZ-binding domain. Critical amino acids at position 0 and -2 of the PDZ-binding motifs of PKD1 and PKD2 are labeled in red. Cortical primary neurons (B) and PC12 cells (C) were transfected with GFP-PKD3-KD mutants where the last three amino acids at the C-terminal end (EDP) had been changed to SIL or SVL (C-terminal ends of PKD1, upper panels, and PKD2, lower panels, respectively). Note that now Kidins220 colocalizes intracellularly with GFP-PKD3-KD-SIL or -SVL mutants (compare these images with Fig. 3), indicating that the PDZ-binding motifs of PKD1 and PKD2 (absent in PKD3) confer on PKD3 the control of Kidins220 surface localization. A quantitative analysis of a representative experiment was carried out in GFP-PKD3-KD- or GFP-PKD3-KD-SIL-transfected PC12 cells (% of positive cells) (D). Among this population (n = 20 and n = 30, respectively), we determined the percentage of cells containing retained GFP-PKD3-KD or GFP-PKD3-KD-SIL (black bars, 100 and 100%, respectively) and Kidins220 aggregates in the same cell (gray bars, 0 and 85%, respectively). These aggregates were double-positive for GFP-PKD3-KD/Kidins220 and GFP-PKD3-KD-SIL/Kidins220 in 0 and 88% of the cells counted, respectively (white bars).

Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In colorectal cancer, gene profiling studies have identified a positive correlation between advanced or metastatic colon tumors and abundant OPN expression (15Agrawal D. Chen T. Irby R.

Metastasis. 2003; 20: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that stable, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of OPN expression in CT26 colon adenocarcinoma cells results in suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression, decreased in vitro tumor cell motility and invasiveness, and attenuation of functional in vivo hepatic metastasis (17Wai P.Y.

Together, these data suggest that OPN is necessary for CT26 colorectal metastasis. Subsequent studies in our laboratory have confirmed that OPN protein expression is highly up-regulated in metastatic CT26 but absent in nonmetastatic cell lines such as YAMC. In this study, we investigated the molecular determinants that regulate OPN expression in CT26 colorectal tumor cells. CT26, an undifferentiated murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line, produces aggressive pulmonary and hepatic metastases in murine models (18Corbett T.H. Griswold Jr., D.P. Roberts B.J. Peckham J.C. Schabel Jr., F.M. Cancer Res. 1975; 35: 2434-2439PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ikubo A. Aoki Y. Nagai E. Suzuki T. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and constitutively expresses OPN at high levels. We hypothesized that specific cis-regulatory domains and trans-factors control OPN expression in CT26 colorectal cancer. Using transient transfection and clonal deletion analysis of OPN promoter-luciferase constructs, we identified cis-regulatory regions within the OPN promoter in CT26 cells versus YAMC control. Gel-shift assays sublocalized 20–30-base pair regions in this cis-domain that could form DNA-nuclear protein complexes. Competition with unlabeled mutant probes characterized the nucleotide sequence of the essential nuclear factor binding sites. A TRANSFAC data base query and antibody-supershift assays identified the corresponding trans-regulatory nuclear proteins as Ets-1 and Runx2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays evaluated the in vivo binding capacity of these targets to the OPN promoter. Consensus binding site mutations in subcloned OPN promoter-luciferase constructs demonstrated a significant decrease in transcriptional activity. Antisense oligonucleotides to Ets-1 and Runx2 determined the functional effect of decreased expression of these trans-regulatory nuclear proteins in CT26 cells. Together, these data suggest that expression of the tumor metastasis protein, OPN, requires Ets-1 and Runx2. Cell Culture—CT26 murine colon carcinoma cells were grown as monolayer cultures in DMEM-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2-humidified air. YAMC cells were provided as a gift from Dr. Robert Whitehead (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). YAMC is a conditionally immortalized murine colonic epithelial cell line that expresses SV40-large-T-antigen when stimulated by interferon-γ at 33 °C. SV40-large-T-antigen is heat labile and degraded at 37 °C. YAMC cells were grown in monolayer in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1 μg/ml insulin, 5 IU/ml mouse interferon-λ, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 33 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in humidified air. The utilization by established investigators of the metastatic and nonmetastatic companion cell lines CT26 and YAMC in studying colon cancer is well described in the literature (20Whitehead R.H.

Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (22Gao C. Guo H. Wei J. Mi Z. Wai P. Kuo P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35 μg of protein/lane was resolved on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels (Gradipore Inc., Hawthorne, NY) and transferred to polyvinylidene membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies used were: anti-OPN (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion, Austin, TX), anti-PEBP2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-aml-3 (Calbiochem). Secondary antibodies used were: donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), donkey anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunodetection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-based SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For quantification, the bands were scanned into an AlphaImager 3400 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and normalized by dividing the measured density of protein bands by the density of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control bands from corresponding cell lysates. Plasmid Constructs—5′-Deletion fragments of the OPN promoter subcloned into pXP2 plasmid encoding luciferase were gifts from Dr. D. Denhardt (Rutgers University). Deletion constructs were constructed by PCR from the following primers, and the fragments were subsequently cloned into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid: OPN –69 (–69 to +79), OPN –88 (–88 to +79), OPN –107 (–107 to +79), OPN –120 (–120 to +79), OPN –134 (–134 to +79), OPN –160 (–160 to +79), OPN –174 (–174 to +79), OPN –209 (–209 to +79), OPN –258 (–258 to +79), OPN –472 (–472 to +79), OPN –512 (–512 to +79), OPN –670 (–670 to +79), OPN –777 (–777 to +79), and OPN –1467 (–1467 to +79). Consensus binding site mutations corresponding to Ets-1 (nt –120 to –114; 5′-GAGGAAG-3′ to 5′-ACTTTTA-3′), Runx2 (nt –136 to –129; 5′-AACCACAA-3′ to 5′-GGACAATTT-3′) and an ETS-1/Runx2 double mutant were constructed using QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), with the OPN –512 wild type fragment as template, and used in transient transfection assays. Mutational accuracy was verified using DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Transient Transfection and Activity Assay—Preliminary experiments using pGL3-β-galactosidase were performed to determine that transfection efficiency was comparable between the two cell lines, CT26 and YAMC. DNA transfections of CT26 and YAMC cells were carried out in 12-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 24 h prior to transfection, cells were harvested using trypsin and plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates in DMEM-10% FBS without antibiotics. 2 μg of plasmid DNA diluted in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in Opti-MEM I were combined and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. These reagents were incubated with the previously plated cells for 4 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. After 4 h, the transfection medium was then replaced with DMEM-10% FBS. 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40-Renilla, which contains a full-length Renilla reniformi luciferase gene under the control of a constitutive promoter was added to each well as a control for transfection efficiency between different wells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested in 150 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed by following the manufacturer's directions. 20 μl of lysate was used for measurement in a luminometer (Turner Designs TD-20/20, Sunnyvale, CA). The results were reported as relative luciferase activity, which represents a ratio of luciferase firefly activity/Renilla activity. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments repeated in triplicate. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Monolayers of CT26 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet obtained by centrifugation was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCL, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; then 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and vortexed briefly. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. The nuclear proteins were extracted with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was stored at –80 C until use. Gel-shift and Supershift Assays—The assays were performed using CT26 and YAMC nuclear extracts. In competitive binding assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at 100 m excess. Supershift assays were performed by the addition of 1 μl of polyclonal antibody directed against mouse Ets-1 (sc-111 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Runx2 (S-19 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; AML-3, Calbiochem). The oligonucleotides used in gel-shift assays were as follows (underlined for emphasis): probe A, nt –123 to –101 (5′-CCA GAG GAG GAA GTG TAG GAG CAG GT-3′); probe B, nt –145 to –121 (5′-TTT TTT TTT AAC CAC AAA ACC AGA G-3′); and probe C, nt –165 to –140 (5′-TGT TTC CTT TTC TTC CTT TTT TTT TT-3′). Each probe was prepared by end-labeling the double-stranded oligonucleotides with [32P]ATP (2500 Ci/mmol) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI), followed by G-50 column purification (Biomax, Odenton, MD). The reactions were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. All olignonucleotides used in the gel-shift assays were HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) grade. 20-bp oligonucleotides were synthesized to contain sequential 2–3-nt mutations (Fig. 3, C and D) and used as competitors in gel-shift assays to identify essential protein binding sites. Probe A mutants containing the nt –118 to –115 (5-GGAA-3′ to 5′-TTTT-3′) binding site mutation or the Ets-1 consensus binding site mutation (5′-gagACTTTTAtgtaggagcaggt-3′) were constructed (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA), labeled using [32P]ATP as described above, and used in gel-shift assays. Probe B mutants containing the nt –134 to –129 (5-CCACAA-3′ to 5′-ACATTT-3′) binding site mutation or the Runx2 consensus binding site mutation (5′-ttttGGACATTTaaccagaggaggaagtgta-3′) were constructed (Integrated DNA Technologies), labeled using [32P]ATP as described above, and used in gel-shift assays. Transcription Factor Data Base Analysis—The nucleotide sequence corresponding to the cis-regulatory domain in the OPN promoter was cross-referenced with the TRANSFAC transcription factor data base to identify consensus binding sites of known transcription factors. Candidate transcription factors were screened for using antibody-supershift analysis in the gel-shift assays, as described above, to confirm the presence of the factor in our oligonucleotide-protein complexes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin isolated from CT26 and YAMC cells were fixed and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of anti-AML-3, anti-PEBP2α, anti-Ets-1, or IgG isotype. After DNA purification, the presence of the selected DNA sequence was assessed by PCR. The PCR product was 265 bp in length. The PCR program was: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, for a total of 28 cycles, and then 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products were resolved in 10% acrylamide gels. The average size of the sonicated DNA fragments subjected to immunoprecipitation was 300 bp as determined by ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. The ChIP assay utilized PCR primers 5′-CCTTTCATCCCCACTGATGT-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTTTTTGCCACTACCC-3′. Antisense Oligonucleotide Design and Assay—Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed according to GenBank™ sequences X53953 (Ets-1: sense, 5′-AGCCAACCCTACCTACCCAG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGGTAGGTAGGGTTGGCT-3′) and NM 009820 (Runx2: sense, 5′-GCCACCACTCACTACCACAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GTGTGGTAGTGAGTGGTGGC-3′) to inhibit the expression of Ets-1 and Runx2. Transfection of sense or antisense to Ets-1 or Runx2 and cotransfection of Ets-1/Runx2 sense or antisense into CT26 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000, as described above. After 48 h, cells were collected for analysis of OPN protein expression by Western blotting. Ets-1 and Runx2 siRNA and Assays—We utilized an RNAi-mediated approach to develop cell lines that could be utilized in an in vivo model of metastasis. Ets-1 and Runx2 siRNA (sc-35346, sc-37146; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at a concentration of 10 μm for transient transfection of CT26 cells as described above. CT26 were transfected using mismatch siRNA or Ets-1/Runx2 siRNA. After 24 h, cells were transfected again using the corresponding siRNA. After 72 h from the initial transfection, cell lysates were collected and analyzed using Western blotting to confirm the extent of Ets-1, Runx2, and OPN protein expression. Subsequently, cells were assayed for viability by trypan blue exclusion. Stably down-regulated cell lines would then be developed for use in a previously established model of in vivo experimental metastasis (17Wai P.Y. Mi Z. Guo H. Sarraf-Yazdi S. Gao C. Wei J. Marroquin C.E. Clary B. Kuo P.C. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat, version 3 (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA). Individual comparisons were made with Student's t test. The criterion for significance was p < 0.05 for all comparisons. Transient Transfection Analysis of OPN Promoter Deletion Constructs—To localize potential cis-acting elements in the OPN promoter, deletion constructs were analyzed in CT26 colon cancer cells using transient transfection (Fig. 1). Serial deletion constructs demonstrated a significant 3-fold increase in luciferase activity between nt –88 and –258 in CT26 cells (Fig. 1A). Transient transfection of these deletion constructs in YAMC, a nonmetastatic colonic epithelial cell line, did not demonstrate any increased luciferase activity (Fig. 1A). CT26 demonstrated an ∼8-fold increased luciferase activity in comparison with YAMC. Deletion fragments containing nucleotides upstream from –258 did not confer any additional, significant increase in luciferase activity in CT26 cells (Fig. 1A). Using further serial deletion constructs, this area of increased OPN promoter activity was further localized to the length of the promoter from nt –107 to –160 (Fig. 1B). Fragment –120 and –134 demonstrated an incremental 3.8-fold and a 6.4-fold increase in luciferase activity in comparison with control. These results suggest that more than one enhancer may reside in the nt –107 to –160 cis-regulatory domain of the OPN promoter. Gel-shift Analysis—To determine whether trans-activating nuclear factors may regulate the nt –107 to –160 region of the OPN promoter, gel-shift analysis was performed using [32P]ATP-labeled fragments (∼20 to 30 nt) that span this region of interest (Fig. 2). Nuclear proteins were isolated from CT26 cells and incubated with three overlapping, labeled oligonucleotide probes: probe A (nt –101 to –123); probe B (nt –121 to –145); and probe C (nt –140 to –165), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclear proteins bound to probe A (Fig. 2, lane 4) and probe B (Fig. 2, lane 5) but not to probe C. Three gel-shift complexes (E1, E2, and E3) were present with probe A, whereas two distinct complexes (R1 and R2) were seen with probe B. Gel-shift complexes E1, E2, and E3 and R1 were extinguished in the presence of 50-fold excess unlabeled probe A or B, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8), but persisted in the presence of a 50-fold excess of nonspecific unlabeled competitor (Fig. 2, lanes 10 and 11). These gel-shift complexes corresponding to E1, E2, E3, and R1 suggest that potential trans-regulatory nuclear proteins are bound to the OPN promoter in the region of nt –101 to –145 in CT26 cells. The binding sites were further characterized by serial mutations of the OPN promoter between nt –101 to –123 in probe A (Fig. 3A) and between nt –121 to –145 in probe B (Fig. 3C). These mutated sequences were then used as excess unlabeled competitors in gel-shift assays (Fig. 3, B and D). Mutation of nucleotides –115 to –118 in probe A resulted in persistence of complexes E1, E2, and E3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 9), whereas mutations of nt –101 to –114 and nt –119 to –123 resulted in ablation of complexes E1, E2, and E3 in competition gel-shift assays (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–7, 10, and 11). These data suggest that nt –115 to –118 (AAGG) represents an essential binding site for the nuclear proteins corresponding to the E1, E2, and E3 complexes. Mutation of nt –129 to –134 in probe B resulted in persistence of complexes R1 and R2 (Fig. 3D, lanes 5–7), whereas mutations of nt –121 to –128 and –135 to –145 resulted in ablation of R1 in competition gel-shift assays (Fig. 3D, lanes 1–4 and 8–12). These data suggest that nt –129 to –134 (AACACC) represents an essential binding site for the nuclear proteins corresponding to the R1 complex. Together, these data from the probe A and B serial deletions indicate that two potential enhancer binding sites (nt –115 to –118 and nt –129 to –134) reside within the cis-regulatory region nt –101 to –145. Identification of trans-Regulatory Proteins and Confirmation of DNA-Protein Binding—To identify the nuclear factors that bind our cis-element of interest, we searched the TRANSFAC data base for consensus binding sites of known transcription factors within the nt –101 to –145 segment (Fig. 4). The region nt –115 to –118 matched with the known consensus binding site of Ets (Fig. 4A), whereas the region nt –129 to –134 matched with Runx2, SBF-1 (spliceosome-binding factor-1), and C/EBP (Fig. 4B). We selected these nuclear proteins as candidates for specific binding in supershift and ChIP assays. Gelshift assays were repeated in the presence of Ets-1 antibody (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8) and Runx2 antibodies (Fig. 5B, lanes 7–8 and 10–11) with the previously described DNA probes A and B. In the presence of antibody against Ets-1, complexes E1, E2, and E3 were diminished, and a specific supershift band was formed (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8). In the presence of antibody against Runx2 (S-19 X), complex R1 was diminished with formation of a supershift band (Fig. 5B, lanes 7 and 8). This effect was more pronounced with the use of α-aml-3, a different antibody raised against Runx2, with the formation of an intense supershift band (Fig. 5B, lanes 10 and 11). No shift was detected using IgG isotype, and no complexes were formed between the antibodies and DNA probe in the absence of nuclear extract (Fig. 5, A, lane 5, and B, lanes 6 and 9). No supershift complexes were formed using antibodies to SBF-1 and C/EBP (data not shown). ChIP assays were then performed to confirm the in vivo binding of Ets-1 and Runx2 to this portion of the OPN promoter (Fig. 5C). Control reactions using no antibody or IgG isotype did not exhibit specific immunoprecipitation, whereas reactions containing antibodies to Ets-1 or Runx2 demonstrated specific binding to this region of the OPN promoter. Chromatin from YAMC cells did not result in specific Ets-1 or Runx2 antibody-mediated immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5D). Together, these data suggest that Ets-1 and Runx2 bind specifically to enhancer domains in the cis-regulatory region nt –101 to –145 of the OPN promoter in CT26 cells.FIGURE 5Identification of the trans-regulatory protein and confirmation of binding. A, gel-shift assays using probe A were repeated in the presence of antibody to Ets-1. Supershift bands (SS) were detected with increasing concentration of anti-Ets-1 in lane 7 (μg/μl) and lane 8 (μg/μl). Probe A + NE + IgG isotype (lane 6), probe A + anti-Ets-1 in the absence of NE (lane 5), free probe A (lane 1), probe A + NE (lane 2), probe A + NE + specific competitor (SC)(lane 3), and probe A + NE + nonspecific competitor (NC) (lane 4) were used as controls. This blot is representative of three experiments. B, gel-shift assays using probe B were repeated in the presence of antibodies to Runx2 (S-19 X and α-aml-3). Supershift bands were detected with increasing concentration of S-19 X and α-aml-3 in lanes 7 and 8 and lanes 10 and 11, respectively. Probe B + NE + IgG isotype (lane 5), probe B + S-19 X in the absence of NE (lane 6), probe B + α-aml-3 in the absence of NE (lane 9), free probe B (lane 1), probe B + NE (lane 2), probe B + NE + specific competitor (lane 3), and probe B + NE + nonspecific competitor (lane 4) were used as controls. This blot is representative of three experiments. C, ChIP analysis of Ets-1 and Runx2 binding. Chromatin from CT26 cells was fixed and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology). The purified chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of anti-Ets-1, SC-19 X, anti-aml-3, corresponding IgG isotype, or no antibody (no Ab) as control. The input fraction corresponded to 0.1% of the chromatin solution before immunoprecipitation. After DNA purification, the presence of the selected DNA sequence was assessed by PCR. The blot is representative of three experiments. D, chromatin from YAMC cells was fixed and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology). The purified chromatin was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of α-Ets-1, SC-19 X, α-aml-3, the corresponding IgG isotype, or no antibody as control. The input fraction corresponded to 0.1% of the chromatin solution before immunoprecipitation. After DNA purification, the presence of the selected DNA sequence was assessed by PCR. The blot is representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional Analysis of ETS-1 and Runx2 on DNA Binding, OPN Transcription, and Protein Expression—To determine whether trans-activation of Ets-1 and Runx2 is critical to the transcription of OPN in CT26 cells, we constructed OPN promoter sequences containing mutant binding sites for Ets-1 and Runx2 and analyzed them in gel-shift and luciferase-promoter assays. Mutation of nt –115 to –118 from AAGG to TTTT resulted in ablation of the E1 and E3 complexes with significant reduction in the binding of E2 in gel-shift assays (Fig. 6, lane 2). This effect was duplicated by mutating the consensus binding site for Ets-1 with complete ablation of complexes E1, E2 and E3 (Fig. 6, lane 3). Both mutation of nt –129 to –13"
https://openalex.org/W2093877599,"Mucoepidermoid (MEC) salivary gland tumors arise from a t(11;19) rearrangement which generates a fusion oncogene, Mect1-Maml2, that functions to activate CREB-responsive target genes. To determine if sustained expression of Mect1-Maml2 is required for tumor cell growth, we first showed that ectopic expression of Mect1-Maml2 in rat epithelial RK3E cells is tumorigenic in vivo in nude mice and that excised xenografts continue to express the fusion oncogene. We then generated a hairpin RNAi vector that selectively suppressed the fusion peptide and showed that ectopic expression in either parotid or pulmonary MEC tumor cell lines containing the t(11;19) rearrangement resulted in at least 90% colony growth inhibition. In contrast, single nucleotide changes within this RNAi sequence abolished the ability to suppress Mect1-Maml2 protein and abolished all growth inhibition of these MEC tumor lines. In addition, the RNAi-specific vector had no effect on colony growth of non-MEC tumors including a lung tumor or two other salivary gland cell lines that do not express Mect1-Maml2. We also generated a mutant Mect1-Maml2 expression plasmid that carried silent nucleotide changes within the RNAi target sequence and observed that co-transfection of this mutant, but not wild-type Mect1-Maml2, could partially rescue RNAi growth inhibition in the MEC tumor line. The recent detection of acquired fusion oncogenes in epithelial solid tumors has suggested new possibilities for the diagnosis and therapy of these cancers. Our data show that the ‘gain-of-function’ activity from aberrant Mect1-Maml2 expression is a candidate therapeutic target for this group of malignant salivary gland tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1992391979,"RUNX1 (AML1) is a gene that is frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. Like its Drosophila homolog Runt, RUNX1 both activates and represses transcription. Both Runt and RUNX1 are required for gene silencing during development and a central domain of RUNX1, termed repression domain 2 (RD2), was defined as being required for transcriptional repression and for the silencing of CD4 during T-cell maturation in thymic organ cultures. Although transcriptional co-repressors are known to contact other repression domains in RUNX1, the factors that bind to RD2 had not been defined. Therefore, we tested whether RD2 contacts histone-modifying enzymes that may mediate both repression and gene silencing. We found that RD2 contacts SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase, via two motifs and that endogenous Suv39h1 associates with a Runx1-regulated repression element in murine erythroleukemia cells. In addition, one of these SUV39H1-binding motifs is also sufficient for binding to histone deacetylases 1 and 3, and both of these domains are required for full RUNX1-mediated transcriptional repression.

Here we show by the proteomic technique of time series difference gel electrophoresis that a major result of neuroendocrine stimulation of the Drosophila renal tubule is an extensive remodeling of the mitochondrial matrix. By generating Drosophila that were transgenic for both luminescent and fluorescent mitochondrial calcium reporters, it was shown that mitochondrial calcium tracked the slow (minutes) but not the rapid (<1 s) changes in cytoplasmic calcium and that this resulted in both increased mitochondrial membrane polarization and elevated cellular ATP levels. The selective V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, further enhanced ATP levels, suggesting that the apical plasma membrane V-ATPase is a major consumer of ATP. Both the mitochondrial calcium signal and the increase in ATP were abolished by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter blocker Ru360. By using both mitochondrial calcium imaging and the potential sensing dye JC-1, the apical mitochondria of principal cells were found to be selectively responsive to neuropeptide signaling. As the ultimate target is the V-ATPase in the apical plasma membrane, this selective activation of mitochondria is clearly adaptive. The results highlight the dynamic nature and both spatial and temporal heterogeneity of calcium signaling possible in differentiated, organotypic cells and provide a new model for neuroendocrine control of V-ATPase.

Cell signaling is vital for coordination and homeostasis of all organisms. Elucidation of the intracellular mode of action of hormones, neuropeptides, and other soluble modulatory signals is thus of great interest. Although our detailed understanding of cell signaling processes reflects the enormous investment in its study, it would still be useful to obtain a global view of cell signaling targets, rather than an incremental one. Post-genomic technologies are potentially useful in this regard, although both transcriptomics and proteomics have limitations to match their benefit. The transcriptome of a cell will only change in response to nuclear actions of an extracellular messenger, so rapid effects (less than 10s of minutes) are unlikely to be reflected in meaningful changes in the transcriptome. Potentially, therefore, the proteome is more likely to reflect instantaneous changes in the cell. The main problem with this approach is the difficulty in detecting subtle changes between gels; it is not reasonable to suppose that all changes will be drastic. The standard two-dimensional PAGE technique has been adapted to overcome this obstacle; difference gel electrophoresis (DiGE) 3The abbreviations used are: DiGE, difference gel electrophoresis; UAS, upstream activating sequence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 3The abbreviations used are: DiGE, difference gel electrophoresis; UAS, upstream activating sequence; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. permits pairwise comparison between protein samples on the same gel by labeling each protein sample with a distinct fluor (1Unlu M. Morgan M.E. Minden J.S. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). To further aid quantification, it is also customary to run a third sample as a standard. Here, DiGE was applied to elucidate the mode of action of a Drosophila neuropeptide, Capa-1, on the Malpighian (renal) tubule. Capa-1 acts through intracellular calcium to generate nitric oxide and therefore cyclic GMP, and the ultimate target of signaling is thought to be an apical plasma membrane proton pump, the V-ATPase (2Dow J.A.T. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H.P. Davies S.-A. Skaer N.J.V. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). As V-ATPase has not been demonstrated to be regulated by protein phosphorylation, it was of interest to study its probable activation at a proteomic level. Although the Drosophila renal tubule is tiny (only 160 cells), it proved possible to obtain good DiGE gels from pooled samples and to perform a time course of action for the Capa-1 peptide. As expected, V-ATPase subunits were found to vary but, surprisingly, so did a range of mitochondrial enzymes. By generating Drosophila that were transgenic for two independent mitochondrially targeted calcium reporters (one luminescent and one fluorescent), mitochondria in the tubule principal cell were shown to receive a direct calcium signal from Capa-1, and this increased both mitochondrial potential and cellular ATP levels, functionally validating the novel mode of action for this peptide suggested by the DiGE time course study. Drosophila—Flies were raised in bottles on standard Drosophila medium, at 25 °C and 55% relative humidity, on a 12:12 light/dark cycle. The strains used were as follows: Oregon R, wild-type; c42, a GAL4 driver line specific for the principal cells of the tubule main segment (the cell type on which Capa-1 is known to act (4Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)); UAS-apoaequorincytoplasmic, flies carrying the apoaequorin luminescent cytoplasmic calcium reporter under control of the UAS promoter (4Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); UAS-apoaequorinmt, flies carrying the apoaequorin luminescent calcium reporter with a mitochondrial targeting signal under control of the UAS promoter, described below; UAS-mitycam, flies carrying a pericam fluorescent calcium reporter targeted to mitochondria under control of the UAS promoter, described below; and vhaSFD::eGFP, a genetrap construct, in which the V-ATPase SFD subunit is translationally fused to enhanced GFP (5Morin X. Daneman R. Zavortink M. Chia W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). All transgenic lines were viable as homozygotes, thus facilitating crossing to produce flies in which the relevant reporter was targeted to principal cells. Neuropeptide Stimulation and Malpighian Tubule Secretion Assays—Week-old adult flies were cold-anesthetized and dissected in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen). Fluid secretion assays were performed with a modified Ramsay assay, as described previously (6Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H.P. Görtz A. Skaer N.V. Brogan S. Kaiser K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 197: 421-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In essence, tubules were prepared as pairs, joined by a common ureter, and transferred to 10-μl drops of Schneider's medium in paraffin wax-lined 35-mm Petri dishes under paraffin oil (Sigma). One of the tubule pair was led out of the drop and wrapped around a small insect pin, under the oil, therefore stranding the ureter midway between the drop and the pin. Secretion by the tubule that remained in the drop was collected from the ureter every 5 min, and the diameters of the resulting droplets were measured with an eyepiece micrometer. The volume of secretion could then be calculated from the equation for a sphere. Typically, 20 tubules would be run simultaneously, allowing a 10 experimental + 10 control design to be achieved. When the diuretic neuropeptide Capa-1 (7Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Davies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (synthesized by Invitrogen) or other compounds were added, they were dissolved in Schneider's medium at 10× the final concentration required, and 1-μl droplets were fused with the main bathing drops at the times indicated in the figures. Generation of Mitochondrial Calcium Reporter Transgenic Flies—Drosophila, transgenic for a luminescent mitochondria-targeted calcium reporter, were generated by cloning a commercial mitochondrially targeted Aequorea victoria apoaequorin construct from the mtAEQ/pMT2 vector (Molecular Probes) into the pUAST vector (8Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct uses the mitochondrial targeting signal from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase (9Rutter G.A. Theler J.M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to target GFP to mitochondria in transgenic Drosophila (10Cox R.T. Spradling A.C. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Embryos were germ line-transformed with this construct, creating several independent transgenic lines. Drosophila, transgenic for a fluorescent mitochondria-targeted calcium reporter (“mitycam”), were generated from ratiometric pericam (kind gift of Atsushi Miyawaki (11Nagai T. Sawano A. Park E.S. Miyawaki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3197-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar)) by introducing the changes D148T in the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein domain and E67Q in the calmodulin domain. This produced a single wavelength excitation reporter with a greater sensitivity to Ca2+ (Kd = 47 nm). This was C-terminally fused to the mitochondrial targeting signal from subunit VIII of human cytochrome c oxidase (9Rutter G.A. Theler J.M. Murgia M. Wollheim C.B. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22385-22390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cloned into the pUAST vector (8Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development (Camb.). 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and embryos were germ line-transformed, creating several independent transgenic lines. Proteomics—For proteomics, pools of 500 rapidly dissected tubules were accumulated in 200-μl aliquots of Schneider's solution in Eppendorf tubes. The diuretic neuropeptide Capa-1 (7Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Davies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was dissolved in Schneider's solution and added to samples at a final concentration of 10-7 m. This concentration provides maximal stimulation of tubule fluid secretion (7Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Davies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The samples were mixed by gentle inversion and then stopped after timed intervals of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10 min by addition of AUT sample buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 8 m urea, and 2% (w/v) amino-sulfobetaine detergent (ASB14)) and rapid homogenization. Four to 10 experimental replicates of each time point were generated. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC detergent-compatible kit. Two-dimensional DiGE was performed as described previously (12Alban A. David S.O. Bjorkesten L. Andersson C. Sloge E. Lewis S. Currie I. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Protein samples from individual time points (50 μg) were minimally labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (200 pmol; Amersham Biosciences). A protein pool consisting of all protein samples included in the study was generated for use as an internal standard and was minimally labeled with Cy2. Proteins labeled with Cy2 (pool), Cy3, and Cy5 were mixed and separated by isoelectric focusing using 13-cm IPG DryStrips (pH 4-7) (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were further separated according to molecular weight using SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12%, Ettan Dalt Twelve apparatus; Amersham Biosciences). Following electrophoresis, gels were scanned at appropriate wavelengths for Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 fluorescence using Typhoon™ 9400 (Amersham Biosciences). Gel images were cropped using ImageQuant™ version 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences), and protein expression was quantified using Biological Variation Analysis software module (Amersham Biosciences). The Cy2 internal standard included in all experiments for normalization purposes allowed both intra- and inter-gel analyses. Protein spots showing significant changes (p < 0.05) with respect to control were picked from a colloidal Coomassie-stained gel and identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Following gel-to-gel matching of spots, statistical analysis (analysis of variance) of normalized protein abundance changes between samples was performed by using the using Biological Variation Analysis software module as described (12Alban A. David S.O. Bjorkesten L. Andersson C. Sloge E. Lewis S. Currie I. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Proteins within the gel-excised spots were first reduced, carboxyamido-methylated, and then digested to peptides using trypsin on a MassPrepStation (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The resulting peptides were applied to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. The liquid chromatographic separation was achieved with a PepMap C18, 180 μm inner diameter, 15-cm column (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The mass spectrometer was a QTof (Micromass). Fragmentation data were used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base using the MASCOT search engine. Probability-based MASCOT scores were used to evaluate identifications. Only matches with p < 0.05 for random occurrence were considered significant (further explanation of MASCOT scores can be found online). Manual sequence assignment was assisted using the peptide sequencing feature of BioLynx (Micromass). Dynamic Imaging of V-ATPase Localization—Adult flies were dissected in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen). For vital imaging of V-ATPase expression with the vhaSFD::GFP gene trap line (5Morin X. Daneman R. Zavortink M. Chia W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), tubules were allowed to adhere lightly to a poly-l-lysine-treated coverslip glued to a window in the bottom of a 50-mm Petri dish (MatTek Corp.). Tissues were viewed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss 510 meta system. Antibodies—An anti-peptide antibody for Drosophila vha55 was generated in rabbit by Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France), utilizing the 14-amino acid peptide sequence FNGSGKPIDKGPPI, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via an N-terminal cysteine residue. Sera from the immunized rabbits were purified over an affinity column in which the peptide was immobilized. The affinity column was prepared by covalently cross-linking the peptide via the sulfhydryl residue on the NH2 cysteine, to a Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Antibodies were used for Western blotting of tubule proteins, as described previously (13Radford J.C. Davies S.A. Dow J.A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38810-38817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein from 100 tubules was loaded in each lane. Real Time Measurement of Mitochondrial Calcium—For aequorin measurements, tubules were dissected from transgenic flies and pooled in groups of 20 in Schneider's medium. They were incubated in the dark with coelenterazine (the cofactor for apoaequorin) for 2-4 h. Samples were then placed in a Berthold luminometer, and base-line luminescence was measured for at least 30 s before automated injection of Capa-1 (7Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Davies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 10-7 m. Real time readings then continued for at least 3 min, with sampling every 0.1 s. Quantification was as for cytoplasmic aequorin; at the end of the experiment, total tissue luminescence was discharged by incubating in a calcium-containing buffer containing Triton X-100. This allowed the calculation of calcium concentration by back-integration using a routine written in Perl (4Rosay P. Davies S.A. Yu Y. Sozen M.A. Kaiser K. Dow J.A.T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For mitycam imaging, individual Malpighian tubules from 7-day-old adult progeny of a c42 × UAS-mitycam cross were carefully stuck (in PBS) to the bottom of a glass-bottomed dish that had been treated with poly-l-lysine. Once the tubules were attached, the PBS was immediately removed and 3 ml of Schneider's solution added. The samples were left for at least an hour before imaging, to allow the tubules to recover from incubation in PBS and to prevent the interference of any stimuli that might have occurred within the fly prior to dissection. Transgenic tubules expressing mitycam were imaged in a small glass-bottomed Petri dish on a Zeiss 510 meta confocal system coupled to an inverted Zeiss microscope. The reporters were excited with an argon 488 laser, and the emission was filtered through a 505-530 band pass filter. A ×20 objective was used for all live imaging. Mitycam is an inverse pericam, with Kd = 47 nm. It is thus ideally suited for detecting small changes in mitochondrial calcium. This pericam has a single excitation wavelength peak at ∼485 nm, and therefore ratiometric quantification is not possible. Real time images of the tubule-expressing mitycam were captured, and average fluorescence values for specified regions of interest were calculated for each frame. As mitycam is an inverse reporter, these values were subtracted from a higher arbitrary value to give fluorescence decrease and thus an estimate of calcium increase over time. Organotypic Imaging of Mitochondrial Potential—Tubules were adhered to glass-bottomed dishes and incubated in Schneider's solution as above. JC-1 (Molecular Probes) was added to 5 μg/ml, and tubules were incubated in the dark for 15 min and then washed twice for 10 min in Scheider's solution before imaging in Zeiss 510 meta confocal system coupled to an inverted Zeiss microscope. Tubules were imaged in real time with settings normally employed for GFP and dsRED, as these are close to the green and metachromatic red emissions, respectively, of JC-1. Pilot experiments had shown that uptake of JC-1 was saturated within 10 min. This rapid uptake of the dye, which facilitated our experiments, is probably a result of active uptake via an organic solute transporter. These are conspicuously abundant in the tubule transcriptome (14Dow J.A. Davies S.A. J. Insect. Physiol. 2006; 52: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Wang J. Kean L. Yang J. Allan A.K. Davies S.A. Herzyk P. Dow J.A.T. Genome Biol. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/1/R5)Google Scholar). ATP Assays—For each sample, 20 tubules were dissected and placed into 25 μl of Schneider's medium. Samples were either left untreated (controls) or treated with Capa-1 for 10 min (10-7 m) and/or the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin for 10 min (10-6 m). For Capa-1 + bafilomycin samples, tubules were pre-treated with bafilomycin for 10 min, prior to a 10-min stimulation with Capa-1. Triplicate samples were generated for each condition. Control samples were left for 20 min. All samples were quenched with 25 μl of ice-cold 10% (v/v) perchloric acid. Samples were sonicated and spun at 5,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were removed, and 1 μl of Universal Indicator (BDH) was added to each sample. Samples were neutralized with 1.5 m KOH, 60 mm HEPES. Precipitates were spun down, and 50 μl of supernatant from each sample was used for ATP measurements using a luciferin-based ATP determination kit (Invitrogen). The assay was conducted using a Berthold tube luminometer according to manufacturer's instructions using ATP standards at final concentrations between 1 nm and 1 μm. Tubule samples were used at 1:9 dilution (v/v) in a final volume of 200 μl and were assayed in duplicate. The ATP concentrations of tubule samples were calculated from the standard curve. Results are expressed as picomoles of ATP ± S.E. (n = 6). Proteomics—The two-dimensional proteome of adult Drosophila tubule is relatively simple, stable, and clearly defined (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect of application of the diuretic Capa-1 peptide was assessed by a DiGE time course on matched pairs of neuropeptide/vehicle-only treated batches of tubules. The choice of time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min) was informed by the known time course of action of Capa-1 peptides, which produce a stable increase in secretion and elevation of transepithelial potential, 5-10 min after application (7Kean L. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.E. Davies S.A. Veenstra J. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Davies S.A. Huesmann G.R. Maddrell S.H.P. O'Donnell M.J. Skaer N.J.V. Dow J.A.T. Tublitz N.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar). At this interval, it is unlikely that transcriptional changes can significantly affect tubule function, and so a proteomic approach is indicated.FIGURE 1Time course difference gel electrophoresis.

A few spots showed a monotonic increase or decrease; most showed a complex variation. However, multiple spots corresponding to the same proteins were identified, increasing our confidence in their identification as genuinely varying proteins. The hits (see Table 1) fell into three categories as follows: V-ATPase subunits, mitochondrial enzymes, and a cell signaling protein. The V-ATPase is a complex holoenzyme, which in Drosophila is formed of 13 subunits encoded by 34 genes (15Wang J. Kean L. Yang J. Allan A.K. Davies S.A. Herzyk P. Dow J.A.T. Genome Biol. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/1/R5)Google Scholar); the hits are to subunits that are believed to form the plasma membrane form of the pump (15Wang J. Kean L. Yang J. Allan A.K. Davies S.A. Herzyk P. Dow J.A.T. Genome Biol. 2004; (http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/1/R5)Google Scholar), specifically the V1 cytoplasmic head group. This is not surprising, as the Vo subunits are intensely hydrophobic integral membrane proteins, and so would not run into a two-dimensional gel. Similarly, the mitochondrial proteins are all matrix, and thus soluble, proteins. The hits are to both metabolic enzymes (such as enolase or dehydrogenases) and to two subunits of the F-type ATP synthase head group. In one case, i.e. porin, two neighboring spots (1018 and 1023) showed reciprocal changes, implying a shift between two states, possibly reflecting phosphorylation. The cell signaling protein is Leonardo, a 14-3-3ζ protein (17Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1996; 17: 931-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This is thought to be an inhibitor of protein kinase C (17Skoulakis E.M. Davis R.L. Neuron. 1996; 17: 931-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the known action of Capa-1, through phospholipase C and intracellular calcium (18Pollock V.P. Radford J.C. Pyne S. Hasan G. Dow J.A.T. Davies S.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because it is unlikely that transcription or translation could have modified the levels of these proteins so quickly, their availability to run on a two-dimensional gel, i.e. their solubility, must have varied over this time scale. It is thus necessary to investigate the action of Capa-1 on the following two distinct targets: the V-ATPase, which had been predicted, and the mitochondrial matrix, which had been quite unexpected.TABLE 1Significant DeCyder hitsSpotGeneDescriptionV-ATPases 354vha68-2V-ATPase A subunit 642vha44V-ATPase C subunitMitochondrial enzymes 273AconAconitase (mitochondria) 453UGPUTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase 483BlwBellwether, proton ATP synthase α subunit (mitochondria) 478BlwBellwether, proton ATP synthase α subunit (mitochondria) 490BlwBellwether, proton ATP synthase α subunit (mitochondria) 494ATPsyn-βATPsyn-β, ATP synthase β subunit 500ATPsyn-βATPsyn-β, ATP synthase β subunit 873CG9914Enoyl-CoA hydratase mitochondria 1020CG6543Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase activity EC 4.2.1.17 (fatty acid β-oxidation mitochondrial matrix) 558enoEnolase (glycolytic) 1023CG6647Porin 1018CG6647Porin 1029CG7834Electron transfer flavoprotein complex (sensu Eukarya) 1119scully7β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP+) activity (EC 1.1.1.201)Cell signaling 103114-3-3ζTryptophan hydroxylase activator activity; protein kinase C inhibitor activity 101014-3-3ζTryptophan hydroxylase activator activity; protein kinase C inhibitor activity Open table in a new tab Capa-1 Signaling Alters V-ATPase Localization—V-ATPase activity is not thought to be modulated by phosphorylation but by trafficking of holoenzyme in vesicles or by reversible release of the V1 head group from the Vo transmembrane pore. Regulation by reversible loss of the head group was first identified in insects, during molting in larval lepidopteran midgut (19Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and was also observed in yeast in response to glucose deprivation (20Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recruitment of head groups has been seen in blowfly salivary glands in response to serotonin (21Zimmermann B. Dames P. Walz B. Baumann O. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), so the DiGE result is consistent with our understanding of V-ATPase function. In Drosophila, a variety of genetic resources allow the data to be extended from proteomics back to the organism. A GFP-tagged subunit of the V-ATPase SFD subunit (5Morin X. Daneman R. Zavortink M. Chia W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15050-15055Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), which forms part of the V1 head group, is apically localized in Drosophila epithelia and allows organotypic monitoring of V-ATPase positioning within the cell. Confocal sections (Fig. 2) show the majority of vhaSFD to be apically located both before and after Capa-1 stimulation, reflecting the relatively high basal secretion levels by tubule. However, the resting tubule also shows some basolateral V-ATPase, which vanishes after Capa-1 stimulation. We thus conclude that Capa-1 plays only a modest role in remodeling the apical V-ATPase by release of any available basolaterally anchored V-ATPase head groups. So mobilization of V-ATPase subunits, although a known method of controlling V-ATPase (19Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.T. Earley F. Klein U. Jäger D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Real Time Measurement of Mitochondrial Calcium—How can the completely unexpected change in mitochondrial enzymes be explained? Capa-1 is known to signal through intracellular calcium and nitric oxide, which are known to activate or inhibit mitochondrial respiration, respectively (22Dumollard R. Hammar K. Porterfield M.

STOP suppression in mice induces synaptic defects affecting both short and long term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, STOP has been identified as a component of synaptic structures in neurons, despite the absence of microtubules in nerve terminals, indicating the existence of mechanisms able to induce a translocation of STOP from microtubules to synaptic compartments. Here we have tested STOP phosphorylation as a candidate mechanism for STOP relocalization. We show that, both in vitro and in vivo, STOP is phosphorylated by the multifunctional enzyme calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which is a key enzyme for synaptic plasticity. This phosphorylation occurs on at least two independent sites. Phosphorylated forms of STOP do not bind microtubules in vitro and do not co-localize with microtubules in cultured differentiating neurons. Instead, phosphorylated STOP co-localizes with actin assemblies along neurites or at branching points. Correlatively, we find that STOP binds to actin in vitro. Finally, in differentiated neurons, phosphorylated STOP co-localizes with clusters of synaptic proteins, whereas unphosphorylated STOP does not. Thus, STOP phosphorylation by CaMKII may promote STOP translocation from microtubules to synaptic compartments where it may interact with actin, which could be important for STOP function in synaptic plasticity.

Microtubules are vital components of the cell cytoskeleton, being involved in cell mitosis, intracellular organization, and cell morphogenesis. Neurons contain abundant subpopulations of stable microtubules that resist depolymerizing conditions such as exposure to cold temperature and to depolymerizing drugs (1Baas P.W. Slaughter T. Brown A. Black M.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 134-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J.

In neurons, microtubule stabilization is mainly because of association with a family of proteins known as STOPs 2The abbreviations used are: STOP, stable tubule only polypeptide; CE, calcium eluate; E-STOP, Early STOP; N-STOP, neuronal adult STOP; STOP-P, phosphorylated STOP; PSD, post-synaptic density; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. (stable tubule only polypeptides). STOP proteins were initially characterized as microtubule cold-stabilizing factors whose activity was inhibited by interaction with Ca2+-calmodulin (4Job D. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4679-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and subsequent work has shown that STOPs contain bifunctional modules comprised of overlapping calmodulin-binding and microtubule-stabilizing sequences (5Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Neurons contain two major variants of STOP, E-STOP (89 kDa) and N-STOP (116 kDa). E-STOP is present in mouse brain from embryonic stage E16 to adulthood, whereas N-STOP appears at birth and is subsequently expressed in the adult brain (2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 6Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). STOP function has been investigated in the whole animal by studying STOP null mice (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In these mice, microtubule cold stability is suppressed, with no dramatic consequences for mouse organogenesis, viability or brain anatomy. However, STOP-/- mice display multiple synaptic deficits that affect both long and short term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. These synaptic defects are associated with depleted vesicular pools in glutamatergic nerve terminals and with severe behavioral disorders (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which, interestingly, are specifically alleviated with long term neuroleptic treatment. It has been very surprising that a protein associated with microtubules along whole neurites turns out to be important for glutamatergic synaptic function, despite apparent microtubule absence in nerve terminals. However, from proteomic analysis of synaptosomal fractions, there is evidence that STOP localizes to synapses (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 9Peng J. Kim M.J. Cheng D. Duong D.M. Gygi S.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21003-21011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and this raises questions concerning the mechanisms that could promote STOP dissociation from microtubules and relocalization in synaptic structures. Previous evidence has indicated that STOP can be inactivated by calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation (10Job D. Rauch C.T. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3894-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), correlated with the presence of putative CaMKII phosphorylation sites in the STOP sequence (6Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, long term potentiation, which is known to involve CaMKII, is severely impaired in STOP null mice (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we have tested both the occurrence and the consequences of STOP phosphorylation. We show that CaMKII phosphorylates STOP on at least two independent sites (Ser-198, Ser-491), both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, phosphorylated STOPs do not bind to microtubules in vitro. Additionally, the phosphorylated forms of STOP co-localize with actin-rich structures in cultured neurons and bind to polymerized actin in vitro. Finally, phosphorylated STOP protein associates with synaptic markers following synaptogenesis, in cultured neurons. Thus, phosphorylation by CaMKII may delocalize STOPs from microtubules and allow STOP association with synaptic actin, which may be important for synaptic plasticity. Purification of STOP and CaMKII from Mouse Brain (Calcium Eluate (CE) Fraction)—Purification of STOP protein from adult mice brain was performed as described by Pirollet et al. (11Pirollet F. Rauch C.T. Job D. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All buffers used during STOP purification contained 2 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 104 units/ml aprotinin; 20 μm leupeptin). Briefly, 40 brains from OF 1 mice were homogenized in MEM buffer (100 mm Mes, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm EGTA, pH 6.75) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a Sepharose-S Fast Flow column and bound proteins were eluted in MEM containing 0.4 m NaCl. The eluate was adjusted to 2 mm calcium and passed through a calmodulinagarose column equilibrated in MEM buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.4 m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted in MEM buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and 1 mm EGTA. The purified fraction (CE) was stored in elution buffer containing 10% glycerol, at -80 °C. Phosphorylation Reaction—CE fraction containing STOPs was buffer-exchanged to 50 mm Pipes, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. The phosphorylation reaction was performed in the presence of 100 μm ATP (added of 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP when indicated), 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.3 μm calmodulin, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.5 μm mycrocystine, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, during 30 min at 30 °C. For quantitative experiments, gels were dried before exposure on a screen for analysis with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager® FX, Bio-Rad). Relative amounts of incorporated radioactivity were quantified using Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad). For control experiments, the buffer-exchanged CE fraction was incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 °C, resulting in dephosphorylation of STOPs. For experiments using preactivated CaMKII, CE fraction was incubated with 30 μm calmodulin and 0.7 mm calcium for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylation reaction was then performed in the presence or in the absence of 2.5 mm EGTA at 30 °C for 30 min. Phospho-STOP Antibodies and Primary Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against phosphosynthetic peptides corresponding to the potential phosphorylated sites in N-STOP protein, as shown in Fig. 1A. The phosphopeptides P1-P4 used for the immunization were the following: RPRpSEYQPSDAPFC (amino acids 136-148), RPQpSQERGPMQLC (amino acids 195-206), RAWpTDIKPVKPIKC (amino acids 435-447), RRIRpSLYSEPFKEC (amino acids 487-499), according to amino acid numbering of mouse N-STOP (GenBank accession number CAA75930). These peptides were used to generate sera P1, P2, P3, and P4, respectively (Eurogentec). The C-terminal cysteine residue of each peptide was introduced for the purification steps. Crude sera were affinity-purified against the phosphorylated peptide on Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce). Antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and then incubated for 1 h with the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide coupled on Sulfolink gel to absorb antibodies reacting with non-phosphorylated peptides. Polyclonal antibodies reacting only with phosphorylated peptides were collected in the flow-through and stored at -80 °C in 50% glycerol. Affinity-purified P2 and P4 polyclonal antibodies did not show detectable cross-reactivity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests (not shown). The same phosphopeptides P1-P4 were used to generate monoclonal antibodies following standard procedure. Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for anti-STOP phosphopeptides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The positive hybridomas were selected and screened on Western blot for immunoreactivity on phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated STOP proteins. Positives hybridomas were subcloned by limiting dilution. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: mAb against α-tubulin (alpha3a clone (12Erck C. Peris L. Andrieux A. Meissirel C. Gruber A.D. Vernet M. Schweitzer A. Saoudi Y. Pointu H. Bosc C. Salin P.A. Job D. Wehland J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), ascitic fluid, dilution 1/1,000 for immunofluorescence); mAb 175 against C-terminal part of N-STOP (6Bosc C. Cronk J.D. Pirollet F. Watterson D.M. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (dilution 20 μg/ml for immunofluorescence and 1 μg/ml for Western blot); affinity-purified phospho-STOP P2 and P4 antibodies (dilution 20 μg/ml for immunofluorescence and 1 μg/ml for Western blot); P1 mAb against phospho-STOP (hybridoma culture supernatant, dilution 1/10 for Western blot); mAb against CaMKII (Ref C89220, Transduction laboratories), Homer (all isoforms, Chemicon), synapsin1 (BD Biosciences), CaMKI and CaMKIV (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used following manufacturer's advice. Sedimentation of STOPs with Microtubules or Actin—All proteins were preclarified at 150,000 × g for 15 min in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 4 °C prior start experiments. STOP proteins of the CE fraction were either phosphorylated by CaMKII or dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase treatment as described above. Microtubule binding assay was performed as in Masson and Kreis (13Masson D. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using taxol-stabilized microtubules (4 μm) as substrates. Actin binding assay was performed with CE fraction containing 0.5 μm phospho- or dephospho-STOP (as estimated on Coomassie Blue gels, using known amounts of pure STOP as standards) complemented or not with various amount of G-actin (1, 6, and 15 μm), in 100 μl ofa1× F-polymerization buffer (10× stock: 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 1 m KCl, 50 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. After 90 min of incubation at 22 °C, samples were centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed and kept; the pellets were washed twice with polymerization buffer and dissolved in 100 μl of H20. Laemmli buffer was added to the pellet solutions and to the supernatants. Equal amounts of each sample were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred on nitrocellulose and blotted with mAb 175 or CaMKII antibodies. Cell Culture—Hippocampal cell cultures were prepared according to Dotti et al. (14Dotti C.G. Sullivan C.A. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1454-1468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse hippocampi (E 18.5) were removed and digested in 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min. After manual dissociation, cells were plated at a concentration of 5,000-15,000 cells/cm2 on poly-l-lysine (Sigma) coated coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). One hour after plating, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing B27 and N2 supplement (Invitrogen). Inhibitor of CaMKII, KN62 (5 μm) was applied to neuronal culture for 8 h prior to cell fixation when indicated. In some experiments, neuronal cultures were subjected to cytochalasin treatment (50 μm, for 10 min). In some experiments, neurons in culture were activated by exposure to glutamate treatment (glutamate 100 μm, glycine 10 μm) for 15 min prior to fixation. Immunofluorescence—Neurons grown on coverslips for 12-30 days were fixed 20 min with warmed solution of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.12 m sucrose, in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and then permeabilized for 3 min using 0.2% Triton X-100, in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence by incubation with primary antibodies for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20 and then with secondary antibodies (Cy3- or Alexa488-coupled from Molecular Probes and Jackson ImmunoResearch, respectively) for 40 min. To visualize F-actin, rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was included with the secondary antibodies. The cells were analyzed with an inverted microscope. Images were digitalized using a Princeton RTE-CCD-1317-K/1 camera (Princeton Instruments) and IPLab Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). CaMKII Phosphorylation Sites in N-STOP—The consensus amino acids sequence for CaMKII phosphorylation is K/RXXS/T, where either S or T residues are phosphorylated (15Pearson R.B. Woodgett J.R. Cohen P. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14471-14476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search for such sequences in murine N-STOP protein sequence (GenBank Accession number CAA75930) revealed four candidate sequences (P1-P4, Fig. 1A) containing serine or threonine residues Ser-139, Ser-198, Thr-438, and Ser-491, respectively. N-STOP contains two classes of microtubule-stabilizing modules, Mc and Mn and multiple calmodulin-binding sites (5Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The locations of P1-P4 sites relative to these STOP functional domains (5Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1A. All four P1-P4 sequences are located within or are overlapping a calmodulin-binding site on N-STOP. P1 and P3 are located into or are overlapping with microtubule-stabilizing modules Mn1 and Mn3, respectively. STOP Phosphorylation by CaMKII in Vitro—We used semipurified fractions to assay STOP protein phosphorylation in vitro. These protein fractions (CE fractions) were purified from mouse brain extracts by ion exchange chromatography followed by calmodulin affinity chromatography. The procedure resulted in the isolation of several calmodulin-binding proteins as shown on SDS gels in Fig. 1B. CE fractions contained one major band at 116 kDa and one other prominent band at 52 kDa. According to immunoblots of CE fraction, with anti-N-STOP antibody (Fig. 1C) and with anti-CaMKII antibody (Fig. 1D) the 116-kDa band corresponded to N-STOP, and the 52- and 58-kDa bands to subunits of CaMKII. Thus, CE fractions contained both N-STOP and CaMKII. CE fractions were also immunoblotted with anti-CaMKI and CaMKIV antibodies with negative results (not shown). Incubation of CE fraction proteins with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography showed little phosphate incorporation in the bands corresponding to N-STOP or to CaMKII (Fig. 1E, left column). Phosphate incorporation was dramatically enhanced in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin with an apparent shift of phosphorylated bands, which migrated at positions corresponding to higher apparent molecular weights (Fig. 1E, right column). Band shifts of both N-STOP and CaMKII following phosphorylation were confirmed on immunoblots (Fig. 1F). The whole N-STOP band was shifted, showing that all STOP molecules had been phosphorylated during the phosphorylation reaction. In a time course analysis of STOP phosphorylation (Fig. 1, G and H), STOP phosphorylation reached a plateau within 10 min. After 1 min of incubation, a small shift of N-STOP was detectable (Fig. 1H), showing that STOP molecules had already incorporated at least one molecule of phosphate at this time point. According to quantitative autoradiography, the ratio of phosphate incorporation in N-STOP at the plateau versus phosphate incorporation at 1 min was ∼3.7. Assuming that the first shift corresponds to the incorporation of a single phosphate group in STOP molecules, this ratio may reflect the phosphorylation of the four CaMKII phosphorylation consensus sites at the plateau. We used purified N-STOP and pure CaMKII to test whether N-STOP was truly a substrate for CaMKII. We observed both N-STOP phosphorylation and shift following STOP phosphorylation with CaMKII (supplemental Fig. S1). However, pure STOP is hard to prepare in biochemical amounts and cannot be stored; hence, all subsequent experiments were run using CE fractions. High Concentrations of Ca2+-Calmodulin Inhibit STOP Phosphorylation by CaMKII—The overlap of all P1-P4 putative STOP phosphorylation sites with calmodulin-binding sites on N-STOP (Fig. 1A) raised the possibility of an inhibition of STOP phosphorylation through steric hindrance, in the presence of an excess of Ca2+-calmodulin complex. We examined STOP phosphorylation in CE extracts in the presence of varying amounts of calmodulin ranging from 0.003 to 30 μm. Full activation of CaMKII occurred for calmodulin concentrations above 0.03 μm as indicated by the band shift of CaMKII (Fig. 2A). STOP phosphorylation was also observed above 0.03 μm calmodulin as indicated by the shift of N-STOP molecular weight on Western blots (Fig. 2A). However, at calmodulin concentrations above 0.3 μm, there was a small but reproducible decrease in N-STOP shift, indicating inhibition of N-STOP phosphorylation by calmodulin in the micromolar range. When CaMKII is preactivated through autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+-calmodulin, the enzyme remains activated following Ca2+ removal, as long as dephosphorylation does not occur. We made use of this persistent CaMKII activation for further test the inhibition of N-STOP phosphorylation by Ca2+-calmodulin complexes. Preactivated CaMKII was added to CE fractions, in the presence of 30 μm Ca2+-calmodulin, and in the presence or in the absence of EGTA (Fig. 2B) to inactivate or not the Ca2+-calmodulin complexes. The N-STOP band shift was markedly reduced in the absence of EGTA (active Ca2+-calmodulin complex) compared with the band shift observed in the presence of EGTA (no active Ca2+-calmodulin complex). Altogether these results show that CaMKII-mediated STOP phosphorylation is inhibited by Ca2+-calmodulin binding to N-STOP, compatible with an overlap of P1-P4 with calmodulin-binding sites, on the N-STOP sequence. Phosphorylated N-STOP Does Not Bind to Microtubules in Vitro—We next investigated whether the phosphorylation of STOP by CaMKII could affect STOP binding to microtubules, as phosphorylation often regulates the binding on microtubules of associated proteins (16Ozer R.S. Halpain S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3573-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Sanchez C. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 133-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). CE fractions, with or without prior phosphorylation, were mixed with taxol-stabilized microtubules. Microtubules were then pelleted, and the STOP content of both supernatant and pellet was analyzed on immunoblots. In the absence of phosphorylation, STOP co-sedimented with microtubules, being present in microtubule pellets and absent in supernatants (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, phosphorylated STOP was absent in microtubule pellets, being only present in the supernatants (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, phosphorylated STOP does not bind to microtubules in vitro indicating a strong regulation by CaMKII of the STOP binding to microtubule in vivo. Phosphorylated STOP Antibodies—We designed phosphopeptides corresponding to the four potential CaMKII phosphorylation sequences on STOP (P1-P4, Fig. 1A) and used them to produce polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific to phosphorylated forms of STOP. On Western blots of CE fractions, P2 and P4 polyclonal antibodies reacted with N-STOP (Fig. 4). The signal was strongly enhanced when a phosphorylation step was introduced prior to immunoblotting and was erased when CE fractions were exposed to alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4). Additionally we obtained a monoclonal antibody P1, which reacted only very weakly with N-STOP in CE fractions, whereas a strong signal was observed when a phosphorylation step was introduced prior to immunoblotting (Fig. 4). These results indicate that at least three of the four P1-P4 peptides are phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro, at Ser-139, Ser-198, and Ser-491 positions. Additionally, the immunoreactivity of P2 and P4 antibodies on native CE fractions indicates the presence of phosphorylated STOP protein in adult brain extract. This strongly suggests that STOP is phosphorylated at least on Ser-198 and Ser-491 residues in vivo. Phosphorylated STOP Co-localizes with Actin-rich Structures in Differentiating Neurons—We used one of the polyclonal phospho-STOP antibody, P2 antibody and N-STOP monoclonal antibody to localize phosphorylated STOP and total N-STOP in neuronal cells. The specificity of P2 antibody for STOP labeling in neuronal culture was assessed by staining wild type and STOP-deficient neurons (supplemental Fig. S2). Hippocampal neurons from E18.5 embryos were cultured for 12 days in vitro, a stage of differentiation at which N-STOP is expressed. At this stage of differentiation neurons are forming a complex network comprising neurite extensions and branching points (18Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9757-9769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where individual microtubules are distinct. Total N-STOP labeling showed co-localization of STOP and tubulin staining in neurites (Fig. 5A, upper left panels), whereas phosphorylated STOP staining using P2 antibody showed a diffuse staining, not co-localizing with tubulin staining and concentrated in spike-like structures appended to neurites (Fig. 5A, bottom left panels). At branching points, N-STOP staining again co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 5A, upper right panels). In contrast, P2 labeling was concentrated in a ring-shaped zone, underneath the cell membrane, not co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 5A, bottom right panels). Because neuronal actin concentrates in spikes along neurites and in submembrane domains at branching points (18Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9757-9769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility of a co-localization of phosphorylated STOP with actin. P2 antibody staining co-localized with actin staining in spikes (Fig. 5B, bottom left panels). At branching points, P2 stained the internal border of the actin-rich extensions (Fig. 5B, bottom right panels). Interestingly, cytochalasin treatment, which results in a disorganization of the actin network, also induced a loss of P2 staining indicating an association of phosphorylated STOP with F-actin assemblies (Fig. 5C). When neurons were activated by a 15-min exposure to glutamate prior to fixation, the P2 staining of spikes increased 2-fold, compatible with CaMKII activation, and enhanced STOP phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). CaMKII phosphorylation sites can be substrate for the cyclic AMP-regulated protein kinase, PKA, which is also present in synapses and is involved in synaptic plasticity (19Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase A is insensitive to the general CaMkinases inhibitor KN62. In neuronal cells, exposure to KN62 suppresses the P2 staining, indicating inhibition of STOP phosphorylation (Fig. 5E). This result argues against a significant contribution of protein kinase A in STOP phosphorylation, in vivo. We then tested whether STOP could interact directly with polymeric actin in vitro, using standard sedimentation assays. CE STOP fractions, either phosphorylated or treated with alkaline phosphatase, were mixed with actin under polymerizing conditions. Then, polymerized actin was pelleted, and STOP content was analyzed on immunoblots, in both supernatants and pellets (Fig. 6). The concentrations of F-actin at which approximately half of STOP co-sedimented with actin were of ∼1 and 6 μm for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STOP, respectively (Fig. 6, B and C). In the same sedimentation assays, CaMKII co-sedimented with F-actin when non-phosphorylated, whereas phosphorylated CaMKII remained in the supernatants, as expected from previous study (20Shen K. Meyer T. Science. 1999; 284: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified STOP fractions, devoid of detectable amounts of CaMKII also bound to F-actin (Fig. 6B), indicating that actin binding is a genuine property of STOP. These results indicate that STOP and phosphorylated STOP both interact directly with polymerized actin in vitro, although with different Kds. Phosphorylated Forms of STOP Co-localize with Clusters of Synaptic Proteins in Differentiated Neurons—Hippocampal neurons were cultured for 45 days in vitro, a stage of differentiation at which neurons are forming a complex network and are connected by synapses. In such cultures, synaptic proteins form clusters. Clusters corresponding to different synaptic proteins are both present in transport vesicles and at synapses. In differentiated neurons, the presynaptic vesicle-associated protein synapsin and the post-synaptic PSD-associated protein homer, showed a typical cluster distribution (Fig. 7). As these markers, phosphorylated STOP (STOP-P) was distributed in clusters and phosphorylated STOP staining partially overlapped with synapsin or homer stainings (Fig. 7, arrows). This overlap was never observed with N-STOP. Hence, these results are compatible with a presence of phosphorylated STOP in both the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. STOP proteins are important for synaptic plasticity, as demonstrated by the synaptic defects in both long and short term plasticity exhibited by STOP-deficient mice (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given the apparent absence of microtubules in nerve terminals, it has been surprising to find a synaptic function for a protein tightly associated with microtubules in neurites (2Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). STOP function in synaptic plasticity may arise indirectly from modifications of microtubule dynamics and their resulting downstream effects on synaptic functions (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, there are indications for a synaptic localization of STOPs, which are present in synaptosomal fractions (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and in the PSD proteome (9Peng J. Kim M.J. Cheng D. Duong D.M. Gygi S.P. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21003-21011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Here, we find that CaMKII, which is a key enzyme for synaptic plasticity (21Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar, 22Gleason M.R. Higashijima S. Dallman J. Liu K. Mandel G. Fetcho J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 217-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), can inhibit STOP binding to microtubules through phosphorylation, thereby offering a possible mechanism for persistent STOP dissociation from microtubules and localization in other compartments, during synaptic activation. N-STOP is phosphorylated by CaMKII in vitro on at least three independent sites (Ser-139, Ser-198, and Ser-491) of four consensus CaMKII phosphorylation sites in the sequence. Previous studies have shown that N-STOP interaction with microtubules can be inhibited by direct Ca2+-calmodulin binding to microtubules (4Job D. Fischer E.H. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4679-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data suggest a model in which N-STOP dissociates from microtubules in two separate ways, either by binding Ca2+-calmodulin in response to transient Ca2+ influxes induced by synaptic activation, or through phosphorylation by active CaMKII, in the absence of Ca2+-calmodulin. The latter mechanism could be particularly relevant during short or long term synaptic potentiations, which both involve active CaMKII, after the Ca2+ peak dropped back to basal levels. In cultured neurons, we find that phosphorylated STOP co-localizes with actin spikes along neurites and at branching points during differentiation. We also find that both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of STOP bind to polymerized actin in vitro, although phosphorylated STOP has apparently less affinity for F-actin. In cells, the overall concentration of F-actin is ∼100 μm (23Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), which is higher than the F-actin concentrations found to absorb both dephosphorylated and phosphorylated STOP quantitatively, in vitro (6 and 16 μm, respectively). It is uncertain whether STOP binding to actin at actin spikes or at branching points is important physiologically, because we have not detected any obvious perturbation of neurite morphogenesis in STOP null mice (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A major signature of STOP inactivation, is a dramatic depletion of synaptic vesicle pools in glutamatergic synapses, which could be central to some of the synaptic disorders observed in STOP null mice (7Andrieux A. Salin P.A. Vernet M. Kujala P. Baratier J. Gory-Fauré S. Bosc C. Pointu H. Proietto D. Schweitzer A. Denarier E. Klumperman J. Job D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2350-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Actin is important for the localization and regulation of synaptic vesicle pools and binding to actin may be important for STOP effect on the size of vesicular pool (24Fischer M. Kaech S. Knutti D. Matus A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 25Fukazawa Y. Saitoh Y. Ozawa F. Ohta Y. Mizuno K. Inokuchi K.

A. 2000; 97: 6856-6861Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is evidence for a burst of actin polymerization during synaptic potentiation, both in the pre- and post-synaptic compartments (24Fischer M. Kaech S. Knutti D. Matus A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 27Hannah M.J. Schmidt A.A. Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 361-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we find phosphorylated STOP in the vicinity of pre- and post-synaptic protein clusters, in differentiated neurons. Finally, cross-talk between microtubule and actin assemblies have been a subject of great interest in recent times, and several proteins with dual microtubule/actin binding properties have been identified as crucial integrators of the cytoskeleton (8Dehmelt L. Halpain S. J. Neurobiol. 2004; 58: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 31Kodama A. Karakesisoglou I. Wong E. Vaezi A. Fuchs E.

Here we present five crystal structures of FlaA1 in the presence of substrate, inhibitors, and bound cofactor, with resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 1.9 Å. These structures reveal that the enzyme is a novel member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Additional electron microscopy studies show the enzyme to possess a hexameric doughnut-shaped quaternary structure. NMR analyses of “real time” enzyme-substrate reactions indicate that FlaA1 is a UDP-GlcNAc-inverting 4,6-dehydratase, suggesting that the enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthetic pathway of a pseudaminic acid derivative, which is implicated in protein glycosylation. Guided by evidence from site-directed mutagenesis and computational simulations, a three-step reaction mechanism is proposed that involves Lys-133 functioning as both a catalytic acid and base.

Helicobacter pylori is a spiral shaped, motile, microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium that resides in the gastric mucus layer or adheres to the epithelial lining of the stomach (1Marshall B.J. Warren J.R. Lancet. 1984; 1: 1311-1315Abstract PubMed Scopus (4173) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that half to two-thirds of the world's population is chronically infected with H. pylori, and prevalence among adults in developing countries is typically 80-90% (2Graham D.Y. Klein P.D. Opekun A.R. Boutton T.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The bacterium can asymptomatically remain in the human stomach for decades; however, infections can lead to gastric inflammation and ulceration. In addition to its well established etiological role in several gastroduodenal diseases, H. pylori infection has also been implicated in the development of gastric cancer (3Forman D. Newell D.G. Fullerton F. Yarnell J.W. Stacey A.R. Wald N. Sitas F. Br. Med. J. 1991; 302: 1302-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 4Parsonnet J. Friedman G.D. Vandersteen D.P. Chang Y. Vogelman J.H. Orentreich N. Sibley R.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3583) Google Scholar). The significance of the discovery that H. pylori plays a causal role in gastritis and ulceration was recently recognized through the awarding of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Drs. Marshall and Warren.The pathogenicity of H. pylori can be attributed to numerous virulence factors that allow for host colonization, among these are urease, adhesins, flagella, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 6The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; MES, 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pse, pseudaminic acid. 6The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; MES, 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pse, pseudaminic acid.

Labigne A. Suerbaum S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3010-3020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the flagella enable H. pylori to penetrate the gastric mucus layer and reach the epithelial cells, and LPS O antigens employ mimicry to Lewis blood group antigens to facilitate subsequent cell adhesion and colonization (8Appelmelk B.J. Monteiro M.A. Martin S.L. Moran A.P. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 565-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because of drug resistance and an increase in treatment failure, the biochemical pathways responsible for the synthesis and delivery of these virulence factors have received much attention as they contain potential targets for drug development (9Merkx-Jacques A. Obhi R.K. Bethune G. Creuzenet C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Schirm M. Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Austin J. Thibault P. Logan S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1579-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).The flaA1 (HP0840) gene product has been shown to be involved in the synthesis of both flagella and LPS, and as such it plays a critical role in H. pylori pathogenesis and colonization. Specifically, disruption of the flaA1 gene results in bacteria devoid of flagella and with altered LPS that lacks most of the O antigen (9Merkx-Jacques A. Obhi R.K. Bethune G. Creuzenet C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Schirm M. Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Austin J. Thibault P. Logan S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1579-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). FlaA1 is a 37-kDa protein whose sequence suggests that it is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. Several biochemical studies have shown that the substrate of FlaA1 is UDP-linked N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc; UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucose). However, these same studies present conflicting data on the reaction product produced by FlaA1, hence characterizing the enzyme as a 4,6-dehydratase (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a 4,6-dehydratase-4-reductase (10Schirm M. Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Austin J. Thibault P. Logan S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1579-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or a 4,6-dehydratase-5-epimerase (12Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the sequence of FlaA1, even given the structural conservation within the SDR superfamily, provides no indications on the nature of the catalyzed reaction. In fact, it is unclear for any of the three suggested catalytic functions what a possible reaction mechanism could be. The resulting confusion impacts the identification of the pathway in which the enzyme participates and how this pathway plays a role in virulence factor biosynthesis. Furthermore, it hampers efforts to exploit FlaA1 as a potential antibiotic target. To address these questions, we have performed structural biological studies of FlaA1, using a combination of x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, and NMR spectroscopy as well as computational simulations and bioinformatics analyses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallography—FlaA1 was purified as described previously (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A portion of the purified sample was subjected to chemical reduction to prepare the FlaA1·NADPH sample based on a method described by Thoden et al. (13Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Crystals of five different ternary complexes of FlaA1 were grown at room temperature by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion, using as reservoir solution 10% (v/v) polyethylene glycol-200, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5% (v/w) polyethylene glycol-3000, and 4% acetone, and providing 10 m excess of substrate. For the crystallization of the FlaA1·NADP+·UDP-GlcNAc and FlaA1·NADP+·UDP-Glc ternary complexes, 5 m excess of NAD+ was also included in the crystallization condition. Note that crystals of the FlaA1·NADPH·UDP-GlcNAc ternary complex had a distinct yellow color reflecting the oxidation state of the cofactor. Diffraction data were collected at the X8C beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories, and processed using the HKL suite of programs (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

Exploiting the presence of 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry, the remaining C-terminal region of FlaA1 was built over successive rounds of refinement by mask-less averaging of σA-weighted difference electron density maps with RAVE (17Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar). Crystal structures for FlaA1 in complex with other sugar nucleotides were subsequently determined by difference Fourier methods. Final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1.Electron Microscopy—Purified FlaA1 was adsorbed to a carbon-coated Formvar film on a 400-mesh copper electron microscope grid, washed with double-distilled water, negatively stained with NANO-W™ (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY), blotted, and allowed to air-dry. Electron micrographs were taken on a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope under low dose conditions at a nominal magnification of ×73,000 and recorded on Kodak Electron Microscope Film 4489. Micrographs were subsequently digitized at 4800 × 2400 dpi and analyzed using IMAGIC-V electron image processing software (18van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Briefly, 592 smaller images comprising a single, defined FlaA1 complex were selected from micrographs and subjected to standard “single particle analysis” to define reproducible projection views (19van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 307-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis and Activity Assay—Construction of mutants, protein production, and activity assays for FlaA1 K133E and K133M variants followed procedures described previously (20Creuzenet C. Urbanic R.V. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26769-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy, employing a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, was used to assess that mutations did not affect protein folding. For activity assays the production of product was measured by capillary electrophoresis analysis as described previously (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—As the product of FlaA1 may be labile, the FlaA1 reaction was monitored with NMR, and the reaction product was identified directly in aqueous reaction buffer without purification. FlaA1 protein (90 μg) was suspended in 200 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O sodium phosphate buffer (25 mm NaPO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and placed in a 3-m[sacp]m NMR tube. To begin the reaction, 5 mm UDP-GlcNAc was added. The enzymatic reaction was monitored using 1H NMR analysis (25 °C) at 500 MHz (1H) with a Varian Inova spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto) equipped with a Varian Z-gradient 3-m[sacp]m triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P) probe. The reaction was stopped after 3 h when the concentrations of starting material and product were equal by removing the FlaA1 protein. The structure of the product was then examined using standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated NMR pulse sequences (from Varian) and selective one-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (12Schoenhofen I.C. McNally D.J. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D. Young M. Dick S. Wakarchuk W.W. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Computational Analyses—Values of the pKa for three active site residues (Asp-132, Lys-133, and Tyr-141) were computed using WHATIF (21Vriend G. J. Mol. Graphics. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 22Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), where DelPhi was employed to calculate the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation (24Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). For ligands, partial charges were assigned with SYBYL 6.9 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis) using the MMFF94 (25Halgren T.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Crossref Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) force field, and topology files were generated with PRODRG (26Schuttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). In the calculations, the dielectric constants for protein and solvent were set to 8 and 80, respectively, and the ionic strength of the solvent was placed at 0.144 mm. Besides the three residues listed above, an additional 21 of 94 titratable residues were included in full pKa calculations (22Nielsen J.E. McCammon J.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar).To examine pKa changes during catalysis, calculations were performed on five models, representing the distinct states along the reaction coordinate: holoenzyme, substrate-bound state, first reaction intermediate following oxidation, second reaction intermediate following water elimination, and product-bound state.RESULTSOverall Structure and Oligomeric Arrangement of FlaA1— The three-dimensional structure of FlaA1 is bilobal in shape (Fig. 1A). The larger, predominantly N-terminal, lobe consists of residues 1-174, 208-234, and 265-317 and contains a 10-stranded mostly parallel β-sheet flanked on either side by eight helices. The smaller, predominantly C-terminal, lobe is composed of residues 175-207, 235-264, and 318-333 and possesses three α-helices and two short two-stranded β-sheets. There are a total of five crossover points between the two lobes, resulting in an intertwined connectivity. The fold of FlaA1 confirms that this enzyme is a member of the SDR superfamily. However, FlaA1 is unique in that within the larger lobe the six-stranded parallel β-sheet of the Rossmann fold has been extended by four additional strands.Biophysical studies for FlaA1 have suggested that under physiological conditions the enzyme is organized in a higher order structure; gel filtration experiments suggest that the enzyme is a dimer (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas dynamic light scattering studies of purified samples predict at least a tetrameric arrangement (data not shown). Analysis of crystal packing interactions also suggests that FlaA1 does not exist as a monomer under physiological conditions. The FlaA1 protomer possesses two extended buried interfaces within the crystal lattice, both located on the larger lobe of the molecule, positioned as a wedge. The first interface buries ∼3300 Å2 of surface area and is predominantly hydrophobic in nature. The second interface buries ∼2700 Å2 of surface area and incorporates 4-6 salt bridges. Because of the combination of crystallographic and noncrystallographic symmetry, six FlaA1 protomers form a compact doughnut in which ∼20% of the total surface area is buried (Fig. 1B). To examine the physiological relevance of this hexameric arrangement, electron microscopy was performed using a diluted FlaA1 sample. Doughnut-shaped protein particles were observed in negatively stained micrographs. Subsequent single-particle analysis revealed FlaA1 oligomers that are in excellent agreement with the hexameric structure derived from crystallographic analysis, confirming that the enzyme exists as a hexamer in solution (Fig. 1, C-F).Active Site Architecture and Catalytic Residues—The FlaA1 crystal structures reveal the cofactor and substrate-binding sites to be located in the larger and smaller lobes, respectively. The cofactor for FlaA1 is identified as NADP+/NADPH, which binds in a canonical manner to the Rossmann fold portion of the predominantly N-terminal lobe. Most intriguingly, exogenous NADP+ was not included as part of the crystallization conditions, indicating that NADP+ was co-purified and thus must bind tightly to the enzyme. In fact, supplementing the crystallization conditions with excess NAD+ did not dislodge the NADP+. This is in agreement with data from biophysical studies where addition of exogenous cofactor had no effect on the catalytic activity of FlaA1 (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Crystal structures of FlaA1 were obtained with the substrate UDP-GlcNAc (with reduced and oxidized cofactor) and with UDP, UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), and UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). In all five structures well defined density was observed for the UDP moiety whose uracil group forms an H-bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro-197 and whose diphosphate group is stabilized by two arginine residues (205 and 258) and a helix dipole moment. However, density for the saccharide moiety was only seen in the FlaA1·NADPH·UDP-GlcNAc and FaA1·NADP+·UDP-Gal ternary complexes (Fig. 2). It is not uncommon that saccharide density is lacking or ill defined in SDR enzymes that bind UDP-hexoses as this moiety must be inherently mobile for catalysis to proceed (16Ishiyama N. Creuzenet C.

However, the FlaA1·NADPH·UDP-GlcNAc structure provides insight on the average location of the hexose moiety of the substrate in FlaA1, which is in close proximity to the nicotinamide group of the cofactor, with both rings being parallel to each other. Surrounding the GlcNAc moiety are several residues that most likely play a role in catalysis, specifically Thr-131 and Tyr-141 of the (S/T)YK triad commonly found in SDR enzymes, and Asp-132 and Lys-133 (Fig. 2A). Previously, the importance of Tyr-141 for catalysis was illustrated through site-directed mutagenesis, consistent with its identified role in other SDR enzymes (30Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, we mutated Lys-133 to assess its importance in catalysis. Both K133M and K133E mutant proteins proved to lack activity, suggesting that Lys-133 is also important for enzyme catalysis.FIGURE 2Active site architecture.

However, unlike UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal is able to completely inhibit the enzyme (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of FlaA1·NADP+·UDP-Gal shows that unlike in the complex with UDP-Glc, the hexose ring is ordered but positioned away from the nicotinamide ring, allowing it to make specific interactions with the enzyme (Fig. 2B). These increased points of interaction between UDP-Gal and FlaA1 are apparently sufficient to result in effective inhibition of the enzyme.Reaction Catalyzed by FlaA1—FlaA1 has been characterized previously as a 4,6-dehydratase (11Creuzenet C.

The structural data presented here are incompatible with FlaA1 being a 4,6-dehydratase-4-reductase, which would convert UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-quinovosamine. The reason is that such a conversion cannot be accomplished in a manner that regenerates the NADP+ cofactor, mandating replenishment. However, we have shown that the NADP+/NADPH is tightly bound to FlaA1 and cannot be readily dislodged. Yet, it remains possible that FlaA1 is either a 4,6-dehydratase or a 4,6-dehydratase-5-epimerase. To address the disparity and contradictions on the reaction catalyzed, we used NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the chemical structure of the product of FlaA1 catalysis. Because intermediates of UDP-saccharide biosynthetic pathways are known to be unstable during reaction product purification (31Kneidinger B. O'Riordan K. Li J. Brisson J.R. Lee J.C. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3615-3627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the reaction catalyzed by FlaA1 was monitored directly in an NMR tube so that the product could be analyzed in a temporal fashion.Analysis of the NMR data obtained for the FlaA1 product was inconsistent with it being UDP-N-acetyl-α-d-quinovosamine. Instead, the compound was identified as UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-hexose-4,4-diol (Supplemental Material). By taking into consideration the aqueous conditions, this gem-diol compound is in equilibrium with UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-β-l-arabino-hex-4-ulose. Therefore, we have identified FlaA1 to be a UDP-GlcNAc 4,6-dehydratase that additionally inverts the chirality at the C-5 position. Henceforth we will describe the activity of FlaA1 as an inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity, to distinguish it from other 4,6-dehydratases that do not affect the chirality at C-5. Note that the reaction catalyzed by FlaA1 can be accomplished in a manner that regenerates the cofactor during catalysis, consistent with tight binding of NADP+/NADPH.DISCUSSIONOur structural studies have shown that FlaA1 is a hexameric enzyme belonging to the SDR superfamily, possessing inverting 4,6-dehydratase activity. To our knowledge FlaA1 is the first SDR superfamily member with a hexameric quaternary structure and the first inverting 4,6-dehydratase that is structurally characterized. However, three-dimensional structures of several 4,6-dehydratases that retain the chirality of the C-5 atom have been determined. Specifically, structural studies have been reported for dTDP-Glc 4,6-dehydratases (29Allard S.T. Beis K. Giraud M.F. Hegeman A.D. Gross J.W. Wilmouth R.C. Whitfield C. Graninger M. Messner P.

In comparison, FlaA1 shares only 12-16% sequence identity with these enzymes, and the structural common core is limited to ∼220 residues. In fact, FlaA1 is as similar, if not more so, to 4-epimerases such as WbpP as it is to 4,6-dehydratases (11Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

In Escherichia coli, the most likely role of FBPase is the generation of five-carbon precursors for nucleotide and polysaccharide production (3Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J.

Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).FBPase and fructose-6-phosphate-1-kinase are constitutive enzymes in E. coli, and in the absence of some kind of coordinate regulation, define a futile cycle (5Pilkis S.J.

Types I-III are primarily in Bacteria, Type IV in Archaea, and Type V in thermophilic prokaryotes from both domains. Eukaryotic FBPases are homologous to prokaryotic Type I enzymes.

An important property of mammalian FBPase, synergism in Fru-2,6-P2/AMP inhibition, however, is not understood in terms of a specific molecular mechanism. Moreover, no example is known of a mutant or wild-type mammalian FBPase that lacks synergism without significant disruption of AMP or Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition. Fru-2,6-P2 and AMP individually are potent inhibitors of E. coli FBPase, but exhibit no synergism (15Marcus F. Edelstein I. Rittenhouse J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The sequence identity (41%) of the E. coli and porcine enzymes suggest similar folds. Other studies indicate the existence of an allosteric AMP binding site and a tetrameric subunit organization for the E. coli enzyme (14Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kelly-Loughnane. N. Biolsi Gibson S.A. Lu K.M. Hehir G. Phelan M.J. P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Hence, differences in the conformational responses of E. coli and porcine FBPases to AMP and/or Fru-2,6-P2 could reveal the molecular basis of AMP/Fru-2,6-P2 synergism.Reported here is the high resolution structure of Type I FBPase from E. coli. The structure reveals a homotetramer between the canonical R- and T-states of porcine FBPase (11Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Sulfate anions appear at the interface between top and bottom subunit pairs of the tetramer. Sulfate and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) enhance activity of the E. coli enzyme by at least 300%. Anionic ligands likely mimic a physiological effector that stabilizes E. coli FBPase as an active tetramer, a hypothesis consistent with previous reports of dilution-linked inactivation (4Fraenkel D.G.

Sequence alignments reveal a number of organisms with Type I FBPases that probably possess the anion binding site of the E. coli enzyme. The anion binding site, however, is not present in organisms that employ Fru-2,6-P2 in the regulation of FBPase activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fru-1,6-P2, NADP+, PEP, leupeptin, ampicillin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose came from Sigma and kanamycin sulfate from Invitrogen. VENT DNA-polymerase and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were from Roche Applied Sciences. The Iowa State University DNA Sequencing and Synthesis Facility produced deoxyoligonucleotides and DNA sequences. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent.Cloning E. coli FBPase—The fbp gene that encodes Type I FBPase in E. coli (27Hamilton W.D.O. Harrison D.A. Dyer T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was cloned from genomic DNA isolated from strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) by primer extension using polymerase chain reactions (PCR). Forward (5′-GTATCGACCATATGAAAACGTTAGGTGAATTTATTG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGAATTCTTACGCGTCCGGGAACTCACGG-3′) primers introduced NdeI and EcoRI sites, respectively (sites underlined). The initial round of PCR employed VENT DNA polymerase. The amplified product was the template for a second PCR, using the same primers and the BIO-X-ACT Short DNA polymerase (Midwest Scientific), which leaves a 3′-A overhang. The resulting oligonucleotide was ligated into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and the resulting plasmid used to transform electrocompetent XL1-Blue cells. Transformants were selected by growth on LB-agarose supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, whereas recombinants were selected by blue/white screening. Plasmid DNA was isolated from cultures grown from single colonies. The presence of the insert was verified by digestion with EcoRI and gel electrophoresis.The internal NdeI site within the fbp gene was eliminated by PCR using the mutagenic primer 5′-CTTTGTCGGCAACGACCACATGGTTGAAATGTCGAACGC-3′ and its reverse complement to introduce a silent mutation (base change underlined). Parental methylated DNA was digested with DpnI, and DH5α cells were transformed with the resulting nicked plasmid. Plasmids from single colonies were isolated, digested with NdeI, and separated by gel electrophoresis, using non-mutated plasmid as a control. The desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting construct was amplified by PCR, and then digested with NdeI and EcoRI. Simultaneously the bacterial protein expression vector pET-24b (Novagen), carrying the kanr selectable marker, was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and the cut plasmid isolated by gel electrophoresis. The excised oligonucleotide and vector DNA were purified, ligated, and transformed as previously described, using the cut and uncut vectors as negative and positive controls, respectively. The final plasmid (pECFBP) was verified by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Native and Selenomethionine-substituted E. coli FBPase—Separate preparations of native and selenomethionine-substituted enzyme were used for the kinetic and structural investigations, respectively. FBPase-deficient E. coli strain DF657 (tonA22, ompF627(T2R), relA1, pit10, spoT1, Δ(fbp)287; Genetic Stock Center at Yale University, New Haven, CT) was transformed by the pECFBP plasmid and plated onto LB-agarose supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. A single colony inoculant (100 ml LB-kanamycin) grew (with shaking, 37 °C) for 12 h. Two percent inoculum was added to 4 liters of LB-kanamycin. The culture grew (with shaking, 37 °C), to an A600 of 1.0, at which time transcription was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, final concentration, 0.85 mm). The culture was maintained (with shaking, 37 °C) for an additional 12 h. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was produced as described previously with all growth steps at 37 °C. 3Ginder, N. D., Binkowski, D. J., Fromm, H. J., and Honzatko, R. B. (May 2, 2006) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbcM602109200. Modifications to the protocol of Kelley-Loughnane et al. (16Kelly-Loughnane. N.

All buffers employed after cell lysis were degassed (stirring under vacuum) and contained 0.2 mm EDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Cells were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g) and resuspended in 75 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for disruption by French press. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min, 33,000 × g) prior to ammonium sulfate fractionation. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation from 40–70% levels of saturated (NH4)2SO4, and redissolved in 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, and (NH4)2SO4 (40% of saturation). Protein was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column, washed with the same buffer, and eluted by a step gradient in (NH4)2SO4 (20% followed by 14% of saturation). Combined fractions of highest specific activity were reduced in volume to 30 ml using an Amicon concentrator (YM 30,000 membrane). Protein was passed through a desalting column (Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2), loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column, (equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl, 40 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and then eluted with a linear gradient in NaCl (0.1–0.5 m). Pooled fractions of highest specific activity were desalted (Sephadex G-50 column, equilibrated with 5 mm Tris malonate, pH 7.4). Enzyme (0.75 mg/ml) used for kinetic studies was frozen in this buffer, whereas enzyme used for crystallization experiments was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. Protein was flash-frozen in 200-μl aliquots using a dry-ice ethanol bath and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was monitored by sodium dodecylsulfatepolyacryamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing and mass determinations of purified proteins were performed at the Iowa State University Protein Facility, using an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 6075 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS).Crystallization of E. coli FBPase—Crystals were grown by hanging drop in vapor diffusion VDX-plates (Hampton Research). Droplets contained 2 μl of a protein solution (15 mg/ml of the selenomethioninesubstituted FBPase, 20 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm each of Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, and MgCl2) and 2 μl of a precipitant solution (2.0 m (NH4)2SO4) and were equilibrated over 500 μl of precipitant solution. Equal dimensional crystals (0.2–0.4 mm) grew within 3 days at 22 °C. Crystals were immersed for 20 s in the precipitant solution, supplemented with DTT, ligands, and 27% (v/v) glycerol, before freezing directly in a cold stream of nitrogen.Data Collection—Crystals were screened for diffraction at Iowa State University on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system at a temperature of 110 K. High resolution data were collected at 100 K on Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The program d*trek (31Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar) was used to index, integrate, scale, and merge intensities, which were then converted to structure factors using the CCP4 (32Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D 50, 760–763Google Scholar) program TRUNCATE (33French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517Crossref Scopus (888) Google Scholar).Structure Determination and Refinement—A molecular replacement solution was obtained using the program AMORE (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) and the model for R-state porcine FBPase (PDB accession identifier 1CNQ), from which residues 52–72 and all ligand and water molecules had been removed. Residues for the E. coli enzyme were manually fit to omit density, using the program XTALVIEW (35McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting model using CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) underwent simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K in steps of 25 K, followed by 100 cycles of energy minimization and thermal parameter refinement. Force constants and parameters of stereochemistry were from Engh and Huber (37Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar). Restraints for thermal parameter refinement were as follows: 1.5 Å2 for bonded main-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 for angle main-chain atoms and angle side-chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 for angle side-chain atoms. Ligands and water molecules were fit to omit electron density until no improvement in Rfree was evident. Water molecules with thermal parameters above 50 Å2 or more than 3.2 Å from the nearest hydrogen bonding partner were removed from the final model.Comparison of Porcine and E. coli FBPases—Construction of dimer and tetramer models from the monomer, as well as pair-wise least squares superpositions of E. coli FBPase and porcine liver FBPase were accomplished using the CCP4 programs PDBSET (38Evans, P., (1992) MRC LMB, CambridgeGoogle Scholar) and LSQKAB (39Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). The canonical R- and T-states of porcine FBPase used in superpositions have PDB identifiers 1CNQ and 1EYK, respectively, whereas IT- and IR-states have identifiers 1Q9D and 1YYZ, respectively. The angle of rotation of subunit pairs in various quaternary states of FBPases is sensitive to the subset of residues used in the least-squares fit (40Iancu C.V. Mukund S. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19737-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By convention, Cα atoms of porcine FBPase residues 33–49, 75–265, 272– 330 are used; however, gross structure differences and residue insertions dictate the use of a slightly modified subset in comparisons between porcine and E. coli FBPase. Cα atoms used in all least-squares superpositions are porcine FBPase residues 33–49, 75–106, 112–140, 148–232, 239–265, and 272–330, and the structurally corresponding E. coli FBPase residues 25–41, 67–98, 104–132, 142–226, 234–260, and 267–325. This modified residue set does not significantly alter the angle of rotation represented in the R- to T-state transition of porcine FBPase.Kinetic Experiments—Assays for FBPase activity employed the coupling enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and monitored formation of NADPH by either absorbance at 340 nm or fluorescence emission at 470 nm (40Iancu C.V. Mukund S. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19737-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Assays (total volume, 2 ml) were performed at 22 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 0.1 mm EDTA and 150 μm NADP+. Saturating levels of Fru-1,6-P2 (40 μm) and MgCl2 (10 mm) were used in assays to measure specific activity and ligand activation. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1.4 μg of enzyme (specific activity determinations) or by incubating (1 h) the enzyme in assay mixtures without MgCl2, and subsequently initiating the reaction by the addition of metal. For activation assays, the coupling enzymes were dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to remove ammonium sulfate that would otherwise be present at ∼3mm in all assays.Sequence Alignments—Multiple sequence alignments employed the program ClustalW (41Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). Pair-wise alignments, which served as the basis for calculating sequence identity, employed the program ALIGN (42Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar).RESULTSEnzyme Purity—Native and selenomethionine-substituted preparations of E. coli FBPase represented more than 30% of the soluble protein in the cell lysate. Preparations of E. coli FBPase, isolated by following a multiday protocol, were proteolyzed near the N terminus (confirmed by Edman degradation) and had relatively low specific activities. Kinetic parameters for porcine FBPase are sensitive to truncations near the N terminus (43Nelson S.W. Kurbanov F.T. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in order to avoid any modification of the N-terminal residues of E. coli FBPase, we developed a streamlined protocol that provided enzyme free of proteolysis (confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and by electron density in the crystal structure). The first residue in E. coli FBPase is an unblocked methionine (first residue of the translated DNA sequence). Retention of the N-terminal methionine is consistent with lysine at position two of the sequence; long side-chains at sequence position two generally prevent E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase from excising the N-terminal methionine (44Hirel P.-H. Schmitter J.-M. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Final enzyme preparations are at least 95% pure as evidenced by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and have specific activities of 40 units/mg.E. coli FBPase has six methionine residues per monomer. Mass analyses of native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins indicate a mass increase of 261 ± 30 Da, corresponding to more than a 90% replacement of methionine with selenomethionine. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed a ladder of protein bands indicative of high molecular weight aggregates. Others have observed aggregation of E. coli FBPase (14Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kelly-Loughnane. N. Biolsi Gibson S.A. Lu K.M. Hehir G. Phelan M.J. P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), a condition we sought to avoid in crystallizing the enzyme. The inclusion of 20 mm DTT in protein solutions prevented ladder formation and improved crystal growth.Kinetic Parameters—Native and selenomethionine-substituted enzymes were kinetically indistinguishable: kcat, Km for Fru-1,6-P2 and Ka for Mg2+ are 24 s–1, 1.7 ± 0.1 μm and 1.0 ± 0.1 mm, respectively. The Hill coefficients for both Fru-1,6-P2 and Mg2+ are 1.1 ± 0.1. These values are similar to those reported previously for E. coli FBPase (4Fraenkel D.G. Pontremoli S. Horecker B.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Kelly-Loughnane. N.

Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Structure of E. coli FBPase (PDB identifier 2GQ1)—Type I FBPase from E. coli has the same overall fold and tetrameric subunit organization as other Type I FBPases for which structural information is available (Fig. 1) (11Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 46Weeks C.M. Roszak A.W. Erman M. Kaiser R. Jornvall H. Ghosh D.

Crystals belong to the space group I222 (a = 45.6, b = 81.3, c = 170.1 Å) with one subunit of the tetramer in the asymmetric unit. Data also were collected from a native protein crystal in-house to a resolution of 2.2 Å. The native and selenomethionine-substituted structures exhibited no differences beyond coordinate uncertainty. Hence, we report here only the results of the high resolution, selenomethionine-substituted structure (Table 1).TABLE 1Statistics of data collect"
https://openalex.org/W2008704566,"Oxidation of SCN–, Br–, and Cl– (X–) by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and other plant and fungal peroxidases results in the addition of HOX to the heme vinyl group. This reaction is not observed with lactoperoxidase (LPO), in which the heme is covalently bound to the protein via two ester bonds between carboxylic side chains and heme methyl groups. To test the hypothesis that the heme of LPO and other mammalian peroxidases is protected from vinyl group modification by the hemeprotein covalent bonds, we prepared the F41E mutant of HRP in which the heme is attached to the protein via a covalent bond between Glu41 and the heme 3-methyl. We also examined the E375D mutant of LPO in which only one of the two normal covalent heme links is retained. The prosthetic heme groups of F41E HRP and E375D LPO are essentially not modified by the HOBr produced by these enzymes. The double E375D/D225E mutant of LPO that can form no covalent bonds is inactive and could not be examined. These results unambiguously demonstrate that a single heme-protein link is sufficient to protect the heme from vinyl group modification even in a protein (HRP) that is normally highly susceptible to this reaction. The results directly establish that one function of the covalent heme-protein bonds in mammalian peroxidases is to protect their prosthetic group from their highly reactive metabolic products.

Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 349-385Google Scholar, 2Van Dalen C.J. Kettle A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Furtmüller P.G. Burner U. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17923-17930Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, the antimicrobial and other roles of the mammalian peroxidases depend on their oxidation of halide and/or pseudohalide ions. In contrast, the substrates of most plant and fungal peroxidases are low oxidation potential compounds such as phenols, but the enzymes can also oxidize iodide, thiocyanide, bromide, and, albeit very poorly, chloride ions (4Shah M.M. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 5Munir I.Z. Dordick J.S. Enz. Microbial.

Soc. 2005; 127: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Apart from these differences in their normal substrates, the most notable difference between the mammalian and plant/fungal peroxidases is the presence, in the mammalian enzymes, of two (or in MPO three) covalent bonds between the heme group and active site residues. In LPO, Glu375 and Asp225 form covalent ester bonds with the 1- and 5-methyl groups, respectively, of the heme (7Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2305-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

In MPO, in addition to the two ester bonds common to all the mammalian peroxidases, the 2-vinyl is attached via an unusual vinyl sulfonium link to Met243 (10Kooter I.M. Moguilevsky N.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). No such covalent links have been detected in native plant or fungal peroxidases. We have demonstrated that HRP can oxidize thiocyanide, bromide, and chloride ions and that these reactions result in the addition of HOX (where X = SCN, Br, or Cl) to the prosthetic heme 2- and/or 4-vinyl groups (6Huang L. Wojciechowski G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12Wojciechowski G. Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15871-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These results were recently extended to the Arthromyces ramosus and soybean peroxidases (13Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 446: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), confirming that modification of the heme vinyl groups is a common property in the oxidation of halides and pseudohalides by plant and fungal peroxidases. Reconstitution of apo-HRP with the modified hemes shows that vinyl group modification greatly attenuates the catalytic activity of the enzyme (6Huang L. Wojciechowski G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, the heme group in LPO has been shown to be impervious to modification by the products it forms when it oxidizes thiocyanide, bromide, or chloride (12Wojciechowski G. Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15871-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 446: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This is fortunate, because the physiological roles of the mammalian enzymes require the oxidation of precisely these substrates. Based on these correlative results we have hypothesized that the role of the covalent bonds between the heme 1- and 5-methyl groups and protein carboxyl residues is, in part, to protect the prosthetic group from autocatalytic heme modification during oxidation of the normal halide and pseudohalide substrates of these enzymes and thus to prolong their lifetime despite their production of highly reactive metabolites (12Wojciechowski G. Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15871-15879Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 446: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we report the first direct and unambiguous evidence that the covalent links between the protein and the heme do, in fact, protect the heme from modification by HOX. HRP was engineered to introduce a covalent ester bond between the protein and the 3-methyl of the heme by mutating Phe41 to a glutamic acid and pretreating the enzyme with low amounts of peroxide (14Colas C.

The heme covalent bond is formed in essentially quantitative yield by this procedure. The oxidation of Br– by the HRP F41E mutant with its single covalent heme bond produced HOBr as efficiently as native HRP but in contrast to the reaction of native HRP resulted in little modification of the heme vinyl groups. Moreover, the LPO E375D mutant, in which one of the two covalent heme bonds has been eliminated, not only oxidizes halides normally but remains as impervious to the hypohalide product as the wild-type enzyme. Thus, a single covalent bond between a heme methyl and the protein clearly suffices to protect the heme vinyl groups from reaction with the catalytically generated electrophilic HOX species. This protective effect was postulated earlier from correlative studies, but this is the first direct demonstration of its validity. Materials and General Methods—Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Excell 420™ (JRH Biosciences), and High Five™ cells were grown in Express Five™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine (2.7 g/liter of medium). Both cell lines were kept in suspension at 28 °C and maintained at densities between 0.5 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells/ml. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. HPLC was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 Series II instrument equipped with a photodiode array detector. LC/MS was performed on a Waters Micromass ZQ coupled to a Waters Alliance HPLC system (2695 separations module, Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance Detector) employing an Xterra® MS C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm). HPLC Analysis—Unless otherwise mentioned, HPLC analysis was performed on a Vydac protein C4 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) fitted with a precolumn filter. Solvent A was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient program consisted of linear segments with 15% B (0–3 min), 15–40% B (3–53 min), 95% B (54–57 min), and 15% B (58–60 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluent was monitored at 278 and 400 nm. Expression and Purification of the HRP F41E Mutant—The HRP F41E mutant was expressed and purified following modifications of the previously reported procedure (14Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24131-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Viral stock was generated and amplified from single virus populations. High Five™ cells were infected at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml using a multiplicity of infection of ∼5, and hemin was added (10 mg/liter cells). After 3.5 days, cell suspensions (7 liters) were centrifuged at 4 °C at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was concentrated to ∼200 ml by ultrafiltration over a spiral-wound regenerated cellulose membrane (molecular mass, 10 kDa cut-off; Millipore) connected to an Amicon TCF10 peristaltic pump equipped with a 2l RA2000S reservoir; 1 liter of water was added, and the mixtures was concentrated again to ∼200 ml. The resulting solution, made 0.4 m with solid NaCl and 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 8, was ultracentrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C and 100,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ column (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 8, containing 0.4 m NaCl; the resin was then washed first with 10 volumes of buffer and then with 5 volumes of the same buffer containing imidazole (5 mm). Elution was achieved by increasing the imidazole concentration to 200 mm. The colored fractions were pooled and dialyzed against KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer (20 mm, pH 8) for at least 14 h with at least three bath changes. The dialyzed fractions were then concentrated 12-fold by ultrafiltration over an Amicon YM10 membrane and passed through a pre-equilibrated QFF-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. The colored fractions were concentrated again over an Amicon Ultra-4™ centrifugal filter device (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa) to 1–2 ml. The protein was tested by the ABTS assay (6Huang L. Wojciechowski G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for peroxidase activity and by SDS-PAGE analysis for purity. Oxidation of Br– by the HRP F41E Mutant—The HRP F41E mutant (0.5 mm, 50 μl) in 400 μl of bis-tris propane buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.2) was treated with H2O2 (2 equivalents × 6) at 5-min intervals and was incubated for a further 10 min after the last H2O2 addition. A 50-μl aliquot was injected onto the HPLC for analysis. Most of the heme (>90%) co-eluted with the protein. The medium was then changed to citrate buffer (0.5 m, pH 5.0) with a Millipore ultrafree centrifugal filter device (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa; final volume, 300 μl; A407 = 0.713 after 4-fold dilution; yield, ∼23%). An aliquot of the final HRP F41E solution (100 μl, 17 μm) was incubated with KBr (60 μl, 2 m) and H2O2 (40 μl, 1.26 mm, 30 equivalents) for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged and exchanged into bis-tris propane buffer (100 mm, pH 8.2), giving a final volume of 150 μl with a Soret band absorption at λmax = 409 nm. EDTA (100 mm, 3 μl) was then added followed, after 15 min, by trypsin (1 mg/ml, 5 μl). The resulting solution was incubated at ∼20 °C overnight. On the second day, protease K (10 mg/ml, 10 μl) was added, the resulting solution was incubated at ∼ 20 °C overnight, and the digested solution was analyzed by LC/MS. The LC conditions were as follows where one solvent (A) is water plus 0.1% formic acid, and the other solvent (C) is methanol containing 0.1% formic acid: solvent C was maintained at 40% for 2 min, followed by a linear gradient from 40 to 70% over the following 20 min. The MS settings were: mode, ES+; capillary voltage, 3.5 kV; cone voltage, 25 V; desolvation temperature, 300 °C; and source temperature, 120 °C. A control experiment was performed with HRP as follows. HRP (100 μl, 40 μm) in citrate buffer (0.5 m, pH 4.4) was mixed with KBr (60 μl, 2 m) and H2O2 (40 μl, 3 mm, 30 equivalents). After 30 min of incubation, the solution was exchanged into bis-tris propane buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.2) at a final volume of 150 μl. The Soret absorption band of the protein at this point was at λmax = 395 nm. The solution was digested with trypsin and protease K and was analyzed by LC/MS following the procedure described above. Expression and Purification of the LPO Mutants—The LPO E375D mutant and D225E/E375D double mutant were expressed and purified according to the previously reported procedure (8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Viral stock was generated and amplified from single virus populations. High Five™ cells were infected at a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml using a multiplicity of infection of ∼4, and hemin was added (10 mg/liter of cells). After 3 days, cell suspensions were centrifuged at 4 °C at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of deionized water, followed by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (as a protease inhibitor) at a final concentration of 200 mg/liter. To this solution Amberlite CG50 cation exchange resin (pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) was added in three portions over 2 h (∼20 ml of settled resin/liter of supernatant). After decantation, the slurry was packed into a column, and the column was subsequently washed with ∼5 volumes of 50 mm Tris·HCl and ∼3 volumes of 150 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4. The protein was then eluted with 500 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.4. The fractions with absorbance at 412 nm were pooled, concentrated to ∼2 ml, and diluted 10-fold with deionized water. The resulting solution was loaded onto a CL-6B cation exchange column (2–3 ml of resin/liter of culture) and was subjected to gradient elution on fast protein liquid chromatography. The fast protein liquid chromatography conditions were as follows, where solvent A was 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, and solvent B was 50 mm Tris·HCl at the same pH containing 0.3 m NaCl. After washing with 5 volumes of solvent A, the gradient rose from 0 to 100% solvent B in 8 column volumes. Fractions with absorbance at both 280 and 412 nm were combined, concentrated, and exchanged into phosphate buffer. The final product was tested with the ABTS assay for peroxidase activity and by SDS-PAGE for purity. Oxidation of Br– by the LPO E375D Mutant—The LPO E375D mutant (100 μl, 29 μm, Soret band λmax = 412 nm, RZ = 0.73) was incubated with four aliquots of 10 μl of H2O2 (0.29 mm, 1 equivalent) at 3-min intervals in bis-tris propane buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.2), followed by exchange of the sample into citrate buffer (0.5 m, pH 4.4) with a Millipore ultrafree centrifugal filter device (molecular mass cut-off, 10 kDa). The final volume was 100 μl of ∼18 μm protein (based on heme absorption). To this were added KBr (60 μl, 2 m) and H2O2 (40 μl, 1.81 mm, 40 equivalents), and the solution was incubated for 20 min before it was exchanged into bis-tris propane buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.2). The final volume was 110 μl of a solution with a Soret absorption band at λmax = 410 nm. CaCl2 (10 mm, 10 μl) was then added to this solution, followed after a few minutes by trypsin (1 mg/ml, 10 μl). The resulting solution was incubated at ∼20 °C overnight. On the second day, CaCl2 (10 mm, 20 μl) was again added followed after a few minutes by protease K (10 mg/ml, 10 μl). The resulting solution was incubated at ∼20 °C overnight. In a control experiment, the E375D mutant prior to incubation with KBr was also digested with trypsin/protease K. The digests were analyzed by LC/MS using the conditions already described above. Preparation of the HRP F41E Mutant with a Heme-Protein Cross-link—As previously reported, the F41E mutant of HRP can be expressed in a baculovirus insect cell system as a protein with a noncovalently bound heme, but exposure of this protein to several equivalents of H2O2 results in autocatalytic cross-linking of the heme 3-methyl group to Glu41 via an ester link essentially identical to those found in the mammalian peroxidases (14Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24131-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The F41E HRP mutant was therefore expressed and purified as previously reported. The resulting protein in bis-tris propane (0.1 m, pH 8.2) was incubated with H2O2 (2 equivalents × 6) over a period of 35 min, after which HPLC analysis indicated that the heme was quantitatively covalently bound. The Soret band of the heme shifted from 406 to 409 nm as a result of formation of the covalent heme bond. The activities of native HRP, the F41E mutant without H2O2 pretreatment, and the final F41E mutant after exposure to H2O2 were determined and are shown in Table 1. Compared with the native enzyme, the F41E is ∼5-fold better at oxidizing Br– before preincubation with H2O2 but has roughly the same activity as the native enzyme after H2O2 pretreatment. The peroxidase activity of all three proteins is roughly comparable in the ABTS peroxidase assay, although native HRP is somewhat more active in this assay. The F41E mutant is therefore fully active both in the oxidation of Br– and as a peroxidase, both before and after pretreatment with peroxide to form the heme-protein covalent bond.TABLE 1Activity of the F41E HRP mutantHRPF41EBefore H2O2 treatmentAfter H2O2 treatmentMCD assay52 ± 13285 ± 3268 ± 16ABTS assay(2.5 ± 0.5 × 104(1.8 ± 0.1) × 103(3.6 ± 0.7) × 103 Open table in a new tab Oxidation of Br– by H2O2-pretreated HRP F41E—HRP F41E, after pretreatment with H2O2 to promote heme-protein covalent binding, was incubated with 0.6 m Br– and 30 equivalents of H2O2 in citrate buffer (0.5 m, pH 4.4) for a period of 30 min. The reaction solution was exchanged to bis-tris propane buffer (100 mm, pH 8.2), and the protein was digested first with trypsin and subsequently with protease K. LC/MS analysis of the digested sample showed a major peak that was identified as the 3-hydroxymethyl heme 31-, 3-, or 5-hydroxymethyl heme indicates that derivative of iron protoporphyrin IX with a hydroxyl on the indicated methyl group. derivative (1) by its retention time (t = 17.85 min) and mass spectrometric molecular ion (m/z 632) (Fig. 1 and Scheme 1). This monohydroxylated heme is the product expected from hydrolysis of the ester bond between the 3-methyl and Glu41 and is the same as is obtained if the incubation with Br– is omitted. In addition to the major heme-derived product, several very minor heme-like peaks were detected, including a residual unmodified heme (2, t = 24.53 min) and two possible products of further modification: 3 (t = 20.42 min) and 4 (t = 10.64 min).SCHEME 1Structures of the various products formed from the prosthetic heme groups in incubations of native HRP, the F41E HRP mutant, native LPO, and the mutant of LPO on reaction with Br– and H2O2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Compound 3, with a molecular ion at m/z 710 and a 1:1 710:712 isotopic peak ratio, corresponds to the addition of one bromine atom. Based on our previous work with native HRP (6Huang L. Wojciechowski G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 5345-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this compound is identified as the 4-bromovinyl derivative of 3-hydroxymethyl heme. Compound 4 has a mass spectrometric molecular ion at m/z 666 and thus is obtained by the addition of two hydroxyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group on the 3-methyl. In our earlier work with native HRP, the major products include the bromohydrin derivatives formed by addition of the equivalents of HOBr across either the 2- or 4-vinyl group of the heme (15Van Tamelen E.E. Storni A. Hessler E.J. Schwartz M. J. Am. Chem Soc. 1963; 85: 3295-3296Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Bromohydrins readily eliminate bromide to give epoxides under basic conditions, and epoxides are readily hydrolyzed to diols by water addition, reactions that are to be expected given the prolonged digestion conditions (2 days at pH 8.2). Here we performed control experiments in which native HRP was incubated with Br–/H2O2 and then subjected to the same proteolytic conditions. In addition to the 2-(1′-hydroxyl, 2′-bromo)ethyl, 4-(2′-bromo)vinyl heme (product 5), which was reported previously, another product (6, m/e = 728:730, isotope ratio 1:1) was obtained. We further observed that the amount of product 6 increased concomitantly with a decrease in product 5 upon digestion at pH 8.2 for an additional day, indicating that product 6 was derived from 5. This observation in conjunction with the mass spectrum of product 6 identified it as 2-(1′, 2′-dihydroxyl)ethyl, 4-(2′-bromo)vinyl heme. Therefore, in the incubations with the F41E mutant, product 4 was identified as the 1,2-dihydroxyethyl derivative of either the 2- or 4-vinyl group, a product analogous to product 6 obtained from native HRP. Quantitative comparison of the extent of formation of vinyl group-modified products 3 and 4 in incubations of F41E HRP with Br–/H2O2 with the vinyl-modified products obtained in incubations of native HRP under the same conditions shows that a dramatic decrease in vinyl modified products is associated with introduction of the heme-protein bond in the F41E mutant (Fig. 1 and Table 2). In the F41E HRP mutant, only ∼10% of total heme signals correspond to vinyl-modified products (4% for 3, 4% for 4). The major peak is due to 3-hydroxylmethyl heme (81%), the “unmodified” prosthetic group. In contrast, 100% of heme in native HRP was modified under the same conditions, and the two major vinyl-modified hemes accounted for ∼80% of the total heme products.TABLE 2Comparison of the vinyl modified products from the F41E HRP mutant and native HRPModified hemesUnmodified hemesF41E HRP3 (4%), 4 (4%)1 (81%), 2 (8%),HRP5 (49%), 6 (30%), 7 (4%)not detectable Open table in a new tab Preparation of the Mature E375D Mutant of LPO—Mature LPO has two covalent bonds, the first between Asp225 and the 5-methyl and the second between Glu375 and the 1-methyl (8Colas C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that mutation of Glu375 to an Asp prevents formation of the covalent bond to that residue, although the 1-methyl is still oxidized to some extent to the 1-hydroxymethyl derivative (8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether the heme of LPO would be more susceptible to modification by HOBr if it were only attached to the protein through one covalent bond, we expressed and purified this enzyme as previously reported (8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As previously reported, we also preincubated this enzyme with H2O2 (1 equivalent × 4) to ensure complete autocatalytic formation of the covalent bond between Asp225 and the 5-methyl (8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activity assays established that the recombinant E375D LPO mutant had similar bromide oxidation and peroxidatic activities as the native enzyme before and after pretreatment with H2O2 (Table 3).TABLE 3Activity of E375D LPO mutantLPOE375DBefore H2O2 treatmentAfter H2O2 treatmentMCD assay(5.8 ± 1.2) × 103(6.4 ± 0.6) × 102ABTS assay(4.5 ± 1.6) × 103(2.6 ± 0.8) × 1032.2 × 103 Open table in a new tab Oxidation of Br– by the E375D LPO Mutant—The mature (covalently cross-linked) E375D mutant was incubated with Br– in the presence of 40 equivalents of H2O2 for 20 min. The reaction solution was changed to bis-tris propane buffer (100 mm, pH 8.2) before the protein was digested as previously described, and the lysate was analyzed by LC/MS (Fig. 2). The two major heme-derived peaks at t = 17.00 and 10.19 min exhibited molecular ions at m/z 632 and 648, respectively, and were identified as 5-hydroxymethyl heme (8) and 1,5-di(hydroxymethyl) heme (9) by their molecular masses and retention times. These same species were observed in control experiments in which the mature LPO E375D mutant was digested without first reacting it with Br– and H2O2. 5-Hydroxymethyl heme is the iron porphyrin expected hydrolytically from LPO E375D, which can still form the covalent bond between Asp225 and the 5-methyl. 1,5-(Dihydroxymethyl)heme arises from oxidation of the 1-methyl in the mutated protein in addition to hydrolysis of the bond to the 5-methyl. Most importantly, no bromo-heme adducts were detected in the lysates. Expression of the D225E/E375D LPO Double Mutant—We have demonstrated above that introduction of one covalent bond into HRP protects the heme from modification by autocatalytically generated HOBr and have shown that an LPO with only one such bond is also fully protected. To complete the test set, we expressed the D225E/E375D double mutant of LPO, in which formation of both covalent bonds to the heme is disrupted (8Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, we have confirmed that this double mutant binds heme poorly and has no measurable peroxidase activity. It has therefore not been possible to test whether the heme of LPO with no covalent heme bonds is susceptible to modification by catalytically generated HOBr. It is well established that the prosthetic heme group in mammalian peroxidases is covalently bound to protein, but the functional role of the covalent linkage remains unclear. We have reported that both plant/fungal and mammalian peroxidases oxidize bromide, and the resulting hypobromous acid modifies the prosthetic heme in plant and fungal peroxidases but not in mammalian peroxidases (13Huang L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 446: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We proposed a hypothesis that the heme of LPO and other mammalian peroxidases is protected from vinyl group modification by the heme-protein covalent bonds. In this study we provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis. This laboratory previously reported that the HRP F41E mutant was able to form a heme-protein covalent link between the 3-methyl of the heme and Glu41 of the protein (14Colas C. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24131-24140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Here we expressed the same mutant and pretreated it with H2O2 to form the covalent heme-protein link. The enzymatic activity of the final protein in the oxidation of Br– is roughly the same as that of native HRP. However, the Br– oxidizing activity of the F41E mutant is 5-fold higher before the covalent link is formed (Table 1). The basis for the enhanced bromide oxidation activity of the noncovalently linked F41E mutant is unclear but may reflect a change in the electrostatic properties of the active site caused by the negative charge of the unmasked carboxylic acid group. In any case, the prosthetic heme group of the cross-linked F41E mutant remains almost intact in the presence of Br– and up to 30 equivalents of H2O2. In contrast, the heme of native HRP is completely modified under identical conditions. Indeed, complete modification of the heme of native HRP is observed under even milder conditions (10–20 equivalents H2O2, 0.4 m Br–). When the H2O2 concentration is >50 times the concentration of the enzyme, the heme and heme-like signals are greatly diminished in the LC/MS analysis. This is due to both the bleaching effect of H2O2 and the degradation of the bromovinyl groups under the digestion (2 days, pH 8.2), as we observed secondary transformations of the bromohydrin heme derivatives during the digestion process. In the control experiment with native HRP, one of the two major products (6) was not detected before the digestion but rather derived from 5 as a result of incubation under the digestion conditions. The conversion of 5 to 6 involves substitution of the Br in the bromohydrin by an OH group, possibly via intermediate formation of an epoxide. The corresponding product (4) was identified in the reaction of the F41E mutant. Overall, the majority of the heme in the F41E mutant remained intact, whereas the heme of HRP was completely modified during Br– oxidation. This result clearly demonstrates that the heme-protein covalent bond protects the prosthetic heme from modification and thus protects the enzyme from inactivation. A similar result was obtained with the LPO E375D mutant in which only the covalent bond between the 5-methyl of the heme and Asp225 is retained. We detected 5-hydroxymethyl heme (8) from this mutant after the heme was released by trypsin/protease K digestion. Most importantly, even after reaction with Br– and H2O2, LC/MS analysis showed that the heme species that are present were the same as those obtained by direct digestion of the protein. One covalent bond thus suffices to protect the heme from modification by HOBr, in agreement with the results from the HRP F41E mutant. Efforts to prepare D225E/E375D double mutant and to test whether LPO without any covalent bond to its heme would become susceptible to modification by HOBr were unsuccessful because, as previously found, this double mutant is essentially inactive. It is somewhat surprising that the single ester bond in the F41E HRP mutant protects not one but both heme vinyl groups from reaction with electrophilic agents. Analysis of a model based on the crystal structure of HRP in which Glu41 and the heme 3-methyl are simply linked together suggests that the resulting ester bond can sterically shield the 4-vinyl, but simultaneous steric protection of the 2-vinyl does not appear likely without an active site conformational change. A shift in the positions of the active site residues is almost certain, because the ester bond in the model is only awkwardly formed if the protein residues and the heme are held in their crystallographic positions. LPO and the other mammalian peroxidases normally have two ester bonds, each of which could sterically protect one of the vinyl groups. However, even if one of these bonds is lost, as in the D225E mutant, both vinyls are still protected. One factor that may contribute to protection of the vinyl groups by the heme-protein links, both in the F41E HRP mutant and the mammalian peroxidases, is the rigidification of the active site associated with covalent attachment of the heme to the protein. Anchoring of the heme to the protein is expected to dampen the natural dynamic breathing motions of the active site and could facilitate protection of the vinyl groups by the active site residues. We have recently proposed that rigidification of the active site by the heme-protein cross-link in CYP4 cytochrome P-450 enzymes is responsible, at least in part, for their unique ability to catalyze ω-hydroxylation of fatty acid chains (16He X. Cryle M.J. De Voss J.J. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22697-22705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The covalent heme links in the mammalian peroxidases are likely to have roles in addition to protection of the heme. LPO and even more so MPO have much higher activities in the oxidation of halides than HRP. It is very possible that the hemeprotein cross-links help to adjust the reactivity of the ferryl species for halide oxidation, although no specific evidence for this is provided by the present studies. In summary, this study provides direct support for the hypothesis that covalent linkages between the prosthetic heme and the protein in mammalian peroxidases serve to protect the heme from modification by the reactive HOX species generated during the catalytic process. This is based on two key findings. First, the HRP F41E mutant, which forms one covalent bond between the heme and the protein, is resistant to modification by autocatalytically generated HOBr. In contrast, HOBr modified the heme of native HRP in which no heme-protein covalent bond exists. Second, the LPO E375D mutant, which only retained one of the two normal heme-protein covalent bonds, remained completely resistant to heme modification by autocatalytically generated HOBr. We thank Christophe Colas for providing an initial sample of the F41E HRP mutant and for advice."
https://openalex.org/W2030452124,"Abstract N-Acetylglucosamine-phosphate mutase (AGM1) is an essential enzyme in the synthetic process of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). UDP-GlcNAc is a UDP sugar that serves as a biosynthetic precursor of glycoproteins, mucopolysaccharides, and the cell wall of bacteria. Thus, a specific inhibitor of AGM1 from pathogenetic fungi could be a new candidate for an antifungal reagent that inhibits cell wall synthesis. AGM1 catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P) into N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P). This enzyme is a member of the α-d-phosphohexomutase superfamily, which catalyzes the intramolecular phosphoryl transfer of sugar substrates. Here we report the crystal structures of AGM1 from Candida albicans for the first time, both in the apoform and in the complex forms with the substrate and the product, and discuss its catalytic mechanism. The structure of AGM1 consists of four domains, of which three domains have essentially the same fold. The overall structure is similar to those of phosphohexomutases; however, there are two additional β-strands in domain 4, and a circular permutation occurs in domain 1. The catalytic cleft is formed by four loops from each domain. The N-acetyl group of the substrate is recognized by Val-370 and Asn-389 in domain 3, from which the substrate specificity arises. By comparing the substrate and product complexes, it is suggested that the substrate rotates about 180° on the axis linking C-4 and the midpoint of the C-5—O-5 bond in the reaction."

Here we show that treatment of p53-null cancer cells with sublethal concentrations of ROS triggered an arrest with some morphological similarities to cellular senescence. Different from a classical senescent arrest in G1, the ROS-induced arrest was predominantly in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, and its establishment depended at least in part on an intact Chk1-dependent checkpoint. Chk1 remained phosphorylated only during the repair of double strand DNA breaks, after which Chk1 was inactivated, the G2 arrest was suppressed, and some cells recovered their ability to proliferate. Inhibition of Chk1 by an RNAi approach resulted in an increase in cell death in p53-null cells, showing that the Chk1-dependent G2 checkpoint protected cells that lacked a functional p53 pathway from oxidative stress. It has been proposed that the induction of a senescent-like phenotype by antineoplastic agents can contribute therapeutic efficacy. Our results indicate that oxidative stress-induced growth arrest of p53-null tumor cells cannot be equated with effective therapy owing to its reversibility and supports the concept that targeting Chk1 may enhance the effects of DNA-damaging agents on cancer progression in such tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2072424337,"The ability to induce cell cycle progression while evading cell death is a defining characteristic of cancer. Deregulation of E2F is a common event in most human cancers. Paradoxically, this can lead to both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Although the way in which E2F causes cell cycle progression is well characterized, the pathways by which E2F induces cell death are less well defined. Many of the known mechanisms through which E2F induces apoptosis occur through regulation of E2F target genes. However, mutants of E2F-1 that lack the transactivation domain are still able to induce cell death. To further investigate this activity, we refined a transactivation independent mutant to identify a minimal apoptotic domain. This revealed that only 75 amino acids from within the DNA-binding domain of E2F-1 is sufficient for cell death and that this activity is also present in the DNA-binding domains of E2F-2 and E2F-3. However, analysis of this domain from E2F-1 revealed it does not bind DNA and is consequently unable to transactivate, repress or de-repress E2F target genes. This provocative observation therefore defines a potential new mechanism of death from E2F and opens up new opportunities for inducing cell death in tumours for therapeutic gain."
https://openalex.org/W2053580524,"OmpT and OmpU are general diffusion porins of the human intestinal pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The sole presence of OmpT in the outer membrane sensitizes cells to the bile component deoxycholic acid, and the repression of OmpT in the intestine may play an important role in the adaptation of cells to the host environment. Here we report a novel important functional difference between the two porins, namely the sensitivity to deoxycholic acid. Single channel recordings show that submicellar concentrations of sodium deoxycholate induce time-resolved blocking events of OmpT but are devoid of any effect on OmpU. The effects are dose-, voltage-, and pH-dependent. They are elicited by deoxycholate applied to either side of the membrane, with some asymmetry in the sensitivity. The voltage dependence remains even when deoxycholate is applied symmetrically, indicating that it is intrinsic to the binding site. The pH dependence suggests that the active form is the neutral deoxycholic acid and not the negatively charged species. The results are interpreted as deoxycholic acid acting as an open-channel blocker, which may relate to deoxycholic acid permeation.

After ingestion of contaminated water by the human host, the bacteria will encounter various micro-environments before colonizing the gut and producing an infection (1.Krukonis E.S. DiRita V.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2.Lee S.H. Hava D.L. Waldor M.K. Camilli A. Cell. 1999; 99: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important aspects of the physiology and pathogenesis of the bacterial cell rely on detection of and response to the extracellular environment (3.Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The flow of hydrophilic solutes through the outer membrane of this Gram-negative bacterium is largely controlled by the general diffusion porins OmpU and OmpT. The pore-forming ability of these proteins has been demonstrated by liposome swelling assays (4.Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), antibiotic flux assays in live cells (5.Wibbenmeyer J.A. Provenzano D. Landry C.F. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and electrophysiology (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that the two porins are functionally distinct on the basis of their electrophysiological properties (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As other general diffusion porins, OmpU and OmpT exist as trimers of monomeric high conductance channels that remain in the open state for >90% of the time. They do exhibit a spontaneous gating activity, evidenced by the random transitions of the monomeric channels between ion conducting (open) and non-conducting (closed) states. The frequency of these random transitions is fairly low for OmpU (every ∼4 s, comparable with that of the Escherichia coli porin OmpF) but much higher for OmpT (every ∼0.3 s), indicating that OmpT may be a much more dynamic pore. General diffusion porins are characterized by their tendency to inactivate at high transmembrane voltage, a phenomenon whose functional relevance and molecular mechanism remain elusive. OmpT was found to be more voltage-sensitive than OmpU and inactivates at a threshold voltage of ∼90 mV, a voltage that is about half the voltage required to inactivate OmpU and that might be in the range attainable by Donnan potentials in physiological conditions. Finally, OmpT was shown to be relatively non-selective with a ratio of permeability for potassium to chloride (PK/PCl) of ∼4 (similar to E. coli OmpF), while OmpU is a much more cation-selective channel (PK/PCl ∼14). The conductance of the monomers is similar for the two porins (∼350 picosiemens for OmpT and ∼300 picosiemens for OmpU in 150 mm KCl), but OmpU has a tendency to display transitions to various states of lower conductance (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). OmpU allows the passage of larger sugars than OmpT does (4.Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) but, however, displays a smaller rate of β-lactam antibiotic flux (5.Wibbenmeyer J.A. Provenzano D. Landry C.F. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Since the three-dimensional structure of OmpU and OmpT is unknown, and as the transport rate of a pore depends on both size and the thermodynamics of the interactions between permeating solutes and the channel wall, it remains difficult at this point to assess whether the pore of OmpU has larger dimensions than that of OmpT or vice versa. The two porins also appear to confer different physiological properties to bacterial cells. In particular, the sensitivity of cells to bile and bile components is an important factor for this intestinal pathogen. One of the major components of bile is deoxycholic acid, a cholesterol derivative with detergent-like properties. Previous work has shown that mutant V. cholerae cells that express exclusively OmpT (and no OmpU) grow more poorly in presence of deoxycholate than cells that express exclusively OmpU (7.Provenzano D. Lauriano C.M. Klose K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3652-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This phenotype is similar to the behavior of E. coli bile acid-sensitive ompC mutants versus E. coli cells that express only OmpC (8.Thanassi D.G. Cheng L.W. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been attributed to the fact that some porins (V. cholerae OmpT and E. coli OmpF) allow a better permeation of deoxycholate than others (V. cholerae OmpU and E. coli OmpC). The outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically more resilient than phospholipid bilayers to the action of detergents, such as bile acids, due to the presence of lipopolysaccharides in the outer leaflet (9.Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). Permeation of bile acids does occur though, as several promoters are regulated by these bile components (10.Gupta S. Chowdhury R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1131-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Provenzano D. Schuhmacher D.A. Barker J.L. Klose K.E. Infect.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Bina J.E. Mekalanos J.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although general diffusion porins are poorly permeable to hydrophobic compounds (9.Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar), it is anticipated that amphipaths such as deoxycholate have a finite flux rate through these pores. Once in the periplasm, detergents molecules can partition in the cytoplasmic membrane, thus compromising cellular integrity and growth. It is important to note, however, that many studies have used submicellar concentrations of sodium deoxycholate or other bile salts and have shown a variety of effects, from pump-mediated efflux to biofilm formation (8.Thanassi D.G. Cheng L.W. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2512-2518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Rosenberg E.Y. Bertenthal D. Nilles M.L. Bertrand K.P. Nikaido H. Mol.

Sturtevant D. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 193-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the ompU and ompT genes is under the control of the transcriptional regulator ToxR, a membrane bound environmental sensor that plays a major role in regulating expression of virulence factors, such as cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus (16.Klose K.E. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ToxR was shown to be an activator of ompU expression and a repressor of ompT expression (17.Crawford J.A. Kaper J.B. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18.Li C.C. Crawford J.A. DiRita V.J. Kaper J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The activity of ToxR is itself modulated by a variety of external factors, such as pH, bile salts, osmolarity, and temperature (3.Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 10.Gupta S. Chowdhury R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1131-1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Hung D.T. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Once inside the host, activation of ToxR would turn on ompU expression and turn off ompT expression. Presumably this switch in porin expression has an important role in the adaptive success of the cells in the host environment. Interestingly, Klose and collaborators (19.Provenzano D. Klose K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10220-10224Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have also shown that engineered cells that express solely ompT from a ToxR-activated ompU promoter have attenuated virulence properties, as they become defective in colonization and virulence factor production. Although these porins are not required for virulence (7.Provenzano D. Lauriano C.M. Klose K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3652-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it appears that the type of porin present in the outer membrane may have an impact on the ability of V. cholerae cells to cause disease. To continue our characterization of functional differences between OmpU and OmpT that may have important physiological consequences, we have investigated the effect of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate (DC) 2The abbreviations used are: DC, sodium deoxycholate; octyl-POE, N-octyloligo-oxyethylene; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid., 3In solution, deoxycholate exists as a mixture of ionized and protonated deoxycholate. on the channel properties of OmpU and OmpT. Our results demonstrate that OmpT is reversibly blocked by protonated deoxycholate, presumably as it transits through the pore, while OmpU is impervious to the presence of DC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of block of a pore-forming protein by deoxycholic acid. Chemicals, Media, and Buffer Composition—The OmpU and OmpT porin samples were prepared from the porin-deficient V. cholerae strain KKV884 (7.Provenzano D. Lauriano C.M. Klose K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3652-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) expressing the ompU or ompT gene cloned into a pBAD30 plasmid. Cells were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 0.5% yeast extract) with appropriate antibiotics (0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) and l-arabinose (0.01% for ompT expression, 0.05% for ompU expression). Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco Laboratories. N-Octyl-oligo-oxyethylene (octyl-POE) was purchased from Axxora. Other chemicals were from Sigma. For electrophysiology, the following buffers were used: buffer A (150 mm KCl, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)), buffer B (= buffer A + 20 mm MgCl2), buffer K(= buffer A where HEPES is substituted by 5 mm MES and the pH is 5.2), buffer L (600 mm KCl, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)), and buffer M (= buffer A where HEPES is substituted by 5 mm CHES, and the pH is 9.2). A 25 mm stock solution of sodium deoxycholate was made in the appropriate buffer in a plastic tube. The solution was diluted to the desired concentration and immediately perfused into the patch clamp chamber. The solutions were stable for at least 1 h, while each individual experiment with fresh DC sample lasted for 10–15 min. Protein Purification—Purification of OmpU and OmpT protein was essentially done as described (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein extraction with the detergent octyl-POE was done at 4 °C. A first column chromatography was done on an anion exchange column (Mono Q HR10/10, Amersham Biosciences), and the protein eluted between 130 and 210 mm NaCl (in 1% octyl-POE, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6)). Subsequently, OmpT- or OmpU-containing fractions were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 26/20 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) in 1% octyl-POE, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). Proteins were identified by Western blot. Protein visualization and purity were assessed by silver staining after SDS-PAGE. Pure protein was kept at –80 °C in 1% octyl-POE, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), and 50 mm NaCl, prior to use in electrophysiology. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic assays (Pierce). Reconstitution into Liposomes and Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Pure protein was reconstituted into soybean phospholipids (Azolectin, from Sigma) at protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:3,000 to 1:5,000 (w/w), and patch clamp experiments were performed on unilamellar blisters emerging from liposomes when placed in buffer B, as described (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20.Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes of ∼10 megaohm resistance were filled with buffer A or buffer A + DC and brought into contact with the blister membrane to generate seals of 0.5–1.0 gigaohm. All experiments were conducted on excised patches produced by brief air exposure. After excision, the bath solution was exchanged for buffer A or other buffers, as dictated by the experiment. An Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instrument) was used to monitor currents under voltage clamp conditions. The current was filtered at 1 KHz, digitized at 1.25-ms sampling intervals (ITC-18, Instrutech), and stored on a PC computer using the Acquire software (Bruxton). Data Analysis—Analysis of patch clamp traces was done with a program specifically developed in the laboratory and written by Arnaud Baslé using Microsoft Visual Studio C. Amplitude histograms were constructed by scanning current records and counting the number of sample points at each current value. The open probability (Po) was calculated as the ratio of the observed integrated current obtained over a 1-min-long recording to the total current expected for the same duration if the current value remained at the fully open level. The dose-response curve was fitted to the Hill equation below using SigmaPlot (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm), Po(DC)/Po(CON)=1/{1+([DC]/IC50) n} (Eq. 1) where Po(DC) and Po(CON) are the open probabilities in presence and absence of DC, respectively, IC50 is the inhibitory concentration at which Po is reduced by 50% relative to control, and n is the Hill coefficient. Based on the fact that cells expressing solely OmpU or OmpT have different sensitivities to DC in growth and that antibiotic flux through OmpU or OmpT are differently affected by crude bile, we hypothesized that DC might show differential effects on the pore properties of OmpU and OmpT. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the electrophysiological behavior of purified OmpU or OmpT pores in the absence or the presence of DC with the use of the patch clamp technique. Fig. 1 shows traces of the activity of a single trimer of OmpT in symmetric buffer A (see “Experimental Procedures” for composition) before and after applying 0.008% DC to the bath of the same patch. In all experiments, the voltages indicated on the figures represent pipette voltage. Traces A and B of Fig. 1 demonstrate that DC has a profound effect on the channel behavior when the pipette voltage is positive. In the absence of DC, the current trace dwells at a baseline level that corresponds to the total current flowing through three monomers (level marked “3o”). Frequent transitions to the level marked “2o” correspond to spontaneous random closures of a single monomer. The amplitude histograms shown to the right of the traces illustrate the distribution of current values between these two levels. In the absence of DC, most current values distribute as a peak of the largest conductance. The short trace right below trace A shows the details of a small segment of trace A marked by a horizontal bar. In the presence of 0.008% DC (trace B), the current steps to all possible current levels for this trimer, including a fully closed level. The corresponding amplitude histogram shows the almost even distribution of current values among these four levels. The expanded trace below trace B shows the clean square pulse pattern of closures and openings that suggests that each monomer is fully and reversibly blocked by DC. Indeed, the conductance of OmpT was measured by voltage-current plots and was found to be unaffected by DC (data not shown). This kinetic pattern is similar to the transient block of OmpF observed in the presence of ampicillin (21.Nestorovich E.M. Danelon C. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9789-9794Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or of LamB observed in the presence of maltodextrins (22.Schwarz G. Danelon C. Winterhalter M. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2990-2998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23.Kullman L. Winterhalter M. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 803-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as these solutes translocate through the channels. As for these solutes and their respective channels, the effect of DC on OmpT was found to be voltage-dependent and much less pronounced at negative pipette potentials. The effect was reversible upon application of buffer without DC. In contrast, OmpU was completely insensitive to DC in this concentration range (Fig. 2). As was done for Fig. 1, a patch containing a single trimer of OmpU was sequentially studied in the absence and the presence of 0.008% DC, and the traces obtained at + and –50 mV pipette voltages are represented. The kinetic pattern of the channel was unchanged in the presence of DC, and no other effect was detected. This is not due to the artifactual lack of access of DC to the patch, as the subsequent perfusion of 0.1 mm spermine in the same patch was fully effective at inhibiting OmpU, in a manner similar to the inhibition of OmpF by this polyamine (24.Iyer R. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18595-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This insensitivity of OmpU-containing patches to DC also serves as a control for unspecific effects that this amphipathic molecule might have on pores and membranes. We have found that patches were stable for at least 1 h at concentrations less than 0.01% (∼250 μm). Higher concentrations lead to membrane breakdown. These low concentrations are well below the critical micellar concentration for DC at room temperature (2–6 mm (25.Matsuoka K. Moroi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1580: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) and do not introduce noise or other artifacts into the electrophysiological traces. To quantify the effect of DC on OmpT, we have measured the Po of a single full trimer at various voltages and various concentrations. Fig. 3 shows the concentration dependence of the ratio of Po with and without DC obtained from traces of either an OmpU (closed symbols) or an OmpT (open symbols) trimer at +50 mV. The open probability of OmpU is so reproducibly maintained close to 1.0 that the error bars are within the thickness of the symbols. The solid line is a linear regression fit yielding a horizontal line. For OmpT, a concentration dependence is evident in the range of 0.001% to 0.01% DC. The solid line is a fit to the Hill equation (Equation 1) given under “Experimental Procedures,” where the IC50 is 0.008% DC, and the Hill coefficient is 2.5. These data are supportive of a model where the minimum number of binding sites is 3, and each monomer is blocked by a single molecule of DC, with, surprisingly, some amount of cooperativity. Cooperativity has been postulated for the simultaneous activation of porin trimers reconstituted in bilayers as clusters (26.Schindler H. Rosenbusch J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) but not for substrate binding or modulation nor between monomers of the same trimer. The effect of bath-applied DC on OmpT in symmetric buffer A is also voltage-dependent, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 4. In the absence of DC, the open probability of OmpT remains close to 1.0 in the voltage range of –50 mV to +70 mV (Fig. 4, filled circles). At higher positive or negative voltages, the channels inactivate, leading to a decreased Po, even in the absence of DC (6.Simonet V.C. Baslé A. Klose K.E. Delcour A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17539-17545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For this reason, the investigation was limited to a voltage range where Po remains constant, so the analysis of DC effect would not be complicated by channel inactivation. Bath-applied DC is quasi-ineffective in the negative voltage range, but the block becomes increasingly stronger as the transmembrane voltage increases in the positive range (Fig. 4, open circles). We initially thought that the voltage dependence of bath-applied DC was due to negatively charged deoxycholate molecules being driven from the bath into the pore at pipette positive potentials. If this scenario is correct, we would expect to see the opposite voltage dependence when DC is present in the pipette and absent in the bath. We did observe an inhibitory effect of DC when applied from the pipette side, supporting the model that the site of DC action is within the pore. Surprisingly, we found that the trend of the voltage dependence was the same regardless of where DC is applied, i.e. the effect is always more pronounced at positive pipette voltages than at negative ones. There is some sidedness to the efficacy of DC, though, as the reduction of Po is more pronounced when DC is in the pipette (Fig. 4, closed squares) than when it is in the bath (Fig. 4, open circles). These results suggest that the asymmetric voltage dependence of the DC effect is intrinsic to the channel, and indeed this asymmetric voltage dependence is still observed when the same concentration of DC is applied to both sides of the membrane (Fig. 4, open squares). Since there is no voltage dependence of Po in this voltage range, the voltage dependence of the DC effect is not due to the increased availability of open pores at positive pipette voltages. Thus it seems that the configuration of the DC binding site within the pore displays voltage dependence. These results also suggest that the active molecular species of DC is not the negatively charged molecules. The pKa of deoxycholic acid being 6.2, the ratio of unprotonated to protonated molecules would be 10:1 at the pH of buffer A (pH 7.2). Therefore, there is a non-negligible amount of protonated deoxycholate molecules present at pH 7.2. If indeed the neutral protonated deoxycholate is the active species, its effect should be decreased at higher pH and increased at lower pH. The results of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show that it is indeed the case. Fig. 5 shows traces obtained from the same patch at +50 mV pipette voltage in the presence of 0.006% DC at three different pH values, where the ratios R of negatively charged to protonated deoxycholate are widely different: pH 9.2 (R = 1000), pH 7.2 (R = 10), and pH 5.2 (R = 0.1). At pH 9.2, there is only 0.1% of protonated deoxycholate, and no effect on the channel is observed (top trace). At pH 5.2 (bottom trace), there is 90% of protonated deoxycholate, and the effect is much more pronounced than at pH 7.2 (∼9% protonated deoxycholate). It is important to note that the perfusion sequence for this experiment was buffer A + DC (pH 7.2), then buffer M + DC (pH 9.2), and finally buffer K + DC (pH 5.2). Therefore the observed effect is not due to a time dependence. These results also re-emphasize the reversibility of the phenomenon, since the channel completely recovers from block once buffer A + DC (pH 7.2) is exchanged for buffer M + DC (pH 9.2). The enhancement of the effect of DC with increasingly acidic pH is illustrated in Fig. 6, which compares the values of Po at these three different pH values. The top part shows that by themselves, the pH 5.2 and pH 9.2 buffers have no effect on the open probability.FIGURE 6Effect of pH on the OmpT open probability in presence of DC. The Po of a single trimer of OmpT in the absence (A) or the presence (B) of 0.006% bath-applied DC is plotted against the pipette potential. Symbols represent the averages of Po (±S.E.) from four separate patches, except for the cases of buffer M in the bath (n = 3) and of buffer A + DC in the bath (n = 5). When not seen on the graph, the error bars lie within the thickness of the symbols. In all cases, the pipette buffer was buffer A. The pH values of bath solutions are as follows: pH 9.2 (•, ○), pH 7.2 (▴, ▵), and pH 5.2 (▪, □).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also attempted similar experiments on OmpU to investigate whether the 10-fold increase in concentration of protonated deoxycholate might induce some inhibition. Unfortunately, OmpU is sensitive to acidic pH, and its open probability is decreased to ∼10% at pH 5.2 in the absence of DC. Perfusion of 0.006% DC at pH 5.2 had no additional effect, but of course these experiments are more difficult to interpret since the channel is already mostly in the closed state. Here we report that the general diffusion porins OmpU and OmpT of the outer membrane of V. cholerae are differentially sensitive to channel block by deoxycholic acid in a physiological range.

Deoxycholic acid constitutes about 20% of the bile acids present in bile.

Using a 13K chicken cDNA microarray, specifically enriched for chicken immune system expressed sequence tagged (ESTs), we carried out array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and detected significant DNA copy number change at many loci on most or all chromosomes in both early TF and end-stage lymphomas. Formation of long palindromes, through breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, is thought to play an early role in gene amplification. Employing genome-wide analysis of palindrome formation (GAPF), we detected extensive palindrome formation in early TF and end-stage lymphomas. The population of loci showing amplification by array-CGH was enriched for palindromes detected by GAPF providing strong evidence for genetic instability early in Myc-induced tumorigenesis and further support for the role of palindromes in gene amplification. Comparing gene copy number change and RNA expression changes profiled on the same cDNA array, we detected very little consistent contribution of gene copy number change to RNA expression changes. Palindromic loci in TF and tumors, however, were expressed, many at high levels, suggesting an abundance of RNA species with long double-stranded segments generated during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1547551683,"The P73 gene is transcribed from two promoters, P1 and P2, that direct the expression of multiple transactivation competent (TA) and dominant negative (DN) isoforms. TAp73 transcription factors mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to DNA damage and are involved in developmental processes. P73 mRNA levels increase and the P1p73 promoter is upregulated during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 skeletal muscle satellite cells. The DNp73 proteins act as trans-repressors of p53- and p73-dependent transcription, and possess both antiapoptotic and pro-proliferative potential. Here, we show that DNp73α is expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, rapidly accumulates in differentiating myocytes and remains elevated in C2C12 myotubes. By combining transactivation assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we could show that the upregulation of the P2p73 promoter during myogenic differentiation is mediated by the coordinated recruitment and activity of MyoD and p53/p73. Abrogation of DNp73 expression by specific siRNA led to a strong potentiation of the spontaneous apoptosis of C2C12 myoblasts induced to differentiate. Finally, unlike TAp73 that contributes to DNA damage-induced apoptosis of myotubes, endogenous DNp73 mediates the relative resistance of differentiated myotubes to DNA damage. Altogether, our findings identify DNp73α as an important target in designing strategies aimed at the potentiation of the regenerative potential of skeletal satellite cells."

The reaction mechanism of eukaryotic LMW-PTPs has been structurally, thermodynamically, and kinetically characterized (7Ramponi G. Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, very limited knowledge is available for prokaryotic LMW-PTPs thus far. All LMW-PTPs share a highly conserved C(X)5RS motif, where X can be any amino acid. This motif adopts a loop structure, where the phosphate group of the substrate binds to, and is known as the P-loop (1Kennelly P.J. Potts M. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D372-D385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some amino acids required for the catalysis are also highly conserved, such as an aspartate residue that acts as a general acid (8Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the structures of mammalian LMW-PTPs in complex with exogenous substrates or serendipitous ligands, determinants for substrate specificity were proposed, including the ring stacking around the targeted phosphotyrosine provided by two aromatic side chains of the LMW-PTPs (9Zhang M.

Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Many bacterial species harbor a layer of capsular polysaccharides and surface-associated exopolysaccharides (EPS). In Escherichia coli, the group 1 capsular polysaccharides and the colanic acid EPS are assembled in a Wzy-dependent polymerization system (11Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The ca gene cluster contains one tyrosine autokinase (Wzc) and one LMW-PTP (Wzb) that function as a pair of kinase/phosphatase in the regulation of colanic acid production (12Stevenson G. Andrianapolous K. Hobbs M. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4885-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, colanic acid is only produced after the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated Wzc by Wzb (14Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Wzc was identified to regulate the activity of UDPglucose dehydrogenase by the level of tyrosine phosphorylation and a working model for the role of Wzb and Wzc in EPS production has been proposed (15Grangeasse C. Obadia B. Mijakovic I. Deutscher J. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39323-39329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In several Gram-negative bacteria, there exist other kinase/phosphatase pairs that are homologous to the Wzc/Wzb pair, which also involve in capsular polysaccharides or EPS transport and regulation (16Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Bugert P. Geider K.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of Wzb and some other bacterial LMW-PTPs contain only one of the two residues with aromatic side chains that are critical for substrate recognition in eukaryotic LMW-PTPs. This fact leads to an open question: what are the determinants for the substrate specificity of those bacterial LMW-PTPs such as Wzb? In an effort to elucidate the structural basis of Wzc/Wzb interactions and further to understand the substrate recognition mechanism of the prokaryotic LMW-PTPs, we have determined the solution structure of the LMW-PTP Wzb from E. coli by NMR spectroscopy. The overall fold of Wzb highly resembles that of the typical LMW-PTPs. However, significant diversity of the tertiary structures was observed between Wzb and the eukaryotic LMW PTPs, especially around the active site P-loop. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of the substrate recognition for LMW-PTPs. Sample Preparation—The wzb gene from E. coli was amplified by PCR and cloned into the plasmid pET28a(+) (Novagen) with an N-terminal His tag and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were allowed to grow overnight in 25 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C and subsequently transferred into 1 liter of LB medium. When the A600 reached around 0.6, cells were spun down and resuspended in 250 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 15N-labeled ammonium chloride in the presence or absence of 13C-labeled glucose for 15N/13C-labeled or 15N-labeled samples, respectively (20Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The resuspended cells were allowed to grow in minimal medium for 1 h before induction. The protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 100 mg/liter. After 6 h of induction at 20 °C, the cells were harvested. The soluble protein was purified by the affinity chromatography (nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column), and subsequently gel filtration (Superdex-120 column) with the ÄKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Only a single peak corresponding to the monomeric molecular weight was observed during gel filtration. The purity was determined to be greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. NMR samples were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide at pH 6.0 in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid was added as the internal chemical shift reference. For phosphate titration experiments, Wzb protein (0.1 mm) was first dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm citric acid, 50 mm NaCl at pH 6.0. During the titration experiments, the concentration of phosphate ions in the Wzb solution was gradually increased and the titration was monitored by a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectra. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR experiments for obtaining the chemical shift assignments and distance restraints were carried out at 25 °C on Bruker Avance 500 MHz (with cryoprobe) and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance probes and pulsed-field gradients. The sample concentration was about 1.0 mm. Nearly complete backbone resonance assignments for Wzb were obtained using a series of three-dimensional spectra HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH and almost complete side chain resonance assignments were obtained using the three-dimensional spectra HBHA(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC, (H)CC(CO)NH,(H)CCH-TOCSY, H(C)CH-TOCSY, and (H)CCH-COSY (21Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional 15N- or 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (mixing times of 60 and 120 ms) were collected to confirm the resonance assignments and to obtain the distance restraints. The spectra were processed using the software package NMRPipe (22Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (23Blevins R.A. Johnson B.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). A semiautomatic strategy was followed to assign the backbone chemical shifts using the software MARS (24Jung Y.S. Zweckstetter M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). All backbone amide chemical shifts were obtained except Ile13 that was invisible in the spectra. The hydrogen bonding information was obtained by the 1H/2H exchange experiments. In addition, a set of 1H-15N residual dipolar coupling (RDC) constants were measured by dissolving Wzb protein in a dilute liquid crystal buffer containing a mixture of alkyl-poly(ethylene glycol) C12E5 and n-hexanol (25Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The C12E5/water ratio was 5.5 weight %, and the molar ratio of C12E5 to n-hexanol was 0.92. The RDCs were extracted from the difference in 1H-15N splitting measured by 1H-15N IPAP-HSQC spectra between the weakly aligned and the isotropic samples at 25 °C (26Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using software packages PALES (27Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and MODULE (28Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—The initial structure calculations were performed using the automatic nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) assignment program CANDID embedded in CYANA(29Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). The extended NOE contacts and chemical shift assignments were obtained by an iterative analysis of the calculated structures and NOE assignments using the program SANE (30Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The NOE-derived distance restraints, in combination with the backbone dihedral angles determined by TALOS (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and hydrogen bond information, were used in each calculation step. Two hundred structures were calculated using CYANA and the 100 structures with the lowest target function were selected for further refinement by AMBER7 (32Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER.7. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar). The 1H-15N RDCs were used as restraints during the refinement stage. As recommended in the AMBER7 manual, explicit angle restraints were added to enforce the ideal backbone geometry for residues with RDC restraints. Finally, the 20 lowest energy structures were selected to represent Wzb. The structures were analyzed using the software packages MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Crossref Scopus (6490) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK_NMR(34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure-based Multiple Sequence Alignment—The LMW-PTPs with known tertiary structures were aligned using STRAP. LMW-PTPs of unknown tertiary structures were subsequently added in the multiple sequence alignment using the program ClustalX (35Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins M. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). Accession Numbers—The chemical shifts have been deposited in the BioMagResBank data base under accession number 6934. The coordinates of Wzb structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 2FEK. The Overall Structure of E. coli Wzb—The solution structure of E. coli Wzb was determined using the NOE-derived distance restraints in conjunction with the dihedral angle, RDC, and hydrogen bond restraints. The 20 lowest energy structures were selected to represent Wzb and are shown in Fig. 1A, together with the ribbon diagram showing the secondary structural elements (Fig. 1, B and C). The structural statistics are listed in Table 1. The root mean square deviation of the backbone heavy atoms is 0.90 ± 0.23 Å for all residues and 0.50 ± 0.09 Å for those in secondary structural elements. Ramachandran plots of all 20 structures indicate that most of the backbone dihedral angles lie within the energetically favorable regions of the (φ, ψ) space.TABLE 1Structural statistics of E. coli WzbStatisticsRestraintsIntra-residue unambiguous NOEs797Sequential unambiguous NOEsa|i − j| = 1.606Medium range unambiguous NOEsb1<|i − j|>5.494Long range unambiguous NOEsc|i − j| ≤ 5.743Total unambiguous NOEs2640Total ambiguous NOEs1630Dihedral angles (backbone + X1)190 + 32Hydrogen bond distance restraintsdTwo upper limits were used for each hydrogen bond restraint (d(HNi+4-Oi) < 2.3 Å and d(Ni+4-Oi) < 3.3 Å).1001H-15N RDC restraints97Restraint violationsNOE-derived distance (>0.2 Å)0Torsion angle, >5°3Torsion angle, >10°0Energy (kcal/mol)Mean AMBER energy−7887 ± 13NMR restraints violation energyeInclude NOE, dihedral angle, and RDC violation energy.32.3 ± 7.3Root mean square deviation from mean structure (Å)Backbone heavy atomsfThe backbone heavy atoms including Cα, amide nitrogen, and carbonyl carbon atoms.All residues0.90 ± 0.23Secondary structures0.50 ± 0.09All heavy atomsgAll heavy atoms including all the non-hydrogen atoms of the protein.All residues1.58 ± 0.23Secondary structures1.29 ± 0.16Ramachandran statisticsResidues in most favored regions (%)86.0Residues in additional allowed regions (%)12.8Residues in generously allowed regions (%)0.4Residues in disallowed regions (%)0.8a |i − j| = 1.b 1<|i − j|>5.c |i − j| ≤ 5.d Two upper limits were used for each hydrogen bond restraint (d(HNi+4-Oi) < 2.3 Å and d(Ni+4-Oi) < 3.3 Å).e Include NOE, dihedral angle, and RDC violation energy.f The backbone heavy atoms including Cα, amide nitrogen, and carbonyl carbon atoms.g All heavy atoms including all the non-hydrogen atoms of the protein. Open table in a new tab Overall, Wzb adopts a typical LMW-PTP fold, consisting of 4 β-strands (β1 (Asn4-Cys9), β2 (Lys31-Leu37), β3 (Leu78-Thr81) and β4 (Lys100-His106)) and five α-helices (α1 (Arg15-Tyr26), α2 (Pro47-His56), α3 (Arg70-Arg74), α4 (Lys84-Met93), and α5 (Arg121-Leu142)). The β-strands form into a central highly twisted parallel β-sheet (β4-β3-β1-β2) flanked by helices α1, α2, and α5 on one side, while α3 and α4 on the other side. Three long loops (β2-α2, α2-α3, and β4-α5) link the secondary structural elements. In addition, a type II β-turn is formed from Leu40 to Lys43 in loop β2-α2. The Active Site—The P-loop of Wzb contains the amino acid sequence 9CVGNICRS16, where the underlined residues are highly conserved among all identified LMW-PTPs (Fig. 2). The P-loop connects strand β1 and α-helix α1 (Fig. 1B) and is buried at the bottom of a crevice (Fig. 3), which is delineated by residues Ala39, Leu40, Ala45, and Asp46 in loop β2-α2, Glu83 and His86 in helix α3, and Asp115 to Tyr117 in loop β4-α5. Residues Asp115, Glu83, and those in the P-loop form the upper and center part of the crevice, whereas residues in loops β2-α2 and β4-α5 contribute to the lower part as viewed in Fig. 3. The side chains of Tyr117 and Leu40, together with the main chain of Ala45 and Asp46 form a ring around the side chain of Ile13 below the P-loop. To confirm the binding of the P-loop of Wzb with phosphate ions, the phosphate titration experiments were performed and monitored by a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC experiments. In the absence of phosphate ions, 13 residues (Cys9-Asn12, Cys14-Ser16, Glu20, Gly36, Leu37, Leu40, Arg66, and Tyr117) of Wzb completely disappeared in the 15N-edited HSQC spectrum, whereas the remaining cross-peaks in the spectrum were almost identical to that in the presence of phosphate ions (Fig. 4A). Upon addition of phosphate, all missing cross-peaks showed up and their intensities gradually increased with the increase of phosphate concentration. After the phosphate concentration was higher than 20 mm, the peak intensities in the HSQC spectra remained unchanged. This result confirmed that the phosphate binds to Wzb and stabilizes the P-loop, and indicated that phosphate binding does not significantly alter the overall structure of Wzb except the P-loop region in which most residues are missing from the two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum in the absence of phosphate ions. Nevertheless, we compared the P-loop region of Wzb with that of the crystal structure of phosphate-bound BPTP (Protein Data Bank code 1PHR) (36Su X.D. Taddei N. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Nordlund P. Nature. 1994; 370: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and found that all the NH bonds of Wzb whose NMR signals were missing in the absence of phosphate point toward the position where the phosphate group is expected to bind (Fig. 4B). Based on this, the inorganic phosphate in Wzb likely occupies a similar position as that in other LMW-PTPs. In addition, the phosphate titration experiments suggest that the P-loop undergoes significant mobility (conformational exchanges) in the absence of phosphate, which causes the broadening of the NMR signals and makes them undetectable. The conformational exchanges are largely diminished after binding with phosphate ion, which is further demonstrated by the results of backbone dynamics (supplemental data).FIGURE 3Ribbon representation of Wzb showing the catalytic P-loop.

A, two-dimensional 15N-edited HSQC spectrum of Wzb in the presence of excess phosphate ions. Wzb was dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl at pH 6.0. The spectrum was acquired on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. Folded cross-peaks are colored in gray. Except the crowded central region of the spectrum, the cross-peaks are labeled with the residue names and numbers. For clarity, the HSQC spectrum in the absence of phosphate ions is not shown because both spectra were almost identical as described in the text. Instead, cross-peaks that were absent in the buffer containing 20 mm citric acid, 50 mm NaCl at pH 6.0 are circled in red as indicated in A. B, mapping of the titration changes on the ribbon structure of Wzb. The residues disappeared in the absence of phosphate ions are represented by black balls and residues at the extremities and outside of the P-loop are labeled.

Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2175-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and YwlE from the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (41Xu H. Xia B. Jin C. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have been reported recently. Although Wzb shares a low sequence identity (less than 30%) with these LMW-PTPs, it shows a high structural similarity with them, especially the highly conserved regular secondary structures. Residues Cys9-Ser16 of the catalytic site fold into a typical P-loop conformation, and the root mean square deviation values of the backbone atoms of these residues with those of the equivalent residues (Cys12-Ser19 in BPTP and HCPTPA, Cys13-Ser20 in LTP1) in eukaryotic LMW-PTPs range from 0.30 to 0.35 Å. In addition, most of the main chain NH bonds in the P-loop point toward the expected position of the phosphate group. Furthermore, the side chain of the strictly conserved asparagine residue Asn12 is spatially closed to that of His63 (the distance between Nδ2 of Asn12 and Nδ2 of His63 is d(N12Nδ2, H63Nδ2) = 3.4 ± 0.4 Å), Ser16 (d(N12Nδ2, S16Oγ) = 3.7 ± 0.8 Å), and Ser34 (d(N12Nδ2, S34Oγ) = 4.9 ± 0.5 Å). A similar geometry is observed in BPTP, HCPTPA, and LTP1 (residues Asn15, His72, Ser19, and Ser43, respectively in BPTP). These distances suggest the presence of a hydrogen-bonding network involving Asn12 in Wzb, which may stabilize the backbone conformation of the P-loop, as previously observed in BPTP (38Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11097-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). On the upper side of the P-loop as viewed in Fig. 3, the guanidinium moiety of the conserved Arg15 is in a favorable distance with the acidic groups of Asp115 and Glu83 to form hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. Moreover, the Hϵ atom of Arg15 in Wzb is superimposable with that of the equivalent arginine in BPTP (Arg18), HCPTPA (Arg18), and LTP1 (Arg19). In those LMW-PTPs, the Hϵ atom of the arginine likely forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of the phosphate substrate. As a consequence, residue Arg15 in Wzb most likely contributes to the recognition and position of the substrate in a similar way as eukaryotic LMW-PTPs. The acidic group of residue Asp115 in Wzb is close to the guanidinium moiety of Arg15 and is in a favorable position to provide a proton to the leaving phenolic group. This aspartic residue is believed to serve as a general acid in the reaction (8Zhang Z. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25947-25950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Wzb, the Cys9 side chain is directed toward the phosphate binding site and the proximity of the hydroxyl group of Ser16 to Cys9 side chain (d(C9Sγ, S16Oγ) = 3.9 ± 0.8 Å) suggests hydrogen bonding. In BPTP, Cys12 (equivalent to Cys9 in Wzb) forms a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate during the reaction (42Wo Y.Y. Zhou M.M. Stevis P. Davis J.P. Zhang Z.Y. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1712-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and is likely activated by hydrogen bonding with Ser19 (equivalent to Ser16 in Wzb) (43Evans B. Tishmack P.A. Pokalsky C. Zhang M. Van Etten R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13609-13617Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As a consequence, Cys9 may be activated by Ser16 in Wzb. The fact that Wzb shares high structural similarity with the eukaryotic LMW-PTPs strongly suggests that the dephosphorylation mechanism of Wzb is similar to that of other LMW-PTPs (7Ramponi G. Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the phosphoryl group of the phosphorylated Wzc undergoes a nucleophilic attack by the active site Cys9 side chain of Wzb. The guanidinium moiety of Arg15 stabilizes the phosphoenzyme intermediate state and the invariant aspartate residue Asp115 protonates the ester oxygen of the leaving group. In the following step, the phosphoenzyme is hydrolyzed by the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule, possibly assisted by Asp115. Finally, one cycle of the dephosphorylation is finished with the release of the inorganic phosphate (7Ramponi G. Stefani M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Substrate Recognition—Previous structural studies on eukaryotic LMW-PTPs in complex with exogenous substrates identified two regions around the catalytic center that are important for the enzyme activity (9Zhang M. Stauffacher C.V. Lin D. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21714-21720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Wang S. Tabernero L. Zhang M. Harms E. Van Etten R.L. Stauffacher C.V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1903-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In loop β4-α5 of the eukaryotic LMW-PTPs, an aromatic ring (Tyr131 in HCPTPA and BPTP, Trp134 in LTP1) was found to stabilize the substrate by interacting with the aromatic ring of the phosphotyrosine from one side. In Wzb, Tyr117 is structurally equivalent to Tyr131 in BPTP (Fig. 5A) and likely plays a similar role in substrate recognition and stabilization by providing π-π stacking contacts with the phenolic ring of the substrate. Notably, an aromatic residue is conserved at this position among all bacterial LMW-PTPs with a preference f"

Whereas the epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB2 and ErbB3 are positively associated with various cancers, clinical studies of ErbB4 in breast cancer are contradictory. Results from tissue culture analyses and some clinical studies suggested that ErbB4 is either a tumor suppressor or is a negative regulator of ErbB2-driven tumors. Neu-Cre-ErbB4flox/null mice in which ErbB4 was inactivated by Cre-lox-mediated recombination in the mammary gland developed MMTV-Neu-driven mammary tumors with a similar latency period to mice with one or two wild-type ErbB4 alleles. Moreover, there was no difference in the histologies of tumors that developed, nor in the propensity to form lung metastases. Taken together these results suggest that ErbB4 is not a potent, highly penetrant tumor suppressor, nor is it a factor in Neu-mediated tumorigenesis in this model."
