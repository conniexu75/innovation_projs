https://openalex.org/W4307715650,"The therapeutic potential of recombinant cytokines has been limited by the severe side effects of systemic administration. We describe a strategy to reduce the dose-limiting toxicities of monomeric cytokines by designing two components that require colocalization for activity and that can be independently targeted to restrict activity to cells expressing two surface markers. We demonstrate the approach with a previously designed mimetic of cytokines interleukin-2 and interleukin-15-Neoleukin-2/15 (Neo-2/15)-both for trans-activating immune cells surrounding targeted tumor cells and for cis-activating directly targeted immune cells. In trans-activation mode, tumor antigen targeting of the two components enhanced antitumor activity and attenuated toxicity compared with systemic treatment in syngeneic mouse melanoma models. In cis-activation mode, immune cell targeting of the two components selectively expanded CD8+ T cells in a syngeneic mouse melanoma model and promoted chimeric antigen receptor T cell activation in a lymphoma xenograft model, enhancing antitumor efficacy in both cases."
https://openalex.org/W4307715677,"Chromatin profiling at locus resolution uncovers gene regulatory features that define cell types and developmental trajectories, but it remains challenging to map and compare different chromatin-associated proteins in the same sample. Here we describe Multiple Target Identification by Tagmentation (MulTI-Tag), an antibody barcoding approach for profiling multiple chromatin features simultaneously in single cells. We optimized MulTI-Tag to retain high sensitivity and specificity, and we demonstrate detection of up to three histone modifications in the same cell: H3K27me3, H3K4me1/2 and H3K36me3. We apply MulTI-Tag to resolve distinct cell types and developmental trajectories; to distinguish unique, coordinated patterns of active and repressive element regulatory usage associated with differentiation outcomes; and to uncover associations between histone marks. Multifactorial epigenetic profiling holds promise for comprehensively characterizing cell-specific gene regulatory landscapes in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4307906184,"The function of biomolecular condensates is often restricted by condensate dissolution. Whether condensates can be suppressed without condensate dissolution is unclear. Here, we show that upstream regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway form functionally antagonizing condensates, and their coalescence into a common phase provides a mode of counteracting the function of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution. Specifically, the negative regulator SLMAP forms Hippo-inactivating condensates to facilitate pathway inhibition by the STRIPAK complex. In response to cell-cell contact or osmotic stress, the positive regulators AMOT and KIBRA form Hippo-activating condensates to facilitate pathway activation. The functionally antagonizing SLMAP and AMOT/KIBRA condensates further coalesce into a common phase to inhibit STRIPAK function. These findings provide a paradigm for restricting the activity of biomolecular condensates without condensate dissolution, shed light on the molecular principles of multiphase organization, and offer a conceptual framework for understanding upstream regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W4307715801,"Coenzyme A (CoA) is one of the central cofactors of metabolism, yet a method for measuring its concentration in living cells is missing. Here we introduce the first biosensor for measuring CoA levels in different organelles of mammalian cells. The semisynthetic biosensor is generated through the specific labeling of an engineered GFP-HaloTag fusion protein with a fluorescent ligand. Its readout is based on CoA-dependent changes in Förster resonance energy transfer efficiency between GFP and the fluorescent ligand. Using this biosensor, we probe the role of numerous proteins involved in CoA biosynthesis and transport in mammalian cells. On the basis of these studies, we propose a cellular map of CoA biosynthesis that suggests how pools of cytosolic and mitochondrial CoA are maintained."
https://openalex.org/W4307800251,"The declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11 2020, by the World Health Organisation prompted the need for a sustained and a rapid international response. In a swift response, the Government of Ghana, in partnership with Zipline company, launched the use of Unmanned Automated Vehicles (UAV) to transport suspected samples from selected districts to two foremost testing centres in the country. Here, we present the experiences of employing this technology and its impact on the transport time to the second largest testing centre, the Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine (KCCR) in Kumasi, Ghana.Swab samples collected from suspected COVID-19 patients were transported to the Zipline office by health workers. Information on the samples were sent to laboratory personnel located at KCCR through a WhatsApp platform to get them ready to receive the suspected COVID-19 samples while Zipline repackaged samples and transported them via drone. Time of take-off was reported as well as time of drop-off.A total of 2537 COVID-19 suspected samples were received via drone transport from 10 districts between April 2020 to June 2021 in 440 deliveries. Ejura-Sekyedumase District Health Directorate delivered the highest number of samples (765; 30%). The farthest district to use the drone was Pru East, located 270 km away from KCCR in Kumasi and 173 km to the Zipline office in Mampong. Here, significantly, it took on the average 39 minutes for drones to deliver samples compared to 117 minutes spent in transporting samples by road (p<0.001).The use of drones for sample transport during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the travel time taken for samples to be transported by road to the testing site. This has enhanced innovative measures to fight the pandemic using technology."
https://openalex.org/W4307851522,"Linguistic disorders are one of the common problems in Alzheimer's disease, which in recent years has been considered as one of the key parameters in the diagnosis of Alzheimer (AD). Given that changes in sentence processing and working memory and the relationship between these two activities may be a diagnostic parameter in the early and preclinical stages of AD, the present study examines the comprehension and production of sentences and working memory in AD patients and healthy aged people.Twenty-five people with mild Alzheimer's and 25 healthy elderly people participated in the study. In this study, we used the digit span to evaluate working memory. Syntactic priming and sentence completion tasks in canonical and non-canonical conditions were used for evaluating sentence production. We administered sentence picture matching and cross-modal naming tasks to assess sentence comprehension.The results of the present study revealed that healthy elderly people and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease have a significant difference in comprehension of relative clause sentences (P <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in comprehension of simple active, simple active with noun phrase and passive sentences (P> 0.05). They had a significant difference in auditory and visual reaction time (P <0.05). Also there was a significant difference between the two groups in syntactic priming and sentence completion tasks. However, in non-canonical condition of sentence completion, the difference between the two groups was not significant (P> 0.05).The results of the present study showed that the mean scores related to comprehension, production and working memory in people with mild Alzheimer's were lower than healthy aged people, which indicate sentence processing problems at this level of the disease. People with Alzheimer have difficulty comprehending and producing complex syntactic structures and have poorer performance in tasks that required more memory demands. It seems that the processing problems of these people are due to both working memory and language problems, which are not separate from each other and both are involved in."

https://openalex.org/W4307699297,"Holistic health care (HHC) is a synonym for complete patient care, and as such an efficient clinical decision support system (CDSS) for HHC is critical to support the judgement of physician’s decision in response of patient’s physical, emotional, social, economic, and spiritual needs. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved considerably in the past decades and many AI applications have been deployed in various contexts. Therefore, this study aims to propose an AI-assisted CDSS model that predicts patients in need of HHC and applies an improved recurrent neural network (RNN) model, long short-term memory (LSTM) for the prediction. The data sources include in-patient’s comorbidity status and daily vital sign attributes such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen prescription, etc. A two-year dataset consisting of 121 thousand anonymized patient cases with 890 thousand physiological medical records was obtained from a medical center in Taiwan for system evaluation. Comparing with the rule-based expert system, the proposed AI-assisted CDSS improves sensitivity from 26.44% to 80.84% and specificity from 99.23% to 99.95%. The experimental results demonstrate that an AI-assisted CDSS could efficiently predict HHC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4307699300,"Introductions Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive progressive muscular disease marked by developmental delays due to mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin. Brain comorbidity adds to the burden of limited mobility and significantly impacts patients’ quality of life and their family. The changes of expression of dystrophin isoforms in the brain due to DMD gene mutations are thought to be related to the cognitive and neurobehavior profiles of DMD. Objectives This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize cognitive and neurodevelopmental profiles of patients with DMD and to explore underlying genotype-phenotype associations. Methods Patients with DMD aged 5–18 years from Dr Sardjito Hospital and Universitas Gadjah Mada Academic Hospital from 2017–2022 were included. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and whole exome sequencing were used to determine mutations in the DMD genes. Cognitive function was measured by intelligence quotient testing using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and adaptive function tests with Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. The Autism Mental Status Exam and Abbreviated Conner’s Rating Scale were used to screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), respectively. Results The mean total IQ score of DMD patients was lower than that of the general population (80.6 ± 22.0 vs 100 ± 15), with intellectual disability observed in 15 boys (29.4%). Of the 51 patients with DMD, the Dp71 group had the lowest cognitive performance with a total IQ score (46 ± 24.8; p = 0.003), while the Dp427 group and Dp140 group’s total IQ scores were 83.0 ± 24.6 and 84.2 ± 17.5 respectively. There were no DMD patients with ASD, while 4 boys (7.8%) had comorbidity with ADHD. Conclusion Boys with DMD are at higher risk of intellectual disability. The risk appears to increase with mutations at the 3’ end of the gene (Dp71 disruption). Moreover, Dp71 disruption might not be associated with ADHD and ASD in patients with DMD."
https://openalex.org/W4307699517,"The prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has endangered the psychological health of individuals. This study aimed to assess the quality of life and its related psychological problems during COVID-19 pandemic.In this cross-sectional study, 559 citizens above the age of 16 years, in Isfahan and Bandar Abbas cities in Iran were selected with a convenient sampling method. An online questionnaire was used to collect the data, which consisted of five sections: demographic information, short health anxiety inventory (SHAI), perceived stress scale (PSS), world health organization quality of life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) and Padua inventory. Data were analyzed using statistical tests including t-test, path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS 24 and Amos 21 statistical software.A total of 559 subjects with the mean age of 37.34 ± 11.19 years participated in this study. Most of the participants were female (78.5%), married (71.6%) and employed (40.9%). The majority of them also had a bachelor's degree (42.9%). There were significant negative correlations between perceived helplessness (r = -.597, p = .000), perceived stress (r = -.715, p = .000), risk of disease (r = -.302, p = .000), negative effect of disease (r = -.424, p = .000), health anxiety (r = -.366, p = .000), contamination obsessions (r = -.187, p = .000) and washing compulsions (r = -.193, p = .000) with quality of life. On other hand, significant positive correlation was found between perceived self-efficacy (r = .665, p = .000) and quality of life.According to our findings, health anxiety, perceived stress and obsessive-compulsive disorder were negatively affected psychological health during COVID-19 which in turn decreased quality of life. Therefore, we suggest considering prevention and treatment of theses psychological problems to diminish the risk of reduced quality of life during COVID-19 global pandemic crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4307715228,"The resistance and the birth of new intrinsic and multidrug-resistant pathogenic species like C . auris is creating great concern in the antifungal world. Given the limited drug arsenal and the lack of effectiveness of the available compounds, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches. The murine mAb 2G8 was humanized and engineered in silico to develop a single-chain fragment variable (hscFv) antibody against β-1,3-glucans which was then expressed in E . coli . Among the recombinant proteins developed, a soluble candidate with high stability and affinity was obtained. This selected protein is VL-linker-VH oriented, and it is characterized by the presence of two ubiquitin monomers at the N-terminus and a His tag at the C-terminus. This construct, Ub 2 -hscFv-His, guaranteed stability, solubility, efficient purification and satisfactory recovery of the recombinant product. HscFv can bind β-1,3-glucans both as coated antigens and on C . auris and C . albicans cells similarly to its murine parental and showed long stability and retention of binding ability when stored at 4°, -20° and -80° C. Furthermore, it was efficient in enhancing the antifungal activity of drugs caspofungin and amphotericin B against C . auris . The use of biological drugs as antifungals is limited; here we present a promising hscFv which has the potential to be useful in combination with currently available antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4307744147,"Increased physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and longevity. In Swedish healthcare, the physical activity on prescription (PAP) method reportedly increases patients' PA levels for up to 12 months, but long-term follow ups are lacking. As it remains difficult to maintain lifestyle changes, our aim was to evaluate adherence and clinical effects at a 5-year follow-up of PAP treatment in primary healthcare.This longitudinal, prospective cohort study included 444 patients, (56% female), aged 27-85 years, with at least one metabolic risk factor. Participants were offered PAP by nurses or physiotherapists. The PAP intervention included an individualised dialogue, a PA recommendation by written prescription, and individually adjusted follow-up over 5 years, according to the Swedish PAP model. Patient PA level, metabolic risk factors, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) were measured at baseline and at the 6-month, 1.5-year, 2.5-year, 3.5-year, and 5-year follow-ups. Estimated latent growth curves were used to examine levels and rates of change in the outcomes.The study dropout rate was 52%, with 215 of 444 patients completing the 5-year follow-up. At follow-up, the mean PA level had increased by 730 MET-minutes per week or 3 hours of moderate-intensity PA/week when compared to baseline. During the 5-year intervention, we observed significant positive changes (p ≤ 0.05) in 9 of 11 metabolic risk factors and HRQoL parameters: body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and mental component summary.This first evaluation of a 5-year PAP intervention in primary care demonstrated positive long-term (5 years) effects regarding PA level, metabolic health, and HRQoL. The recorded long-term adherence was ~50%, which is in line with medical treatment. Despite limitations, PAP can have long-term effects in an ordinary primary care setting."
https://openalex.org/W4307832392,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial, opportunistic pathogen with growing clinical significance globally. A . baumannii has an exceptional ability to rapidly develop drug resistance. It is frequently responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia in clinical settings and inflammation resulting in severe sepsis. The inflammatory response is mediated by host pattern-recognition receptors and the inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation triggers inflammatory responses, including the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, the recruitment of innate immune effectors against A . baumannii infection, and the induction programmed cell death by pyroptosis. An important knowledge gap is how variation among clinical isolates affects the host’s innate response and activation of the inflammasome during A . baumannii infection. In this study, we compared nine A . baumannii strains, including clinical locally-acquired isolates, in their ability to induce activation of the inflammasome and programmed cell death in primary macrophages, epithelial lung cell line and mice. We found a variation in survival outcomes of mice and bacterial dissemination in organs among three commercially available A . baumannii strains, likely due to the differences in virulence between strains. Interestingly, we found variability among A . baumannii strains in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, non-canonical Caspase-11 pathway, plasmatic secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and programmed cell death. Our study highlights the importance of utilising multiple bacterial strains and clinical isolates with different virulence to investigate the innate immune response to A . baumannii infection."
https://openalex.org/W4307832393,"Background Elevations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations not related to type 1 myocardial infarction are common in chest pain patients presenting to emergency departments. The discrimination of these patients from those with type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) is challenging and resource-consuming. We aimed to investigate whether the hs-cTn I/T ratio might provide diagnostic and prognostic increment in this context. Methods We calculated the hs-cTn I/T ratio in 888 chest pain patients having hs-cTnI (Abbott Laboratories) or hs-cTnT (Roche Diagnostics) concentrations above the respective 99 th percentile at 2 hours from presentation. All patients were followed for one year regarding mortality. Results The median hs-cTn I/T ratio was 3.45 (25 th , 75 th percentiles 1.80–6.59) in type 1 MI patients (n = 408 ☯46.0%]), 1.18 (0.81–1.90) in type 2 MI patients (n = 56 ☯6.3%]) and 0.67 (0.39–1.12) in patients without MI. The hs-cTn I/T ratio provided good discrimination of type 1 MI from no type 1 MI (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve 0.89 ☯95% confidence interval 0.86–0.91]), of type 1 MI from type 2 MI (area under the curve 0.81 ☯95% confidence interval 0.74–0.87]), and was associated with type 1 MI in adjusted analyses. The hs-cTn I/T ratio provided no consistent prognostic value. Conclusions The hs-cTn I/T ratio appears to be useful for early diagnosis of type 1 MI and its discrimination from type 2 MI in chest pain patients presenting with elevated hs-cTn. Differences in hs-cTn I/T ratio values may reflect variations in hs-cTn release mechanisms in response to different types of myocardial injury."
https://openalex.org/W4307832599,"Background HIV is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa that can be managed using antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence clubs are interventions that have been introduced to decentralize ART to improve ART adherence and provide social support for club members. However, ART adherence can be suboptimal even among adherence club members. Aim This study aimed to determine the factors affecting ART adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) attending adherence clubs in Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Ordinal logistic regression was used in univariable and multivariable analyses to determine factors significantly associated with adherence scores. Factors included in the final model were age, comorbidity, ART regimen and club membership duration. Results The records of 730 participants were analysed. After adjusting for age, participants with comorbidities were half as likely to report high ART adherence scores compared to participants without comorbidities (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–0.8, p = 0.005). The adjusted odds of reporting high levels of adherence among participants on cART were 1.8 times those on a single tablet regimen (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0–3.2; p = 0.033). There was a 20% reduction in the adjusted odds of reporting high ART adherence for each additional year of adherence club membership (AOR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.8–0.9, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Increasing years spent as adherence club members, single tablet ART regimens and the presence of comorbidities were all significantly associated with low ART adherence among study participants. Regular assessment of the quality of counselling sessions for ART adherence club members and questionnaires for early screening of treatment fatigue have been suggested as tools for improved adherence in ART adherence club settings."
https://openalex.org/W4307699293,"Tailings dams are in danger of liquefaction during earthquakes. The liquefaction process can be indirectly reflected by the evolution rule of the dynamic pore water pressure. To study the development law of dynamic pore water pressure of tailing sand under different consolidation conditions, the evolution equation of critical dynamic pore water pressure of tailings under isotropic and anisotropic consolidation conditions was derived based on the limit equilibrium theory. Moreover, the development law of dynamic pore water pressure was expounded theoretically. The dynamic triaxial tests of tailing silty sand and tailing silt under different dry densities, consolidation ratios, and confining pressures were performed. The dynamic pore water pressure ratio and vibration ratio curves of tailings under isotropic and anisotropic consolidation were analyzed, and a dynamic pore water pressure growth index model suitable for both isotropic and anisotropic consolidation was derived. The results showed that the critical dynamic pore water pressure was positively correlated with the confining pressure and average particle size of tailings under isotropic consolidation conditions. The tailings have a limit dynamic effective internal friction angle <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> under the anisotropic consolidation condition.

The consolidation ratio significantly affects the dynamic pore pressure growth curve while confining pressure and dry density do not. For different tailing materials, the dynamic pore water pressure ratio is positively correlated with tailing particles. The dynamic pore water pressure growth process of tailing silty sand and tailing silt can be divided into two stages: rapid and stable growths. The development law of two types of tailings can be described by the dynamic pore water pressure growth index model. The research results can provide a theoretical basis for the seismic design of tailings dams in practical engineering."
https://openalex.org/W4307699306,"The research aimed to further develop knowledge on the mechanisms that enhance risk-taking propensities among powerful people. Three studies (N1 = 328, N2 = 388, N3 = 267) investigated the role of optimism in the relationship between sense of power and financial risk-taking, controlling for the state of power. Study 1, correlational, analyzed whether the relationship between sense of power and risky financial choices is serially mediated by general optimism and financial risk perception. The results confirmed the initial hypotheses. The second, experimental, study investigated the role of states of power and lack of power in explaining people's financial decisions as well as their influence on people's situational optimism and perception of risk. The results indicated that people in a state of power differed from people lacking power in terms of their situational optimism and the riskiness of their financial choices; however, they did not differ in terms of risk perception. People having power were more optimistic, invested more, and made riskier gambling choices than those in control conditions and those who lacked power. The third, experimental, study investigated the single and joint moderating effects of the states of optimism and power in explaining the positive relationship between sense of power and risky investing and gambling choices. In line with our expectations, the results of the study showed that the states of power and optimism jointly moderated the positive relationship between the sense of power and risky financial choices. This effect was the strongest under the state of power and optimism conditions and the weakest when lack of power and pessimism were induced; thus boundary conditions for previously observed mechanisms were identified. The results of the research shed light on the way optimism mediates and moderates the effect of power on financial risk-taking and thus contributes to theoretical knowledge of the consequences of power."
https://openalex.org/W4307699479,"The process of number symbolization is assumed to be critically influenced by the acquisition of so-called verbal number skills (e.g., verbally reciting the number chain and naming Arabic numerals). For the acquisition of these verbal number skills, verbal and visuospatial skills are discussed as contributing factors. In this context, children's verbal number skills have been found to be associated with their concurrent spatial language skills such as mastery of verbal descriptions of spatial position (e.g., in front of, behind). In a longitudinal study with three measurement times (T1, T2, T3) at an interval of about 6 months, we evaluated the predictive role of preschool children's (mean age at T1: 3 years and 10 months) spatial language skills for the acquisition of verbal number skills. Children's spatial language skills at T2 significantly predicted their verbal number skills at T3, when controlling for influences of important covariates such as vocabulary knowledge. In addition, further analyses replicated previous results indicating that children's spatial language skills at T2 were associated with their verbal number skills at T2. Exploratory analyses further revealed that children's verbal number skills at T1 predict their spatial language at T2. Results suggests that better spatial language skills at the age of 4 years facilitate the future acquisition of verbal number skills."
https://openalex.org/W4307744423,"Background It is important to ensure that both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of clinical education are maintained during the pandemic. Understanding students’ views on clinical rotations and the extent of their perceived pandemic-related stress would thus be useful for designing and implementing effective clerkship programs. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate perceived stress and perceptions regarding clinical clerkship among incoming clinical students (third year) and senior clinical students (fourth year) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods After completing orientation programs at the beginning of the academic year, we surveyed students on their perceived stress, their general perspectives regarding the appropriate scope of clinical clerkship, and their preferences regarding level of participation in clerkship. We examined the differences in stress and clerkship-related perceptions based on the students’ study year and sex using independent t-test, chi-squared test, and Fisher’s exact test. In addition, the influences of stress, sex, and study year on clerkship-related perceptions were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results The independent t-test indicated that third-year students experienced lower stress than did fourth-year students. Clerkship-related perceptions also differed significantly between third- and fourth-year students. Multinomial logistic regression analyses on the scope of and participation levels in clinical clerkship revealed that third-year students had significantly lower odds of preferring a limited range of clinical rotations and lower engagement in clerkships compared to fourth-year students. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has affected clinical education and, consequently, medical students’ inclination toward active participation in clinical rotations. It is thus essential to understand students’ views and provide them with relevant intra-pandemic educational supports."

https://openalex.org/W4307800249,"The use of biologic adjuvants (orthobiologics) is becoming commonplace in orthopaedic surgery. Among other applications, biologics are often added to enhance fusion rates in spinal surgery and to promote bone healing in complex fracture patterns. Generally, orthopaedic surgeons use only one biomolecular agent (ie allograft with embedded bone morphogenic protein-2) rather than several agents acting in concert. Bone fusion, however, is a highly multifactorial process and it likely could be more effectively enhanced using biologic factors in combination, acting synergistically. We used artificial neural networks, trained via machine learning on experimental data on orthobiologic interventions and their outcomes, to identify combinations of orthobiologic factors that potentially would be more effective than single agents. This use of machine learning applied to orthobiologic interventions is unprecedented.Available data on the outcomes associated with various orthopaedic biologic agents, electrical stimulation, and pulsed ultrasound were curated from the literature and assembled into a form suitable for machine learning. The best among many different types of neural networks was chosen for its ability to generalize over this dataset, and that network was used to make predictions concerning the expected efficacy of 2400 medically feasible combinations of 9 different agents and treatments.The most effective combinations were high in the bone-morphogenic proteins (BMP) 2 and 7 (BMP2, 15mg; BMP7, 5mg), and in osteogenin (150ug). In some of the most effective combinations, electrical stimulation could substitute for osteogenin. Some other effective combinations also included bone marrow aspirate concentrate. BMP2 and BMP7 appear to have the strongest pairwise linkage of the factors analyzed in this study.Artificial neural networks are powerful forms of artificial intelligence that can be applied readily in the orthopaedic domain, but neural network predictions improve along with the amount of data available to train them. This study provides a starting point from which networks trained on future, expanded datasets can be developed. Yet even this initial model makes specific predictions concerning potentially effective combinatorial therapeutics that should be verified experimentally. Furthermore, our analysis provides an avenue for further research into the basic science of bone healing by demonstrating agents that appear to be linked in function."
https://openalex.org/W4307800273,"Tiktok is a social media platform with many adolescent and young adult users. Food, nutrition, and weight-related posts are popular on TikTok, yet there is little understanding of the content of these posts, and whether nutrition-related content is presented by experts. The objective was to identify key themes in food, nutrition, and weight-related posts on TikTok. 1000 TikTok videos from 10 popular nutrition, food, and weight-related hashtags each with over 1 billion views were downloaded and analyzed using template analysis. The one-hundred most viewed videos were downloaded from each of the ten chosen hashtags. Two coders then coded each video for key themes. Key themes included the glorification of weight loss in many posts, the positioning of food to achieve health and thinness, and the lack of expert voices providing nutrition information. The majority of posts presented a weight-normative view of health, with less than 3% coded as weight-inclusive. Most posts were created by white, female adolescents and young adults. Nutrition-related content on TikTok is largely weight normative, and may contribute to disordered eating behaviors and body dissatisfaction in the young people that are TikTok’s predominant users. Helping users discern credible nutrition information, and eliminate triggering content from their social media feeds may be strategies to address the weight-normative social media content that is so prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W4307832431,"An extensive rearing system (ERS) for poultry requires an outdoor run, which enhances the foraging activity of chickens. Slow-growing (SG) strains are more adapted to ERS than fast-growing (FG); and generally, have higher levels of bioactive compounds in their meat. The aim of this paper was to assess the storage efficiency of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), tocols and carotenes in the meat of seven commercial SG genotypes (SG1-7). One hundred SG chicks/strain of both sexes were included and their walking activity (High- or Low-W) was classified: SG1-4, HW comprised more than 10% of the time budget, and SG5-7, less than 10% (LW). Chickens were reared in pens (4 pens/strain) with indoor (0.10 m 2 /bird) and outdoor (4 m 2 /bird) areas, and they were fed the same diet ad libitum (starter feed for 1–21 d, grower feed from 22 d to slaughter at 81 d). The chickens were weighed weekly; feed consumption and grass intake were also estimated. At 81 days of age, 32 chickens/genotype were selected on the basis of the average weight (1:1, M:F) and slaughtered. The breast, thigh and drumstick meat were excised from 30 carcasses/genotype, sampled and stored at -20°C until analysis. Nutrients (e.g., n-3, n-6, carotenes and tocols) of feed, grass and meat were analyzed. The storage efficiency of nutrients was estimated as the ratio between the amount deposited in the body muscles (OUT) and the dietary intake (feed and grass, IN). The genotype affected chickens foraging behavior and the intake of nutrients. For SG1, SG2 and SG3, more than 50% of the intake of n-3 came from grass, whereas in the other genotypes, less than 20%. Accordingly, chickens that foraged more showed better meat nutritional profiles (less fat, more n-3 and antioxidants), which, in ERS, was ascribed to grass ingestion. However, the storage efficiency of nutrients into meat was inversely correlated with the grass intake: strains with higher grass intake (SG1, SG2, and SG3) had lower storage rates. Several hypotheses were proposed to explain these trends."
https://openalex.org/W4307832531,"Background Understanding the perspectives of the key players in the community regarding female genital cutting (FGC) is very important for directing preventive programs. Religious leaders help shape community behaviors, which is highly pertinent in the case of FGC as it is frequently perceived to be a religious requirement. This study assesses religious leaders’ knowledge, attitudes, and positions towards FGC in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. It included a purposive sample of 147 local religious leaders ( khateebs ) representing the three governorates of Erbil, Sulaimaniyah, and Duhok. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data about the religious leaders’ knowledge, attitude, and position towards FGC. Results The participants identified reduction of the sexual desire of women as the main benefit (37%) and risk (24%) of FGC. Cultural tradition and religious requirements were the main reported reasons for practicing FGC. About 59% of the religious leaders stated that people ask for their advice on FGC. Around 14% of the participants supported performing FGC, compared to 39.1% who opposed it. Religious (73.9%) and cultural (26.1%) rationales were the main reasons given for supporting FGC. Being a cultural practice with harmful effects (53.5%) and lack of clear religious evidence (46.6%) were the main reasons for being against FGC. Around 52% of the participants recommended banning FGC by law, while 43.5% did not support banning it. A statistically significant association (P = 0.015) was found between religious leaders’ residence and their position on performing FGC. More than 46% of those residing in Duhok were against performing FGC, compared to lower proportions in Erbil (38.8%) and Sulaimaniyah (30%). Conclusion Religious leaders believed that cultural tradition was the main reason behind practicing FGC and they believed that FGC is not common in KRI, and even that it is decreasing. The religious leaders in our study reported that they could have an influential role in the FGC issue due to their position in the community. There was no statistically significant association between religious leaders’ age, education level, or work experience and their position on performing FGC. However, a statistically significant association was found between religious leaders’ residence and their position on performing FGC. A conclusive decision concerning the prohibition of FGC needs to be made by religious authorities. Health awareness activities incorporating FGC risks should be carried out to inform religious leaders at different levels of religious positions. Further research exploring perspectives of religious authorities concerning religious leaders’ inconclusive judgment about FGC is deemed necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4307832570,"Background Treatment options for many cancers include immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy and combination therapy with impressive clinical benefit across cancers. We sought to define the comparative cardiac risks of ICI combination and monotherapy. Methods We used VigiBase, the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, to identify cardiac ADRs (cADRs), such as carditis, heart failure, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and valvular dysfunction, related to ICI therapy. To explore possible relationships, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) as a proxy of relative risk. A lower bound of a 95% confidence interval of ROR &gt; 1 reflects a disproportionality signal that more ADRs are observed than expected due to chance. Results We found 2278 cADR for ICI monotherapy and 353 for ICI combination therapy. Combination therapy was associated with significantly higher odds of carditis (ROR 6.9, 95% CI: 5.6–8.3) versus ICI monotherapy (ROR 5.0, 95% CI: 4.6–5.4). Carditis in ICI combination therapy was fatal in 23.4% of reported ADRs, compared to 15.8% for ICI monotherapy (P = 0.058). Conclusions Using validated pharmacovigilance methodology, we found increased odds of carditis for all ICI therapies, with the highest odds for combination therapy. Given the substantial risk of severe ADR and death, clinicians should consider these findings when prescribing checkpoint inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4307832612,"We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of shift patterns at work on gynecologic problems and the healthcare behavior of Korean nursing staff. We conducted a web-based survey for over two weeks in September 2021, involving female nursing staff, including nurses, nurses' aides, and nursing assistants, working in five medical centers. The questionnaire included 40 questions on baseline characteristics, working information, and experiences with gynecologic problems and medical approaches. Overall, 885 nursing staffs participated in the survey, of the 1,904 who received the invitation with an online link of the survey. The response rate was 46.5%. Among the participants responding to all questions, 569 (64.4%) worked two or three shifts and 305 (34.5%) worked full-time. In women rotating two or three-shift patterns, irregular menstrual cycles (21.6% vs. 13.8%, p = 0.005), abnormal menstrual cycles (40.9% vs. 33.8%, p = 0.038), and dysmenorrhea (48.0% vs. 38.4%, p = 0.006) were more frequent than in those who worked full-time. The experience of visiting gynecologic clinics (47.5% vs. 44.1%, p = 0.332) and treating gynecologic conditions (33.4% vs. 29.3%, p = 0.211) did not differ according to the working patterns. However, diagnosis of gynecologic diseases was more frequent in women working full-time (36.4% vs. 29.7%, p = 0.043). The rates of screening (76.1% vs. 57.8%, p<0.001) and human papillomavirus vaccination (55.7% vs. 39.9%, p<0.001) for cervical cancer prevention were higher in women working full-time than in two-three shifts. This study showed that rotating shift work may be related to an increase in gynecologic problems and a decrease in cancer prevention activity among female nursing staff."
https://openalex.org/W4307838844,"Abstract Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the usage of cholesterol-lowering agents seemed to have no benefit in CRC patients. In this study, we focused on the cholesterol-nuclear receptors (NRs) axis as a strategy. Cholesterol and its derivatives work as ligands for different nuclear receptors, thus promoting cancer progression. The key NR downstream of cholesterol in CRC is unknown. Here, we treated CRC cells with a cholesterol-lowering agent and lipoprotein-depleted conditioned medium, and then detected the change of the putative NRs. The results revealed that RORα/γ (Retinoic acid receptor-related Orphan Receptor α/γ) levels exhibited the most obvious increases in CRC cells subjected them to cholesterol deprivation. RORα/γ agonists significantly inhibited CRC cells proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. Also, RORα/γ overexpression repressed CRC cells proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo and RORα/γ knockdown promoted it. Mechanistically, RORα/γ agonists promoted c-myc degradation by activating the transcription of the ubiquitinase NEDD4. Intriguingly, the combination of RORα/γ agonists and atorvastatin had a synergistic effect on inhibiting CRC cells. These findings demonstrate that the cholesterol- RORα/γ axis is important for maintaining c-myc protein levels. Combination therapy with atorvastatin and RORα/γ agonist is a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC."

https://openalex.org/W4307851579,"Floating objects play a pivotal role in pelagic ecosystems by serving as shelters, meeting points, cleaning stations, nurseries, and feeding grounds. The abundance of these objects is increasing globally in the form of flotsam, plastics, discarded or lost fishing gear, and fish aggregating devices (FADs) deployed by commercial fisheries. However, it is difficult to measure how often and in what ways fish interact with floating objects in pelagic environments. Dolphinfish ( Coryphaena hippurus ) is prevalent among the fish species that associate with floating objects, but the extent to which dolphinfish utilize them is unclear. This study applies existing knowledge of FAD-associated dolphinfish diving behavior to identify periods of potential association with floating objects in a remote telemetry dataset of 23 fish with a total of 678 days at liberty spanning two distinct regions within the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Fish inhabiting waters off the western coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico spent significantly more time exhibiting behavior indicative of association with floating objects than those off the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico. When not exhibiting this behavior, dolphinfish in both regions occupied similar vertical habitats, with western Baja fish utilizing more of the water column than Oaxaca fish. Observed regional differences in behavior were coincident with regional differences in size (Oaxaca fish fork lengths ranged from 103 to 118 cm (mean = 110 cm), while Baja fish ranged from 85 to 106 cm (mean = 93 cm)). Although larger fish in the Baja region displayed behavior consistent with smaller Baja fish, future studies should investigate whether the observed regional differences are due to (i) size, (ii) sex, (iii) oceanography, or (iv) availability of floating objects. Dolphinfish are an important mid-trophic level predator and potentially sustainable fishery resource. Understanding their behavior and use of floating objects is of both ecological and economic importance–particularly in the context of expanding international FAD-based fisheries. Our study suggests dolphinfish spend a large amount of their time exhibiting potential floating object associated behavior, and this could influence their population structure and growth."
https://openalex.org/W4307699243,"Prophylactic transarterial chemoembolization (p-TACE) is frequently conducted for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China, but the question of who could benefit from it remains controversial. Hence, we wanted to establish a nomogram model to identify patients eligible for p-TACE.Data from HCC patients receiving R0 resection with or without p-TACE between January 2013 and December 2014 were identified, using primary liver cancer big data, to establish a nomogram model to predict overall survival (OS). Based on the model, Patients receiving R0 resection between January 2015 and December 2015 were divided into three subgroups, and survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test among patients in each subgroup.A nomogram integrating the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, AFP, tumor diameter, and microvascular invasion was developed to predict the OS of patients with HCC receiving R0 resection, and significant differences were observed in the median OS of the subgroups of low-risk (≤20), intermediate-risk (20~120), and high-risk (>120) identified by the current model. This model showed good calibration and discriminatory power in the validation cohort and the external cohort (c-index of 0.669 and 0.676, respectively). In the external cohort, the Kaplan-Meier curves showed that p-TACE could only significantly prolong the median OS of high-risk patients (25.6 vs. 33.7 months, P<0.05), but no differences were observed in any subgroups stratified by the current staging systems (all P>0.05).This readily available nomogram model could help guide decisions about p-TACE, but it needs further validation."
https://openalex.org/W4307699307,"Acute blast or gunshot wounds have a negative effect on the patients' health related quality of life (HRQoL). No validated instrument exists to assess the HRQoL of patients with such wounds. Therefore, we aimed to test and validate a subscale of an existing HRQoL instrument among patients with acute blast or gunshot wounds.We used data from a randomized controlled trial comparing negative pressure wound therapy with standard treatment of civilian adults with acute extremity blast or gunshot wounds. We evaluated the reliability (internal consistency, stability) and validity of the body subscale of the Wound QoL instrument using the World Health Organisation 20 question self-reporting questionnaire as gold standard.A total of 152 participants were included in the study. The participants were predominantly (93.4%) male, and median age was 29.0 years (IQR 21.0-34.0). The internal consistency was acceptable while a test-retest analysis indicated instability in the Wound QoL instrument. The content validity of the instrument was considered satisfactory; however, the criterion validity was found to be insufficient.Our results indicate that Wound QoL is a promising instrument for the assessment of wound specific HRQoL among patients with acute blast or gunshot wounds. Further testing and validation is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4307699373,"Background In resource-limited countries such as Ethiopia, tuberculosis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with the human immunodeficiency virus. In the era of antiretroviral therapy, the effect of tuberculosis on the survival of patients who are living with human immunodeficiency virus has been poorly understood in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of active tuberculosis on the survival of HIV-infected adult patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy in public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 566 participants from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2018. The collected data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 before being exported to Stata version 14 for analysis. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the effect of active tuberculosis on the survival of HIV-infected adult patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy, and a p-value less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence level were used to declare statistical significance. Result Of the 566 patients included in the study, 76 died. The mortality rate was 11.04 per 100 person-years in tuberculosis co-infected patients, while it was 2.52 per 100 person-years in non-tuberculosis co-infected patients. The patients with tuberculosis co-infection had a 2.19 times higher hazard of death (AHR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.17, 4.12) compared to those without tuberculosis. Advanced clinical stage, low CD4+ cell count, and previous episodes of an opportunistic infection other than tuberculosis were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion Co-infection with tuberculosis at antiretroviral therapy initiation increases the hazard of death approximately two-fold. Hence, we recommend key organizations to enhance the region’s collaborative interventional and preventative strategies for TB and HIV."
https://openalex.org/W4307699515,"Much has been claimed on the health benefits of alkaline water including metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its features with scarcity of scientific evidence. Methods: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted to determine whether regular consumption of alkaline water confers health advantage on blood metabolites, anthropometric measures, sleep quality and muscle strength among postmenopausal women. A total of 304 community-dwelling postmenopausal women were recruited with comparable proportion of regular drinkers of alkaline water and non-drinkers. Participants were ascertained on dietary intake, lifestyle factors, anthropometric and biochemical measurements. Diagnosis of MetS was made according to Joint Interim Statement definition. A total of 47.7% of the participants met MS criteria, with a significant lower proportion of MetS among the alkaline water drinkers. The observed lower fasting plasma glucose (F(1,294) = 24.20, p = 0.025, partial η2 = 0.435), triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein concentration ratio (F(1,294) = 21.06, p = 0.023, partial η2 = 0.360), diastolic blood pressure (F(1,294) = 7.85, p = 0.046, partial η2 = 0.258) and waist circumference (F(1,294) = 9.261, p = 0.038, partial η2 = 0.263) in the alkaline water drinkers could be considered as favourable outcomes of regular consumption of alkaline water. In addition, water alkalization improved duration of sleep (F(1,294) = 32.05, p = 0.007, partial η2 = 0.451) and handgrip strength F(1,294) = 27.51, p = 0.011, partial η2 = 0.448). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (F(1,294) = 1.772, p = 0.287, partial η2 = 0.014), body weight (F(1,294) = 1.985, p = 0.145, partial η2 = 0.013) and systolic blood pressure (F(1,294) = 1.656, p = 0.301, partial η2 = 0.010) were comparable between the two different water drinking behaviours. In conclusion, drinking adequate of water is paramount for public health with access to good quality drinking water remains a critical issue. While consumption of alkaline water may be considered as a source of easy-to implement lifestyle to modulate metabolic features, sleep duration and muscle strength, further studies are warranted for unravelling the precise mechanism of alkaline water consumption on the improvement and prevention of MetS and its individual features, muscle strength and sleep duration as well as identification of full spectrum of individuals that could benefit from its consumption."
https://openalex.org/W4307699520,"Healthcare, like other industries, is increasingly using smart technologies, which also include intelligent/smart wayfinding navigation. The focus of this article, as part of the research project (its second step), was to analyze the economic effectiveness of the introduction of the wayfinding system in a local hospital in the Czech Republic. In the first phase/step of the project, possible variants of the solution were identified, verification of possible functioning, and a questionnaire survey was conducted among employees and patients regarding the waste of time in search of destination and preferences of various forms of navigation. Based on the above, it was decided to develop our own mobile application. To determine the effectiveness of this method of implementation of the new system, economic verification was used by the cost-benefit analysis method. Although the use of this method has not been required in the implementation of funded projects within the European Union since 2021, it was chosen for clarifying the pros and cons in many both investment and non-investment projects. In addition to the net present value calculation, the benefit cost ratio, profitability index, and payback period were used for evaluation. The time saving of medical staff, calculated on the basis of a questionnaire survey in the hospital (the first step of the project), was used as a benefit. The costs used were the salaries paid out in the research project, the investment, and the operating costs over the lifetime of the navigation system, which is estimated at eleven years. Using the above indicators, the implementation of the navigation system was found to be effective, despite the initial high costs. Based on these results, as part of the third step of the project, the navigation system will be implemented in the given hospital-the testing phase was taking place in the last quarter of 2021, and the full implementation is expected during the 2022."

The quality of cattle wastewater (CWW) treated by ozonation, the water requirement and its effect on the growth of seedlings of Dalbergia nigra cultivated with sewage sludge were determined under different light conditions. The study was carried out in a split plot scheme with 2 shading levels (0%-C1, and 49.4% attenuation-C2) and 3 types of irrigation water (control-T1, 1 h ozonation-T2, and 2 h-T3), with 4 repetitions. Direct sowing was realized into 280 cm3 tubes which were irrigated by drip irrigation with automatic management. The height and collar diameter were measured every 21 days, and at the end of the nursery phase, and the Dickson quality index (DQI) and irrigation water productivity (WPir) were determined. In addition, seedlings were transplanted in a forest restauration area (FRA) of Atlantic Forest, with height and diameter monitoring for 200 days. With ozonation, there was an increase in pH and a reduction in electrical conductivity, total solids and turbidity in the CWW, allowing its use for irrigation of forest seedlings. The maximum volumes of water applied were 2.096 and 1.921 L plant-1, with water supply T2 and T1, respectively, and coverages C1 and C2. In these conditions, the seedlings reached DQI of 0.47 and 0.17, and WPir of 2.35 and 1.48 g L-1, respectively. The initial vegetative growth of the seedlings planted in the FRA was benefited by the nutrients provided by the CWW treated. Therefore, the use of sewage sludge and CWW treated has the potential to produce forest seedlings, reducing the release of waste and effluents into the environment."
https://openalex.org/W4307715170,"Since several years, whiteflies of the species complex of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) are causing several damages on vegetable crops in Côte d'Ivoire. These sap-sucking insects are the main vector of many viruses on tomato and several species of this complex have developed resistances against insecticides. Nevertheless, there is very little information about whitefly species on vegetable crops in Côte d'Ivoire. Here, we investigated the species diversity and their genetic diversity and structuring on samples from vegetable crops in the major tomato production areas of Côte d'Ivoire. To assess this diversity, 535 whitefly samples from different localities and plant species were collected and analysed with nuclear (microsatellite) and mitochondrial (mtCOI) markers. In each site, and ecological data were recorded, including whiteflies abundance and plant species colonised by B. tabaci. The analysis of mtCOI sequences of whiteflies indicated the presence of four cryptic species on tomato and associated crops in Côte d'Ivoire. These were MED ASL, MED Q1, SSA 1 and SSA3. The MED ASL species dominated over all samples in the different regions and plant species. One haplotype of MED ASL out of the 15 identified predominated on most plant species and most sites. These results suggested that MED ASL is probably the main phytovirus vector in the Ivorian vegetable cropping areas. In contrast, only five haplotypes of MED Q1 were identified on vegetables but in the cotton-growing areas of the country. Its low prevalence, low nuclear and mitochondrial diversity might indicate a recent invasion of this species on vegetable crops in Côte d'Ivoire. The Bayesian nuclear analysis indicated the presence of hybrid genotypes between the two main species MED ASL and MED Q1, however in low prevalence (10%). All these results highlight the need to maintain whitefly populations monitoring for a more effective management in Côte d'Ivoire."
https://openalex.org/W4307715239,"Background Although low-middle income countries have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is scarce information about the impact of long COVID on their population. This study aimed to evaluate long COVID symptomatology, complications (hospital readmission and metabolic disorders), and main clinical features that impact Quality of Life (QoL). Methods This cross-sectional study provides a detailed clinical and laboratory picture of individuals who presented residual symptoms after mild to severe acute COVID-19. Between Aug-2020 to Sep-2021, long COVID patients were evaluated in a reference center for long COVID in Bahia State, Brazil. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire accessed QoL. Results A total of 1164 (52 ±13.4 years, 57% female, 88% black/mixed-race) were evaluated 2.3 [IQR = 1.6–3.7] months after mild (n = 351, 30.2%), moderate (338, 29.0%) or severe (475, 40.8%) acute illness. Dyspnea (790, 67.9%), fatigue (738, 63.5%), and chest pain (525, 42.9%) were the most frequent residual symptoms regardless of acute severity, affecting the QoL of 88.9% of patients (n/N—826/925), mainly the domains of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. High levels of HbA1c were detected for 175 out of 664 patients (26.6%), 40% of them without a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Of note, hospital admission one-to-three months after the acute phase of disease was required for 51 (4.4%) patients. Conclusion In this majority-black/mixed-race population, long COVID was associated with post-acute hospitalization, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and decreased QoL, particularly in women and regardless of disease severity of acute infection, suggesting important implications for health care system."
https://openalex.org/W4307715252,"Household screening is common when information about characteristics of household members is needed for selection of survey respondents. When key characteristics have a low prevalence, or are oversampled, this can result in a large number of sampled households screened, many of which have no persons selected. For in-person surveys this can be inefficient and costly, especially in an environment of declining response. A multimode design using a mail, push-to-web approach is an attractive alternative due to lower cost and high internet penetration. However, little is known about the comparable data quality properties between in-person and web modes. While in-person screening is considered a gold standard approach, respondents may fail to report household members and interviewers may unintentionally screen out reluctant respondents. Similarly, those self-responding sometimes fail to report unrelated household members or young children. In this study we compared in-person and web screening in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Households were randomly selected to complete a self-administered web screener and subsequently be screened by an interviewer during an in-person visit. We report on the comparability of household characteristics between modes to determine if web screening provides data equivalent to in-person screening. We examine time between the web and in-person screening to see if true change can account for differences. In the presence of conflicting data, we examine selection criteria based on the screening responses to see how inaccuracies affect selection status, or if inaccuracies or person omissions are systematically related to a specific mode. Approximately 93% (80/86) of households agreed on selection status between the web and in-person modes. Household composition matched fully for 84% (72/86) of households. These results indicate that web screening is a viable option enumerating households in population surveys."
https://openalex.org/W4307832410,"To support studies of neuropeptide neuromodulation, I have studied beta-arrestin binding sites (BBS’s) by evaluating the incidence of BBS sequences among the C terminal tails (CTs) of each of the 49 Drosophila melanogaster neuropeptide GPCRs. BBS were identified by matches with a prediction derived from structural analysis of rhodopsin:arrestin and vasopressin receptor: arrestin complexes [1]. To increase the rigor of the identification, I determined the conservation of BBS sequences between two long-diverged species D . melanogaster and D . virilis . There is great diversity in the profile of BBS’s in this group of GPCRs. I present evidence for conserved BBS’s in a majority of the Drosophila neuropeptide GPCRs; notably some have no conserved BBS sequences. In addition, certain GPCRs display numerous conserved compound BBS’s, and many GPCRs display BBS-like sequences in their intracellular loop (ICL) domains as well. Finally, 20 of the neuropeptide GPCRs are expressed as protein isoforms that vary in their CT domains. BBS profiles are typically different across related isoforms suggesting a need to diversify and regulate the extent and nature of GPCR:arrestin interactions. This work provides the initial basis to initiate future in vivo , genetic analyses in Drosophila to evaluate the roles of arrestins in neuropeptide GPCR desensitization, trafficking and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4307832421,"Background Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes exist, but whether in-hospital care explains this difference is not known. We sought to determine racial and ethnic differences in demographics, comorbidities, in-hospital treatments, and in-hospital outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods and findings This was a cohort study using MiCOVID-19, a multi-center, retrospective, collaborative quality improvement registry, which included data on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 38 hospitals in the State of Michigan. 2,639 adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at a site participating in the MiCOVID-19 Registry were randomly selected. Outcomes included in-hospital mortality, age at death, intensive care unit admission, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation by race and ethnicity. Baseline comorbidities differed by race and ethnicity. In addition, Black patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, creatine phosphokinase, and ferritin levels. Black patients were less likely to receive dexamethasone and remdesivir compared with White patients (4.2% vs 14.3% and 2.2% vs. 11.8%, p &lt; 0.001 for each). Black (18.7%) and White (19.6%) patients experienced greater mortality compared with Asian (13.0%) and Latino (5.9%) patients (p &lt; 0.01). The mean age at death was significantly lower by 8 years for Black patients (69.4 ± 13.3 years) compared with White (77.9 ± 12.6), Asian (77.6 ± 6.6), and Latino patients (77.4 ± 15.5) (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions COVID-19 mortality appears to be driven by both pre-hospitalization clinical and social factors and potentially in-hospital care. Policies aimed at population health and equitable application of evidence-based medical therapy are needed to alleviate the burden of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4307832530,"Athletic performance data are modeled in an effort to better understand the relationship between both hours spent training and a measurement of ""commitment"" to that training, and improvements in performance. Both increased training time and greater commitment were predicted to produce larger increases in performance improvement, and commitment was predicted to be the more important determinant of improvement. The performance of 108 soccer players (ages 9-18) was quantified over a 10-week training program. Hours spent training ranged from 16 to 90 during the course of the study, while commitment scores ranged from 0.55 to 2.00, based on a scale from 0.00 to 2.40. A model selection approach was used to discriminate among models specifying relationships between training hours and improvement, and commitment and improvement. Despite considerable variability in the data, results provided strong evidence for an increase in performance improvement with both training hours and commitment score. The best models for hours and commitment were directly compared by computing an evidence ratio of 5799, indicating much stronger evidence favoring the model based on commitment. Results of analyses such as these go beyond anecdotal experience in an effort to establish a formal evidentiary basis for athletic training programs."
https://openalex.org/W4307832598,"Accentuated-eccentric loading (AEL) takes advantage of the high force producing potential of eccentric muscle contractions, potentially maximising mechanical tension within the muscle. However, evidence is lacking on how AEL squatting may load the involved musculature, limiting scientifically justified programming recommendations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of concentric and eccentric loads on joint loading and muscle activity of the lower limbs.Resistance trained males performed traditional squatting (20-100% of concentric one-repetition maximum [1RM]) and AEL squatting with eccentric loads (110-150% of 1RM) provided by a novel motorised isotonic resistance machine (Kineo). Kinetics and kinematics of the hip, knee, and ankle joints were collected, with electromyography from the gluteus maximus, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius medialis. A secondary cohort underwent a kinematic and electromyography analysis of squatting technique to compare Kineo and back and front barbell squatting.Knee joint peak eccentric moments occurred at 120% 1RM (P = 0.045), with no further increase thereafter. As eccentric load increased, the time course of moment development occurred earlier in the eccentric phase. This resulted in a 37% increase in eccentric knee extensor work from the 80% 1RM trial to the 120% 1RM trial (P<0.001). Neither hip nor ankle joints displayed further change in kinetics as eccentric load increased above 100% 1RM. Electromyographic activity during traditional squatting was ~15-30% lower in all eccentric trials than in concentric trials for all muscles. EMG plateaued between a load of 80-100% 1RM during the eccentric trials and did not increase with AEL. No significant differences in kinematics were found between Kineo and barbell squatting.The knee extensors appear to be preferentially loaded during AEL squatting. The greater work performed during the eccentric phase of the squat as eccentric load increased suggests greater total mechanical tension could be the cause of adaptations from AEL. Our data suggest that AEL should be programmed with a load of 120% of 1RM. Further studies are needed to confirm the longer-term training effects of AEL."
https://openalex.org/W4307832610,"Introduction Obtaining a tenure track faculty position (TTFP) after postdoctoral appointment (PDA) completion is considered an indicator of successful transition to independence (TTI). Whether cross-institutional mobility (CIM)—moving to a different institution from that of the PDA—contributes to TTI is unclear, as data evaluating retention and mobility is lacking. We tested the hypothesis that, for postdocs (PDs) at R1 institutions, CIM is a significant predictor of successful TTI defined as TTFP-status 3 years post-PDA. Materials and methods Using University of Pittsburgh data for health sciences PDs we tested the association of CIM at PDA completion (moved to a different institution (CIM = 1) or retained at Pitt (CIM = 0)) with TTFP-status 3 years post-PDA (TTFP, non-TTFP, or left faculty position) using multinomial logistic regression models. Results Among all 622 Pitt PDs, 3-year retention in a faculty position at Pitt was 21%, while 14% had a faculty position outside of Pitt. Among the analytic sample of PDs with an academic career outcome during the study period (N = 238; 50% women, 8% underrepresented minorities (URM)), at baseline PDA completion 39% moved to a different institution (CIM = 1), and 61% remained at Pitt (CIM = 0) in any job type. Those with CIM = 1 had greater odds of having a TTFP at follow-up than those with CIM = 0 [adjusted OR (95% CI): 4.4 (2.1, 9.2)]. Discussion One fifth of Pitt PDs were retained by Pitt as faculty. While Pitt PDs were equally likely to get a faculty position whether they were retained at Pitt or left, those who left had greater odds of obtaining a TTFP. Future work with longer follow-up times, expanded markers of TTI, and samples from other R1 institutions is needed to better understand the reason for these results. This knowledge can lead to better support for the next generation of PDs as they successfully transition to faculty."

The present study aimed to explore and explain the process of aging perception during menopausal transition. This study was a qualitative grounded theory research, which was going to be implemented in 2019–2020 on 18 Baluch women settled in the Sistan &amp; Baluchestan province in South-East Iran and among midlife or older menopause experienced women. Sampling was started first by Purposive sampling, and then it was performed with theoretic sampling. Data analysis was performed according to Corbin and Straus’s approach (2015) in four phases: (1) identifying and developing concepts; (2) analyzing data for the context; (3) entering the process stage into analysis; and (4) integrating categories to build a theory. In this study, seven main categories were obtained: “Sunset of youth”, “aging as the other side of the coin of menopause”, “Weaving a cocoon”, “aging as a mental trap”, “social acceptance”, “aging domino”, and “feeling of transcendence”. It seems that menopause plays an important role in Baluch women’s view toward aging. The practical results of this study can be applied to better understand the middle-aged and older Baluch women’s attitudes toward aging. Also study shows a new evolutionary and situational perspective on the lives of middle-aged menopausal Baluch women. Baluch women in menopause accept the sunset of youth and look forward to experiencing the Feeling of transcendence. Identify and respond to their needs by developing and establishing health policies to change their negative attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W4307832631,"The effects of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) on the tooth development of infected children are not well known. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of CZS with dental alterations in children with microcephaly seen at a referral hospital in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The chronology and sequence of tooth eruption and the presence of dental alterations were evaluated by a single calibrated examiner (kappa > 0.80) in 62 children aged 7 to 35 months with microcephaly associated with CZS and other congenital infections. Medical data of the mother and child were collected from the records and the parents responded to a socioeconomic questionnaire. Descriptive analysis and Fisher's exact test were used (5% significance level). The mean age of the children was 26.4 months (SD = 7.52). The mean weight and head circumference at birth were 2,593 g (SD = 0.60) and 29.6 cm (SD = 2.48), respectively. Microcephaly was associated with congenital Zika virus infection in 79% of cases and with other congenital infections in 21%. No significant association was found between CZS and alterations in the chronology (p = 1.00) or sequence of tooth eruption (p = 0.16) or changes in enamel development (p = 1.00). In conclusion, children with microcephaly exhibit a delay and alterations in the sequence of tooth eruption of primary teeth, as well as developmental defects of enamel, which are not associated with Zika virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W4307832779,"Group antenatal care (G-ANC), an alternative to focused ANC (F-ANC), involves grouping mothers by gestational and maternal age. In high-income countries, G-ANC has been associated with improved utilization of health care services like Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV services. Some low-resource countries with poor utilization of health care services have piloted G-ANC. However, there is limited evidence of its efficiency. We, therefore, compared G-ANC versus F-ANC with regards to optimal utilization of PMTCT of HIV services and assessed associated factors thereof among adolescent mothers in eastern Uganda. We defined optimal utilization of PMTCT of HIV services as the adolescent being up to date with HIV counseling and testing. If found HIV negative, subsequent timely re-testing. If found HIV positive, initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) under option B plus for the mother. While for the infant, it entailed safe delivery, testing, feeding, and appropriate HIV chemotherapy.From February to April 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional study among 528 adolescent mothers in four sites in eastern Uganda. We assessed the optimal utilization of PMTCT of HIV services among adolescent mothers that had attended G-ANC versus F-ANC at the post-natal care or immunization clinics. We also assessed the factors associated with optimal utilization of PMTCT of HIV services among these mothers.Optimal utilization of PMTCT was higher among those in G-ANC than in F-ANC (74.7% vs 41.2, p-0.0162). There was a statistically significant association between having attended G-ANC and optimal utilization of PMTCT [PR = 1.080, 95%CI (1.067-1.093)]. Other factors independently associated with optimal utilization were; having a partner that tested for HIV [PR = 1.075, 95%CI (1.048-1.103)], trimester of first ANC visit: second trimester [PR = 0.929, 95%CI (0.902-0.957)] and third trimester [PR = 0.725, 95%CI (0.616-0.853)], and the health facility attended: Bugembe HCIV [PR = 1.126, 95%CI (1.113-1.139)] and Jinja regional referral hospital [PR = 0.851, 95%CI (0.841-0.861].Adolescent mothers under G-ANC had significantly higher optimal utilization of PMTCT of HIV services compared to those under F-ANC. We recommend that the Ministry of Health considers widely implementing G-ANC, especially for adolescent mothers."
https://openalex.org/W4307851524,"Extracting life history information from mineralized hard tissues of extant and extinct species is an ongoing challenge in evolutionary and conservation studies. Primary lamellar bone is a mineralized tissue with multidien periodicity that begins deposition prenatally and continues until adulthood albeit with concurrent resorption, thus maintaining a record spanning several years of an individual's life. Here, we use field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis to measure the relative concentrations of calcium, phosphorous, oxygen, magnesium and sodium in the femora of seven rhesus macaque with known medical and life-history information. We find that the concentration of these elements distinguishes parous from nulliparous females; that in females calcium and phosphorus are lower in bone formed during reproductive events; and that significant differences in relative magnesium concentration correlate with breastfeeding in infants."
https://openalex.org/W4307966130,"Colorectal cancer causes >900,000 deaths every year and a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease will contribute to improve its clinical management and survival. Myosin Vb (MYO5B) regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking, and inactivation of this myosin disrupts the polarization and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells causing microvillous inclusion disease (MVID), a rare congenital disorder characterized by intractable life-threatening diarrhea. Here, we show that the loss Myosin Vb interfered with the differentiation/polarization of colorectal cancer cells. Although modulation of Myosin Vb expression did not affect the proliferation of colon cancer cells, MYO5B inactivation increased their migration, invasion, and metastatic potential. Moreover, Myo5b inactivation in an intestine-specific knockout mouse model caused a >15-fold increase in the number of azoxymethane-initiated small intestinal tumors. Consistently, reduced expression of Myosin Vb in a cohort of 155 primary colorectal tumors was associated with shorter patient survival. In conclusion, we show here that loss of Myosin Vb reduces polarization/differentiation of colon cancer cells while enhancing their metastatic potential, demonstrating a tumor suppressor function for this myosin. Moreover, reduced expression of Myosin Vb in primary tumors identifies a subset of poor prognosis colorectal cancer patients that could benefit from more aggressive therapeutic regimens."
