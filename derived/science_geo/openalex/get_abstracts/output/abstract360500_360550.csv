https://openalex.org/W2103108890,"Glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTπ) is a marker protein in many cancers and high levels are linked to drug resistance, even when the selecting drug is not a substrate. S-Glutathionylation of proteins is critical to cellular stress response, but characteristics of the forward reaction are not known. Our results show that GSTπ potentiates S-glutathionylation reactions following oxidative and nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Mutational analysis indicated that the catalytic activity of GST is required. GSTπ is itself redox-regulated. S-Glutathionylation on Cys47 and Cys101 autoregulates GSTπ, breaks ligand binding interactions with c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and causes GSTπ multimer formation, all critical to stress response. Catalysis of S-glutathionylation at low pK cysteines in proteins is a novel property for GSTπ and may be a cause for its abundance in tumors and cells resistant to a range of mechanistically unrelated anticancer drugs."

We have reported that SPARC-null mice accumulate significantly more fat than wild-type mice and maintain relatively high levels of serum leptin. We now show that SPARC inhibits adipogenesis in vitro. Specifically, recombinant SPARC inhibited (a) adipocyte differentiation of stromal-vascular cells isolated from murine white adipose tissue and (b) the expression of adipogenic transcription factors and adipocyte-specific genes. SPARC induced the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin and subsequently enhanced the interaction of β-catenin and T cell/lymphoid enhancer factor 1. The activity of integrin-linked kinase was required for the effect of SPARC on β-catenin accumulation as well as extracellular matrix remodeling. During adipogenesis, fusiform preadipocytes change into sphere-shaped adipocytes and convert the extracellular matrix from a fibronectin-rich stroma to a laminin-rich basal lamina. SPARC retarded the morphological changes exhibited by preadipocytes during differentiation. In the presence of SPARC, the deposition of fibronectin was enhanced, and that of laminin was inhibited; in parallel, the expression of α5 integrin was enhanced, and that of α6 integrin was inhibited. Lithium chloride, which enhances the accumulation of β-catenin, also inhibited the expression of α6 integrin. These findings demonstrate a role for SPARC in adipocyte morphogenesis and in signaling processes leading to terminal differentiation.

Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States because of its high prevalence and causal relationship to many medical complications, including diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease, cancer, gallbladder disease, liver disease, arthritis, pulmonary complications, sleep disorders, and premature death. Obesity is characterized by excessive accumulation of white adipose tissue (WAT, 3The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; ECM, extracellular matrix; GM, growth medium; WT, wild type; C/EBPα, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; TCF/LEF, T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; LN, laminin; FN, fibronectin; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; GPDH, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RUNX2, runt-related transcription factor 2; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; SVC, stromal-vascular cell; RT, reverse transcription. fat). The cellular composition of WAT includes primarily adipocytes and preadipocytes as well as endothelial cells and macrophages. Obesity is the result of both over-proliferation (number) and overgrowth (size) of adipocytes. Adipocytes are not only the storage depots of energy but also the source of various cytokines and hormones. These so-called adipokines, e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, target the central nervous system and peripheral tissues (fat, liver, and muscle) to modulate energy metabolism (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, 2Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) belongs to the family of matricellular proteins, which generally do not contribute to the structure of extracellular matrix (ECM) but regulate its interaction with cells. SPARC is typically anti-adhesive in vitro and regulates angiogenesis and collagen production/fibrillogenesis in vivo. It is also a major participant in wound healing, tumor progression, and inflammation (3Brekken R.A. Sage E.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 19: 816-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent findings have attracted new interest in SPARC and its proposed role(s) in adipose tissue formation. SPARC-null mice exhibit significantly more fat accumulation than wild-type (WT) mice (4Bradshaw A.D. Graves D.C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6045-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar); consistent with this observation, SPARC-null bone marrow cells showed an increased tendency to differentiate into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts (5Delany A.M. Kalajzic I. Bradshaw A.D. Sage E.H. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression of SPARC in fat is enhanced in various murine obesity models that include diet-induced obesity, gold thioglucose treatment, and the ob/ob strain (6Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a clinical study, the plasma concentration of SPARC was correlated positively with body mass index (7Takahashi M. Nagaretani H. Funahashi T. Nishizawa H. Maeda N. Kishida K. Kuriyama H. Shimomura I. Maeda K. Hotta K. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data imply that SPARC is involved in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue turnover. Adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells, which first differentiate into preadipocytes and, subsequently, adipocytes, a process termed adipogenesis. Extensive studies have probed into mechanisms by which transcription factors and exogenous hormones regulate adipogenesis in cultured 3T3-L1/F442 cells. CAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) are the key factors required for adipogenesis in addition to signaling mediated by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 and nuclear receptors (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, 2Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis and enhance osteoblastogenesis (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar, 8Nuttall M.E. Gimble J.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 9Farmer S.R. Int. J. Obes. (Lond). 2005; 29: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Activation of this pathway is sufficient to inhibit the differentiation and apoptosis of preadipocytes through an inhibition of C/EBPα and PPARγ (9Farmer S.R. Int. J. Obes. (Lond). 2005; 29: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins bind to frizzled (Fz) receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein coreceptors to activate several signaling pathways. Importantly, the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) via Wnt results in the stabilization of β-catenin in the cytoplasm as opposed to its proteasomal degradation. After translocation to the nucleus, β-catenin binds to and coactivates transcription factors that include members of the T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) family. Moreover, constitutively activated Fz1 increases the stability of β-catenin, inhibits apoptosis, inhibits adipogenesis, and induces osteoblastogenesis (11Kennell J.A. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24004-24010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that SPARC regulates the activity of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in lung fibroblasts (12Barker T.H. Baneyx G. Cardo-Vila M. Workman G.A. Weaver M. Menon P.M. Dedhar S. Rempel S.A. Arap W. Pasqualini R. Vogel V. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36483-36493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Another group also demonstrated that ILK activity mediates oncogenic effects of SPARC in glioma cells (13Shi Q. Bao S. Song L. Wu Q. Bigner D.D. Hjelmeland A.B. Rich J.N. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 4084-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ILK also regulates the β-catenin pathway through its phosphorylation of GSK3β, an inhibition resulting in the stabilization of β-catenin (14Oloumi A. McPhee T. Dedhar S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Further accumulation of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm is a consequence of the inhibition of E-cadherin production by ILK (14Oloumi A. McPhee T. Dedhar S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Tan C. Costello P. Sanghera J. Dominguez D. Baulida J. de Herreros A.G. Dedhar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). SPARC represses expression of E-cadherin and promotes tumorigenesis in melanoma cells (17Robert G. Gaggioli C. Bailet O. Chavey C. Abbe P. Aberdam E. Sabatie E. Cano A. Garcia de Herreros A. Ballotti R. Tartare-Deckert S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7516-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that SPARC could inhibit adipogenesis through ILK-β-catenin-mediated signaling. Herein we have established that SPARC inhibits adipogenesis and enhances osteoblastogenesis. SPARC not only retarded morphological changes in preadipocytes but also inhibited the expression of most adipocyte transcription factors and other adipocyte-specific genes. Significantly, SPARC inhibited the degradation of β-catenin and enhanced its nuclear translocation. ILK was required for the effect of SPARC on β-catenin accumulation. Consistent with its effects in other tissues (18Francki A. Bradshaw A.D. Bassuk J.A. Howe C.C. Couser W.G. Sage E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32145-32152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Gruber H.E. Sage E.H. Norton H.J. Funk S. Ingram J. Hanley Jr., E.N. J. Histochem.

Dermatol. 2003; 120: 949-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), SPARC also regulated the production of ECM proteins and integrins, in an ILK-dependent manner. These data identify a novel pathway by which SPARC inhibits adipogenesis. Mice—A colony of WT and SPARC-null mice has been described (21Norose K. Lo W.K. Clark J.I. Sage E.H. Howe C.C. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 WT and SPARC-null mice are maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility. All animal experiments conformed to NIH guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. These WT and SPARC-null mice have a mixed genetic background (129SV × C57BL/6) with four to ten backcrosses into the C57BL/6 background. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human SPARC was produced and purified by our laboratory as described (22Bradshaw A.D. Bassuk J.A. Francki A. Sage E.H. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The preparations of SPARC used for these studies contained 0.001-0.005 ng of endotoxin/μg protein as determined by the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Cape Cod, Inc., E. Falmouth, MA). The purity of SPARC was greater than 90%, and its activity was verified in an assay of cell proliferation (23Bradshaw A.D. Francki A. Motamed K. Howe C. Sage E.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recombinant murine hevin protein was produced as described (24Sweetwyne M.T. Brekken R.A. Workman G. Bradshaw A.D. Carbon J. Siadak A.W. Murri C. Sage E.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All chemicals were reagent grade (Sigma). Goat anti-mouse SPARC antibody was purchased fromR&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); rabbit-anti-β-actin antibody was from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA); anti-ILK antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); rabbit anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2; Thr-202/Tyr-204) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); anti-histones, rabbit anti-α5-integrin, and rat anti-α6-integrin antibodies were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA); anti-mouse laminin (LN)-1, monoclonal anti-cellular fibronectin (FN), and monoclonal anti-vinculin antibodies were from Sigma; mouse anti-β-catenin antibody and a blocking antibody against α6 integrin (GoH3) were from BD Bioscience. Secondary antibody conjugates were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin and Hoechst 33258 dye were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Aquablock was from EastCoast Bio, Inc. (North Berwick, ME). Cell culture reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), DMEM/F-12, trypsin/EDTA, antibiotics, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Isolation and Differentiation of Preadipocytes from Adipose Tissue—Stromal-vascular cells (SVCs) from mouse adipose tissue were prepared as described (25Zhao L. Gregoire F. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16845-16850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The subcutaneous inguinal fat deposits from 3∼4-week-old male mice were dissected under sterile conditions, and the lymph nodes were carefully removed. The SVCs were obtained from the minced fat tissues by collagenase (Invitrogen) digestion (2 mg/ml at 37 °C for 60 min in DMEM, with orbital agitation). The resulting cell suspension was homogenized by pipetting with a 10-ml serological plastic pipette, passed through a 100-mm nylon filter, and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The floating (top) layer of mature adipocytes was removed, and the pellets were resuspended. Erythrocytes were removed by exposure to hypotonic buffer for 1 min. The cells were plated at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G, and streptomycin sulfate. When the cells reached confluence, differentiation was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm dexamethasone, 0.25 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 17 nm insulin in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the differentiation medium was replaced by DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and insulin only. Oil-Red-O Staining—Cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. After two washes in water, cells were stained with 0.5% Oil-Red-O in isopropanol:H2O (3:2, v:v) for 1 h. After washes with water to remove unbound dye, cells were photographed under a Leica inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera. Glycerol-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GPDH) Activity Assay—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm EDTA. Next, cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to clear debris. The supernatant was incubated with 0.12 mm β-NADH and 0.2 mm dihydroxyacetone phosphate in 100 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and the reaction was monitored by absorbance at 340 nm. Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA from (pre)adipocytes at day 0, 2, 4, 6, or 7 of adipogenesis was isolated with RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following primers: PPARγ2 (forward, 5′-ggagattctcctgttgacccag-3′; reverse, 5′-ggcactcaatggccatgag-3′), C/EBPα (forward, 5′-cagttccagatcgcgcact-3′; reverse, 5′-ctagagatccagcgacccga-3′), C/EBPβ (forward, 5′-cgactacggttacgtgagcct-3′; reverse, 5′-cgacagctgctccaccttcttc-3′), C/EBPδ (forward, 5′-cgcagacagtggtgagctt-3′; reverse, 5′-tcctgtcgctcgcaggt-3′), lipoprotein lipase (forward, 5′-gcaagcaacacaaccaggc-3′; reverse, 5′-cctgggttagccaccgttt-3′), leptin (forward, 5′-atgtgctggagacccctgtg-3′; reverse, 5′-tcagcattcagggctaacatcc-3′), osteocalcin (forward, 5′-gcagacaccatgaggacca-3′; reverse, 5′-tggagctgctgtgacatcc-3′), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2, forward 5′-cccagccacctttacctaca-3′; reverse, 5′-tatggagtgctgctggtctg-3′), 36B4 (forward, 5′-ccagaggcaccattgaaattctg-3′; reverse, 5′-cgaagagaccgaatcccatatc-3′), LNα1 chain (forward, 5′-gatgccattggcctagagattg-3′; reverse, 5′-ggatgggaatgggagctga-3′), LNα4 chain (forward, catgggatcctattggcctg-3′; reverse, 5′-cacatagccgccttctgtgg-3′), LNγ1 chain (forward, 5′-acctggaccgtctgattgacc-3′; reverse, 5′-agctgcctcagcataccgtt-3′), α5 integrin (forward, 5′-gcgactggaatcctcaaga-3′; reverse, 5′-gctgcagactacggctctct-3′), and α6 integrin (forward, 5′-cttgagggaaacaccgtca-3′; reverse, 5′-cacaactcaagaaagaaacgg-3′). Immunoblotting—Cells cultured in media were lysed in radiolabeled immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), cleared by centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by detection with a specific antibody as detailed in the figure legends. Immunostaining—For immunohistochemistry, WAT was fixed with methyl Carnoy's solution for 24 h and subsequently embedded in paraffin. Five-μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and incubated with control goat IgG or goat anti-mouse SPARC IgG. Bound primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, and histochemical reactions were performed with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as the substrate. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For immunocytochemistry, preadipocytes were plated on coverslips. At certain stages of differentiation, cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 20% Aquablock and 0.1% Triton X-100. Specific primary antibodies were used as indicated, with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections and cells were examined with a Leica DMR microscope, and images were captured digitally with an RT-Spot camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—After 2 washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at -20 °C. The cells were subsequently washed twice with water and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium alkaline phosphatase substrate buffer (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were photographed under a Leica inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera. ILK Activity Assay—200-250 μg of cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-ILK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) or IgG isotype control, and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Complexes were washed with high salt lysis buffer and kinase reaction buffer, and kinase assays were performed with 5 μg of myelin basic protein as a substrate. Kinase activity was measured by immunoblotting with a specific antibody against phosphorylated myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions (NUCLEI EZ Prep Nuclei Isolation kit, Sigma). The cells were scraped into Nuclei EZ lysis buffer and were pelleted by centrifugation after two washes with ice-cold serum-free DMEM. Cell pellets were washed again with Nuclei EZ lysis buffer. The nuclei were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C. Nuclear fractions were solubilized with cold Nuclei EZ storage buffer. Proteins comprising the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and, subsequently, by immunoblotting. Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)—Equimolar amounts of nonspecific siRNAs or siRNAs targeting murine ILK or SPARC (Qiagen) were incubated with Hiperfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligo mixtures were added to preadipocyte cultures 18 h after plating the cells. Thirty hours later the media were replaced with standard differentiation media as described above. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—5 × 105 cells were transfected with 3 μg of Super 8× TOPflash (From Dr. Randall T. Moon, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and 20 ng of pRenilla-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) by electroporation. Super 8× TOPflash contains eight TCF/LEF transcription factor binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase/Renilla assays were performed with the Dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The average ratio of luciferase activity (relative light units) to Renilla activity was calculated. Experiments were repeated more than three times in triplicates. ECM Protein Deposition—For quantification of ECM proteins, cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates and were induced to differentiate as described above. The cells in each well were removed by repeated washing with cold Mg2+/Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Detached cells were counted and subsequently lysed with a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Proteins deposited on the plates were collected by scraping with a policeman into radiolabeled immunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against LN-1 or cellular FN. SPARC Inhibits Adipogenesis and Enhances Osteoblastogenesis—SPARC is expressed extensively in WAT and in most adipocytes (Fig. 1A) as previously reported (6Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22231-22237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Takahashi M. Nagaretani H. Funahashi T. Nishizawa H. Maeda N.

Given the high levels of SPARC in WAT and the data linking SPARC with obesity (4Bradshaw A.D. Graves D.C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6045-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 6Tartare-Deckert S. Chavey C. Monthouel M.N. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Maeda K. Hotta K. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we asked whether SPARC controlled one (or more) of the processes contributing to adipogenesis. We separated SVCs from murine WAT and established an in vitro adipogenesis model as described (25Zhao L. Gregoire F. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16845-16850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SVCs are composed mainly of preadipocytes, as verified by immunostaining (data not shown); contamination by either macrophages or endothelial cells is less than 5%, according to staining for CD31 and F4/80, respectively. At least 50% of cells differentiate into adipocytes by day 7 after induction of adipogenesis, although the actual differentiation capacity of cells varied between preparations by ∼10%. More than 90% of WT SVCs expressed SPARC. SPARC protein was distributed in a diffuse pattern in cells maintained in growth medium (GM), whereas the location of SPARC appeared more concentrated in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-like compartment surrounding nuclei at day 2 of adipogenesis (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1). During the differentiation of preadipocytes, levels of SPARC protein were augmented at two different stages: the first, between 6 and 24 h, and the second, at days 3-4 of adipogenesis (Fig. 1C). The concentration of SPARC in conditioned media on day 1 of adipogenesis is ∼200 ng/ml. Levels of β-actin are diminished during differentiation due to the major cytoskeletal remodeling required for this process (26Spiegelman B.M. Ginty C.A. Cell. 1983; 35: 657-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 is phosphorylated and activated only at an early stage of differentiation when mitotic clonal expansion occurs (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2) (27Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). On day 7 of differentiation, cultured SPARC-null cells were fixed and stained with Oil-Red-O or were extracted for GPDH activity assays. Purified SPARC protein was added simultaneously to the culture with the differentiation medium and was replenished every 2 days. SPARC protein did not change the cellular apoptotic index, according to an acridine orange assay (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, 2 μg/ml SPARC significantly inhibited adipogenesis in these primary cultures. Both hevin (a SPARC homolog) and SPARC proteins are purified from insect cells. Hevin, as well as bovine serum albumin (BSA), were therefore used as controls, neither of which showed effects on adipogenesis, and SPARC protein after partial denaturation exhibited significantly less activity (Fig. 2B). The inhibitory effect of SPARC was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2C). The endogenous level of SPARC (200 ng/ml) should exert certain inhibitory effects on adipogenesis; consequently, anti-SPARC IgG rescued adipogenesis in the presence of SPARC and blocked SPARC activity by 80% (Fig. 2D). Preadipocytes and mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoblasts under long term culture. SPARC significantly enhanced osteoblast formation 21 days after the induction of differentiation (supplemental Fig. 3). These data support previous reports that SPARC inhibits adipogenesis and enhances osteoblastogenesis (4Bradshaw A.D. Graves D.C. Motamed K. Sage E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Investig. 2000; 105: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of SPARC on adipocyte differentiation, we compared the differentiation in vitro of preadipocytes from WT and SPARC-null mice. Preadipocytes were isolated from epididymal WAT of each genotype and were induced to differentiate into adipocytes. After 7 days, more adipocytes and more fat accumulation were observed in cultures of SPARC-null preadipocytes compared with those of WT preadipocytes (Fig. 3, A-C). We also tested the capacity of these preadipocytes to differentiate into osteoblasts. On day 28, cells were stained for the osteoblast marker, alkaline phosphatase. There were fewer stained cells in SPARC-null preadipocytes (Fig. 3, D and E). These data further demonstrate that SPARC regulates mesenchymal stem cell lineage commitment. SPARC Inhibits Adipocyte Gene Expression and Enhances Osteoblast Gene Expression—Adipogenesis requires the sequential expression of adipogenesis transcription factors and adipocyte genes. We next examined the levels of specific mRNAs in the presence or absence of SPARC. By RT-PCR (Fig. 4A), the transcription factors C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ2 were all significantly decreased by SPARC, whereas C/EBPδ was unchanged. Adipocyte genes such as leptin and lipoprotein lipase were also substantially decreased by SPARC. Conversely, genes required for osteoblast differentiation were enhanced by SPARC (Fig. 4B). RUNX2 is one of the key transcription factors for osteoblast formation (29Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003;"

The [NiFe] hydrogenases produced by these organisms are unusual in their ability to oxidize H2 in the presence of O2, which is a potent inactivator of most hydrogenases through attack at the active site. To probe the origin of this unusual O2 tolerance, we conducted a study on the membrane-bound hydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha H16 and that of the closely related organism Ralstonia metallidurans CH34, which was purified using a new heterologous overproduction system. Direct electrochemical methods were used to determine apparent inhibition constants for O2 inhibition of H2 oxidation (KI(app)O2) for each enzyme. These values were at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of “standard” [NiFe] hydrogenases. Amino acids close to the active site were exchanged in the membrane-bound hydrogenase of R. eutropha H16 for those from standard hydrogenases to probe the role of individual residues in conferring O2 sensitivity. Michaelis constants for H2 (KMH2) were determined, and for some mutants these were increased more than 20-fold relative to the wild type. Mutations resulting in membrane-bound hydrogenase enzymes with increasedKMH2 or decreasedKI(app)O2) values were associated with impaired lithoautotrophic growth in the presence of high O2 concentrations.

Hydrogenases are active catalysts both in H2 oxidation and proton reduction (1Cammack R. Robson R. Frey M. Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature.in: Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1997Google Scholar). Three phylogenetically distinct classes of hydrogenases are found in nature as follows: [FeFe], [NiFe], and [Fe] hydrogenases (2Shima S. Thauer R.K. Chem.

The basic module of a [NiFe] hydrogenase consists of two subunits, a large subunit that contains the Ni-Fe active site, and a small, electron-transferring subunit that accommodates three Fe-S clusters (4Volbeda A.

The Ni is coordinated to the protein via four thiol groups from cysteine residues, two of which are bridging ligands to the Fe, which additionally coordinates two CN- and one CO (7Volbeda A. Garcin E. Piras C. de Lacey A.L. Fernandez V.M. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12989-12996Crossref Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 8Pierik A.J. Roseboom W.

The structure of the active site of the “standard” O2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio gigas is shown in Fig. 1A. A crucial feature of hydrogenases is their sensitivity to O2. Although the [NiFe] hydrogenases are generally more robust toward O2 damage than the [FeFe] enzymes (9Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18179-18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), the vast majority of [NiFe] hydrogenases act under anaerobic conditions in vivo, and their activity is normally subject to reversible inactivation by O2. Dioxygen is a π-acceptor ligand like H2 and CO and is expected to enter the active site easily. However, it subsequently behaves as an oxidizing agent, leading to inactive “resting” states. EPR studies on a set of standard [NiFe] hydrogenases, such as those isolated from Allochromatium vinosum, D. gigas, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F, and Desulfovibrio fructosovorans, have identified distinct Ni(III) features associated with two inactive states, known as Ni-A (“Unready”) and Ni-B (“Ready”), and these are also associated with subtly distinct ν(CO) and ν(CN) frequencies in IR spectra (11Cammack R. Fernandez V.M. Schneider K. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12Bleijlevens B. van Broekhuizen F.A. De Lacey A.L. Roseboom W. Fernandez V.M. Albracht S.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In conjunction with crystallographic studies on the D. gigas enzyme, for example, it has been established that Ni-B incorporates a hydroxide ligand into the bridging position between Ni and Fe, whereas further electron density in the active site of Ni-A suggests a bridging peroxide ligand or an O atom bonded to cysteinyl S; both ligands are released through reductive activation under H2 (13Fernandez V.M.

The ready state of the enzyme is also formed under anaerobic oxidative conditions (10Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem.

In contrast to standard hydrogenases, a few [NiFe] hydrogenases, especially those synthesized by Knallgas bacteria, catalyze aerobic H2 oxidation using O2 as the terminal oxidant (9Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18179-18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the light of the above comments, this situation is seemingly paradoxical. Furthermore, there are intense efforts to produce organisms and synthetic catalysts that cycle H2 without interference from O2. We define hydrogenases that exhibit catalytic activity in the presence of O2 as being “O2 tolerant” (10Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Rev. 2007; 107: 4366-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The [NiFe] hydrogenases expressed by chemolithoautotrophic Ralstonia species fall into this special category (17Burgdorf T. Lenz O. Buhrke T. van der Linden E. Jones A.K. Albracht S.P. Friedrich B. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 10: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For example, electrochemical experiments have shown that although the membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH) 5The abbreviations used are: MBH, membrane-bound hydrogenase; PFV, protein film voltammetry; Re, R. eutropha; RH, H2-sensing, regulatory hydrogenase; Rm, R. metallidurans; SH, NAD-reducing hydrogenase; SHE, standard hydrogen electrode. enzymes from Ralstonia eutropha H16 (Re H16) and Ralstonia metallidurans (Rm CH34) react rapidly and reversibly with O2, substantial H2 oxidation activity remains even in air (9Vincent K.A. Parkin A. Lenz O. Albracht S.P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cammack R. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18179-18189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 18Cracknell J.A.

A practical demonstration of this O2 tolerance was provided by the construction of an H2 fuel cell employing Rm CH34 MBH as the anode catalyst and laccase (a multicopper oxidase catalyzing the clean four-electron reduction of O2 to water) at the cathode. With this device it was possible to produce sufficient electricity from a quiescent atmosphere of just 3% H2 in air to power a wristwatch for over 24 h (19Vincent K.A. Cracknell J.A. Clark J.R. Ludwig M. Lenz O. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2006; 48: 5033-5035Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). No crystal structure has yet been obtained for any O2-tolerant hydrogenase. IR spectroscopic experiments suggest that Re H16 MBH has the same coordination arrangement of CO and CN- ligands at the active site as the standard O2-sensitive [NiFe] hydrogenases (20Vincent K.A. Cracknell J.A. Lenz O. Zebger I. Friedrich B. Armstrong F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16951-16954Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). 6M. Saggu, I. Zebger, M. Ludwig, O. Lenz, B. Friedrich, P. Hildebrandt, and F. Lendzian, submitted for publication. An amino acid sequence comparison reveals that Re H16 MBH shares only ∼40% identity with standard [NiFe] hydrogenases. However, the amino acids closest to the Re H16 MBH Ni-Fe active site are identical to those in the O2-sensitive periplasmic hydrogenase from D. gigas, for which a structure has been determined (4Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C. Hatchikian E.C. Frey M. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The nearest nonconserved residues to the active site are (according to D. gigas hydrogenase numbering) tyrosine 70 and valine 71, which correspond to glycine 80 and cysteine 81 in Re H16 MBH (Fig. 1B). To probe whether these specific residues confer O2 tolerance, a series of exchanges via site-directed mutagenesis was introduced into the Re H16 MBH. Experiments on the H2-sensing hydrogenases (RH) from Re H16 and Rhodobacter capsulatus (21Buhrke T. Lenz O. Krauss N. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23791-23796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Duche O. Elsen S. Cournac L. Colbeau A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3899-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that O2 tolerance arises from the bulky residues isoleucine and phenylalanine restricting access of O2 through a narrow gas channel to the active site. In Re H16 MBH, the corresponding residues are valine 77 and leucine 125. To probe whether introducing bulky residues into the MBH further enhances the O2 tolerance of the enzyme, the residues found in the sensory hydrogenases were introduced into Re H16 MBH by genetic engineering. The effects of these mutations were investigated in terms of cell growth characteristics and the catalytic properties of the isolated enzymes. The isolated enzymes were studied electrochemically using the suite of techniques known as protein film voltammetry (PFV), which has proved to be very useful in studying hydrogenases from various organisms (9Vincent K.A.

The enzyme is adsorbed onto an electrode as a sub-monolayer film such that the electrode replaces physiological electron donors and acceptors. Catalytic currents report directly on enzyme activity under conditions of controlled potential (driving force). Using PFV, activity can be measured even under aerobic conditions (18Cracknell J.A.

Lenz O. Krause E. Volkmer R. Friedrich B. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 453-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An equivalent plasmid for overproduction of the MBH from Rm CH34 was constructed as follows. A HindIII restriction site within the coding region for the leader sequence of HoxK and a BsrGI site downstream of hoxG were introduced by inverse PCR with primers 638 and 639 using pCH1229 as a template. The 4.39-kbp amplificate was digested with XbaI and re-ligated, resulting in pCH1237. A 2.94-kbp PCR fragment, amplified with primers 640 and 641 on Rm CH34 genomic DNA, was digested with HindIII-BsrGI and inserted into pCH1237 resulting in pCH1266. Plasmid pCH1266 was cut with SpeI and AsiSI, and a 4.40-kbp fragment containing hoxKG CH34 was cloned into SpeI-AsiSI-digested pCH1351 carrying hoxKGZMLOQRTV from Re H16. This yielded plasmid pCH1267 from which a 9.02-kbp SpeI-Ecl136II fragment was subsequently transferred into pCH785 resulting in pCH1268. Finally, a 21.57-kbp SpeI-XbaI fragment from pCH1268, harboring the MBH operon with hoxKG from Rm CH34, was inserted into the broad host range vector pEDY309 (28Kleihues L. Lenz O. Bernhard M. Buhrke T. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) resulting in pGE615. A StrepTag II sequence was fused to the 3′ end of hoxK from Rm CH34 by inverse PCR using primers 653 and 654 with pCH1269 as the template. The resulting 3.48-kbp PCR fragment was digested with RsrII and re-ligated, resulting in pCH1294. A 0.41-kbp PspOMI-SalI fragment from pCH1294 was cloned into pCH1266 resulting in pCH1295, which carries the StrepTag II sequence at the 3′ end of hoxK. A 4.44-kbp SpeI-AsiSI fragment was transferred from pCH1295 into pCH1351 yielding pCH1296. From there a 9.06-kbp SpeI-Ecl136II fragment was cloned into pCH785 resulting in pCH1297. Finally, a 21.6-kbp SpeI-XbaI fragment from pCH1297, carrying the MBH operon with CH34 hoxKStrepG, was cloned into pEDY309 resulting in pGE621. The plasmids pGE615, pGE621, and pGE636 were transferred via conjugation into Re HF631, which is devoid of megaplasmid pHG1 (29Lenz O. Gleiche A. Strack A. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6590-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yielding Re strains HF688 (Rm MBH), HF717 (Rm MBHStrep), and HF641 (Re MBHStrep), respectively. Amino acid exchanges in HoxG of Re H16 were constructed via PCR using the forward primer 649 and the mutagenic primers 646 (for C81A), 648 (for C81S), 647 (for C81T), and 661 (for C81V), respectively. Plasmid pCH1234, carrying a 69-kbp Acc65I-BmgBI hoxG fragment, served as the template. The resulting PCR products were inserted as 143-bp AgeI-SphI fragments into pCH1234. Also, the amplificates resulting from PCRs with primers 645, 649, and 662 (for G80Y) or 663 (for G80Y/C81V) and pCH1351 as template were introduced as a 179-bp Acc65I-MscI fragment into pCH1234. For the V77I exchange, an 88-bp Acc65I-AgeI-digested PCR fragment, generated with primers 644 and 645 and pCH1351 as the template, was transferred into pCH1234. The L125F exchange was obtained by cloning a 234-bp MscI-BamHI-digested PCR product, generated with primers 650, 651, and 652 and pCH1351 as the template, into pCH1234. A 1.80-kbp AgeI-DraIII fragment from the L125F derivative was transferred into the previously constructed V77I derivative of pCH1234 yielding a hoxG mutant fragment encoding a V77I/L125F exchange. From all pCH1234 derivatives carrying the hoxG mutations, a 0.68-kbp Acc65I-BstZ17I fragment was transferred into pCH1351 and pCH1353. From the pCH1351 derivatives 4.82-kbp SalI-PstI fragments were cloned into pLO2, yielding plasmids that were used for introduction of the mutations into Re HF388 by double homologous recombination as described previously (30Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strains HF681-HF740 are listed in Table 1. From the pCH1353 derivatives, 9.06-kbp SpeI-Ecl136II fragments were transferred into pCH785 and, from there, as 21.60-kbp SpeI-XbaI fragments into pEDY309. The resulting plasmids pGE610-614, pGE622, and pGE639-641 were transferred into Re HF631 by conjugation. This allowed the overproduction and purification of the MBH variants via a StrepTag II fused to the C terminus of the small subunit HoxK. All PCR amplificates were verified by sequencing. Media and Growth Conditions—Ralstonia strains were grown in Luria broth medium containing 0.25% (w/v) sodium chloride (LSLB) or in mineral salts medium. Synthetic media for heterotrophic growth of Re H16 and Rm CH34 contained 0.4% fructose (FN medium) or 0.2% fructose and 0.2% glycerol (FGN medium) (31Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lithoautotrophic and mixotrophic (H2-supplemented heterotrophic) cultures were grown in mineral salts medium without any carbon source or in FGN medium, respectively, under an atmosphere of H2, CO2, and O2 (8:1:1, v/v), unless otherwise indicated. Cell cultures were grown for 48 h at 120 rpm and 30 °C until they reached an OD436 of ∼10, when cultivated heterotrophically, or ∼20, when cultivated lithoautotrophically. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5 000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min), washed with phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4·12H2O (90 g liter-1) and KH2PO4 (15 g liter-1)), and re-centrifuged. The resulting cell pellet was frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Sucrose-resistant segregants of originally sacB-harboring strains were selected on LSLB plates containing 15% (w/v) sucrose (30Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains of E. coli were grown in LB medium (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) agar. The following antibiotics were used: kanamycin (350 μgml-1) and tetracycline (15 μgml-1) for Re, and kanamycin (25 μgml-1), tetracycline (15 μgml-1), and ampicillin (100 μgml-1) for E. coli. MBH Purification—Cell pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), 4 ml per 1 g of cells (wet weight), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) and DNase I. The cell suspension was subsequently disrupted in a French pressure cell (Constant Cell Disruption Systems or SLM Aminco). The resulting crude extract was treated by sonication (2 min, level 2.5, 75%, Branson Sonifier), and the membrane and soluble fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min). The brownish membranes were removed, homogenized in an appropriate volume of washing buffer (resuspension buffer + 1 mm EDTA), and ultracentrifuged again (100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min). For MBH purification, the membrane proteins were solubilized by adding washing buffer containing Triton X-114 at a final concentration of 2% w/v and subsequently stirring on ice for 1.5 h. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min), the supernatant, containing the solubilized membranes, was loaded on Strep-Tactin Superflow columns (IBA, Go¨ttingen, Germany; 1-ml bed volume for up to 25 ml of solubilized membrane extract). The columns were washed with 12 column volumes of washing buffer, and proteins were eluted with 6× 0.5 ml of elution buffer (washing buffer + 5 mm desthiobiotin). MBH-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device (Amicon Ultra-15 (PL-30), Millipore). The buffer was changed twice by adding 10 ml of storage buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and subsequent recentrifugation. Aliquots of the resulting concentrate were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The purity of the samples was estimated by visual inspection of SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analysis was performed according to a standard protocol (35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar) with anti-HoxK serum (1:5000) and anti-HoxG serum (1:10"

Methionine residues are particularly susceptible to oxidation, but the resulting mixture of methionine R-sulfoxide (Met-RO) and methionine S-sulfoxide (Met-SO) can be repaired by thioredoxin-dependent enzymes MsrB and MsrA, respectively. Here, we describe a knock-out mouse deficient in selenoprotein MsrB1, the main mammalian MsrB located in the cytosol and nucleus. In these mice, in addition to the deletion of 14-kDa MsrB1, a 5-kDa selenoprotein form was specifically removed. Further studies revealed that the 5-kDa protein occurred in both mouse tissues and human HEK 293 cells; was down-regulated by MsrB1 small interfering RNA, selenium deficiency, and selenocysteine tRNA mutations; and was immunoprecipitated and recognized by MsrB1 antibodies. Specific labeling with 75Se and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the 5-kDa selenoprotein corresponded to the C-terminal sequence of MsrB1. The MsrB1 knock-out mice lacked both 5- and 14-kDa MsrB1 forms and showed reduced MsrB activity, with the strongest effect seen in liver and kidney. In addition, MsrA activity was decreased by MsrB1 deficiency. Liver and kidney of the MsrB1 knock-out mice also showed increased levels of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls, protein methionine sulfoxide, and oxidized glutathione as well as reduced levels of free and protein thiols, whereas these parameters were little changed in other organs examined. Overall, this study established an important contribution of MsrB1 to the redox control in mouse liver and kidney and identified a novel form of this protein.

The product of such oxidation is a diastereomeric mixture of Met sulfoxides: Met R-sulfoxide (Met-RO) 2The abbreviations used are: Met-RO, methionine R-sulfoxide; Met-SO, methionine S-sulfoxide; KO, knock-out; Sec, selenocysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; Se, selenium. and Met S-sulfoxide (Met-SO). These oxidized forms, however, can be reduced back to Met by two enzyme families, MsrA (specific for Met-SO) and MsrB (specific for Met-RO) (4Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys.

This protein is interesting in that it is a selenoprotein that contains selenocysteine (Sec) in place of cysteine normally present in the catalytic sites of MsrBs and MsrAs (11Kryukov G.V.

The lack of MsrA results in the accumulation of carbonyl derivatives (indicative of protein oxidation) (17Oien D. Moskovitz J. Amino Acids. 2007; 32: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), increased susceptibility to exposure to 100% oxygen, and various neurological abnormalities, such as tip-toe walking, abnormal behavior, and lower locomotor activity (16Moskovitz J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, MsrA knock-out mice showed a dramatically reduced life span (16Moskovitz J. Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M.

These studies are consistent with the idea that repair of oxidized proteins is a critical factor in neurological diseases and the aging process (4Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In contrast to MsrA, the consequence of MsrB deficiency in mice or other animal models is not known (although MsrB also can regulate the life span of yeast cells (22Koc A. Gasch A.P. Rutherford J.C. Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7999-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar)). Selenium deficiency was used to reduce MsrB1 expression (13Moskovitz J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), which resulted in lower MsrB activity as well as in a reduction in the levels of other selenoproteins. This treatment increased protein oxidation and the amount of Met sulfoxide residues (13Moskovitz J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whereas the knock-out of MsrA removed this protein in all tissues and compartments, the specific removal of individual MsrBs offers an opportunity to examine the effects of MsrB deficiency in different organs, cells, and compartments. In this work, we describe mice lacking MsrB1. We show that MsrB1 knock-out led to protein oxidation and affected other parameters indicative of oxidative stress. Most effects were observed in the liver and kidney, where MsrB1 levels were particularly high, whereas several other organs were not affected. An additional surprising finding was that MsrB1 knock-out led to the removal of a 5-kDa selenoprotein. We examined this process in more detail and show that this protein corresponds to the C-terminal segment of MsrB1. Materials—General purpose chemicals were from Sigma, DNA purification kits were from Qiagen, the RNA isolation kit was from Ambion, and mammalian cell culture reagents and protein electrophoresis reagents were from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were from Fermentas. KOD XL DNA polymerase (Novagen) was used for genomic DNA amplification and for MsrB1 knock-out allele screening. E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) were used for recombinant DNA transformation and BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen) for recombinant protein synthesis. MsrB1 Knock-out Mice—Two strategies were used to prepare MsrB1 knock-out (KO) mice. Two separate targeting constructs were prepared and used to target the MsrB1 gene by homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). The following primer pairs were used to amplify a 4550-bp region, upstream of the first exon of MsrB1 by nested PCR: UP_D1 5′-TTCAGTGTTGGTGTAGGACTGTAGGAC-3′, UP_D2 5′-AGTCAGCGGCCGCCCTTACCAAGGTCATGAGTGACCAG-3′, UP_R1 5′-GCCTCCGAAGAAGCTGCAGAACGACAT-3′, UP_R2 5′-AGTAGCGGCCGCGGGAGCCGCTCCCAGGAAGCTTAG-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into the NotI site of pPNT targeting vector, and the correct fragment orientation was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. This region was common to both targeting constructs. The region downstream of the first exon of the MsrB1 gene was amplified by nested PCR with the following primer pairs (the first construct): DWN_D1, 5′-GTTATTGGGACTGGGTCGGGTTTGAGTCC-3′; DWN_D2, 5′-AGTCAGGATCCGGCCTTGAACTTCAAATGTAGATC-3′; DWN_R1_1, 5′-CGAATGCCTGAGGTTCTGACACTAACGTG-3′; DWN_R2_1, 5′-AGTCAGGTACCAGAGAGTGCTGTATGGTAAGTTCCAG-3′. The amplified 1080-bp fragment was cloned into BamHI-KpnI sites of the pPNT targeting vector. For the second construct, the following primer pairs were used: DWN_D1, 5′-GTTATTGGGACTGGGTCGGGTTTGAGTCC-3′; DWN_D2, 5′AGTCAGGATCCGGCCTTGAACTTCAAATGTAGATC-3′; DWN_R1_2, 5′-CTTCGAGTGACTGGAGAACAGCTCATAGC-3′; DWN_R2_2, 5′-AGTCAGGTACCGCCAGTGCTGCAGACACACAATACAG-3′. The amplified 4824-bp fragment was cloned into BamHI-KpnI sites of the pPNT targeting vector. More than 500 ES cell clones were tested for successful MsrB1 targeting with these constructs; however, no positive cells were detected, probably because of the high content of repetitive elements in the vicinity of the MsrB1 gene (predicted with RepeatMasker, available on the World Wide Web). As an alternative strategy, a mouse (in a 129/Sv genetic background) was generated at Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine by taking advantage of the genetrap cassette inserted immediately downstream of the MsrB1 gene (Fig. 1B). Homozygous MsrB1 KO mice were obtained by mating heterozygous mice and selecting for homozygous MsrB1 KO by genetic screening. Mice were handled following the guidelines and approved protocols at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Preparation of Protein Extracts from Mouse Tissues—Tissues were glass-homogenized and sonicated in PBS, pH 7.6, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and 20 mm EDTA at 0 °C. Metabolic Labeling of Mice and Cell Cultures with 75Se—[75Se]Selenite (specific activity 1000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from the Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri (Columbia, MO). Wild-type and MsrB1 KO mice were injected with 2.5 mCi of 75Se each and maintained for 2 days at a 12-h light/dark cycle on a regular diet. The mice were sacrificed, tissues were extracted, and protein extracts were prepared from various tissues in ice-cold PBS buffer, pH 7.6, supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science. HEK 293 cells were grown and labeled with 75Se as described (23Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Hua D. Kasaikina M.V. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7857-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Extracts from the indicated mouse tissues or human cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. MsrB1 Knockdown—To down-regulate MsrB1 expression, we used siRNA from Dharmacon. 4 μl of siRNA in RNase-free buffer were mixed with 1 μl of DharmaFECT transfection reagent and antibiotic-free/serum-free medium to a total volume of 40 μl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and added to HEK 293 cells cultured in 6-well plates. After 24-48 h of incubation, medium was substituted with that containing 75Se, and cells were incubated for an additional 12 h and then washed with PBS, pH 7.6, and lysed with mammalian cell lysis reagent from Sigma. The lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. Dietary Studies—One-month-old BALB/c mice were maintained for 3 months on Torula yeast-based diets supplemented with 0.1 ppm selenium or 0.4 ppm selenium (as sodium selenite) or not supplemented with Se (0 ppm selenium) (Harlan Teklad) as described (15Novoselov S.V. Calvisi D.V. Labunskyy V.M. Factor V.M. Carlson B.A. Fomenko D.E. Moustafa M.E. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 8003-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed, and protein extracts were prepared from the indicated tissues and analyzed by Western blot assays with antibodies specific for MsrB1, MsrA, MsrB2, MsrB3, or β-actin. Immunoprecipitation of MsrB1 Forms—MsrB1 antibodies were added to protein extracts of mouse livers in PBS, pH 7.6, containing complete protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were further incubated at 4 °C with continuous shaking for 12 h. MsrB1 was pooled using a Protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Affinity Enrichment of MsrB1 Forms—MsrB1 antibodies were linked to activated BrCN-Sepharose from Sigma according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total protein extracts from 30 wild-type mouse livers in PBS, pH 7.6, containing complete protease inhibitor mixture were incubated with the resin containing immobilized antibodies for 12 h at 4 °C. The resin was extensively washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. MsrB1 forms were eluted with 3 ml of 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. Proteins were reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min, and cysteines/Sec were modified with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were concentrated using 3 kDa cut-off Microcon concentrators (Millipore), and MsrB1 forms were visualized by immunoblot assays with MsrB1 antibodies. The band corresponding to the 5-kDa protein form was cut from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were digested with trypsin or V8 protease and subjected to LC-MS/MS protein sequence analysis at Midwest Bio Services, LLC. MsrA and MsrB Activity Assays—MsrA and MsrB activities were assayed in homogenates of the indicated mouse tissues. 200 μg of protein were used in each assay. The reaction (100 μl) proceeded at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of dithiothreitol (20 mm), and either 200 μm dabsyl-Met-SO (MsrA assay) or 200 μm dabsyl-Met-RO (MsrB assay) was added to the reaction mixture. After stopping the reaction by adding 200 μl of acetonitrile, the mixtures were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 13,000 rpm, and then the supernatant (50 μl) was injected onto a C18 column (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18) to quantify dabsyl-Met in an HPLC system. Analyses of Oxidative Stress Parameters—Protein extracts from liver, kidney, heart, testis, and brain were prepared in PBS containing complete protease inhibitor mixture. Malondialdehyde was measured using the Oxiselect TBARS assay kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein carbonyl content was assayed using 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine and calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 22 mm-1 cm-1 (24Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Dubey A. Orr W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7255-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Total and protein thiol contents were measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described (25Natarajan S.K. Thomas S. Ramamoorthy P. Basivireddy J. Pulimood A.B. Ramachandran A. Balasubramanian K.A. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2006; 21: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and expressed as nmol/mg protein. Reduced and oxidized glutathione were assayed using the Bioxytech GSH/GSSG kit (OxisResearch, Portland OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of Met-RO and Met-SO Residues in Proteins—Liver samples (2 mg of protein) were hydrolyzed with 3 m p-toluene sulfonic acid at 110 °C for 22 h as described (26Hayashi R. Suzuki F. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 521-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and Met sulfoxides were separated by HPLC after precolumn O-phthalaldehyde derivatization using a Zorbax C18-Rx column as described (27Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). MsrB1 Three-dimensional Structure Modeling—The three-dimensional structure of mouse MsrB1 was modeled with Modeler 8.2 based on sequence similarity to MsrB from Bacillus subtilis (Protein Data Bank code 1XM0). Mice Lacking MsrB1 Are Viable—To generate the MsrB1 knock-out mouse, we initially utilized a strategy wherein a Neo cassette was inserted by homologous recombination. The mouse MsrB1 gene is located on chromosome 17 and flanked by Rpl3l and Hstst6 genes, the former being particularly close to the MsrB1 gene (Fig. 1A). In addition, the MsrB1 gene is flanked by a series of repetitive elements, especially abundant at the 3′-end as well as in some MsrB1 introns. We employed the targeting vector as shown in Fig. 1A, with the 3′-arm either 1 or 4 kb (to avoid repetitive elements). However, no ES cells positive for homologous recombination at the MsrB1 gene were found following repeated attempts. We then took advantage of the genetrap clone with the disrupting cassette inserted immediately after the first exon of MsrB1 (Fig. 1B). Mice were prepared that contained this cassette in both gene copies (i.e. homozygous mice) and were found to be viable. These mice had undetectable levels of MsrB1 mRNA (data not shown), and MsrB1 protein was also not detected in liver, heart, kidney, testis, and lung (Fig. 1, C and D). In addition, heterozygous mice containing the genetrap cassette had lower MsrB1 levels than wild-type mice. We further refer to the mice lacking the MsrB1 protein and mRNA as MsrB1 knock-out mice (MsrB1 KO). We also examined the expression of MsrA in MsrB1 KO mice and found that it was unchanged compared with wild-type mice. However, MsrB2 (mitochondrial MsrB) expression was slightly elevated in the liver and heart (this protein was not detected in other tissues examined). In contrast, MsrB3 levels in heart were not changed, but it showed slightly increased levels in skeletal muscle (both tissues are among those with highest MsrB3 expression) (Fig. S1). A 5-kDa Selenoprotein Is an Alternative Form of MsrB1—Since MsrB1 is a selenoprotein, we examined how its levels, as well as the expression of other selenoproteins, were affected in the knock-out mice. MsrB1 KO and wild-type mice were metabolically labeled with 75Se, and the selenoprotein expression was examined in liver, kidney, and testis (Fig. 2A). We found no differences in the levels of ∼14-kDa 75Se-labeled proteins (which correspond in size to MsrB1). Apparently, MsrB1 over-lapped on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with other selenoproteins of similar size, including SelM, Sep15, SelH, and SelK. Some of these selenoproteins were more abundant than MsrB1, which precluded MsrB1 detection with 75Se. The overall expression of selenoproteins was not changed by MsrB1 KO when assayed by 75Se labeling (Fig. 2A) or immunoblot assays (Fig. S2). Interesting, however, was an observation of specific removal of a 5-kDa selenoprotein band in liver and kidney of MsrB1 KO mice, the two tissues with highest MsrB1 expression (Fig. 2A). To determine if the 5-kDa selenoprotein has a relation to MsrB1, we immunoprecipitated MsrB1 from 75Se-labeled livers of wild-type and MsrB1 KO mice with antibodies specific for mouse MsrB1 (Fig. 2B). The 75Se-labeled 5 kDa band was specifically removed by the MsrB1 antibodies from samples derived from wild-type mice, and the pooled fraction contained both the 14- and 5-kDa protein bands, the former corresponding to the full-length MsrB1 and the latter to the trapped 5-kDa selenoprotein. These bands were not immunoprecipitated by the MsrB1 antibodies from the MsrB1 KO samples. We prepared an affinity column containing the MsrB1 antibodies and used it to affinity-isolate MsrB1 forms from liver extracts of wild-type mice. The samples were then analyzed by immunoblot assays, and both bands were trapped on the MsrB1 affinity column (Fig. 2C). Next, regulation of the 5-kDa form was examined in mice with altered Sec tRNA status (Fig. S3). Sec tRNA is essential in mammals, but its knock-out can be rescued with wild-type or mutant Sec tRNA transgenes. We found that expression of wild-type Sec tRNA transgene in mice lacking the natural Sec tRNA gene rescued expression of both 5 and 14 kDa bands as detected by immunoblot assays with MsrB1 antibodies. However, when the Sec tRNA transgene containing a mutation in position 37 was expressed in the Sec tRNA knock-out mice, neither 14 nor 5 kDa bands were expressed. Thus, both MsrB1 forms were similarly regulated by Sec tRNA status. We also found that 5- and 14-kDa forms were detected in other mouse tissues, including lung, muscle, and spleen (Fig. S3). When Sec tRNA knock-out was rescued with a transgene lacking the activator region (STAF-binding site), 3B. A. Carlson and D. L. Hatfield, unpublished results. expression of both 14- and 5-kDa forms was reduced. Overall, the data suggested that the 5-kDa selenoprotein is a novel form of mouse MsrB1. Since Sec in MsrB1 is located in the C-terminal portion of the protein, and the 5-kDa protein was recognized by MsrB1 antibodies, the data suggested that this small selenoprotein corresponded to the C-terminal portion of MsrB1. The fact that the immunoblot signal was weaker than the 75Se signal can be explained by unequal immunogenicity of the C-terminal portion and the full-length MsrB1. In fact, comparison of 75Se signals for 14- and 5-kDa MsrB1 forms suggests that the 5-kDa form is more abundant than the 14-kDa form. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the 5-kDa MsrB1 Form—We isolated the 5-kDa selenoprotein from mouse liver on an affinity column containing MsrB1 antibodies, resolved the protein by SDS-PAGE, and subjected the 5 kDa band to LC-MS/MS sequence analysis. Standard trypsin digestion did not yield MsrB1 peptides. We next used V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus, which preferentially cleaves after aspartic and glutamic acid residues. This procedure detected a peptide derived from mouse MsrB1, NGLGHEFLND (Fig. 3A). The C-terminal part of this peptide corresponded to the expected V8 protease cleavage site, but the N-terminal part did not. This observation and the predicted size of the resulting MsrB1 form (∼5 kDa) suggested that the identified peptide corresponded to the N-terminal part of the short form of MsrB1. Structural Base for Formation of the Short Form of MsrB1—We modeled the three-dimensional structure of mouse MsrB1 based on the B. subtilis MsrB structure (Protein Data Bank code 1XM0) (Fig. 3B). The predicted cleavage site in MsrB1 was located on the protein surface. Sequences located 4 amino acids up and down the predicted cleavage site showed decreased solvent exposure. Taken together, the observed size of the MsrB1 short form, the identified N-terminal peptide, and the known occurrence of Sec in the C-terminal portion of MsrB1 all suggested that the 5-kDa form was generated from the full-length MsrB1 by proteolytic cleavage between Gly75 and Asn76. Expression of 14- and 5-kDa MsrB1 Forms Is Regulated by Dietary Selenium—MsrB1 is a selenoprotein, whose expression is regulated by dietary selenium. To examine whether dietary selenium also regulates the expression of the 5-kDa MsrB1, we subjected wild-type mice to three Torula yeast-based selenium diets, including selenium-deficient (i.e. no selenium added), 0.1-ppm selenium, and 0.4-ppm selenium diets. As expected, expression of the full-length MsrB1 in the liver was dramatically reduced by selenium deficiency in these mice (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the 5-kDa MsrB1 was undetectable under these conditions. Thus, both 14- and 5-kDa MsrB1 forms were regulated by dietary selenium. The 5-kDa Form Is Not Due to Sample Preparation—We examined the possibility that the 5-kDa MsrB1 is the result of sample preparation wherein the full-length MsrB1 is degraded by nonspecific proteolytic cleavage. Extracts from mouse liver were incubated with or without protease inhibitors for 0, 3, 6, and 12 h and analyzed for the occurrence of the 14- and 5-kDa MsrB1 forms. In the presence of protease inhibitors along with 20 mm EDTA, both forms were stable for 12 h (Fig. 4B). In the absence of inhibitors, the proteins were stable for 6 h, and then the levels of both protein forms were reduced (rather than converted from the 14- to 5-kDa form). Thus, both MsrB1 forms were stable and resistant to nonspecific proteolytic cleavage. This finding argues against degradation of full-length MsrB1 during sample preparation. It should also be noted that abundant, partially degraded forms are not known for any selenoproteins. All major bands in the 75Se labeling pattern can be accounted for and correspond to known selenoproteins. 4S. V. Novoselov and V. N. Gladyshev, unpublished results. In addition, the short form of MsrB1 is the only selenoprotein that did not match the size of any predicted mouse selenoprotein. The 5-kDa MsrB1 Form Occurs in Human Cells—To determine if the 5-kDa MsrB1 form is specific to mice or also occurs in other species, we subjected human HEK 293 cells to metabolic 75Se labeling. A 5-kDa selenoprotein band was observed (Fig. 5, left lane). Knockdown of MsrB1 by siRNA completely removed this band without affecting the expression of other selenoproteins. Thus, the short form of MsrB1 also occurs in humans. As in mice, the full-length MsrB1 overlapped with several other selenoproteins on SDS-PAGE gel; therefore, the effect of knockdown on this form was difficult to assess. The molecular basis for generation of the 5-kDa MsrB1 form is not known. It is also not clear what the function of the MsrB1 short form could be. Being part of the overall fold, the C-terminal fragment could not catalyze the reduction of Met-RO on its own. Further studies are required to ascertain the mechanism by which the 5-kDa selenoprotein form is generated and the biological function of this protein form. Decreased MsrA Activity in MsrB1 Knock-out Mice—We examined MsrB and MsrA activities in the liver, kidney, heart, testis, lung, and brain of MsrB KO mice (Fig. 6). Compared with wild-type mice, total MsrB activity was most dramatically decreased in liver (p value 0.004) and kidneys (p value 0.012) of MsrB1 KO mice, which are the organs with highest MsrB1 expression. Activity was also partially decreased in the testis (p value 0.001), lung (p value 0.002), and brain (p value 0.0004). The least change in MsrB activity was observed in the heart, an organ where MsrB2 is highly expressed. Interestingly, we also observed a decreased MsrA activity in each of the organs tested, with liver (p value 0.009) and lung (p value 0.002) showing the largest drop and heart the least change in activity. A previous study revealed that MsrB activity is decreased in MsrA KO mice (13Moskovitz J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7486-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, MsrA and MsrB1 may regulate each other with respect to activity in the cells. It should be noted that although MsrA activity was decreased (Fig. 6), its expression was not (Fig. 1, C and D). Oxidative Stress in MsrB1 KO Mice—We examined the parameters of oxidative stress in MsrB1 KO mice and found increased levels of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls in liver (p value 0.01), kidney (p value 0.001), and brain (p value 0.01) samples of MsrB1 KO mice, whereas these parameters did not change significantly in heart and testis (Fig. 7). We also found reduced protein and total thiol levels in liver (p value 0.001) and kidneys (p value 0.001) of MsrB1 KO mice, but other organs were not significantly affected (Fig. 8). Liver and kidneys were further analyzed with respect to glutathione status. We found that the level of reduced glutathione was decreased (p value 0.04), and GSSG increased in these organs (p value 0.01) (Fig. 9). Accordingly, the GSH/GSSG ratio was reduced in the MsrB1 KO samples. Finally, we assayed for protein-based methionine sulfoxides in liver and kidneys and found elevated levels of methionine sulfoxide residues in MsrB1 KO mice (Fig. 10). The last finding is fully consistent with the idea that MsrB1 is the main MsrB in liver and kidneys. Overall, the data suggested an important role of MsrB1 in the redox control in liver and kidney, organs with maximal levels of MsrB1, but a lower impact of this protein in other organs.FIGURE 8Analyses of total and protein thiols in MsrB1 KO mice.

Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M. Requena J. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Our MsrB1 KO mice appeared to be normal (without strong phenotypes). The oldest animals, currently 20 months old, are still alive, suggesting that the same dramatic effect on the life span found in MsrA KO mice will not be seen with the MsrB1 KO mice. However, considering the apparent oxidative stress seen in these mice, some reduction in the life span may be expected. We also did not observe a tip-toe walking behavior in young and middle-aged MsrB1 KO mice. Thus, there are important differences between MsrA KO and MsrB1 KO mice. In summary, knock-out of the MsrB1 gene in mice is viable and leads to the conditions of oxidative stress; however, the phenotypes are milder than in the MsrA knock-out mice. In addition, our analyses revealed that liver and kidney are severely affected, whereas the redox status of other organs examined was not changed significantly. Since MsrB1 is also highly expressed in liver and kidney, these organs appear to be the prime sites of MsrB1 function. Another interesting observation made in this study is the discovery of a novel selenoprotein form of MsrB1, which is apparently even more abundant than the full-length form. The short, 5-kDa form occurs in both mice and humans and corresponds to the C-terminal segment of the protein. Expression of this protein is regulated by dietary selenium, similar to that of the 14-kDa full-length MsrB1, and both forms appear to be stable proteins. Further studies will be needed to determine the mechanism of formation and function of the 5-kDa MsrB1 form. Download .pdf (.23 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2007548336,"The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein LRP1 is a cell surface receptor with functions in diverse physiological pathways, including lipid metabolism. Here we show that LRP1-deficient fibroblasts accumulate high levels of intracellular cholesterol and cholesteryl-ester when stimulated for adipocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that LRP1 stimulates a canonical Wnt5a signaling pathway that prevents cholesterol accumulation. Moreover, we show that LRP1 is required for lipolysis and stimulates fatty acid synthesis independently of the noradrenergic pathway, through inhibition of GSK3β and its previously unknown target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). As a result of ACC inhibition, mature LRP1-deficient adipocytes of adult mice are hypotrophic, and lower uptake of fatty acids into adipose tissue leads to their redistribution to the liver. These results establish LRP1 as a novel integrator of adipogenic differentiation and fat storage signals."
https://openalex.org/W2163354333,"Growth factor stimulation and oncogenic transformation lead to increased glucose metabolism that may provide resistance to cell death. We have previously demonstrated that elevated glucose metabolism characteristic of stimulated or cancerous cells can stabilize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 through inhibition of GSK-3. Here we show that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Puma, is also metabolically regulated. Growth factor deprivation led to the loss of glucose uptake and induction of Puma. Maintenance of glucose uptake after growth factor withdrawal by expression of the glucose transporter, Glut1, however, suppressed Puma up-regulation and attenuated growth factor withdrawal-induced activation of Bax, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Conversely, glucose deprivation led to Puma induction even in the presence of growth factor. This regulation of Puma expression was a central component in cell death as a consequence of growth factor or glucose deprivation because Puma deficiency suppressed both of these cell death pathways. Puma induction in growth factor or glucose withdrawal was dependent on p53 in cell lines and in activated primary T lymphocytes because p53 deficiency suppressed Puma induction and delayed Bax and caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and loss of clonogenic survival. Importantly, although p53 levels did not change or were slightly reduced, p53 activity was suppressed by elevated glucose metabolism to inhibit Puma induction after growth factor withdrawal. These data show that p53 is metabolically regulated and that glucose metabolism initiates a signaling mechanism to inhibit p53 activation and suppress Puma induction, thus promoting an anti-apoptotic balance to Bcl-2 family protein expression that supports cell survival.

Hematopoietic cells depend on extrinsic growth factors to maintain viability and prevent death by neglect (1Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Nat.

This tight regulation of cell fate by the availability of growth factors is critical for hematopoietic homeostasis. Disturbance of the balance between cell death and cell survival can lead to diseases such as autoimmunity or cancer if growth factors are in excess and immunodeficiency if growth factors or their signaling mechanisms are limiting. In addition to survival, it has become clear that growth factors play prominent roles to regulate glucose uptake and metabolism (3Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N.

In hematopoietic cells, glucose is transported into cells through Glut1 and phosphorylated by mitochondrially bound hexokinase to become glucose-6-phosphate, which can then enter downstream pathways of glucose metabolism to generate energy as well as substrates for biosynthesis. Normally, when cells are withdrawn from growth factors, Glut1 is internalized and degraded in lysosomes, leading to decreased glucose uptake and metabolism prior to cell death (8Edinger A.L.

Cell. 2007; 18: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Activated lymphocytes dramatically induce glucose uptake (10Frauwirth K.A. Riley J.L. Harris M.H. Parry R.V. Rathmell J.C.

Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3611) Google Scholar). Recently, the maintenance of glucose metabolism has been implicated in the regulation of cell survival because the loss of glucose uptake can promote activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax to cause cell death (5Rathmell J.C.

Conversely, increased glucose metabolism or maintenance of glucose metabolism after growth factor withdrawal by expression of Glut1 alone or with HK1 was found to initiate a nutrient-dependent signaling pathway that phosphorylated and inactivated GSK-3 to protect cells from apoptosis (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The full mechanisms by which glucose metabolism may regulate cell death, however, are not certain.Bcl-2 family members are key regulators of apoptosis upon growth factor withdrawal, and anti-apoptotic glucose signaling may act through these proteins to affect cell death. In particular, growth factors can regulate the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1, a short-lived protein that is essential for hematopoietic cell survival (17Opferman J.T. Iwasaki H. Ong C.C.

Nature. 2003; 426: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). When cells are deprived of necessary growth factors, GSK-3 becomes activated and phosphorylates Mcl-1 to target it for proteasomal degradation (19Ding Q. He X. Hsu J.M. Xia W. Chen C.T. Li L.Y.

Glucose metabolism inhibits GSK-3 in highly glycolytic cells, however, preventing Mcl-1 phosphorylation and ubiquitination (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to regulation of Mcl-1, growth factor withdrawal leads to induction or activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family. In hematopoietic cells, the BH3-only protein Bim plays a critical role in the initiation of apoptosis in response to multiple death stimuli, including growth factor deprivation (23Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). The BH3-only protein, Puma, is also induced in growth factor-deprived hematopoietic cells, and cells deficient in Puma expression are resistant to death (24Ekoff M. Kaufmann T. Engstrom M. Motoyama N. Villunger A. Jonsson J.I. Strasser A. Nilsson G. Blood. 2007; 110: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Erlacher M. Labi V. Manzl C. Bock G. Tzankov A. Hacker G.

Mak T.W. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1657-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Importantly, the combined loss of Bim and Puma leads to greater cell survival than loss of the individual proteins, indicating that they play an additive and only partially redundant role in growth factor withdrawal-induced cell death (25Erlacher M. Labi V. Manzl C. Bock G. Tzankov A. Hacker G. Michalak E. Strasser A. Villunger A. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The effect of glucose metabolism on these pro-apoptotic proteins, however, remains unknown.The elevated glucose metabolism of activated lymphocytes and cancer cells may inhibit cell death through regulation of multiple Bcl-2 family members. Here we show that in addition to metabolic regulation of Mcl-1 by inhibition of GSK-3 (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Puma is also responsive to changes in glucose metabolism. Increased glucose uptake attenuated Puma up-regulation and cell death in growth factor withdrawn cells. In contrast, glucose deprivation led to Puma induction even in the presence of growth factor. Although p53 protein levels did not increase when cells were deprived of growth factor, p53 was required for Puma induction and growth factor withdrawal-induced activation of Bax, DNA fragmentation, and cell death of IL-3-dependent cell lines as well as activated primary T lymphocytes. Elevated glucose uptake, however, suppressed growth factor-regulated p53 activity, indicating that p53 is responsive to the cellular metabolic state. Together these data show that elevated glucose metabolism characteristic of aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells or activated lymphocytes is sufficient to initiate anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that both maintain Mcl-1 and suppress p53-dependent induction of Puma.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—Control, Glut1/HK1, and Bcl-xL expressing FL5.12 and 32D cells were generated and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 0.5 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-3 (PeproTech Inc.; Rocky Hill, NJ) as previously described (5Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed by nucleofection (Kit V; Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). For growth factor withdrawal, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline prior to resuspension in RPMI medium lacking IL-3. For glucose deprivations, the cells were washed three times and resuspended in glucose-free RPMI with addition of IL-3 and 10% dialyzed serum. Methyl-pyruvate (10 mm; Sigma) or etoposide (4 μm; Sigma) was added to some cultures.Primary T Cell Purification and Culture—T cells from wild type and p53 nullizygous mice (p53tm1Tyj; The Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) were purified via negative selection from spleen (StemSep, Vancouver, Canada) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA). T cell stimulation was achieved by culture of T cells on plates coated with 5 μg/ml anit-CD3ϵ (clone 145-2C11) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) (both from BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) with the addition of 5 ng/ml recombinate murine IL-2 (PeproTech Inc.) for 2 days. The cells were then washed off the plate and cultured on uncoated plates with IL-2 for two additional days. For IL-2 deprivation, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in medium in the absence of IL-2. Glucose deprivations were performed as described above except with IL-2 rather than IL-3.Plasmid Constructs—shRNAi plasmids were constructed using previously described approaches (27Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). shRNAi sequences were: Puma, GAGGGTCATGTACAATCTCTTCCTCGAGCAAGAGATTGTACATGACCCTC; p53 shRNAi-a, GAGTATCTGGAAGACAGGCAGACTTCCTCGAGCAAGTCTGCCTGTCTTCCAGATACTC. p53 shRNAi-b, GAGACACAATCCTCCCGGTCCCTTCCTCGAGCAAGGGACCGGGAGGATTGTGTCTC. The sequences of Bim and green fluorescent protein shRNAi have been previously described (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The sequences were cloned into pCR2.1 vector driven by the human U6 promoter as previously described (27Fox C.J. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Master S.R. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The p53 luciferase reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. Ratna Ray (St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO). The pHRGTK Renilla construct was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Datto (Duke University, Durham, NC).Glucose Uptake Assay—Glucose uptake was measured as previously described, with minor modifications (9Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were washed and resuspended in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (at pH 7.4, 136 mm NaCl, 4.7 ml KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm HEPES). 2-Deoxy-d-H3 glucose (2 μCi/reaction) was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of ice-cold 200 μm phloretin (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ) followed by centrifugation through an oil layer (1:1 Dow Corning 550 Silicon fluid from Motion Industries, Birmingham, AL; and dinonyl phthalate from Sigma-Aldrich). The cell pellets were washed and solubilized in 1 m NaOH, and radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter.Western Blots—The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors (BD Pharmingen) on ice for 10 min and precleared by centrifugation. The protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 35 μg of protein was run on a 10–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). Antibodies used were rabbit anti-Bim (BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-Puma (Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA), mouse anti-actin (Sigma), mouse anti-p53 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Bid (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-Bad (BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-Mcl-1 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-BiP (Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-p21 (BD Pharmingen), and rabbit anti-Bax (Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (Cell Signaling) and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse infrared-labeled antibody and were detected with ECL Plus (Pierce) or the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Licor). All of the images were uniformly contrasted, and some were digitally rearranged for ease of viewing (rearranged lanes indicated by spaces). For all immunoblots, the levels of proteins under analysis were quantified by normalization to actin and to the control sample. The numbers indicating these normalized quantifications of protein levels are presented under each lane throughout.Cell Death Assays—A FACScan (BD Biosciences) and FLowJo (TreeStar, Ashland, OR) were used to analyze uptake of propidium iodide (1 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Bax activation was determined as previously described (5Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and stained with anti-active conformation Bax antibody (clone 6A7; BD Pharmingen) in 100 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline followed by staining with anti-mouse IgG1-PE (BD Pharmingen). DNA fragmentation analysis by quantification of subdiploid cells was performed simultaneously with Bax activation by the addition of propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and RNase (Sigma) to fixed and permeabilized cells prior to flow cytometry. Caspase activation was determined by analysis of cell lysates for DEVDase activity as described (15Nutt L.K. Margolis S.S. Jensen M. Herman C.E. Dunphy W.G. Rathmell J.C. Kornbluth S. Cell. 2005; 123: 89-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed in triplicate for absorbance at 405 nm. The values given are Vmax values of absorbance over 30 min after start of reaction. Clonogenic survival was determined by culturing cells in the presence or absence of IL-3 for 12 h and then performing limiting dilution analysis of cell growth following readdition of IL-3 to determine the percentage of cells capable of responding to IL-3 readdition with clonogenic growth (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was done by using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and was analyzed on an iCycler. β2-Microglobulin was used as the internal control. Primers are: Puma, forward primer, AGACAAGAAGAGCAGCATCGACAC, and reverse primer, TAGGCACCTAGTTGGGCTCCATTT; β2-microglobulin, forward primer, ACCGGCCTGTATGCTATCCAGAAA, and reverse primer, GGTGAATTCAGTGTGAGCCAGGAT.Luciferase Assay—2.5 × 106 cells were transfected with 15 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of Renilla plasmid. 18 h after transfection, the cells were washed and cultured in the presence or absence of IL-3 for 9 h. The cells were then lysed, and activities of firefly and Renilla luciferase were analyzed by a luminometer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity to adjust for transfection efficiency.RESULTSIncreased Glucose Metabolism Attenuates Puma Up-regulation after Growth Factor Withdrawal—The early hematopoietic precursor cell line, FL5.12, is dependent on the cytokine IL-3 to maintain glucose metabolism and survival (6Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Control of glucose uptake, in particular, plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism and cell death. Prior to commitment to cell death, IL-3 withdrawal led to decreased glucose uptake in control cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). Expression of Glut1 and HK1 both elevated and sustained glucose uptake (Fig. 1A, right panel), rendering cells growth factor-independent for control of glucose uptake (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The increased and growth factor-independent glucose uptake capacity of Glut1- and HK1-expressing cells provided a model of highly glycolytic cancer cells and activated lymphocytes. By expressing only these metabolic genes, the effects of elevated glucose uptake could be directly observed independent of oncogene- or growth factor-stimulated changes in cell signaling pathways that may otherwise complicate analyses of the role of cell metabolism in cell fate determination. Thus whereas Glut1/HK1-expressing cells have an apparent exaggerated glucose uptake capacity relative to control cells and do not simply model growth factor-independent regulation of glucose uptake, they represent highly glycolytic cells. Differences between control and Glut1/HK1 cells, therefore, demonstrate how high rates of glucose metabolism may affect cell signaling and survival pathways. Consistent with the hypothesis that elevated glucose uptake may affect cell signaling and survival, maintenance of elevated glucose uptake was sufficient to inhibit the death of Glut1/HK1 cells withdrawn from IL-3 as determined by propidium iodide exclusion (Fig. 1B) as well by Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and a stringent clonogenicity assay (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).It was unclear whether in addition to regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1 (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), increased glucose metabolism affected pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins that are critical to initiate cell death upon growth factor withdrawal. To address this, control and Glut1/HK1 cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3 or withdrawn from IL-3 for 10 h, and the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma was analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 1, C and D). The BH3-only protein Bad was also analyzed, but the inactive phosphorylated form of Bad was undetectable, and endogenous unphosphorylated Bad was unchanged by IL-3 withdrawal or glucose uptake (data not shown). Levels of both Bim and Puma increased in control cells after IL-3 deprivation. Although control and Glut1/HK1 cells had similar induction of Bim, Puma up-regulation was attenuated in Glut1/HK1 cells. This suppression of Puma induction upon IL-3 withdrawal occurred in multiple independently derived cell clones that expressed Glut1 and HK1, either individually or together, when compared with control or Bcl-xL-expressing cells (Fig. 1E). Similar inhibition of Puma expression by elevated glucose uptake was also seen in other IL-3-dependent cell lines, such as 32D cells (Fig. 1F). These data suggest, therefore, that Puma induction after growth factor withdrawal is inhibited by elevated glucose metabolism.Increased Glucose Metabolism Depends on Inhibition of Puma to Attenuate Cell Death—Expression of Glut1 and HK1 attenuated the up-regulation of Puma, but not Bim, upon growth factor withdrawal, suggesting that Puma may play a role in glucose-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling. We have shown previously that expression of Bim was sufficient to induce cell death even in the presence of IL-3 (16Zhao Y. Altman B.J. Coloff J.L. Herman C.E. Jacobs S.R. Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Dimascio L.N. Ilkayeva O. Kelekar A. Reya T. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4328-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Puma has also been implicated in promoting cell death upon growth factor withdrawal (24Ekoff M. Kaufmann T. Engstrom M. Motoyama N. Villunger A. Jonsson J.I. Strasser A. Nilsson G. Blood. 2007; 110: 3209-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Erlacher M. Labi V. Manzl C. Bock G. Tzankov A. Hacker G. Michalak E. Strasser A. Villunger A. J. Exp.

Med. 2006; 203: 1657-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bim and Puma expression was required for cell death following growth factor withdrawal, the cells were transiently transfected with vector control, Bim, or Puma shRNAi. Protein levels were determined 1 day after transfection (Fig. 2A). The requirement for each protein in IL-3 withdrawal-induced cell death and glucose-mediated protection from this death pathway was next tested. A time course analysis of cell death by measurement of loss of cellular membrane integrity and uptake of the vital dye, propidium iodide (PI), showed that Bim deficiency delayed cell death in both control and Glut1/HK1 cells (Fig. 2B). Bim-deficient Glut1/HK1 cells remained more resistant to cell death, however, than Bim-deficient control cells, indicating that although Bim played a role in growth factor withdrawal-induced cell death, glucose metabolism provided additional protection from death. Inhibition of Puma expression also attenuated cell death as measured by PI uptake. Combined absence of Bim and Puma led to even greater ability to maintain membrane integrity and resist PI uptake. Consistent with these results suggesting roles for both Bim and Puma in regulation of apoptosis, analysis of control and Glut1/HK1 cells transfected with control, Bim, Puma, or Bim together with Puma shRNAi showed that both Bim and Puma are critical for Bax activation and DNA fragmentation following growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 2C). Therefore, inhibition of Puma induction appears to be a critical mechanism for glucose metabolism to protect cells against growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 2Increased glucose metabolism depends on inhibition of Puma induction to attenuate cell death. A, control (lanes C) and Glut1/HK1 (lanes GH) cells were transfected with control (Ctrl), Bim (top panel), or Puma (bottom panel) shRNAi plasmid, and expression was determined 10 h after IL-3 withdrawal. B and C, cell viability was analyzed over time after IL-3 withdrawal by uptake of the vital dye PI (B) and after 15 h by flow cytometric analysis (C) for active conformation Bax (top row) and DNA fragmentation (bottom row).

Recent studies have demonstrated that monomeric G proteins of the Ras family are key regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Using an invasive breast cancer cell lines, we demonstrate that the ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase classically associated with the Golgi, is an important regulator of the biological effects induced by epidermal growth factor. Here, we show that this ARF isoform is activated following epidermal growth factor stimulation and that, in MDA-MB-231 cells, ARF1 is found in dynamic plasma membrane ruffles. Inhibition of endogenous ARF1 expression results in the inhibition of breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. The underlying mechanism involves the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Our data demonstrate that depletion of ARF1 markedly impairs the recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit (p110α) to the plasma membrane, and the association of the regulatory subunit (p85α) to the activated receptor. These results uncover a novel molecular mechanism by which ARF1 regulates breast cancer cell growth and invasion during cancer progression.

Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1994; 29: 11-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). EGFR belongs to the ErbB family of membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that comprises four structurally related receptors, namely, the EGFR (HER-1 and HerB1), HER-2 (ErbB2 or Neu), HER-3/ErbB3, and HER-4/ErbB4 (6Normanno N. De Luca A. Bianco C. Strizzi L. Mancino M. Maiello M.R. Carotenuto A. De Feo G. Caponigro F. Salomon D.S. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 366: 2-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). With the exception of HER-2, which has no obvious ligand, these receptors bind to their ligands and become activated by homo-dimerization or hetero-dimerization and subsequent tyrosine autophosphorylation. The best-known ligands of EGFRs are EGF, transforming growth factor-α, and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (7Lo H.W. Hsu S.C. Hung M.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 95: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). epidermal growth factor receptor ADP-ribosylation factor epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein Kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase small interfering RNA receptor tyrosine kinase guanine nucleotide exchange factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin ARF1 mutant epidermal growth factor receptor ADP-ribosylation factor epidermal growth factor mitogen-activated protein Kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase small interfering RNA receptor tyrosine kinase guanine nucleotide exchange factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin ARF1 mutant EGFRs transmit extracellular mitogenic signals through the activation of a number of downstream signaling cascades. These include signaling modules that involve the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (8Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar). Although multiple forms of PI3K exist in higher eukaryotes, the class 1A enzymes are primarily responsible for production of D-3 phosphoinositides in response to ligand-dependent receptor stimulation and tyrosine-kinase activation. Over the past decade, it has become evident that the PI3K signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers, underscoring its central role in human carcinogenesis (8Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar). Class 1A PI3Ks are obligate heterodimers in vivo, because the p110 catalytic subunits are labile and unstable as monomers (9Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of a p110 subunit with a p85 regulatory subunit maintains the enzyme in a low activity state in quiescent cells. Activation requires translocation of the normally cytosolic enzyme to a membrane and direct interaction with an activated receptor (8Engelman J.A. Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2469) Google Scholar). The most commonly accepted mechanism for activation of class 1A PI3K by RTKs involves the binding of SH2 domains in p85 to phosphorylated YXXM motifs of activated receptors or their substrates (10Rordorf-Nikolic T.

This process is believed to be involved in invasion and metastasis. As cells migrate, intracellular signaling cascades are activated to promote remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to form membrane protrusions. Small GTPases of the Rho and ARF families have been characterized as key players regulating this process. These cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form through the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (12Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 579-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). ARF proteins consist of a family of six isoforms, and of these, ARF1 and ARF6 are the best characterized. ARF1 is classically associated with the Golgi to regulate vesicle trafficking, whereas ARF6 is present at the plasma membrane, where it is involved in receptor endocytosis and actin remodeling (13D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Fifteen ARF-GEFs are encoded in the human genome (14Casanova J.E. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The large number of these regulatory proteins compared with the relatively small number of ARFs suggests that activation of these GTPases is under extensive regulatory control. ARF6 is overexpressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells and plays an essential role during invasion (15Hashimoto S. Onodera Y. Hashimoto A. Tanaka M. Hamaguchi M. Yamada A. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Morishige M. Hashimoto S. Ogawa E. Toda Y. Kotani H. Hirose M. Wei S. Hashimoto A. Yamada A. Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kodama H. Nio Y. Manabe T. Wada H. Kobayashi H. Sabe H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently, GEP100 was identified as the ARF-GEF linking the EGFR to ARF6 activation in breast cancer cells (16Morishige M. Hashimoto S. Ogawa E. Toda Y. Kotani H. Hirose M. Wei S. Hashimoto A. Yamada A. Yano H. Mazaki Y. Kodama H. Nio Y. Manabe T. Wada H. Kobayashi H. Sabe H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AMAP1 was reported to act as an effector of ARF6-GTP during invasion of glioblastomas and lung tumors (17Hashimoto S. Hirose M. Hashimoto A. Morishige M. Yamada A. Hosaka H. Akagi K. Ogawa E. Oneyama C. Agatsuma T. Okada M. Kobayashi H. Wada H. Nakano H. Ikegami T. Nakagawa A. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7036-7041Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the regulation of invasion by ARF6 is dependent on the activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) (18Tague S.E. Muralidharan V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of ARF6 during cancer progression. Several reports have suggested that ARF1 can also be present on plasma membranes and transmit signal from transmembrane proteins (17Hashimoto S. Hirose M. Hashimoto A. Morishige M. Yamada A.

To better define the role of this ARF isoform in breast cancer development and progression, we examined whether ARF1 can regulate migration and proliferation of invasive cell lines. Our study demonstrates that ARF1 is localized to dynamic plasma membrane ruffles together with the EGFR, and this ARF isoform is activated following EGF stimulation. This small GTPase is critical for both cell migration and proliferation by directly regulating the activation of the PI3K pathway. These findings reveal an unexpected role for ARF1 in the regulation of cancer cell migration and proliferation.

DNA Plasmids and siRNAs—ARF1-FLAG was a gift from Dr. Jean-Luc Parent (University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). ARF1-GFP and ARF3-GFP plasmids were previously described (23Chun J. Shapovalova Z. Dejgaard S.Y. Presley J.F. Melancon P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3488-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). siRNA-insensitive ARF1 mutant (ARF1mut) was constructed by introducing silent mutations (aatatttttgca), which contained an Ssp1 site into nucleotide sequence 7–18 (amino acids 3–6) of wild-type ARF1 (pBKΔ) by PCR. All constructs were analyzed by DNA sequencing (Sequencing service, IRIC, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Double-stranded scrambled, ARF1, and ARF6 (#1) siRNAs, with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ dTdT overhangs were previously described (24Houndolo T. Boulay P.L. Claing A. J. Biol.

Cell. 2007; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide sequence for the second siRNA targeting ARF1 (#2) was 5′-gaaatgcgcatcctcatggtgg-3′ corresponding to region 50–71 of the human ARF1 mRNA. All siRNA were synthesized using the Silencer™ siRNA Construction Kit from Ambion (Austin, TX). Cell Culture and Transfection—MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and MCF10a cells were obtained from Dr. Sylvie Mader (University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada), and MDA-MB-435 were provided by Dr. Morag Park (McGill University, Quebec, Canada). Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and SKBR3 cells) or in mammary epithelium basal medium supplemented with 0.52 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 10 ng/ml recombinant EGF, 10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, and 0.1 μg/ml amphotericin B (MCF10a cells). Cells were transfected with DNA (48 h) and/or siRNA (72 h) using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested in 60 μl of TGH buffer (pH 7.3, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 nm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA) complemented with protease inhibitors and 1 nm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were solubilized (4 °C, 1 h), and total soluble proteins were run on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blotted for relevant proteins using specific primary antibodies (described for each experiment). Secondary antibodies were all fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, and fluorescence was detected using a Typhoon 9410 scanner (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the digital images obtained was performed using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Real-time PCR—For real-time reverse transcription-PCR, 5 μg of total mRNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with random primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Gene expression level was determined using primers and probe sets from Applied Biosystems (ABI Gene Expression Assays). PCR reactions for 384-well plate formats were performed using 2 μl of cDNA samples (20–50 ng), 5 μl of the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 μl of the TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (20×), and 2.5 μl of water in a total volume of 10 μl. The ABI PRISM® 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) was used to detect the amplification level and was programmed to an initial step of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. All reactions were run in triplicate, and the average values were used for quantification. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β-actin, and 18 S ribosomal RNA were used as endogenous controls. Primers for ARFs were the following: ARF1, gccactacttccagaacacaca (forward) and ctcgttcacacgctctctgt (reverse); ARF3, cgcagctgatagcaggaac (forward) and ctgctttctggggacagtg (reverse); ARF4, catgggcctcactatctcct (forward) and gcagcatccaatccaacc (reverse); ARF5, tcttcgggaagaagcagatg (forward) and aagcctatggttgggatggt (reverse); and ARF6, gactgcaaaggcagtatacagga (forward) and accatgatatcccgctcaat (reverse). Activation of ARF1 and ARF6—Cells were plated into 6-well dishes and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated times, and activation of ARF1 and ARF6 was measured as described previously (25Cotton M. Boulay P.L. Houndolo T. Vitale N. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 60 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer E. Samples were incubated for 30 min (4 °C) and spun for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. GST-GGA3-(1–316) (26Giguere P. Rochdi M.D. Laroche G. Dupre E. Whorton M.R. Sunahara R.K. Claing A. Dupuis G. Parent J.L. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to each tube, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Proteins were eluted in 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer by heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Detection of ARF1-GTP and ARF6-GTP was performed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-ARF1 or anti-ARF6 antibody. Confocal Microscopy—MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with ARF1-FLAG or ARF6-HA constructs were serum-starved for 1 h, stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) as indicated, and fixed using paraformaldehyde (4%) for 15 min at room temperature. Overexpressed ARF1-FLAG or ARF6-HA were detected using a polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody and a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 568 or a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and an anti-mouse antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 568, respectively. In some experiments, cells were subsequently incubated with Phalloidin-488 for 1 h. In a second set of experiments, the secondary antibody used to detect ARF1-FLAG was coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488. These cells were subsequently incubated with a p115 antibody (monoclonal) and a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 568. For labeling of the EGFR, cells were transiently transfected with siRNA directed against ARF1 (together with 5 nm of an Alexa-Fluor 546-labeled control siRNA (24Houndolo T. Boulay P.L. Claing A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5598-5604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or with a scrambled siRNA (25 nm for 72 h). Cells were washed once and incubated with biotinylated EGF complexed with Alexa-Fluor 488 streptavidin (EGF-488, 5 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. For internalization experiments, cells were simply incubated with the EGF-488 for 20 min, and fixed. Alternatively, cells were labeled with a polyclonal anti-EGFR or a polyclonal anti-phospho-EGFR (Y1148), and a secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488. All fixed cells were mounted onto slides using Gel Tol mounting medium. All images were acquired using a 63× oil immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), at room temperature, on a Zeiss LSM-510 META laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Assessment of receptor levels at the plasma membrane was performed using the analytical functions of MetaMorph software. Images obtained from five cells (two different experiments) were analyzed for each condition (control and ARF1-depleted cells). Briefly, cells were labeled as described above (polyclonal anti-EGFR antibody and secondary anti-rabbit antibody coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488), and images were acquired on the confocal microscope. For each image, 10 areas of the plasma membrane of identical size, per cell, were examined using MetaMorph. EGFR levels correspond to the average fluorescence intensity determined for each condition. Wound Healing Assay—8 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-wells plates, transfected with a scrambled or ARF1 siRNA (25 nm for 72 h), and serum-starved for 24 h. Three scratches were performed using a micropipette tip to wound confluent cells. Cells were subsequently treated with EGF and fixed after 6 h using paraformaldehyde and stained using crystal violet (0.1% in 20% MeOH, overnight). Pictures of five different fields were taken, and a representative picture is presented for each condition. Migration Assay—Cells were transfected with siRNA (72 h) or plasmid DNA (48 h) and serum starved 24 h before the assay as in a previous study (25Cotton M. Boulay P.L. Houndolo T. Vitale N. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and seeded into Boyden chambers (24-well inserts with 8-μm pore, coated with collagen). One hour after plating, cells were stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml). After 6 h, cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde and incubated with crystal violet. Membranes were washed (dH2O), cells present in the upper chamber were removed, and migrated cells were quantified in the lower chamber. For some experiments, cells were pretreated with PD98059 or LY294002 (15 μm) for 30 min before EGF (10 ng/ml) stimulation. Growth Assay—Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA (72 h) or plasmid DNA (48 h), and serum-starved for 24 h. Equal amounts of cells were reseeded into 10-cm dishes. After 1 h, for some experiments, cells were pretreated with PD98059 or LY294002 (15 μm) for 30 min, and then stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) or left untreated. 24 h later, the media was changed for fresh complete media, and all sets of cells were left for 4 days. Cells were counted for each condition. Co-immunoprecipitation—MDA-MB-231 cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml, 37 °C) for the indicated times. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were described previously (25Cotton M. Boulay P.L. Houndolo T. Vitale N. Pitcher J.A. Claing A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed into TGH buffer (60 μl) and EGFR was immunoprecipitated using the anti-EGFR antibody. Interacting p85α was assessed by Western blot analysis. p110α Membrane Recruitment—MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA, ARF1 siRNA, or ARF1 siRNA, and ARF1mut were serum-starved and stimulated with EGF (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were then harvested in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing protease inhibitors. Cell membranes were disrupted by passing three times through a 27G1/2 syringe. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g to discard the nucleus and cellular debris, and the supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C), to separate cytosolic and membrane fractions. Membrane pellets were then lysed for 10 min in 100 μl of ice-cold TGH buffer. Samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies (anti-p110α and anti-Akt). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using either a one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism (version 4.0a, San Diego, CA). EGF Stimulation Promotes the Transient Activation of ARF1 and ARF6—To determine whether stimulation of endogenously expressed EGFR led to the activation of ARF1 and/or ARF6 in invasive breast cancer cells, we first examined levels of GTP-bound ARFs. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGF treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in the rapid and transient activation of endogenous ARF6 and ARF1, where maximal levels of GTP binding were detected after 30 and 60 s, respectively. To assess the role of endogenous ARF1 in EGF-dependent cellular responses, we designed siRNAs that specifically targeted the human ARF1 sequence and tested their effects on MDA-MB-231 cells. As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1A, transfection of either ARF1 siRNA (#1 and #2) reduced the expression of ARF1 without affecting ARF6 levels. Western blot analysis revealed that the minimal concentration of siRNA (ARF1#1) to produce the maximal inhibition of ARF1 expression (90%) was 25 nm (supplemental Fig. S1B), and the optimal time of transfection to achieve this inhibition was 3 days (supplemental Fig. S1C). Efficacy of siRNA transfection for these conditions was over 90%, and cell viability assessed by Trypan blue was similar in scrambled and ARF1 siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). Because no commercial antibodies are available to examine expression levels of other ARF isoforms, we next quantified mRNA levels of all ARF isoforms using real-time PCR. As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1D, only ARF1 mRNA levels were reduced in ARF1 siRNA (25 nm, 72h)-transfected cells. To control for siRNA off-target effects, we designed an ARF1 mutant insensitive to ARF1 siRNA #1 (ARF1mut). As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1E, expression of ARF1mut in cells transfected with ARF1 siRNA resulted in ARF1 expression levels similar to those observed under control conditions. Finally, we confirmed the specificity of the ARF1 antibody against ARF3, because these two isoforms are highly homologous. As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S1F, the anti-ARF1 antibody does not detect overexpressed GFP-tagged ARF3. Additional transfection experiments with ARF6 siRNA reduced expression of this ARF isoform by 80% in MDA-MB-231 cells (supplemental Fig. S1G). Using the siRNA strategy, we next investigated whether the activation of ARF1 was necessary for the activation of ARF6, and vice versa. It was previously suggested that activated ARF6 recruits ARNO family GEFs for further activation of other ARF isoforms (20Cohen L.A. Honda A. Varnai P. Brown F.D. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2244-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1B, depletion of ARF6 did not affect ARF1 activation following EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, ARF1 depletion did not affect the ability of the EGFR to activate ARF6 suggesting that these two GTP-binding proteins are activated independently following EGF stimulation. ARF1 and ARF6 Are Both Localized to the Plasma Membrane of MDA-MB-231 Cells—We next examined the cellular distribution of ARF1 and ARF6. As presented in Fig. 2A, ARF1-FLAG is found inside the cytoplasm, but also present on dynamic plasma membrane ruffles, co-localizing with actin. Scanning of the cells, at different confocal planes, confirmed that ARF1-FLAG is present at the Golgi complex where it colocalizes with p115 (supplemental Fig. S2). EGF stimulation led to the formation of membrane protrusions but had no significant effect on the cellular distribution of this ARF isoform, which remained associated with ruffling areas. As expected, overexpressed ARF6-HA associated primarily with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Altogether, these data demonstrate that localization of ARF1 to dynamic plasma membrane ruffles is consistent with signaling events emanating from the cell surface. ARF1 Regulates the EGF-dependent Migration and Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 Cells—Breast cancer cell migration is an important cellular process necessary for metastasis. The role of ARF6 in regulating cellular invasiveness has been previously demonstrated (15Hashimoto S. Onodera Y. Hashimoto A. Tanaka M. Hamaguchi M. Yamada A. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6647-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Tague S.E. Muralidharan V. D'Souza-Schorey C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9671-9676Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore focused on ARF1 and next investigated whether this ARF isoform can also act to control cell migration. As expected, EGF stimulation increased the motility and invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells in the wound healing assay as well as in the collagen-coated Boyden chamber assay (Fig. 3). Depletion of ARF1 completely abolished the EGF-dependent effects (Fig. 3, A and B), which was reversed by overexpressing an siRNA-insensitive ARF1 mutant (ARF1mut). Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type ARF1 (1.6-fold, 44% transfection efficiency) increased EGF-promoted migration (Fig. 3C), while overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of ARF1, ARF1T31N (1.5-fold, 63% efficiency), prevented EGF-stimulated cell migration.

https://openalex.org/W1996713447,"The phospholipid-binding annexin A2 (AnxA2) is known to play a role in the regulation of membrane and actin dynamics, in particular in the endocytic pathway. The protein is present on early endosomes, where it regulates membrane traffic, including the biogenesis of multivesicular transport intermediates destined for late endosomes. AnxA2 membrane association depends on the protein N terminus and membrane cholesterol but does not involve the AnxA2 ligand p11/S100A10. However, the precise mechanisms that control AnxA2 membrane association and function are not clear. In the present study, we have investigated the role of AnxA2 N-terminal phosphorylation in controlling association to endosomal membranes and functions. We found that endosomal AnxA2 was partially tyrosine-phosphorylated and that mutation of Tyr-23 to Ala (AnxA2Y23A), but not of Ser-25 to Ala, impaired AnxA2 endosome association. We then found that the AnxA2Y23A mutant was unable to bind endosomes in vivo, whereas a phospho-mimicking AnxA2 mutant (Y23D) showed efficient endosome binding capacity. Similarly, we found that AnxA2Y23D interacted more efficiently with liposomes in vitro when compared with AnxA2Y23A. To investigate the role of Tyr-23 in vivo, AnxA2 was knocked down with small interfering RNAs, and then cells were recomplemented with RNA interference-resistant forms of the protein. Using this strategy, we could show that AnxA2Y23D, but not AnxA2Y23A, could restore early-to-late endosome transport after AnxA2 depletion. We conclude that phosphorylation of Tyr-23 is essential for proper endosomal association and function of AnxA2, perhaps because it stabilizes membrane-associated protein via a conformational change. The phospholipid-binding annexin A2 (AnxA2) is known to play a role in the regulation of membrane and actin dynamics, in particular in the endocytic pathway. The protein is present on early endosomes, where it regulates membrane traffic, including the biogenesis of multivesicular transport intermediates destined for late endosomes. AnxA2 membrane association depends on the protein N terminus and membrane cholesterol but does not involve the AnxA2 ligand p11/S100A10. However, the precise mechanisms that control AnxA2 membrane association and function are not clear. In the present study, we have investigated the role of AnxA2 N-terminal phosphorylation in controlling association to endosomal membranes and functions. We found that endosomal AnxA2 was partially tyrosine-phosphorylated and that mutation of Tyr-23 to Ala (AnxA2Y23A), but not of Ser-25 to Ala, impaired AnxA2 endosome association. We then found that the AnxA2Y23A mutant was unable to bind endosomes in vivo, whereas a phospho-mimicking AnxA2 mutant (Y23D) showed efficient endosome binding capacity. Similarly, we found that AnxA2Y23D interacted more efficiently with liposomes in vitro when compared with AnxA2Y23A. To investigate the role of Tyr-23 in vivo, AnxA2 was knocked down with small interfering RNAs, and then cells were recomplemented with RNA interference-resistant forms of the protein. Using this strategy, we could show that AnxA2Y23D, but not AnxA2Y23A, could restore early-to-late endosome transport after AnxA2 depletion. We conclude that phosphorylation of Tyr-23 is essential for proper endosomal association and function of AnxA2, perhaps because it stabilizes membrane-associated protein via a conformational change. Annexin family proteins, which can bind membranes via negatively charged phospholipids and Ca2+ ions (1Futter C.E. White I.J. Traffic. 2007; 8: 951-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), are considered as scaffolding proteins that can participate in and/or regulate membrane dynamics and organization (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 3Rescher U. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Annexin A2 (AnxA2), 2The abbreviations used are: AnxA2, annexin A2; BHK, baby hamster kidney cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PA, phosphatidic acid; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; WT, wild type. a well characterized member of this family, is composed of a non-folded and hypervariable N-terminal domain and of a very conserved C-terminal domain, which bears the common characteristics of annexins, including Ca2+-binding site and annexin repeats. The N terminus of AnxA2 binds p11/S100A10, the light chain of AnxA2, leading to the formation of the (AnxA2)2-(p11)2 heterotetramer (4Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). AnxA2 N terminus also bears two phosphorylation sites, on Tyr-23 and Ser-25, which are presumably targets of Src kinase and protein kinase C, respectively (5Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 6Glenney Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 192: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Isacke C.M. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), but their precise role(s) are still under debate. The phosphorylation of Ser-25 may play a role in vesicle/granule aggregation (8Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Regnouf F. Sagot I. Delouche B. Devilliers G. Cartaud J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of Tyr-23 by Src kinase was proposed to act either as a targeting signal for the plasma membrane together with p11 (10Deora A.B. Kreitzer G. Jacovina A.T. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol.

Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The presence of AnxA2 at the plasma membrane may also facilitate tyrosine phosphorylation (13Bellagamba C. Hubaishy I. Bjorge J.D. Fitzpatrick S.L. Fujita D.J. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3195-3199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been proposed to regulate actin AnxA2-related functions (14Rescher U. Ludwig C. Konietzko V. Kharitonenkov A. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), notably in polarized epithelial cells (15de Graauw M. Tijdens I. Smeets M.B. Hensbergen P.J. Deelder A.M. van de Water B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, AnxA2 has been identified as a Lyn kinase target after oxidative stress, and phosphorylation was proposed to induce AnxA2 relocalization to the endoplasmic reticulum (16Matsuda D. Nakayama Y. Horimoto S. Kuga T. Ikeda K. Kasahara K. Yamaguchi N. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In fibroblastic cells or non-endothelial cells, AnxA2 is present at the plasma membrane, in the cytosol, and also on early endosomes (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 17Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Knockdown experiments by RNAi have shown that AnxA2 is involved in early endosome membrane dynamics along the recycling (18Zobiack N. Rescher U. Ludwig C. Zeuschner D. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4896-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and degradation pathways (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In particular, AnxA2 was shown to be required for the biogenesis of multivesicular transport intermediates destined for late endosomes (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast to other annexins, the endosomal association of AnxA2 does not depend on Ca2+ (17Emans N. Gorvel J.P. Walter C. Gerke V. Kellner R. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or p11 binding and heterotetramer formation (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but on membrane cholesterol (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 23Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AnxA2 shows a non-random distribution on early endosomal membranes, presumably corresponding to cholesterol-AnxA2 platforms or domains (22Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In addition, AnxA2 membrane association also requires the N terminus of the protein (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Harder T.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3931-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the Tyr-23 and Ser-25 phosphorylation sites. In the present study, we have analyzed the putative role of the phosphorylation of the AnxA2 N-terminal part in its association to early endosomes and in its endosomal functions. We show that purified endosomal AnxA2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and, by the use of phosphorylation mutants, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of tyrosine 23 is required for a proper AnxA2 targeting to early endosome. Moreover, using a siRNA phenotype rescuing, we demonstrate that the AnxA2 function in the endosomal transport is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation. We conclude that AnxA2 endosomal binding properties as well as the AnxA2 endosomal function are directly linked to tyrosine, but not serine, phosphorylation. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) and HeLa cells were grown as described previously (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Petiot A. Faure J. Stenmark H. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody against Rab5 was a gift from R. Jahn (Göttingen, Germany), and monoclonal antibodies against AnxA2 (HH7 and H28) and p11 (H21) were gifts from V. Gerke (Münster, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against EEA1 (early endosomal antigen 1) and Lamp1 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) were from Alexis Biochemicals and Affinity BioReagents, respectively. The monoclonal antibody against GFP was from Roche Diagnostics, the monoclonal antibody against transferrin receptor was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and the monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine was from Transduction Laboratories (PY20) and Upstate Biotechnology (4G10). The monoclonal antibody against actin and polyclonal antibody against anti-phosphoserine were from AbCam. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rab7 was described (26Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H.

Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad, and Cy2-, Cy3-, and Cy5-conjugated fluorescent secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The 10-kDa fluorescent fluid phase marker rhodamine-dextran was from Molecular Probes. F-actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 486 nm-coupled phalloidin from Invitrogen. All lipids and latrunculin B were from Sigma. Plasmids, Recombinant Proteins, and RNAi—cDNA plasmid coding for human AnxA2A65EGFP was a gift from V. Gerke (Münster, Germany). This plasmid is referred as AnxA2wtGFP in this report. From this cDNA, we cloned several mutants of AnxA2GFP by mutagenesis: AnxA2dmtGFP (AnxA2Y23AS25AGFP), in which Tyr-23 and Ser-25 were replaced by alanine, AnxA2Y23AGFP, AnxA2Y23DGFP, and AnxA2S25AGFP. Similar recombinant AnxA2 constructions were obtained by cloning these cDNAs in pGEX-5X-1-expressing vector (Clontech), and GST-protein was produced in BL21 bacteria strain. The GST tag was removed by factor Xa cleavage and benzamidine treatment (Amersham Biosciences). The quality of recombinant protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. For mock-treated controls in RNAi experiments, we used vesicular stomatitis virus, protein G (VSV-G) siRNA. AnxA2 down-regulation was obtained by Dicer-generated siRNA duplexes (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, an amplicon of the target sequence (nucleotides 1–320 from human AnxA2 cDNA, PCR oligonucleotides for T7-promoter based cloning: 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAA GGG AGA ATG TCT ACT GTT CAC G-3′, sense, and 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GAC TGA GCA GGT GTC TTC-3′, antisense) was transcribed in vitro to generate double-stranded RNA; dicing reaction and diced siRNAs purification were done accordingly to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). HeLa and BHK cells were transfected 6 h after seeding with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) for cDNA (total time of overexpression: 48 h) and with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), 24 h after seeding, for RNAi experiments (total time for silencing: 72 h). In Vivo Endocytic Transport Assay—Cells were grown on coverslips and then incubated with 3 mg/ml rhodamine-dextran for 10 min at 37 °C in Glasgow minimum essential medium containing 10 mm Hepes. Alternatively, cells were reincubated in marker-free medium for an additional 40 min at 37 °C. Then, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence, as below. Microscopy—Cells cultured on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline with 10% serum buffer except when using special permeabilization buffer, before fixation, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm Hepes, pH 6.9. Pictures were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope, equipped with a ×63 Plan-Neofluar objective, or with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 Plan-Apochromat objective and HeNe1, HeNe2, and argon lasers. To quantify the colocalization between EEA1 and AnxA2GFP fusion proteins, we counted the number of EEA1-positive structures that also contained AnxA2GFP per 100 μm2 in each focal plane. Similarly, the number of vesicles containing Lamp1 and rhodamine-dextran (after pulse-chase internalization as above) after mock treatment and AnxA2-RNAi with or without AnxA2 cDNAs was quantified by counting the number of vesicles containing both markers per 100 μm2 in each focal plane. Subcellular Fractionation—Early and late endosomes were purified as described previously (28Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The analysis of total membranes and cytosol was carried out by high speed centrifugation of postnuclear supernatants (70,000 rpm for 30 min). Membranes and cytosol were recovered from the high speed pellet and high speed supernatant, respectively. Biochemical Analysis—Total cell lysates were prepared using TNE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and protease inhibitors (10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) and 1% Nonidet P-40. For immunoprecipitation assays, this lysis buffer was supplemented with 10% glycerol. Briefly, cell extracts or purified endosomes from transfected BHK or HeLa cells were diluted with TNE buffer to a final Nonidet P-40 concentration of 1%, complemented with 4 μg of anti-GFP antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with TNE buffer with 10% glycerol and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, using 12% acrylamide gels, and Western blotting. For p11 Western blotting analysis, polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes were used. Western blotting was carried out using the SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce); exposure times were always within the linear range of detection. Chemiluminescent signal was quantified with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Annexin A2 Binding to Liposomes—Five μg of purified recombinant protein (AnxA2wt, AnxA2Y23A, AnxA2Y23D) were incubated with liposomes containing phosphatidic acid (PA):phosphatidylethanolamine (PE):cholesterol (2:2:1) in 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl buffer, 5 μm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mg/ml cytosol prepared from BHK cells, phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm NaF and 10 mm orthovanadate), and an ATP-regenerating system for 30 min at 4 °C (30Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 31Tuomikoski T. Felix M.A. Doree M. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1989; 342: 942-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the mixture was further incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, as indicated. The binding reaction was stopped by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Liposome-bound and free recombinant protein was separated by ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C and analyzed by SDS gels and Western blotting with the monoclonal H28 antibody was used against recombinant AnxA2. In immunoprecipitation experiments, liposomes after floatation were mixed with TNE buffer, brought to a final Nonidet P-40 concentration of 1%, complemented with 2 μg of anti-AnxA2 antibody H28 and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with TNE buffer with 10% glycerol and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Endosomal AnxA2 Is Phosphorylated on Tyr-23—To investigate the possible role of AnxA2 phosphorylation in endosome association, cells were transfected with AnxA2 tagged with GFP (AnxA2wtGFP), which shows the same distribution as the endogenous protein (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation from total HeLa cell lysates with anti-GFP antibodies, phosphorylated AnxA2 could be revealed by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine, but not anti-phosphoserine, antibodies (Fig. 1A). As a control, we mutated the two known N-terminal phosphorylation sites Tyr-23 and Ser-25 to Ala (double mutant Y23A/S25A, AnxA2dmtGFP). Although expressed to the same levels as the WT protein, the mutant showed no detectable levels of phosphorylation after immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A). It thus appears that unstimulated cells contain AnxA2 phosphorylated on Tyr-23, but perhaps not on Ser-25, under steady state conditions. Using a well established fractionation protocol (28Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), early endosome fractions were prepared from BHK cells transfected with AnxA2wtGFP. The recovery of early endosomes containing the early endosome markers Rab5 and its effector EEA1, but not the late endosome marker Rab7, was not affected by AnxA2wtGFP expression (Fig. 1B). Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphoserine antibodies revealed that a fraction of endosomal AnxA2wtGFP was phosphorylated on Tyr (Fig. 1C, right panel) but apparently not on serine (not shown). Efficient Endosome Targeting Depends on AnxA2 Phosphorylation— Next, we investigated whether phosphorylation plays a role in the regulation of endosomal membrane binding and analyzed the subcellular distribution of WT and mutant protein by confocal microscopy. The WT protein was present in the cytosol and colocalized with EEA1 on early endosomes (Fig. 2A, arrowheads), as expected (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Aniento F. Emans N. Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). By contrast, the mutant protein was predominantly cytosolic and showed little colocalization with EEA1 (Fig. 2A, arrowheads, the yellow color in the merge reflects the overlap between cytosolic AnxA2dmtGFP and EEA1 punctae), as illustrated by the quantification of WT and mutant AnxA2 colocalization with EEA1 (Fig. 2B). After homogenization and high speed centrifugation, AnxA2wtGFP was enriched ∼2-fold in membranes when compared with the cytosol fraction, like endogenous AnxA2 (Fig. 2C, quantification in the inset), as expected (23Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By contrast, AnxA2dmtGFP showed the opposite distribution, being enriched ∼2-fold in cytosol (Fig. 2C, quantification in the inset), in good agreement with our microscopy analysis (Fig. 2A). Finally, after endosome preparation by subcellular fractionation, both AnxA2wtGFP and AnxA2dmtGFP copurified with endogenous AnxA2 and the transferrin receptor and to a lesser extent with Rab7; AnxA2wtGFP was somewhat more abundant in late endosomes after overexpression (Fig. 2D). Strikingly, however, early endosomes contained roughly half as much AnxA2dmtGFP when compared with AnxA2wtGFP (Fig. 2D, quantification in the inset), although the two proteins were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these observations show that membrane association of AnxA2 is impaired after mutagenesis of its phosphorylation sites. Annexin A2 Tyrosine Phosphorylation Is Required for Endosomal Association—To identify which phosphorylation site, Tyr-23 or Ser-25, was necessary for endosome membrane association, we constructed two AnxA2 single-point mutants, AnxA2Y23AGFP and AnxA2S25AGFP, in which Tyr-23 or Ser-25 had been mutated. Equal amounts of AnxA2wtGFP, AnxA2Y23AGFP, and AnxA2S25AGFP could be detected in total cell lysates (Fig. 3A). However, after high speed centrifugation, AnxA2S25AGFP showed the same distribution as the WT protein, being more abundant than AnxA2Y23AGFP (Fig. 3B). Similarly, after subcellular fractionation, AnxA2S25AGFP and the WT protein were equally abundant on endosomes (Fig. 3A). By contrast, AnxA2Y23AGFP was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A) and showed the same distribution as the double phosphorylation mutant (Fig. 2D). To further investigate the role of Tyr-23 phosphorylation, we generated a phospho-mimicking mutant by replacing the tyrosine residue with an aspartic acid (AnxA2Y23DGFP). When analyzed by light microscopy, the two tyrosine mutants of AnxA2 (AnxA2Y23AGFP and AnxA2Y23DGFP) showed very different behavior. AnxA2Y23AGFP was predominantly cytosolic (Fig. 4A, quantification in Fig. 4B), like the double mutant (Fig. 2A). By contrast, AnxA2Y23DGFP showed essentially the same distribution as the WT protein. This mutant colocalized extensively with EEA1 on early endosomes, perhaps even more so than the WT protein (Fig. 4A, quantification in Fig. 4B). Similarly, AnxA2Y23DGFP, but not AnxA2Y23AGFP, showed the same distribution as the WT protein after fractionation (Fig. 4C). Altogether, these observations demonstrate that endosome membrane association depends on Tyr-23 phosphorylation of AnxA2. Annexin A2 Binding to Liposomes—AnxA2 exhibits the intrinsic capacity to bind negatively charged phospholipids via its C-terminal core domain, presumably in a calcium-dependent manner (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar), and association to the endosomes depends on membrane cholesterol (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Consistently, the purified recombinant form of AnxA2wt (Fig. 5A) was able to bind efficiently liposomes containing PA, PE, and cholesterol after incubation for 30 min at 4 °C (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (not shown). AnxA2wt also bound liposomes in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 5B) with the same efficiency as without cytosol (not shown). In these experiments, we used the H28 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the AnxA2 fusion proteins but not endogenous AnxA2 (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Johnsson N. Johnsson K. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similarly, AnxA2Y23A and AnxA2Y23D (Fig. 5A), which both contain an intact C terminus, showed the same liposome binding capacity as the WT protein in the presence (Fig. 5B, quantification in Fig. 5C) or absence (not shown) of cytosol, ATP, and phosphatase inhibitors at 4 °C. AnxA2wt was then incubated with liposomes in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and phosphatase inhibitors for 3 h at 37 °C. Liposomes were retrieved by floatation, and AnxA2 was immunoprecipitated from the liposome fraction with the H28 anti-AnxA2 antibody, which only recognizes the recombinant protein. Immunoblotting of the precipitate with antibodies against phosphotyrosine showed that recombinant AnxA2wt bound to liposomes had been efficiently phosphorylated during the in vitro incubation (Fig. 5D). Under these conditions, AnxA2wt was indeed detected on the liposomes (Fig. 5B, lower panel), and binding occurred with an efficiency similar to that observed at 4 °C (Fig. 5C). It is not easy to compare directly the absolute amounts of AnxA2wt bound at 4 and 37 °C because the protein interacts with lipids and because bilayer fluidity is different at these temperatures. However, these experiments unambiguously show that AnxA2 is phosphorylated when bound to liposomes. Strikingly, liposome association of AnxA2Y23A and AnxA2Y23D were significantly decreased and increased, respectively (Fig. 5B, quantification in Fig. 5C) after 3 h at 37 °C. This may reflect differences in the capacity of each mutant to interact with putative cytosolic partners. However, both mutants interacted with the AnxA2 light chain p11 with the same efficiency as the WT protein (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that p11 is unlikely to regulate membrane association, in accordance with our previous findings (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We also found that actin, another well established AnxA2 partner, interacted preferentially with AnxA2Y23D when compared with AnxA2Y23A or with the WT protein (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that Tyr-23 phosphorylation regulates interactions with actin. Conversely, however, AnxA2 membrane association is unlikely to be controlled by interactions with actin because actin depolymerization with latrunculin B did not affect AnxA2 binding to endosomes (supplemental Fig. S2). Thus, the simplest interpretation of our observations is that the Y23D mutation, and presumably Tyr-23 phosphorylation, increases membrane association at 37 °C, when membrane fluidity is high, by causing a conformational change that stabilizes the protein onto the membrane. Consistently, we observed that liposome binding of AnxA2Y23D when compared with AnxA2Y23A is increased when the incubation was at 37 °C without cytosol (Fig. 5E). Annexin A2 Endosomal Function Requires Tyrosine Phosphorylation—We previously showed that AnxA2 depletion by RNA interference inhibits membrane transport beyond early endosomes along the pathway leading to lysosomes (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To this end, we monitored early-to-late endosome transport using rhodamine-dextran internalized for 5 min at 37 °C and then chased for 40 min in marker-free medium. In control cells, the tracer reached Lamp1-positive late endocytic compartments, as expected (Fig. 6A; quantification in Fig. 6C). After AnxA2 knockdown with Dicer-generated siRNAs (Fig. 6B), as in our previous studies (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), rhodamine-dextran internalization was not affected (not shown), as expected (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, as in our previous studies (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), little tracer reached Lamp1-positive late endosomes, and intracellular levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 6A, quantification in Fig. 6C); most likely, the tracer had then been recycled to the medium, rather than transported to late endosomes and lysosomes. Next we investigated whether early-to-late endosome transport could be restored by ectopic expression of the WT protein after AnxA2 depletion. After AnxA2 knockdown with siRNAs, AnxA2wtGFP, AnxA2Y23AGFP, or AnxA2Y23DGFP could be efficiently re-expressed, and expression levels were similar (Fig. 6B). RNAi resistance was presumably due to the use of a modified human AnxA2 cDNA (nucleotide 197 (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Johnsson N. Johnsson K. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Thiel C. Weber K. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)) that also contains a silent mutation in nucleotide 345; the target sequence of our siRNA covers ∼350 first base pairs of human AnxA2 mRNA. Moreover, the two phosphorylation mutants bear mutations in nucleotide 70 (corresponding to Tyr-23). Re-expression of the WT protein restored early-to-late endosome transport, unambiguously demonstrating that the inhibition of endocytic transport observed after AnxA2 depletion was not due to some off-target effect (Fig. 6A, quantification in Fig. 6C). Strikingly, early-to-late endosome transport could be rescued by re-expression of the phospho-mimicking mutant AnxA2Y23DGFP, but not of AnxA2Y23AGFP (Fig. 6A, quantification in Fig. 6C). These observations show that Tyr-23 is essential for AnxA2 functions in endocytic membrane traffic, presumably because its phosphorylation regulates association to endosome membranes. Conclusion—Endosomal AnxA2 is known to regulate endocytic membrane traffic, and in particular, membrane transport from early to late endosomes (18Zobiack N. Rescher U. Ludwig C. Zeuschner D. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4896-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), The protein shows a non-random distribution on endosomes and is associated to membranes via an unconventional lipid-dependent mechanism (19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which requires the intact AnxA2 N terminus (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). The hypervariable N-terminal domain of AnxA2 contains the Tyr-23 and Ser-25 phosphorylation sites as well as the binding site for p11/S100A10, the AnxA2 ligand (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Although we previously found that p11/S100A10 is not involved in AnxA2 endosomal functions (20Morel E. Gruenberg J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we now show that Tyr-23 phosphorylation controls AnxA2 binding to endosomal membranes, and thus, its functions in transport, highlighting the role of the N terminus, as recently suggested by in vitro approach with artificial membranes (34Zibouche M. Vincent M. Illien F. Gallay J. Ayala-Sanmartin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22121-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that Tyr-23 phosphorylation regulates positively the binding of monomeric AnxA2 to endosomes. However, non-phosphorylated AnxA2 is also expected to be present on endosomes. In fact, our data argue that non-phosphorylatable AnxA2 can bind endosomes but may be less efficiently retained onto the membrane. Phosphorylation may thus help stabilize AnxA2 onto the membrane, rather than acting as an “on-off” switch. It is tempting to propose that monomeric AnxA2 binds endosomes independently of Tyr-23 phosphorylation, via phospholipids and cholesterol (2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 19Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation may then stabilize membrane-associated protein, perhaps via a conformational change that may help dipping of the amphipatic N-terminal helix into the bilayer and/or facilitate oligomerization of AnxA2. In conclusion, we show here that both binding-related and transport-related functions of endosomal AnxA2 are positively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation in the N-terminal part of the protein, highlighting the fact that AnxA2 functions are differentially regulated by specific signaling mechanisms on the different subcellular sites. We are grateful to Marie-Claire Velluz for technical assistance and to Zeina Chamoun for AnxA2 siRNA duplexes and for comments on the manuscript.

The structure of the collectins is characterized by four domains consisting of: 1) an N terminus involved in interchain disulfide bonding, 2) a collagen-like domain, 3) a coiled-coil neck domain, and 4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (3Kuroki Y. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-A and mannose binding lectin contain collagenous domains consisting of 23 and 19 repeating Gly-X-Y triplets, respectively, with an interruption at the middle of the collagenous sequence (4Drickamer K.

Nature. 1985; 317: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In contrast, SP-D possesses a longer collagenous tail composed of 59 Gly-X-Y repeats without an interruption (6Rust K. Grosso L. Zhang V. Chang D. Persson A. Longmore W. Cai G.-Z. Crouch E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These differences cause distinct oligomeric organization, with SP-A and mannose binding lectin exhibiting bouquet-like structures consisting of either six or four trimeric subunits (7Voss T. Eistetter H. Schäfer K.P. Engel J. J. Mol.

LPS composed of O-antigen, core oligosaccharide, and lipid A is named smooth LPS, and LPS lacking O-antigen and a part of the core oligosaccharides is named rough LPS (10Hancock R. E.W.

SP-D-null mice infected with group B Streptococcus or Haemophilus influenza by intra-tracheal instillation show increased inflammation and inflammatory cell recruitment in the lung (17LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Gwozdz J.A. Richradson T.R. Fisher J.H. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3934-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Increased pulmonary inflammation in LPS (Escherichia coli O55:B5, smooth serotype)-instilled SP-D-/- mice and wild-type mice was decreased by intratracheal administration of SP-D and pulmonary surfactant (18Ikegami M.

Intratracheal recombinant SP-D prevents endotoxin shock in the newborn preterm lamb (19Ikegami M. Carter K. Bishop K. Yadav A. Masterjohn E. Brondyk W. Scheule R.K. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2006; 173: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These in vivo studies provide compelling evidence that SP-D dampens pulmonary inflammation induced by LPS.We have previously shown that SP-A modulates LPS-induced inflammatory cell responses by direct interaction with TLR4 and MD-2 (20Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar, 21Yamada C. Sano H. Shimizu T. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Himi T. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21771-21780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). SP-A attenuates or enhances LPS-induced inflammatory responses in a ligand-specific manner. For example, SP-A inhibits TNF-α secretion elicited by the smooth serotype of LPS, which is not a ligand for SP-A. However, SP-A can also enhance TNF-α secretion stimulated by rough LPS, which is a ligand for the protein. We have recently reported that SP-D directly binds to the extracellular domains of TLR4 and TLR2 through its CRD (22Ohya M. Nishitani C. Sano H. Yamada C. Mitsuzawa H. Shimizu T. Saito T. Smith K. Crouch E. Kuroki Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8657-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether SP-D binds a complex of TLR4 and MD-2 using sTLR4 and sMD-2, 2) to determine whether SP-D affects cytokine secretion and signaling induced by distinct serotypes of LPS, 3) to investigate the mechanism by which SP-D alters TLR4-mediated LPS signaling, and 4) to examine the role of the native oligomeric structure of SP-D in modulating LPS-induced inflammation. We now demonstrate that SP-D down-regulates inflammatory cell responses elicited by smooth and rough serotypes of LPS by altering LPS-receptor interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (CRL-1573) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio Inc., Kerrville, TX). LPS types (Salmonella minnesota Re595, E. coli Rc, E. coli serotype O26:B6, and E. coli serotype O111:B4) were purchased from Sigma. Alexa488-labeled smooth LPS (E. coli O55:B5, molecular mass of ∼10,000 Da) and Alexa488-labeled rough LPS (S. minnesota, molecular mass of ∼3,000 Da) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Monoclonal antibodies 7A10 and 7C6 against human SP-D were prepared as described previously (23Nagae H. Takahashi H. Kuroki Y. Honda Y. Nagata A. Ogasawara Y. Abe S. Akino T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 266: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody to sTLR4 was generated as described previously (24Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Anti-His tag polyclonal antibody was purchased from Medical and Biological Laboratories. Streptavidin-agarose was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose was obtained from Sigma.SP-D—The 1.181-kb cDNA for human SP-D was inserted into a pEE14 plasmid vector, and recombinant human SP-D was expressed in CHO-K1 cells using the glutamine synthetase gene amplification system (25Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman L.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1992; : 16.14.1-16.14.13, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). CHO-K1 cells expressing human SP-D were grown in glutamate-free Glasgow minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing dialyzed fetal calf serum and 25 μm methionine sulfoximine for gene amplification. For protein purification, the cells were transferred into serum-free EXCELL 302 medium (SAFC Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and incubated for 3-4 days. The medium was collected, and four additional harvests were performed, allowing 24-48 h of culture between harvests. The medium adjusted to pH 7.4 with 1 m Tris buffer (pH 9.0) was finally filtered with a 0.45-μm filter and applied to mannose-Sepharose 6B column. The proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl for 2 days.Chimeric Protein—We constructed a chimeric protein with SP-A and SP-D (A/D chimera) in which the N-terminal region and the collagenous domain of SP-D were replaced with those of SP-A, as represented schematically in Fig. 6A. The A/D chimera consists of Glu1-Pro80 of SP-A and Asp203-Phe355 of SP-D. The cDNA for the chimera was constructed by using PCR and the overlap extension method (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) using the cDNAs for SP-A and SP-D. The two primers used at the SP-A/SP-D splicing junction were 5′-GGAGGTCCCGAAGGTCTACAACGAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-CCTCCAGGGCTTCCAGATGTTGCTTCTC-3′. An SP-A sense and an SP-D antisense primers were used as follows: 5′-AAGCTTATGTGGCTGTGCCCTCTGGCCC-3′ and 5′-GAACACCAGACGCTCAAGACTAGATCT-3′, respectively. The BamHI and XbaI sites were incorporated into the flanking 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The construct was inserted into the pEE14 plasmid vector using the BamHI and XbaI sites. The organization of the recombinant plasmid and sequence of the cDNA insert was confirmed by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The recombinant A/D chimera was expressed using the glutamine synthetase gene amplification system (25Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman L.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1992; : 16.14.1-16.14.13, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar), and the recombinant protein was produced and purified by affinity chromatography as described above for SP-D production.Collagenase Treatment—Because the yield of the A/D chimera is greater than that of SP-D, the chimeric protein was used to obtain the collagenase-resistant fragment (CRF). The A/D chimera was digested with collagenase III from Clostridium histolyticum at 37 °C for 22 h. The CRF was isolated by gelfiltration chromatography using a Superose 610/300 GL (GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB). The N-terminal sequence of the isolated CRF was determined by using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) amino acid sequencer. The sequences obtained were GPPGLP or GLPDVA, corresponding to the end of the collagenous domain of human SP-A (Gly75-Prp-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro80) or the SP-A/SP-D splice junction (Gly78-Lys-Pro80 of SP-A/-Asp203-Val-Ala205 of SP-D), respectively. This indicates that the N-terminal region and the collagenous domain of SP-A were removed from the A/D chimera.Endotoxin Removal—Endotoxin in the protein preparations was removed using polymixin-agarose and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as described elsewhere (27McIntosh J.C. Mervin-Blake S. Conner E. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L310-L319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The endotoxin level determined by Limulus amebocytes lysate assay was below 1.41 pg/μg of protein in the preparations of SP-D, the A/D chimera, and CRF.Biotinylation—SP-D was biotinylated by using EZ-Linked sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Gel-filtration Chromatography—SP-D, the A/D chimera, and CRF were analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography using 10 × 300 mm Superose 610/300 GL column. The protein was eluted at 0.5 ml/min in PBS at 4 °C, and the elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) from Pharmacia Biotech were used as molecular mass standards.Western Blot—A 100-ng sample of the protein was subjected to 13! SDS-PAGE under reducing and denaturing conditions, and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunoprobed with anti-human SP-D polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml), or anti-human SP-A polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml), or anti-human SP-D monoclonal antibody 7C6 or 7A10 (2 μg/ml), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The proteins that reacted with the antibodies were visualized by using a chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Electron Microscopy—SP-D, the chimeric protein, and the CRF were diluted to 10 μg/ml in 50! glycerol and 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and rotary-shadowed molecules were observed under an H-7650 electron microscope (Hitachi Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 75 kV.Binding of SP-D to LPS—The binding of the biotinylated SP-D to Re595, Rc, or O26:B6 LPS (5 μg/well) coated onto microtiter wells was performed as described previously (22Ohya M. Nishitani C. Sano H. Yamada C. Mitsuzawa H. Shimizu T. Saito T. Smith K. Crouch E. Kuroki Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8657-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of anti-SP-D monoclonal antibodies on the SP-D binding to LPS, the protein (2 μg/ml) was first incubated with anti-SP-D monoclonal antibody 7C6 or 7A10 at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture of SP-D and antibody was then added to the LPS-coated wells (1 μg/well), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.Binding of SP-D to an sTLR4-sMD-2 Complex—A soluble form of recombinant extracellular TLR4 domain (sTLR4: Met1-Lys631) containing a His6 tag at the C-terminal end and a soluble form of recombinant MD-2 (sMD-2) containing the C-terminal fusion V5 tag and a His6 tag were expressed using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system as described previously (24Hyakushima N. Mitsuzawa H. Nishitani C. Sano H. Kuronuma K. Konishi M. Himi T. Miyake K. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6949-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). sTLR4 and sMD-2, co-expressed in insect cells, were purified from the medium using a nickel-chelating HisTrap column (HP 5 ml, GE Healthcare). The complex of sTLR4 and sMD-2 was purified by gel-filtration chromatography on a Superose 610/300 GL column as described above and eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa.The biotinylated SP-D (100 ng) and/or an sTLR4-sMD-2 complex (100 ng) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5! (w/v) bovine serum albumin (buffer A). After the incubation, the volume of the mixture was adjusted to 500 μlbythe addition of the buffer A and further incubated with anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, with gentle shaking for immunoprecipitation. As a control experiment, affinity-purified mouse IgG2a (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) and protein G-Sepharose were used. For the affinity adsorption assay with the biotinylated SP-D, 800 ng of the biotinylated SP-D and 100 ng of an sTLR4-sMD-2 complex were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were sedimented by centrifugation and washed four times with 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1! (v/v) Triton X-100. The final pellet obtained was suspended in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described above with HRP-labeled streptavidin, anti-V5 antibody, or anti-sTLR4 polyclonal antibody, to detect biotinylated SP-D, sMD-2, or sTLR4.TNF-α Secretion from Alveolar Macrophages—Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage of Sprague-Dawley rats. The lungs were lavaged with pyrogen-free saline (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) containing 1 mm EDTA, and alveolar macrophages were sedimented by centrifugation at 150 × g for 10 min. Isolated macrophages were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10! fetal calf serum, and next incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5! CO2 atmosphere to allow adherence.The indicated concentrations of SP-D, the chimera, or the CRF were incubated with macrophages for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with the cells for 5 h at 37 °C, after the addition of LPS. The medium was collected and the concentrations of secreted TNF-α were determined by using an OptEIA rat TNF set (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.NF-κB Reporter Assay—LPS-induced NF-κB activation was measured by using HEK293 cells (1 × 105 cell/well) that had been transfected with TLR4 cDNA (80 ng) and MD-2 cDNA (80 ng) together with an NF-κB reporter construct (30 ng, NF-κB-Luc, Stratagene) and a construct directing expression Renilla luciferase (10 ng, pRL-TK, Promega), as described previously (21Yamada C.

Nonspecific binding was blocked with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 3! (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The sMD-2 (1 or 2 μg/ml) was preincubated with SP-D (20 or 40 μg/ml), the A/D chimera, or the CRF, and the mixture was added to the wells and further incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed with PBS containing 0.1! (v/v) Triton X-100 and 3! (w/v) skim milk, and incubated with an anti-His tag-polyclonal antibody at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The peroxidase reaction was performed by using o-phenylenediamine as a substrate after washing the wells with PBS containing 0.1! (v/v) Triton X-100. The binding of sMD-2 to LPS was finally detected by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm.Binding of LPS to TLR4/MD-2-expressing Cells—HEK293 cells, stably expressing TLR4 and MD-2 (293-hTLR4/MD-2-CD14) (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml blasticidin, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B. Adherent cells were harvested (∼106/tube) and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml of Alexa488-labeled smooth LPS (E. coli O55:B5), or Alexa488-labeled rough LPS (S. minnesota), which had been preincubated with SP-D (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the cell-associated fluorescence was determined by using FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD, Bioscience).Other Methods—Polyclonal antibodies against human SP-A and SP-D were raised in rabbits by immunizing with purified recombinant SP-A and SP-D, respectively (21Yamada C.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8657-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) through the CRD of the collectin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We isolated a complex of sTLR4 and sMD-2 by gel-filtration chromatography and examined whether SP-D binds to an sTLR4-sMD-2 complex. When sMD-2 was immunoprecipitated by anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose, SP-D as well as sTLR4 was coprecipitated (Fig. 1A, WB:streptavidin and αsTLR4). The biotinylated SP-D also co-sedimented with sTLR4 and sMD-2 by an affinity adsorption assay with streptavidin-conjugated agarose (Fig. 1B, WB:αsTLR4 and αV5). These results indicate that SP-D can bind a complex of TLR4 and MD-2.FIGURE 1SP-D binds to an sTLR4-sMD-2 complex. A, immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 (MD-2) antibody. The isolated sTLR4-sMD-2 complex (100 ng) was incubated with biotinylated SP-D (100 ng) at 37 °C for 2 h. The sTLR4-sMD-2 complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody-conjugated agarose, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5-15! polyacrylamide gel) under reducing conditions. As a control experiment, affinity-purified mouse IgG and protein G-Sepharose were used (normal IgG). The Western blot was then performed by using anti-V5 antibody for sMD-2, anti-sTLR4 polyclonal antibody for sTLR4 and HRP-streptavidin for biotinylated SP-D, respectively, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, affinity adsorption assay of SP-D. Biotinylated SP-D (800 ng) was incubated with an sTLR4-sMD-2 complex (100 ng) at 37 °C for 2 h. The biotinylated SP-D was pulled down by streptavidin-conjugated agarose, and the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5-15! polyacrylamide gel) under reducing conditions. The Western blot was then performed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SP-D Binds to Re595 LPS and Rc LPS by Different Mechanisms—We have previously shown that SP-A binds to Re595 LPS and Rc LPS but not to O26:B6 LPS (20Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D has been reported to bind to Rc LPS and Rd LPS but not to Ra LPS and smooth LPS (28Kuan S.-F Rust K. Crouch E. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In this study we also examined the binding of SP-D to rough LPS (Rc LPS from E. coli and Re595 LPS from S. minnesota) and smooth LPS (O26:B6 LPS from E. coli) coated onto microtiter wells. SP-D bound to Re595 LPS and Rc LPS in the presence of Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). SP-D failed to bind solid-phase O26:B6 LPS. The SP-D binding to Re595 LPS was not significantly attenuated by the presence of EDTA (Fig. 2A), whereas EDTA completely blocked the binding of SP-D to Rc LPS (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the SP-D binding to Rc LPS but not to Re595 LPS was Ca2+-dependent.FIGURE 2SP-D binds to Re595 LPS and Rc LPS by different mechanisms. A and B, the indicated concentrations of biotinylated SP-D were incubated with Re595 LPS (A), Rc LPS (B), or O26:B6 LPS (A and B) coated onto microtiter wells. Binding reactions were at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 (•, Re595 LPS or Rc LPS; ○, O26:B6 LPS) or 5 mm EDTA (▴, Re595 LPS or Rc LPS; ▵, O26:B6 LPS) as indicated. After the incubation, the wells were washed and further incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The binding of SP-D to LPS was detected by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C and D, the biotinylated SP-D (2 μg/ml), which had been preincubated with 40 μg/ml of anti-human SP-D monoclonal antibody 7C6 or 7A10, or control mouse IgG at 37 °C for 1 h, was incubated with Re595 LPS (C) or RcLPS (D) coated onto microtiter wells at 37 °C for 3 h. After the incubation, the wells were washed and further incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The binding of SP-D to LPS was detected as described above. The data shown are the means ± S.D. from three separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.01 when compared with control IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of anti-SP-D monoclonal antibodies on the LPS binding was also investigated. Antibody 7C6 completely blocked the binding of SP-D to Re595 LPS, and antibody 7A10 partially inhibited this binding (Fig. 2C). In contrast, antibody 7A10 but not antibody 7C6 completely inhibited the SP-D binding to Rc LPS (Fig. 2D). Because the epitopes for antibodies 7A10 and 7C6 are located at the CRD and the neck region, respectively (22Ohya M. Nishitani C. Sano H. Yamada C. Mitsuzawa H. Shimizu T. Saito T. Smith K. Crouch E. Kuroki Y. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8657-8664Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the results suggest that the neck region and the CRD are involved in the binding of SP-D to Re595 LPS and Rc LPS, respectively. These results are consistent with those obtained from the experiments demonstrating Ca2+ dependence, or independence for binding different ligands. The data confirm that rough LPS but not smooth LPS is an SP-D ligand and indicate that SP-D binds to Re595 and Rc LPS by different mechanisms.SP-D Attenuates LPS-induced TNF-α Secretion and NF-κB Activation—SP-A, an SP-D homologue, regulates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in a ligand-specific manner. Smooth LPS is not a ligand for SP-A, but the protein potently inhibits TNF-α secretion induced by smooth LPS. Conversely, SP-A binds to rough LPS and enhances its inflammatory response (20Sano H.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) employs molecular mimicry by direct interactions between the cell surface streptococcal collagen-like protein-1 (Scl1) and the human collagen receptor, integrin α2β1. The collagen-like (CL) region of the Scl1 protein mediates integrin-binding, although, the integrin binding motif was not defined. Here, we used molecular cloning and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the GLPGER sequence as the α2β1 and the α11β1 binding motif. Electron microscopy experiments mapped binding sites of the recombinant α2-integrin-inserted domain to the GLPGER motif of the recombinant Scl (rScl) protein. rScl proteins and a synthetic peptide harboring the GLPGER motif mediated the attachment of C2C12-α2 + myoblasts expressing the α2β1 integrin as the sole collagen receptor. The C2C12-α11 + myoblasts expressing the α11β1 integrin also attached to GLPGER-harboring rScl proteins. Furthermore, the C2C12-α11 + cells attached to rScl1 more efficiently than C2C12-α2 + cells, suggesting that the α11β1 integrin may have a higher binding affinity for the GLPGER sequence. Human endothelial cells and dermal fibroblasts adhered to rScl proteins, indicating that multiple cell types may recognize and bind the Scl proteins via their collagen receptors.

This work is a stepping stone toward defining the utilization of collagen receptors by microbial collagen-like proteins that are expressed by pathogenic bacteria. The integrins are a family of αβ heterodimeric cell surface receptors found in metazoans that bind proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and function in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. There are currently 18 α and 8 β known subunits that combine to form 24 distinct heterodimers with various ligand binding specificities (1Hynes R.O.

However, not all collagen types harbor the GFOGER motif.

Similar to mammalian collagens, the collagen-like (CL) regions of Scl proteins adopt stable triple helices with midpoint melting temperatures of about 37 °C (17Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M.

Because of the lack of prolyl hydroxylase in GAS, Scl proteins are devoid of O residues, which in mammalian collagens are regarded as essential for triple helix stabilization. It was recently reported that electrostatic stabilization by charged residues in an Scl2 protein was similar to the stabilizing contribution of the O residues in mammalian collagens (19Mohs A.

Thus, Scl proteins are both structural and functional mimics of human collagen. The native Scl1 protein expressed on the GAS cell surface mediates GAS internalization by human cells upon binding to the α2β1 integrin (21Caswell C.C. Lukomska E. Seo N.-S. Höök M. Lukomski S.

The Scl proteins are members of a new and growing family of “prokaryotic collagens” that are predicted to exist in nature. Searches in silico revealed that numerous bacterial and viral genomes harbor ORFs encoding collagen-like sequences (22Rasmussen M. Jacobsson M. Björck L. J. Biol.

The biological function(s) of the prokaryotic collagens has only recently been subjected to investigations, and sequence motifs that mediate their interactions with human receptors have not been identified. In this study we determined that the GLPGER sequence mediates direct binding to the α2β1 and α11β1 integrins. A synthetic collagen peptide (GPP)5GLPGER(GPP)5 and recombinant Scl proteins with single and multiple GLPGER motifs conferred the attachment of human cells expressing these integrins. Taken together, this study identifies for the first time a prokaryotic sequence GLPGER, which is found in the collagenous domain of the Scl1 protein, as a functional integrin binding motif. Identifying the molecular determinants of Scl-integrin interactions may well offer insight into interactions between human collagen receptors and other yet uncharacterized prokaryotic collagen-like proteins.

DNA fragments were amplified using the primers: GXY 1–30, P176-CL1-F (5′-GAGAGGTCTCGCTGGAGAGAAAGGAGAAGCTGGACC) and P176-CL30-R (5′-GAGAGGTCTCACCAGCTGGACCTTGAGCTCCGG); GXY 15–30, P176-CL15-F (5′-GAGAGGTCTCGCTGGCCCACAAGGTGAAAAAGGCG) and P176-CL30-R (above). The amplified DNA fragments were treated with BsaI restriction endonuclease and cloned in-frame into a single BsaI site in the pSL163-CL region, resulting in constructs pSL204 and pSL205, respectively. Additionally, GXY repeats 1–15 were also cloned as a single (P214) or multiple insertions (P215, P218, P219, and P220). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® kit (Stratagene). To mutate the glutamic acid residue to alanine (construct P209) or to aspartic acid (construct P210) in the GLPGER motif of P204, a polymerase chain reaction was performed using the primer pairs P204-E2A-F (5′-GTTTACCTGGTTTACCTGGTGCACGAGGACCTAGA) and P204-E2A-R (TCTAGGTCCTCGTGCACCAGGTAAACCAGGTAAAC) or P204-E2D-F (GTTTACCTGGTTTACCTGGTGACCGAGGACCTAGA) and P204-E2D-R (TCTAGGTCCTCGGTCACCAGGTAAACCAGGTAAAC), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was also employed to create the GLPGER motif in the CL region of P163 by incorporating two single amino acid substitutions (P → L [CCT → CTT] and A → P [GCT → CCT]) in the GPA triplet of the GPAGER sequence. A polymerase chain reaction with the primers P163-GLPGER-For (5′-GCAGGTCCAATGGGTCTTCCTGGTGAGCGAGGTGAAAAAGG) and P163-GLPGER-Rev (5′-CCTTTTTCACCTCGCTCACCAGGAAGACCCATTGGACCTGC) was used to amplify the mutated plasmid that resulted in pSL222. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Rotary Shadowing and Electron Microscopy—rScl proteins and rScl-rα2I complexes were rotary shadowed and analyzed by EM as described previously (17Xu Y.

Briefly, recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate containing 1 mm magnesium chloride. To study interactions, rScl proteins were mixed with rα2I domain at a molar ratio of 1:3 and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. rScl-rα2I domain combinations were mixed with glycerol to a final glycerol concentration of 70%, and 100 μl of each sample was nebulized with an airbrush onto freshly cleaved mica. Samples were then dried in a vacuum and rotary shadowed with carbon/platinum using an electron beam gun tilted at an angle of 6 degrees relative to the mica surface in a Balzers BAE 250 evaporator. The replicas were backed with carbon at 90 degrees, and then were floated in distilled water and picked up onto bare 600-mesh copper grids. Photomicrographs were then taken using a Philips 410 electron microscope operated at 80 kV with a 30-μm objective aperture. Cell Attachment Assays—The ability of cells to use rScl proteins for attachment was tested using a previously described assay (20Humtsoe J.O. Kim J.K. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Höök M. Lukomski S. Wary K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13848-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). BSA or type I collagen (10 μg/well) or rScl proteins (100 nm) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) were coated overnight onto 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 °C. The following day, wells were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS at room temperature for 2 h. The model eukaryotic C2C12 cells (described below) were detached using a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (CellStripper™; Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Cells were washed twice and suspended in appropriate serum-free cell culture medium containing 2 mm Mg2+. Approximately 5 × 104 cells were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, bound cells were fixed in 3% p-formaldehyde for 15 min and stained with 2% crystal violet for 5 min. Crystal violet was eluted with 100 mm sodium citrate in 50% ethanol, and absorbance was recorded at 595 nm. For visualization, digital images of attached cells were captured prior to the elution of crystal violet using a ×50 magnification on a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope. Images were processed using AxioVision software (Zeiss). The mouse myoblast cell lines C2C12, C2C12-α2 +, and C2C12-α11 + were used as model cells. The C2C12 cells express no collagen binding integrins, while the C2C12-α2 + and C2C12-α11 + derivatives stably express the corresponding α subunits and, therefore, form α2β1 and α11β1 heterodimers, respectively (29Tiger C.-F. Fougerousse F. Grundström G. Velling T. Gullberg D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). C2C12 and C2C12-α2 + /C2C12-α11 + cells were cultured in DMEM/High Glucose medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% FBS in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml puromycin, respectively. In some experiments, a GLPGER-containing peptide was employed in cell attachment assays to assess integrin-binding. The (GPP)5GLPGER(GPP)5 peptide, designated GP36, was synthesized and HPLC-purified by Chi Scientific (Maynard, MA). The GLPGER guest sequence is embedded in a GPP host sequence, which stabilizes the triple helix (3Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Cell attachment was carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates coated with 10 μg/well of GP36 using the C2C12-α2 + myoblasts, the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa; Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). Mapping of α2β1 Integrin Binding Region in rScl1—Our previous study reported binding between the CL region of the recombinant P176 construct, derived from Scl1.41 protein, and the α2β1 integrin on human fibroblasts (20Humtsoe J.O. Kim J.K. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Höök M. Lukomski S. Wary K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13848-13857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); however, the integrin-binding motif on P176 was not defined. To map the α2β1 integrin binding site of P176 we inserted fragments of the P176-CL region into the integrin binding-negative protein, P163 (Table 1). GXY repeats 1–30 and 15–30 were inserted by cloning to create the constructs P204 and P205, respectively. Mouse myoblasts C2C12 devoid of collagen-binding integrins and the C2C12-α2 + cell line, which stably expresses the α2β1 integrin as the only collagen receptor (29Tiger C.-F. Fougerousse F. Grundström G. Velling T. Gullberg D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), were used in a cell attachment assay to assess integrin binding to rScl constructs (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, the C2C12 control cells did not attach to any of these rScl constructs nor to control human type I collagen. The C2C12-α2 + cells attached to type I collagen and to rScl proteins P176 and P204. Attachment of C2C12-α2 + was not observed on P205 and P163 negative control. These results indicated that the first 15 GXY repeats in the P176-CL region harbor an integrin binding motif. Site-directed Mutagenesis of GLPGER Motif Inhibits Integrin Binding—The P176-CL region contains the sequence GLPGER at GXY repeats 8–9, and we hypothesized that this motif mediates binding to the α2β1 integrin. The GLPGER sequence is present in the integrin binding positive construct P204 but not in the integrin binding negative P205. Earlier studies determined that the glutamyl residue in the mammalian integrin binding motif GFOGER is essential for binding to the α2β1 integrin (3Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Peachey A.R. Tuckwell D.S. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 8Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J.

Thus, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to assess the involvement of the GLPGER motif in interactions with the α2β1 integrin. The glutamyl residue in the GLPGER sequence of P204 was replaced with an alanine (E → A) or aspartic acid (E → D) residue to create the rScl constructs P209 and P210, respectively (Table 1). Both P209 and P210 failed to support attachment of C2C12-α2 + cells (Fig. 1, A and B), further indicating that GLPGER in the CL region of the P176 protein is involved in integrin binding. GLPGER Sequence in rScl Is Sufficient for Integrin Binding—We next created the GLPGER motif in the CL region of the P163 protein, which is negative for integrin binding, by site-directed mutagenesis. Two amino acids were replaced (GPA → GLP), and the resulting construct was designated P222. Recombinant P222 supported attachment of C2C12-α2 + cells, but not the C2C12 control cells, indicating that replacement of the two amino acids in P163 rendered its ability to bind integrins (Fig. 1, A and B). Additionally, the synthetic GP36 peptide, which contains a central GLPGER motif flanked on each side by five GPP repeats, supported attachment of C2C12-α2 + cells, but not the C2C12 control cells (Fig. 1A). Altogether, our experiments employing recombinant collagen-like molecules and a synthetic collagen peptide, conclusively demonstrate that the GLPGER sequence found in prokaryotic Scl1 proteins is sufficient to mediate interactions with the α2β1 integrin expressed on the surface of eukaryotic cells. Visualization of α2I Domain Binding to the GLPGER Motif—The inserted (I) domains of the α subunits of collagen-binding integrins confer collagen binding (2Gullberg D.E. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 37: 3-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and recombinant αI domains (rαI) have been used as binding indicators to collagen sequences (10Tulla M. Pentikainen O.T. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Impola U. Nykvist P. Nissinen L. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48206-48212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Here, we used the rα2I to map the binding sites present in rScl constructs. The P222 protein containing a single GLPGER motif was incubated with rα2I, and the mixture was rotary shadowed and viewed by electron microscopy (EM) (Fig. 2). Our earlier EM studies revealed that rScls share a common “lollipop-like” two-domain organization composed of the globular head formed by the V region and the lollipop stalk made by the fibrous CL region (17Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Höök M. Lukomski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27312-27318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Han R. Zwiefka A. Caswell C.C. Xu Y. Keene D.R. Lukomska E. Zhao Z. Höök M. Lukomski S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 72: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Binding events between the rα2I domain and the CL region of P222 were observed in electron micrographs, and the location of bound rα2I appeared to be the same in each case. Based on the translation value of 0.286 nm per residue in collagen triple helix (30Traub W. Piez K.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1971; 25: 243-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), we calculated that the GLPGER motif should be located ∼31 nm from the base of the globular domain. The measured distance from the base of the P222-V domain to the center of bound rα2I was 30.6 ± 0.4 nm, which correlated well with the calculated value. Hence, we physically mapped the rα2I binding site on P222 to the GLPGER motif. Effect of Multiple GLPGER Motifs in the Scl-CL Region on Integrin Binding—To study the effects of increasing numbers of the GLPGER motif in the Scl-CL region, we generated the constructs P214, P215, P218, P219, and P220 (Table 1). The first 15 GXY repeats from the P176-CL region, which contain the sequence GLPGER, were inserted by cloning into the CL region of the integrin binding-negative protein P163 resulting in P214. Multi-insertion constructs were also engendered containing 2, 3, 4, or 5 tandem copies of the 15×GXY-GLPGER repeats to produced P215, P218, P219, and P220, respectively. The purity and integrity of the rScl proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). The rotary-shadowed samples were viewed by EM to reveal the characteristic structural organization of the rScls with increasing lengths of their CL regions and indicating that they form triple helices (Fig. 3B). All rScl constructs were tested in a cell attachment assay for mediating the attachment of C2C12-α2 + cells after 20, 40, and 60 min (Fig. 3C). As expected, C2C12 control cells did not adhered to any of the rScl proteins or type I collagen during this time period. C2C12-α2 + cells expressing the α2β1 integrin readily attached to wells coated with type I collagen but not to the negative controls coated either with P163 protein or BSA after the maximum of 60 min of incubation. Binding of C2C12-α2 + cells to P176, P214, P215, P218, P219, and P220 occurred as soon as 20 min into the experiments. We observed that cell attachment was increasing on constructs P176<P214<P215, but remained comparable for constructs P218, P219, and P220. Similar attachment trends were recorded at 40- and 60-min time points. EM analyses of rα2I domain binding to each rScl construct were also carried out (Fig. 4). The distances of bound rα2I domains measured from the rScl-V borders were compared with the calculated locations of the GLPGER sequences in the rScl-CL regions (Fig. 4A). For each of the rScl constructs, rα2I appeared to bind a site on the rScl collagenous tail corresponding to the location of a GLPGER motif. In constructs containing multiple GLPGER sequences, single binding events were observed between rα2I domains and all GLPGER sites. However, despite the presence of multiple GLPGER sequences in constructs P215, P218, P219, and P220, simultaneous binding of multiple rα2I domains was only observed for P220, where up to three rα2I molecules bound to a single P220-CL region (Fig. 4B). Thus, our mapping experiments employing rα2I confirmed the α2β1 integrin binding to multiple GLPGER sequences in rScl proteins, which suggests that prokaryotic molecules cont"

We, therefore, tested whether pH alters ENaC activity. In Xenopus oocytes expressing human α-, β-, and γENaC, amiloride-sensitive current was altered by protons in the physiologically relevant range (pH 8.5-6.0). Compared with pH 7.4, acidic pH increased ENaC current, whereas alkaline pH decreased current (pH50 = 7.2). Acidic pH also increased ENaC current in H441 epithelia and in human primary airway epithelia. In contrast to human ENaC, pH did not alter rat ENaC current, indicating that there are species differences in ENaC regulation by protons. This resulted predominantly from species differences in γENaC. Maneuvers that lock ENaC in a high open-probability state (“DEG” mutation, proteolytic cleavage) abolished the effect of pH on human ENaC, indicating that protons alter ENaC current by modulating channel gating. Previous work showed that ENaC gating is regulated in part by extracellular Na+ (“Na+ self-inhibition”). Based on several observations, we conclude that protons regulate ENaC by altering Na+ self-inhibition. First, protons reduced Na+ self-inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. Second, ENaC regulation by pH was abolished by removing Na+ from the extracellular bathing solution. Third, mutations that alter Na+ self-inhibition produced corresponding changes in ENaC regulation by pH. Together, the data support a model in which protons modulate ENaC gating by relieving Na+ self-inhibition. We speculate that this may be an important mechanism to facilitate epithelial Na+ transport under conditions of acidosis.

Together, the data support a model in which protons modulate ENaC gating by relieving Na+ self-inhibition. We speculate that this may be an important mechanism to facilitate epithelial Na+ transport under conditions of acidosis. The epithelial Na+ channel, composed of three homologous subunits (α-, β-, and γENaC), functions as a pathway for Na+ reabsorption across epithelia in the kidney collecting duct, lung, distal colon, and sweat duct (for review, see Refs. 1Schild L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 2Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this role the channel is critical for the maintenance of Na+ homeostasis and to control the composition and quantity of the fluid on the apical membrane of these epithelia. ENaC mutations and defects in its regulation cause inherited forms of hypertension and hypotension (3Lifton R.P. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (4Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Knowles M.R. Cantley L. Gatzy J.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 78: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar).As a member of the DEG/ENaC family of ion channels, ENaC shares common structural and functional features with channels that are gated by diverse stimuli. All DEG/ENaC subunits share a common overall structure, with two transmembrane domains and relatively short cytoplasmic N and C termini, leaving the majority of the protein exposed as a large extracellular domain (5Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in these extracellular domains between DEG/ENaC family members result in dramatic functional diversity, from mechanosensitive ion channels in Caenorhabditis elegans (6Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) to ligand-gated channels such as the peptide (FMRF-amide)-gated FaNaCh channel in mollusks (7Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and proton-gated ASIC channels (8Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

For example, proteolytic cleavage at two sites in the extracellular domains of α- and γENaC convert channels from an inactive to an active state (10Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P.

A second population reaches the cell surface in an uncleaved state and is susceptible to cleavage and activation by proteases at the cell surface and in the extracellular fluid (12Caldwell R.A.

Extracellular Na+ inhibits ENaC activity through a process called Na+ self-inhibition, which serves as a negative feedback mechanism to regulate Na+ transport (16Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar, 17Chraibi A. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Sheng S. Bruns J.B.

Two observations implicate a role for the extracellular domain in Na+ self-inhibition. First, mutations of conserved histidine residues in the extracellular domains of α- and γENaC alter Na+ self-inhibition (18Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Second, proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain prevents Na+ self-inhibition (19Sheng S.

Divalent cations including Zn2+ and Ni2+ are also thought to alter ENaC activity by binding to the extracellular domain (20Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

In this regard protons are a strong candidate to regulate ENaC. In its location at the apical membrane of epithelia, ENaC is exposed to extremes of pH. For instance, urine pH in the collecting duct can vary from 4.5 to 8 in response to metabolic acidosis and alkalosis as well as with changes in diet and volume status (22Rose B.D. Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1984: 225-247Google Scholar). Normal airway surface liquid pH is slightly alkaline (pH 7.8–8.1) (23Paget-Brown A.O. Ngamtrakulpanit L. Smith A. Bunyan D. Hom S. Nguyen A. Hunt J.F.

Sweat pH can fall to <6 when the production rate is low but becomes neutral as production increases (25Kaiser D. Songo-Williams R. Drack E. Pfluegers Arch. 1974; 349: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Although ENaC appears poised to respond to changes in pH, previous studies investigating this possibility have been conflicting. External pH < 5 decreased short-circuit current in frog skin (26Levi H. Ussing H.H. Nature. 1949; 164: 928Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but increased Na+ transport in toad bladder (27Leaf A. Keller A. Dempsey E.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1964; 207: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In cultured Xenopus collecting duct cells (A6), acidification of the extracellular medium (pH 6.4 and 5.4) produced a slow increase in amiloride-sensitive current that peaked at ∼30 min (28Awayda M.S. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1896-C1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent work investigated the role of external pH in regulation of rat α-, β-, and γENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These studies reported a very small transient increase (28Awayda M.S. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1896-C1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), small decrease (pH 4.0) (29Ji H.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

When α- and βENaC were coexpressed without γENaC, acidic pH inhibited the channel (which has an open-probability close to 1.0) (30Zhang P. Fyfe G.K. Grichtchenko I.I. Canessa C.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 3043-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, an additional subunit, δENaC, was activated by acidic pH (29Ji H.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Together the data suggest that pH modulates epithelial Na+ transport, but the magnitude and direction of the regulation may vary in different tissues and species. To further explore this possibility and to understand the mechanisms by which pH regulates Na+ transport, we tested the effect of protons on the activity of human ENaC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—cDNAs for human and rat α-, β-, and γENaC in pMT3 were cloned as previously described (33McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J.

Mutations in αENaC (H255R) and γENaC (H233R) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene) and sequenced in the University of Iowa DNA Core.Expression and Whole-cell Electrophysiology in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were harvested from albino Xenopus laevis females and manually defolliculated after a 1-h treatment with 0.75 mg/ml type IV collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+ free ND-96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). After nuclear injection of cDNAs encoding human or rat α-, β-, and γENaC (0.02 μg/μl each), cells were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate, 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) for 20–24 h before the study.Oocytes were voltage-clamped (two-electrode voltage clamp), and currents were amplified with an Oocyte Clamp OC-725C (Warner Instruments), digitized with a MacLab/200 interface (ADInstruments), and recorded and analyzed with Chart software (ADInstruments). Unless otherwise noted, recordings were done at –60 mV in a 116 mm NaCl solution (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Low Na+ solutions (0 or 1 mm NaCl, 116 or 115 mm N-Methyl-d-glucamine chloride) were used as indicated in the figure legends (Figs. 5 and 6). The pH of test solutions (8.5–5.5) was adjusted with HCl or NaOH. Amiloride-sensitive current was determined by adding 10 μm amiloride to the bathing solution. The pH-induced change in amiloride-sensitive current was calculated as the -fold increase/decrease relative to the pH 7.4 base line just before each test solution application. This was done to reduce the effect of time-dependent current run-down. The resulting data were plotted and fit to the Hill equation using IGOR Pro software (WaveMetrics Inc.). Na+ self-inhibition was measured by rapidly changing the bathing solution from low sodium (1 mm NaCl) to high sodium (116 mm NaCl) and quantitated as (peak current (IP) – steady state current (Iss))/peak current (IP).FIGURE 6Regulation by extracellular pH requires Na+. A and B, representative current traces from Xenopus oocytes expressing human αβγ ENaC voltage-clamped at +30 mV. Extracellular bathing solution contained 1 mm Na+ (A) or 116 mm Na+ (B).

C, plot of -fold change in amiloride-sensitive current at pH 8.5 and 6.5 (relative to pH 7.4 (IpH x – IpH 7.4)/IpH 7.4). Inward currents were studied in 116 mm Na+ at –60 mV (n = 37), and outward currents were studied in 116 or 1 mm Na+ at +30 mV (n = 9 and 14, respectively) (mean ± S.E., *, p < 0.0001 versus 116 mm Na+ at –60 or +30 mV by Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression and Whole-cell Electrophysiology in H441 and Primary Airway Epithelia—H441 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown on 0.6-cm2 permeable filter supports (Millipore) in RPMI with 8.5% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C for 5 days. Primary human airway epithelia were isolated from the trachea and bronchi of donor lungs and grown at the air-liquid interface of collagen-coated permeable filter supports as described previously (35Karp P.H. Moninger T.O. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J.L. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 188: 115-137PubMed Google Scholar). Aprotinin (26 μg/ml) was present in the apical solution for 2 h before study. Short-circuit Na+ current was measured in modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.) using an EC-825 Epithelial Voltage Clamp amplifier (Warner). Currents were digitized with a PowerLab interface (ADInstruments) and recorded and analyzed with Chart software (ADInstruments). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 basolateral, 7.4 or 6.5 apical) at 37 °C. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (10 μm) in the apical bathing solution.RESULTSpH Changes Alter ENaC Current—To determine whether changes in extracellular pH alter ENaC current, we expressed human α-, β-, and γENaC in Xenopus oocytes and recorded Na+ current at a holding potential of –60 mV. In Fig. 1A, we found that current was reduced when we shifted the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 8.5. Conversely, pH 6.5 increased current. The changes in current were rapidly reversible on returning to pH 7.4. When ENaC was blocked by amiloride, changes in pH did not alter current, indicating that pH regulated ENaC and not an endogenous oocyte current. Also consistent with this conclusion, pH changes from 8.5 to 5.5 did not significantly alter current in uninjected oocytes (not shown). Fig. 1B shows the pH dose-response relationship for amiloride-sensitive ENaC current (relative to current at pH 7.4). Current was maximal at pH 6 (I6/I7.4 = 1.4 ± .0148) and minimal at pH 8.5 (I8.5/I7.4 = 0.8 ± .01), with a pH50 of 7.2. Thus, human ENaC current is regulated by pH within the range found in the kidney collecting duct and other epithelia.FIGURE 1Extracellular protons modulate human ENaC current. A, representative trace of current versus time recorded in Xenopus oocyte expressing human αβγ ENaC at holding potential of –60 mV. The extracellular bath was changed from pH 7.4 (open bars) to pH 8.5 and 6.5 (black bars) with or without 10 μm amiloride (black bars) as indicated. B, amiloride-sensitive current for human ENaC (relative to current at pH 7.4) with bathing solution pH varied from 8.5 to 5.5 (mean ± S.E., n = 37; error bars are hidden by the symbols).

In a human lung carcinoma cell line (H441), amiloride-sensitive current was larger at pH 6.5 than at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2, A and C). Results were similar in primary cultures of human airway epithelia (Fig. 2, B and C). pH 6.5 increased ENaC current in both epithelia to an extent similar to that when ENaC was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that shifts in pH alter ENaC current not only in heterologous cells but also in Na+-transporting epithelia.FIGURE 2Extracellular protons modulate Na+ transport in epithelia. A and B, representative short-circuit current traces from H441 (A) and primary human airway (B) epithelia. pH changes and the addition of amiloride (Amil) to the apical bathing solution (10 μm) are indicated by the bars. 0.5-mV pulses were applied every 15 s to monitor resistance. C, percent increase in amiloride-sensitive current in response to pH 6.5 (compared with pH 7.4) for H441 epithelia (n = 6), primary airway epithelia (n = 6), and oocytes expressing human αβγ ENaC (n = 37) (mean ± S.E.). The asterisk indicates that the change in amiloride-sensitive current at pH 6.5 (compared with pH 7.4) is statistically significant (p < 0.001 for H441, p < 0.003 for airway, and p < 0.0001 for oocytes by Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Species Specificity of pH Regulation—In contrast to human ENaC, rat ENaC currents were not altered by pH changes over the range 8.5–6 in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 3, A and B). This finding suggests that pH regulates ENaC in a species-specific manner. To determine which subunit(s) underlies this species specificity, we substituted one of the human ENaC subunits in the channel complex with a rat subunit. Channels composed of human α- and γENaC with rat βENaC had a pH dose-response relationship similar to human ENaC (Fig. 3B). In contrast, pH failed to alter current when rat γENaC was expressed with human α- and βENaC (Fig. 3B). When rat αENaC was expressed with human β- and γENaC, pH altered ENaC current, although the effect of pH was reduced (Fig. 3B). Together the data indicate that sequence differences in γENaC (and perhaps αENaC) underlie the observed species variation in ENaC regulation by protons.FIGURE 3Species specificity of pH regulation. A, representative trace of current versus time recorded in Xenopus oocyte expressing rat αβγ ENaC at holding potential of –60 mV. The extracellular bath was changed from pH 7.4 (open bars) to pH 8.5 and 6.5 (black bars). 10 μm amiloride (black bar) was added to the bathing solution as indicated. B, amiloride-sensitive current for human (H) or rat (R) ENaC or the indicated combinations of two human and one rat subunit (relative to current at pH 7.4) with bathing solution pH varied from 8.5 to 6 (mean ± S.E., n = 5–37; error bars are hidden by the symbols). The Hill equation was used to fit the data for human (R2 = 0.9991), human βγ rat α (R2 = 0.9962), and human αγ rat β (R2 = 0.9995).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)pH Regulates ENaC Gating—To determine the biophysical mechanism by which pH alters ENaC current, we took advantage of a strategy that prevents changes in ENaC gating. Covalent modification of a cysteine introduced at the DEG position in the external pore (βS520C) locks ENaC in an open conformation (open probability 0.96) (36Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). When βS520C was coexpressed with α- and γENaC in Xenopus oocytes, pH altered current to a similar extent as wild-type ENaC (Fig. 4, A and D). In contrast, after modification of the channel with [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), changes in pH had a minimal effect on ENaC current (Fig. 4, B and D). As a second approach to address this question, we activated channels at the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage with trypsin, which dramatically increases ENaC open probability (12Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After incubation with trypsin, changes in pH failed to alter ENaC current (Fig. 4, C and D). Together the data suggest that pH regulates ENaC by altering channel gating and argues against effects of pH on single channel conductance or channel number.FIGURE 4pH regulates ENaC gating. A and B, representative current traces at holding potential of –60 mV from the same Xenopus oocyte expressing human αβS520Cγ ENaC before (A) and after (B) covalent modification with 1 mm [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) for 2 min. C, representative current trace at holding potential of –60 mV from a Xenopus oocyte expressing wild-type human αβγENaC after proteolytic cleavage by trypsin (2 μg/ml for 2 min). In A–C, pH changes are indicated by open (pH 7.4) or black (pH 8.5 or 6.5) bars. 10 μm amiloride (Amil) was present in bathing solution, as indicated by the black bars. D, -fold change in amiloride-sensitive current in response to pH 8.5 or 6.5 (relative to current at pH 7.4) before and after application of MTSET (n = 5) or trypsin (n = 7) to oocytes expressing human αβS520Cγ or αβγ ENaC, respectively (mean ± S.E.). The asterisk indicates that the difference between the current at pH 6.5, and the current at pH 8.5 (I6.5 – I8.5) is statistically different between the indicated groups (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Extracellular pH Modulates Na+ Self-inhibition—Previous work indicates that extracellular Na+ regulates ENaC gating, a mechanism known as Na+ self-inhibition. The representative traces in Fig. 5A illustrate this regulation. A shift in extracellular Na+ from 1 to 116 mm induced a peak inward current (IP) that rapidly decreased to a lower steady state level (ISS). This decline in current reflects inhibition of ENaC by Na+. Proteolytic cleavage activates ENaC by preventing Na+ self-inhibition (19Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Because we found that cleavage abolished the effect of pH on ENaC, we hypothesized that pH might regulate ENaC gating by altering Na+ self-inhibition. To test this hypothesis, we varied the extracellular pH and quantitated the fraction of ENaC current that was inhibited by Na+ after a shift from 1 to 116 mm Na+. We found that Na+ self-inhibition was pH-dependent. At acidic pH (6.5), a smaller fraction of amiloride-sensitive current was inhibited by Na+ than at alkaline pH (8.5), resulting in an increase in steady state current at pH 6.5 (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to its effect on steady state current, pH had no effect on the peak current induced by the shift in Na+ concentration (Fig. 5, A and C).Protons could inhibit Na+ self-inhibition by reducing binding of Na+ to ENaC. To investigate this possibility, we determined dose-response relationships for Na+ self-inhibition at pH 8.5, 7.4, and 6.5 (fit to the Hill equation). In Fig. 5D we shifted the extracellular Na+ from 0 mm to concentrations between 1 and 116 mm. At pH 7.4 Na+ produced a dose-dependent increase in self-inhibition; half-maximal inhibition (Ki) occurred at 44.9 ± 1.6 mm Na+, and the maximum fraction of current inhibited by Na+ was 0.57 ± 0.01. pH 6.5 decreased the maximal effect of Na+ (0.49 ± 0.03), but it had no effect on the sensitivity of ENaC to Na+ (Ki = 44.7 ± 4.8). pH 8.5 had the opposite effect, increasing the maximal effect of Na+ (0.66 ± 0.05) with no effect on sensitivity (Ki = 43.5 ± 5.4). Thus, pH modulates Na+ self-inhibition by altering the maximal effect of Na+ on ENaC without affecting its sensitivity to Na+.Regulation by Extracellular pH Requires Sodium—If pH regulates ENaC by modulating Na+ self-inhibition, then the pH effect should be dependent on the presence of Na+ in the extracellular solution. To test this prediction, we measured outward amiloride-sensitive currents (holding potential +30 mV) with 1 or 116 mm Na+ in the bathing solution. In 1 mm Na+, pH had a negligible effect on ENaC current (Fig. 6, A and C). In contrast, in 116 mm Na+, pH 8.5 reduced and pH 6.5 increased outward ENaC current (Fig. 6, B and C), similar to the effect of pH on inward currents with 116 mm Na+ (Fig. 6C, compare black bars to open bars). Thus, extracellular Na+ is required for pH to regulate ENaC. In addition, these results indicate that pH regulates ENaC independent of voltage and the direction of Na+ movement.Mutations That Alter Na+ Self-inhibition also Affect pH Regulation—Previous work identified two ENaC histidine residues critical for Na+ self-inhibition (18Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutation of His-239 in mouse γENaC (His-233 in human) abolished self-inhibition, whereas mutation of the equivalent residue in αENaC (mouse His-282, which is His-255 in human) increased self-inhibition. To test if these mutations alter the effect of pH on ENaC current, we expressed αH255RβγENaC or αβγH233R ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. γH233R nearly abolished the effect of pH on ENaC current (Fig. 7, A and C). Conversely, αH255R increased the degree of ENaC activation by acidic pH (compared with wild-type ENaC), although it had no effect at alkaline pH (Fig. 7, B and C). Thus, mutation of γENaC abolished both Na+ self-inhibition and ENaC regulation by pH, whereas both properties were increased by mutation of αENaC.

NF-κB is composed of dimers of five proteins (p50, p52, p65/RelA, RelB, and c-Rel) (7Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M.

IκB kinase (IKK) complex consists of two catalytic IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (or NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator)) (10May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). A variety of signals activate IκB kinases α and β (9Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylate serines 32 and 36 on IκBα and serines 19 and 23 on IκBβ (9Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκBα and IκBβ leads to proteolytic degradation of IκB and dissociation of NF-κB, and NF-κB translocates to the nucleus to induce gene transcription (7Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 9Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Thrombin was shown to mediate RelA homodimer nuclear localization and its phosphorylation at Ser536 to induce gene transcription in endothelial cells (3Rahman A. Anwar K.N. True A.L. Malik A.B. J.

A rise in [Ca2+]i was found to signal the activation of NF-κB (16Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar, 17Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). However, the targets of Ca2+ signaling that mediate NF-κB activation are unknown. PAR-1 activation in endothelial cells mediates increase in [Ca2+]i by activating the Gq/11-phospholipase C pathway that results in depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores and the subsequent store depletion-dependent Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (18Tiruppathi C. Ahmmed G.U. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Microcirculation. 2006; 13: 693-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This accounts for the sustained rise in [Ca2+]i required for the activation of NF-κB. We (13Paria B.C. Bair A.M. Xue J. Yu Y. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol.

The TRPC family contains seven isoforms (TRPC1 to -7). Recent studies have shown that TRPC1 forms a complex with STIM1 and ORAI1 and is involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry (24Ong H.L. Cheng K.T.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We have shown that human endothelial cells predominantly express TRPC1 and contribute to thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry (18Tiruppathi C. Ahmmed G.U. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Microcirculation. 2006; 13: 693-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol.

Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 21Freichel M. Suh S.H. Pfeifer A. Schweig U. Trost C. Weissgerber P. Biel M. Philipp S. Freise D. Droogmans G. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Further, we have shown that in Trpc4 knock-out (Trpc4-/-) mouse lung endothelial cells, the thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry was markedly reduced (20Tiruppathi C. Freichel M. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Here, we show that thrombin-induced Ca2+ entry via TRPC channels activates the calmodulin (CaM) kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), AMPK, and PKCδ signaling pathway to induce p65/RelA nuclear translocation and transactivation. Further, we show that AMPK activation is required for PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505 in its activation loop to mediate NF-κB activation. Thus, Ca2+ entry via TRPC channels is an essential signal responsible for activating NF-κB in response to thrombin and thereby serves as a crucial link between activation of the coagulation cascade and innate immunity and inflammation.

HPAECs between passages 4 and 7 were used for all described experiments. Lung endothelial cells from 129SvJ (wild type) and Trpc4-/- mice were isolated and cultured as described by us (20Tiruppathi C. Freichel M. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Cells passaged between 3 and 4 times were used in experiments. Mouse lung endothelial cells were characterized by their cobblestone morphology, PECAM-1 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) (or CD31) expression, and Dil-Ac-LDL uptake (20Tiruppathi C. Freichel M. Vogel S.M. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Ca2+ Measurements—The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in single endothelial cells was measured using Fura-2/AM (13Paria B.C. Bair A.M. Xue J. Yu Y. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. J.

Nuclear Protein Extraction—HPAECs grown to confluence were incubated with 1% FBS-containing medium for 2 h prior exposure to different pharmacological inhibitors for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared from endothelial cells and mouse lung tissue using the method described before (13Paria B.C. Bair A.M. Xue J. Yu Y. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20715-20727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After thrombin exposure, cells were scraped and washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline. Cells were then homogenized with 400 μl of solution A (10 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were lysed with 10 strokes using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube (the cytoplasmic fraction). Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of solution B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and then incubated on ice for 20 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were aliquoted in small fractions and stored at -70 °C. Nuclear extract from mouse lung tissue was also prepared for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Frozen lung tissue was thawed on ice and homogenized in Buffer A. Other steps used were similar to endothelial cells described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Supershift Assays—NF-κB oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase for 20 min at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm MgCl2. The nuclear extracts (15 μg of protein) were incubated with the radiolabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide (80,000 cpm/reaction) and subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% native gel, dried onto Whatman paper, and then exposed to autoradiography. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with indicated antibodies for 30 min subsequent to the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (13Paria B.C. Bair A.M. Xue J. Yu Y. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20715-20727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Expression of Reporter Constructs—HPAECs grown to ∼80% confluence in 6-well culture plates were used for reporter construct transfection. Plasmid DNA mixtures containing 1 μg of NF-κB-Luc in a minimal E1B vector and 0.035 μg of pRL/TK were transfected using Lipofectamine (19Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In some experiments, PKCδ-WT or PKCδ-T505A mutant plasmid DNA (1 μg/well) co-transfected with NF-κB-Luc and pRL/TK. The mixture containing Lipofectamine-DNA complexes was diluted with 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM I before being added to HPAECs and prewashed two times with Opti-MEM I for 2-4 h. To end transfection, 2 ml of endothelial growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well. Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay—At 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated in 1% FBS medium containing for 2 h and then stimulated with thrombin. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 40 μm compound C for 30 min before thrombin treatment. After stimulation, cells were lysed, and 20 μl of lysate was used to measure reporter gene expression. Firefly (Photinus pyralis) and sea pansy (R. reniformis) luciferase activity were assayed by the dual luciferase reagent assay system (19Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—HPAECs grown to ∼70% confluence on gelatin-coated culture dishes were transfected with either 100 nm AMPKα1 siRNA, TRPC1 siRNA, or Sc-siRNA using Santa Cruz Biotechnology transfection reagents. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were used for experiments. Immunoblotting—Cells grown to confluence were incubated in Ca2+-containing Hanks’ balanced salt solution for 2 h at 37 °C. Following thrombin treatment in the presence or absence of Ca2+ in Hanks’ balanced salt solution, cells were washed, and then cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated separately as described above. Equal amounts of protein were resolved using SDS-PAGE on a 10% separating gel and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 60 min at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with the indicated antibody in diluted blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After two washes, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit for 60 min at room temperature. Protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Confluent endothelial cell monolayers were washed with serum-free medium and then incubated with 1% FBS-containing medium for 2 h. After this period, the cells were treated with thrombin in 1% FBS-containing medium for various time intervals. Following treatment, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. RT was performed using oligo(dT) primers and superscript reverse transcript (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s recommendation. ICAM-1 transcript expression in human and mouse endothelial cells was amplified using the following primer sets: human (forward, 5′-AGCAATGTGCAAGAAGATAGCCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGCCTGCGTGTCCACC-3′) and mouse (forward, 5′-AGCATTTACCCTCAGCCACTTCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGAGGCTCGATTGTTCAGCTGCTA-3′). PCR product was 459 bp for human and 630 bp for mouse ICAM-1. The reaction conditions included an initial 95 °C for 5 min and then 30 cycles of (94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min). Amplification of GAPDH used the following primers: forward, 5′-TATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGACCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TACATGGCAACTGTGAGGGG-3′. Reaction conditions were as follows: 30 cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 2 min). PCR product were resolved by using 1.5% agarose gel and identified by ethidium bromide staining. Normalization of ICAM-1 expression was achieved by comparing the expression of GAPDH for the matching sample (19Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Perfused Mouse Lung Preparation—According to the approved protocol of University of the Illinois Animal Care Committee, male 129SvJ (wild type) and Trpc4 knock-out (Trpc4-/-) mice weighing 30-35 g were used to make isolated perfused lung preparation as described (27Vogel S.M. Gao X. Mehta D. Ye R.D. John T.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lungs were perfused for 20 min to attain the isogravimetric condition, and then lungs were perfused for an additional 30 min with or without thrombin. At the end of this period, lungs were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then used for nuclear extract preparation, as described above. Immunoprecipitation—HPAECs grown to confluence exposed to thrombin were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer as described (19Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Kwiatek A.M. Rahman A. May M.J. Ghosh S. Tiruppathi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37195-37203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 15 min) prior to overnight immunoprecipitation with 1 μg/ml antibody (as indicated) at 4 °C. Protein AG-agarose beads were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed using immunoprecipitated recombinant PKCδ (26Cheng N. He R. Tian J. Dinauer M.C. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7720-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and AMPK from endothelial cells. Briefly, HEK 293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with the hemagglutinin-tagged expression constructs of PKCδ-WT or PKCδ-T505A (1 μg/ml). At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody. The precipitated proteins were used as substrate for an in vitro kinase assay (26Cheng N. He R. Tian J. Dinauer M.C. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 7720-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HPAECs treated with and without thrombin were washed and lysed, and the lysate (800 μg protein) was incubated with anti-AMPK-α antibody for 60 min and then with 30 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase assay was initiated by adding 20 μl of the kinase buffer to a total volume of 40 μl containing PKCδ (PKCδ-WT or PKCδ-T505A), anti-AMPK-α antibody-precipitated proteins from endothelial cells, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were continued at 30 °C for 30 min and then terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and dried, and then an autoradiogram was performed. We also used recombinant constitutively active AMPKα (CA-AMPKα) for an in vitro kinase assay. In this case, HEK293 cells were infected with Ad-CA-AMPKα (100 plaque-forming units/cell). At 36 h after the infection, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc mAb to precipitate Myc-tagged-Ad-CA-AMPKα, and the immunoprecipitate was used for an in vitro kinase assay as described above.

https://openalex.org/W2124824652,"Energy-dependent quenching of excitons in photosystem II of plants, or qE, has been positively correlated with the transient production of carotenoid radical cation species. Zeaxanthin was shown to be the donor species in the CP29 antenna complex. We report transient absorbance analyses of CP24 and CP26 complexes that bind lutein and zeaxanthin in the L1 and L2 domains, respectively. For CP24 complexes, the transient absorbance difference profiles give a reconstructed transient absorbance spectrum with a single peak centered at ∼980 nm, consistent with zeaxanthin radical cation formation. In contrast, CP26 gives constants for the decay components probed at 940 and 980 nm of 144 and 194 ps, a transient absorbance spectrum that has a main peak at 980 nm, and a substantial shoulder at 940 nm. This suggests the presence of two charge transfer quenching sites in CP26 involving zeaxanthin radical cation and lutein radical cation species. We also show that lutein radical cation formation in CP26 is dependent on binding of zeaxanthin to the L2 domain, implying that zeaxanthin acts as an allosteric effector of charge transfer quenching involving lutein in the L1 domain.

Regulation of light capture during photosynthesis occurs primarily within the antenna of photosystem II, the peripheral portion of which is comprised of trimeric light-harvesting complex (LHC) II 4The abbreviations used are: LHC, light-harvesting complex; qE, energy-dependent quenching; NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; CT, charge transfer; Chl, chlorophyll; Lut, lutein; Z, zeaxanthin; V, violaxanthin; TA, transient absorbance; NIR, near infrared region; Car, carotenoid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.4The abbreviations used are: LHC, light-harvesting complex; qE, energy-dependent quenching; NPQ, non-photochemical quenching; CT, charge transfer; Chl, chlorophyll; Lut, lutein; Z, zeaxanthin; V, violaxanthin; TA, transient absorbance; NIR, near infrared region; Car, carotenoid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.

Plant Cell.. 2001; 13: 1193-1204Google Scholar). Regulation of light capture is critical for plant fitness (3Kulheim C. Agren J. Jansson S. Science.. 2002; 297: 91-93Google Scholar) and is achieved predominantly by a process termed energy-dependent quenching, or qE (4Kramer D.M. Avenson T.J. Edwards G.E. Trends Plant Sci... 2004; 9: 349-357Google Scholar), one of a composite of processes involved in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of excess absorbed light energy (5Muller P. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K.

Adams W.W. FASEB J.. 1996; 10: 403-412Google Scholar). Several characteristics distinguish qE from the other components of NPQ. First, qE is reversible on the seconds-to-minutes time scale, a feat that is thought to reflect rapid changes in the thylakoid lumen pH, which transmit information to the antenna where the molecular mechanism of qE is modulated. Secondly, the npq1 and npq4 mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, which lack the capacity for generating zeaxanthin (Z) (8Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell.. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Google Scholar) and the PsbS protein (9Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M. Jansson S. Niyogi K.K. Nature.. 2000; 403: 391-395Google Scholar), respectively, exhibit very little qE, consistent with Z and PsbS being necessary for qE.The peripheral antenna is generally thought to be the location of the molecular mechanism of qE, although within precisely which of the LHCs, as well as by what molecular mechanism(s), are issues currently under intense investigation (10Holt N.E.

Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature.. 2007; 450: 575-578Google Scholar). Assigning where and by what mechanism(s) qE occurs is hindered by the fact that qE is, by definition, a phenomenon requiring an intact system, complicating purely deconstructive approaches for studying this mechanism. Nonetheless, several recent studies have combined various approaches to correlate the phenomenology of qE with various components and molecular mechanisms. For example, it was recently shown that excitation energy transfer from singlet-excited chlorophyll (Chl) to the S1 state of lutein (Lut) occurs both within isolated LHCII trimeric complexes (13Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H. Kennis J.T. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature.. 2007; 450: 575-578Google Scholar), previously hypothesized to be a site for qE (14Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 919-928Google Scholar), and in vivo in a qE-dependent manner (13Ruban A.V. Berera R. Ilioaia C. van Stokkum I.H. Kennis J.T. Pascal A.A. van Amerongen H. Robert B. Horton P. van Grondelle R. Nature.. 2007; 450: 575-578Google Scholar). Evidence for charge transfer (CT) quenching of Chl excited states, a mechanism previously predicted from quantum chemical calculations (15Dreuw A. Fleming G.R. Head-Gordon M. Phys. Chem. Chem.

Science.. 2005; 307: 433-436Google Scholar). Evidence for CT quenching, e.g. transient Z radical cation (Z•+) formation (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar, 18Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2005; 307: 433-436Google Scholar), has been demonstrated in a composite mixture of CP24, CP26, and CP29 complexes (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar), and recently, in isolated CP29 complexes (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar). Estimates suggest that CT quenching within all three minor complexes can account for a significant fraction of qE in isolated thylakoids (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar), although it should be emphasized that simultaneous operation of multiple mechanisms throughout the antenna during qE is not excluded.The molecular architecture of the CT site in CP29 has recently been elucidated (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar). Based on homology with the LHCII complex, eight Chl and two carotenoid (Car) binding sites have been assigned to CP29, all of which reside within two protein domains referred to as L1 and L2 (20Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 10056-10061Google Scholar). Lut and the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (Z and violaxanthin, or V) preferentially bind to the L1 and L2 sites, respectively (21Formaggio E. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Mol. Biol... 2001; 314: 1157-1166Google Scholar). Chls a that bind to sites A5 and B5 (corresponding to Chl 5 and Chl 12, respectively, in LHCII (14Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 919-928Google Scholar)) are excitonically coupled (20Bassi R. Croce R. Cugini D. Sandona D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 10056-10061Google Scholar), their interaction has been shown to be necessary for regulation of fluorescence lifetime (22Ihalainen J.A. Croce R. Morosinotto T. van Stokkum I.H. Bassi R.

Biochemistry.. 2005; 44: 8337-8346Google Scholar), and they have been shown to be involved in CT quenching in a (Chl-Z) complex within the L2 domain (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar).The CP26 complex provides an opportunity to assess whether other Car species can be involved in CT quenching. Lut is bound at the L1 site, which also holds a pair of Chl binding sites (A2 and B2 corresponding to Chl 2 and Chl 7, respectively in LHCII (14Standfuss J. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Lamborghini M. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 919-928Google Scholar)), both close to the Car and to each other (25Mozzo M. Passarini F. Bassi R. van Amerongen H. Croce R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2008; 1777: 1263-1267Google Scholar), the features found for the L2 site and Chls A5 and B5 in CP29 (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar).In this report, we describe transient absorbance (TA) analyses of CP24 and CP26 complexes with various Cars bound to sites L1 and L2 by excitation of the complexes at the Chl Qy transition and probing for transient species within the near infrared region (NIR), as in Refs. 17Avenson T.J.

The results suggest that although a single CT quenching site involving a Z•+ species operates within CP24, presumably within the L2 domain, two CT sites exist within CP26, one of which involves a Z•+ species within the L2 domain and the other a Lut radical cation (Lut•+) within the L1 domain. We discuss these results in the context of the different CT site architectures of the CP29 and CP26 complexes.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Antenna LHCs with Specific Xanthophylls—The genes for CP24 and CP26 polypeptides from A. thaliana were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the apoproteins were isolated followed by in vitro reconstitution with Chls (a and b), neoxanthin, Lut, and either V or Z. Pigments were extracted from the isolated antenna complexes with 80% acetone and then separated and quantified by HPLC as described in Ref. 26Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol... 1991; 96: 635-643Google Scholar and by fitting analysis of the spectrum of the acetone extract with the spectra of individual pigments as described in Ref. 27Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Google Scholar.Transient Absorbance Setup—A femtosecond TA laser system that was recently described in detail was used to perform NIR TA analyses (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar). Briefly, excitation pulses were centered at 650 nm, and the probe region used was 880–1080 nm. CP24 and CP26 complexes were resuspended in buffer solution (5 mm HEPES and 0.06% α-dodecylmaltocide at pH 7.6) to an OD of ∼0.3/mm (all samples were adjusted to the same OD at 650 nm) for TA analyses. A sample cell with a path length of 1 mm was chilled by a circulating water bath (VWR Scientific 1160, PolyScientific, Niles, IL), which was set at 7 °C during the data acquisition to prevent sample degradation.RESULTSCarotenoid Compositions of Isolated CP24 and CP26 Apoproteins—Isolated recombinant apoproteins of CP24 and CP26 overexpressed in E. coli were reconstituted in vitro with Chls (a and b), neoxanthin, Lut, and either V or Z, or in some instances, only with the individual Cars (below). Table 1 shows that, as determined by HPLC analyses, the CP24 complexes reconstituted in the presence of V (referred to herein as CP24V) contained 0.6 V and 1.6 Lut molecules per 10 Chls, respectively. In contrast, the CP24Z complexes consisted of 1.4 Z and 0.8 Lut molecules, respectively. The CP26V complexes were comprised of 0.2 V and 1.6 Lut molecules, respectively, whereas the CP26Z complexes consisted of 1.1 Z and 1.1 Lut molecules, respectively. The minor complexes preferentially bind Lut and Z (or V) in the L1 and L2 domains, respectively (27Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Google Scholar).TABLE 1Pigment compositions of reconstituted CP24 and CP26 complexesSample# of ChlsChl a/Chl bChl/CarNeoViolaLutZea# of CarCP26V92.23.50.80.21.60.02.6CP26Z92.04.20.00.01.11.12.1CP24V101.54.40.00.61.60.02.2CP24Z101.64.70.00.00.81.42.1 Open table in a new tab Variable Car•+ Formation in CP24 and CP26 Complexes—The Car radical cation (Car•+) species exhibits strong absorption in the NIR (28Galinato M.G.

Shown in Fig. 1 are TA difference spectra for CP24 (panel A) and CP26 (panel B) that were obtained, essentially as described in Refs. 17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z.

Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar, from a series of NIR TA kinetic traces by excitation of the CP24Z/CP24V and CP26Z/CP26V complexes at the Chl Qy transition and probing for transient Car•+ species from 880 to 1080 nm. The CP24 spectrum is characterized by broad absorption and a central peak at ∼970–980 nm, very similar to the TA spectrum obtained for CP29 and in which the 980 nm peak was assigned to transient Z•+ formation during CT quenching (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar, 19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R.

In contrast to the single peak observed in the NIR TA spectra for CP24 and CP29 (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar), the spectrum for CP26 exhibits, in addition to a peak at 980 nm, a shoulder at ∼950 nm. Although these combined results are consistent with the occurrence of CT quenching involving a Z•+ species in the L2 domain in all three minor complexes, as has been previously suggested (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar, 19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar), the two peaks observed in the CP26 TA spectrum are consistent with the transient formation of multiple Car•+ species, possibly indicative of an auxiliary CT site. Recall that the L1 site of CP26Z is occupied by Lut, hinting that the alternative CT site may involve a Lut•+, previously shown to absorb at 940–950 nm (28Galinato M.G. Niedzwiedzki D. Deal C. Birge R.R. Frank H.A. Photosynth. Res... 2007; 94: 67-78Google Scholar). The area under the ∼940 nm band is ∼28% of the total absorbance, suggesting a somewhat lower yield of Lut cation, because Lut and Z bind to CP26 in a 1:1 ratio (Table 1), whereas the extinction coefficient of Lut•+ is 70% that of Z•+ (30Han R.-M.

Fig. 2A shows that the 980 nm TA kinetic profile for the CP24V sample (black trace) is characterized solely by decay components, essentially as was observed in CP29 bound by V (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar) and attributed to the dynamics of Chl excited state absorbance (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar, 18Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R.

In contrast, the 980 nm TA kinetic profile for CP24Z complexes (red trace) exhibits multiexponential rise components followed by biphasic decay. The TA difference profile (blue trace), obtained by subtracting the 980 nm TA kinetics of the V-complexes from those of the Z counterparts, shows biphasic rise components, similar to those observed and kinetically modeled for CP29 (32Cheng Y.-C. Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2008; 112: 13418-13423Google Scholar). The faster and slower rise components displayed time constants of <500 fs and∼5 ps, respectively. The kinetics of the sub-ps rise are attributable to either very fast intracomplex energy transfer to the CT quenching site or to excitation of the CT site directly, as discussed in Ref. 32Cheng Y.-C. Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2008; 112: 13418-13423Google Scholar. The slower ∼5 ps rise component can be assigned to the dynamics of intracomplex energy transfer to the CT trap site (32Cheng Y.-C. Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Phys. Chem. B... 2008; 112: 13418-13423Google Scholar). The 980 nm signal in CP24 decays as a single exponential with a time constant of 103 ps, when compared with the 238-ps decay seen in CP29 at this wavelength (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar). These results imply that the dynamics of energy transfer to the CT site are insensitive to the intrinsic variability of the L2 domains of CP24 and CP29, whereas the charge recombination of the respective charge-separated states is sensitive to the protein environment. The multiexponential rise components (<500 fs and 5 ps, respectively) of the 980 nm TA difference profile for CP26Z (Fig. 2B) are similar to those observed for both CP24Z and CP29Z (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C. Niyogi K.K. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2008; 320: 794-797Google Scholar), whereas the TA signal decays with a time constant of 194 ps, intermediate between the CP24Z and CP29Z values.FIGURE 2NIR TA kinetic profiles for CP24 and CP26 complexes probed at 980 nm. NIR TA profiles were obtained using isolated, monomeric CP24 (A) and CP26 (B) complexes by excitation at 650 nm and probing at 980 nm. The red and black traces represent TA kinetic profiles for the corresponding complexes bound by Z and V, respectively, and represent an average of more than 10 kinetic sweeps. Difference kinetic traces (blue) correspond to subtraction of the V-kinetic profiles from the Z-kinetics. a.u., arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If the Car•+ band at 940 nm is formed independently of the Z•+ 980 nm band, we expect different kinetics in the two spectral regions. Fig. 3A shows that the time constants of the biexponential rise components of the 940 nm TA difference profile for CP24 were <500 fs and 5 ps, respectively, and that the signal decays with a time constant of 108 ps. These CP24 TA dynamics are, within the noise level, the same as those observed at 980 nm (Fig. 2A), implying that the same Car•+ (i.e. Z•+) species is probed at the two wavelengths. Because all CP24 complexes bind two carotenoids, it is possible that some of the Z•+ signal comes from CP24 complexes containing Z in both L1 and L2 sites, although the kinetics would have to be identical in the two sites, which seems unlikely. However, the dominant (70% under this assumption) species is 1Lut/1Z, and we do not see a Lut•+ signal in this sample. The biphasic rise components of the 940 nm TA difference profile for CP26 are <500 fs and 5 ps (Fig. 3B), respectively, as was observed at 980 nm; however, the 940 nm signal decayed with a time constant of 144 ps, in contrast to 194 ps at 980 nm (Fig. 2B), supporting the idea of independent CT quenching sites in CP26 with Z in the L2 site and Lut in the L1 site.FIGURE 3940 nm TA difference profiles for isolated CP24 (A) and CP26 (B) complexes.

Fig. 4A shows NIR TA spectra that were obtained for CP26 complexes reconstituted solely with a single type of Car, i.e. V, Z, or Lut in both sites L1 and L2 (27Croce R. Canino G. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Google Scholar). The pigment compositions of the complex are given in Table 2. The TA spectrum for CP26 reconstituted with only V does not exhibit absorption above the baseline throughout the region where Car•+ species typically absorb, confirming that V does not participate in CT quenching when bound to either L1 or L2 domains of CP26. Similarly, the TA spectrum for CP26 reconstituted with only Lut also shows no evidence for Car•+ formation, implying that CT quenching involving a Lut•+ is not supported when Lut occupies the L1 and L2 domains simultaneously. Occupancy of L2 by V, which competes for binding within this domain, apparently does not support a conformation of the protein that facilitates Lut•+ formation in the L1 site, as suggested by the lack of evidence for Car•+ formation in the spectrum for CP26 reconstituted with both V and Lut (data not shown). In contrast, Car•+ formation is clearly evident in the spectrum for CP26 reconstituted solely with Z, where broad absorption characterized by a single peak centered at ∼980 nm is observed. Furthermore, Fig. 4B shows that the difference spectrum, obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the complexes that bind V only from that of the complexes that were reconstituted solely with Z, exhibits a single peak at ∼980 nm, consistent with previously reported Z•+ absorption characteristics during CT quenching (17Avenson T.J.

These results imply either that Z•+ formation occurs in both sites L1 and L2 and the respective Z•+ species possess similar absorption maxima or that Z•+ formation occurs only in the L2 site (i.e. CT quenching involving a Z•+ does not occur in the L1 site when bound by Z).FIGURE 4Transient spectra for CP26 complexes reconstituted with single carotenoid species. A range of NIR TA kinetic profiles (i.e. obtained by probing from 880 to 1080 nm) was generated in isolated CP26 complexes that were reconstituted solely with V, Z, or Lut.

Binding of Z to the L2 site has been shown to produce a conformational change in CP26 (33Dall'Osto L. Caffarri S. Bassi R.

On the one hand, Z has been suggested to be directly involved in the quenching of Chl excited states during qE via CT quenching (18Holt N.E. Zigmantas D. Valkunas L. Li X.P. Niyogi K.K. Fleming G.R. Science.. 2005; 307: 433-436Google Scholar), evidence for which, e.g. transient Z•+ formation, was obtained in a composite mixture of all three minor complexes (17Avenson T.J. Ahn T.K. Zigmantas D. Niyogi K.K. Li Z. Ballottari M. Bassi R. Fleming G.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 3550-3558Google Scholar) and more recently in isolated CP29 (19Ahn T.K. Avenson T.J. Ballottari M. Cheng Y.C.

It has also been suggested that transfer of energy from singlet-excited Chl to the S1 state of Z may occur, thereby allowing the direct quenching of Chl excites states (35Demmi"

We further investigate the role of PhuS in heme trafficking to HO on disruption of the phuS and hemO genes in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore-deficient and wild-type background. Previous studies have shown that deletion of hemO prevents the cells from utilizing heme as the sole source of iron. However, disruption of phuS alone resulted in a slow growth phenotype, consistent with its role as a heme-trafficking protein to HO. Furthermore, in contrast to the hemO and hemO/phuS deletion strains, the phuS knockout prematurely produced pyocyanin in the presence of heme. Western blot analysis of PhuS protein levels in the wild-type strain showed that Fur-regulation of the phu operon could be derepressed in the presence of heme. In addition the premature onset of pyocyanin production requires both heme and a functional HO. Suppression of the phenotype on increasing the external heme concentration suggested that the decreased heme-flux through HO results in premature production of pyocyanin. The premature production of pyocyanin was not due to lower intracellular iron levels as a result of decreased heme flux through HO. However, transcriptional analysis of the phuS mutants indicates that the cells are sensing iron deprivation. The present data suggest that PhuS has a dual function in trafficking heme to HO, and in directly or indirectly sensing and maintaining iron and heme homeostasis.

Iron is essential for the growth, survival, and virulence of most bacterial pathogens, with only a few exceptions (1Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 2Vasil M.L. Ochsner U.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 3Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). However, within the human body, bacteria encounter an extremely low iron milieu, because the majority of iron is sequestered in iron and heme proteins, such as transferrin and hemoglobin, respectively (4Otto B.R. Verweij-van Vught A.M. MacLaren D.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 18: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Bacterial pathogens have therefore evolved multiple mechanisms to obtain iron from the iron- and heme-containing proteins of the host. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is responsible for severe nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients (5Sadikot R.T. Blackwell T.S. Christman J.W. Prince A.S. Am. J.

The P. aeruginosa genome encodes two heme acquisition systems: the has (heme assimilation system) and the phu (Pseudomonas heme utilization) operons. The has locus encodes the hemophore HasA, the hemophore receptor HasR, and a potential ABC transporter HasDEF for export of HasA (8Ochsner U.A. Johnson Z. Vasil M.L.

The phu locus consists of six open reading frames encoding the outer membrane heme receptor PhuR, the periplasmic ABC (ATP binding cassette) transport system PhuTUV, PhuW whose function has not been determined, and the cytoplasmic heme-binding protein PhuS, which is essential for optimal heme utilization (8Ochsner U.A.

The expression of the phu and has operons is regulated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein, which has both negative and positive regulatory effects on the expression of iron-regulated genes (8Ochsner U.A.

Under iron-replete conditions, Fe2+-bound Fur represses gene expression by directly binding to the Fur box in the promoter regions of iron starvation-inducible genes (including the iron- and heme-uptake genes) and activating gene expression indirectly through a pair of small regulatory RNAs, PrrF1 and PrrF2 (Pseudomonas regulatory RNA involving iron (Fe)) (13Wilderman P.J. Sowa N.A. FitzGerald D.J. FitzGerald P.C. Gottesman S. Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9792-9797Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 14Ochsner U.A.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The regulation of iron and heme uptake by Fur is essential in maintaining the iron homeostasis, because free iron can catalyze formation of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction (1Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 14Ochsner U.A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7194-7201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally a recent proteomic analysis has shown that the ability to use hemoglobin as an iron source is quorum sensing (QS) regulated in P. aeruginosa (16Arevalo-Ferro C. Hentzer M. Reil G. Gorg A. Kjelleberg S. Givskov M. Riedel K. Eberl L. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1350-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). QS is a cell density-dependent cell-to-cell communication mechanism, which allows bacteria to sense their environment and coordinate expression of various genes within a bacterial population (17Juhas M. Wiehlmann L. Salunkhe P. Lauber J. Buer J. Tummler B. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 242: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Lazdunski A.M. Ventre I. Sturgis J.N. Nat. Rev.

The QS network in P. aeruginosa is highly complex and consists of two interlinked N-acyl homoserine lactone-dependent regulatory pathways, which are further modulated by the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) (20Pesci E.C. Milbank J.B. Pearson J.P. McKnight S. Kende A.S. Greenberg E.P. Iglewski B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11229-11234Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 21Wells I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 196: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident that there exists a complex relationship between iron, QS, and virulence (22Bollinger N. Hassett D.J. Iglewski B.H. Costerton J.W. McDermott T.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Juhas M. Wiehlmann L. Huber B. Jordan D. Lauber J. Salunkhe P. Limpert A.S. von Gotz F. Steinmetz I. Eberl L. Tummler B.

Biotechnol. 2007; 132: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A number of separate studies have shown that iron concentrations independent of cell density modulate expression of genes that are known to be QS-regulated (22Bollinger N. Hassett D.J. Iglewski B.H. Costerton J.W. McDermott T.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1990-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown the iron-regulated small regulatory RNAs PrrF1 and PrrF2 are linked to QS at the level of regulation of anthranilate (a biosynthetic precursor of PQS) metabolism providing further evidence of the physiological link between iron and QS (27Oglesby A.G. Farrow 3rd, J.M. Lee J.H. Tomaras A.P. Greenberg E.P. Pesci E.C. Vasil M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15558-15567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore it has been proposed that pyocyanin, the terminal QS signal, itself may play a role in iron uptake and in extracellular electron shuttling in biofilm formation (28Cox C.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dietrich L.E. Price-Whelan A. Petersen A. Whiteley M. Newman D.K. Mol.

In the present report we further address the role of PhuS in heme trafficking to HO. The phuS mutants in P. aeruginosa in the siderophore-deficient IA614 and wild-type MPAO1 strain were observed to prematurely produce pyocyanin in the presence of heme during transition to stationary phase. As PhuS plays a role in iron metabolism via heme trafficking, and pyocyanin has been suggested to play a direct role in iron acquisition (28Cox C.D. Infect. Immun. 1986; 52: 263-270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miller R.A. Rasmussen G.T. Cox C.D. Britigan B.E. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 182-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Britigan B.E. Railsback M.A. Cox C.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the premature pyocyanin phenotype is an indication of an imbalance in iron homeostasis on disruption of PhuS. To further investigate the cause of premature pyocyanin production in the phuS mutants and its relevance to iron homeostasis, we undertook a biochemical and global transcriptional profiling approach. The findings presented herein provide important insight into the critical role of heme in maintaining P. aeruginosa iron homeostasis. Bacterial Strains and Cultures—The P. aeruginosa strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was routinely used for culture and maintenance of all strains. Tetracycline at 60 μg/ml concentration was used for maintenance and culture of the MPAO1 phuS transposon mutant strain. The location of the transposon insertion in the phuS mutant was confirmed by PCR with primers: PhuS1065R(5′-TCAGAGCGCCTTGAAGGAT-3′) and LacZ-148 (5′-GGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCC-3′). Analysis of P. aeruginosa growth in rich medium was carried out in LB medium, which has a heme content of ∼5 μm based on the pyridine hemochrome assay (33Fuhrop J.H. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins.in: Elsevier, Amsterdam1975: 804-807Google Scholar). Overnight cultures (15 ml) of the P. aeruginosa strains grown in LB medium were spun down, and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of fresh LB medium followed by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm (A600). The cultures were then used to inoculate LB medium (20 ml) in 250-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks to a final A600 of 0.05. The flasks were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm, and the A600 was measured every 30 min for a period of 6–8 h as indicated.TABLE 1Strains and plasmids used in this studyStrain or plasmidDescription of strain or plasmidSourceE. coliS17.1E. coli shuttle vector. 294(recA, pro res mod+) Tpr, Smr, (pRP4-2 Tc::Mu-Km::Tn7)(61Simon R.

The medium was made iron-replete with either 10 μm iron chloride (FeCl3), 10 μm human hemoglobin, or both. Iron-restricted medium contained 2,2′-dipyridyl (500 μm) where indicated. Overnight cultures (15 ml) were supplemented with iron chloride and/or hemoglobin.

Construction of an In-frame Deletion of PhuS in P. aeruginosa IA614 and IR1648—Construction of the in-frame deletions utilized a four-primer PCR method. The EcoRI-KpnI and KpnI-PstI gene fragments were obtained from MPAO1 genomic DNA using the GeneAmp High Fidelity PCR kit. Primer 1 (5′-GATAGAATTCGAGGCTGCGGTCGGCGATC-3′) located upstream in the phuT gene and primer 2 (5′-GATAGGTACCAACCTGCACCTGAA-3′), located at the 3′-end of the phuS gene, generated a 900-bp fragment encoding EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. Similarly, primer 3 (5′-GATAGGTACCGTCCTGCCAGGCGCGGT-3′), located at the start of the phuS gene and primer 4 (5′-GATACTGCAGGCTTGCCGAGCAGGCTGT-3′), located within the phuR gene generated a 970-bp fragment introducing KpnI and PstI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The fragments were cloned in tandem into pEX18Ap insert was confirmed by restriction digest and DNA sequencing to ensure that no point mutations had occurred during PCR (34Hoang T.T.

Unmarked deletions of the phuS gene were constructed in the siderophore-deficient P. aeruginosa IA614 strain according to a modification of Hoang et al. (34Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). For the mating, E. coli S17.1 was grown with gentamycin in LB overnight at 37 °C, and the P. aeruginosa strains at 42 °C overnight. The single crossover was selected on Pseudomonas Isolation Agar (PIA) with 100 μg of gentamycin and 250 μg of carbenicillin. PCR confirmed the presence of both the wild-type and the deletion copy of phuS::Gm. Positive colonies were then plated on PIA containing 200 μg/ml gentamicin plus 5% sucrose to select for loss of the wild-type gene. Deletion of the integrated antibiotic marker with Flp recombinase was carried out by conjugally transferring pFlp2 in E. coli S17.1 into the IA614-ΔphuS deletion strain at 37 °C (34Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Single colonies were screened for gentamycin sensitivity (GentS) on PIA plates containing 200 μg/ml gentamicin. Loss of plasmid was tested by screening for on PIA-sucrose and patching onto PIA carbenicillin (250 μg/ml) plates at 37 °C overnight. Colonies that were SucR-CarbS were streaked out on PIA alone and PIA-carbenicillin (200 μg/ml) and gentamycin (200 μg/ml) to confirm sensitivity to both antibiotics. Unmarked mutants were verified by PCR. The ΔphuS::tet pEX18Ap plasmid was constructed to create the ΔphuS knockout in strain IR1648 as described above. Pyocyanin Purification and Quantification—Pyocyanin was purified and quantified as described previously (36Essar D.W. Eberly L. Hadero A. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 884-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatant from 1 ml of bacterial culture was extracted with 1 ml of chloroform. The chloroform phase containing pyocyanin was then extracted into 1 ml of 0.2 n HCl, yielding a pink solution indicating the presence of pyocyanin. The UV-visible spectrum was recorded in 0.2 n HCl. The pyocyanin concentration expressed as micrograms/ml of culture supernatant, was determined by multiplying the A520 by 17.072, as described previously (36Essar D.W. Eberly L. Hadero A. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 884-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on a 3.0- × 250-mm C18 column (Atlantis™ dC18 5 μm) with modification of a previously described procedure (37Kerr J.R. Taylor G.W. Rutman A. Hoiby N. Cole P.J. Wilson R. J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly the elution was carried out at 0.2 ml/min with the following stepwise gradient of acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid (10:90:0.01) for 0–5 min (10:90:0.1 to 70:30:0.1) for 5–40 min and (70:30:0.1 to 50:50:0.1) for 40–45 min. The elution of pyocyanin was monitored by UV-visible absorbance at 278 nm. The major peak was collected and analyzed on a Finnigan LCQ classic ion-trap Mass Spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray ionization source for obtaining the m/z. The MS instrument was operated in a positive-ion mode with Finnigan Xcalibur software 1.1. The spectra were obtained in full scan mode (150–500 m/z). Attenuation of Pyocyanin Production—Overnight cultures of the phuS mutants were grown in LB medium from a single colony and used to inoculate 20 ml of LB medium in 250-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks to a final A600 of 0.05. The medium was supplemented with 0–100 μm human hemoglobin. The flasks were incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm, and pyocyanin concentrations were determined following 24 h of growth and correction for optical density differences. Pyocyanin concentrations (micrograms/ml) were expressed as means ± S.E. and were compared by analysis of variance and t-tests for independent variables using SigmaPlot 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The pyocyanin increases were also monitored every 30 min over a period of 6 h for the phuS mutant cultured in LB medium ± 100 μm hemoglobin. Spectroscopic Determination of Intracellular Iron Levels—The intracellular iron content of the P. aeruginosa strains was determined by modification of previously described procedure (38Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial cultures were grown with shaking at 37 °C in LB medium, starting from an A600 of 0.1. At an A600 of 1.5 and 3.0, 10-ml samples from each strain were harvested at 10,000 × g rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pelleted cells were washed once with fresh LB medium and again pelleted. The pellets were then dried overnight at 80 °C in glass tubes after which they were dissolved in concentrated nitric acid, and the iron content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. For each of the strains the measurements were carried out in triplicate. Control experiments to determine the background levels of iron in the nitric acid were also performed. All glassware and plastic ware were acid-washed before use. The iron concentrations (picograms of iron/μg of protein) were expressed as means ± S.E. and were compared by analysis of variance and t-tests for independent variables using SigmaPlot 10.0. Western Blot Analysis—The determination of PhuS and/or HO expression levels in nutrient-defined succinate medium was determined by Western blot analysis. Cultures were grown overnight in the following nutrient-defined conditions: succinate (iron-restricted), containing either 100 μm FeCl3, or 25 μm hemoglobin, or both. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate 20 ml of the same nutrient-defined medium to an A600 of 0.1. The medium was supplemented with higher concentrations of FeCl3 and hemoglobin than in the previous growth studies to ensure optimal growth at 6 h. Aliquots of the wild-type MPAO1 strain (1 ml) were pelleted every hour over a 7-h growth period, lysed in 100 μl of Bugbuster® (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Inc.) and pelleted at 10,000 × g at 4 °C to obtain the soluble protein fraction. The total protein content was measured by Bradford assay (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.), and 20 μg of total protein was loaded and separated on 4–15% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.in: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and probed with a 1:500 dilution of primary anti-PhuS polyclonal antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The membrane was then probed with the secondary antibody goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in Tris-buffered saline-containing 0.1% Tween 20, and the protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Super-Signal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). RNA Extraction, Labeling, and Hybridization—Overnight cultures of the P. aeruginosa strains were grown from a single colony in 15 ml of RNase-free LB medium at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Aliquots from the samples were spun down, the bacterial pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of fresh RNase-free LB medium, and the A600 was measured. The resuspended cells were then used to inoculate triplicate 20-ml cultures in RNase-free LB medium in 250-ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks to a final A600 of 0.1. Aliquots (1 ml) of the bacterial cultures were removed at an A600 of 1.5 and 3.0 for the 7520 phuS::Tn mutant and MPAO1 strains. For the IA614, IR1648, IA614-ΔphuS, and IR1648-ΔphuS strains, samples were removed at an A600 of 1.5. RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) was added to the samples to stabilize the RNA prior to extraction. Total RNA was then extracted from all strains using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Contaminating DNA was removed with an on-column RNase-free DNase I treatment (Qiagen) followed by an off-column DNase I treatment (0.1 unit/μg of RNA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen). The RNA was concentrated to a final volume of 15 μl using the RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen), and the RNA was quantified by measurement of the absorbance at 260 nm. The quality of the purified RNA was determined on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Medicine, Biopolymer/Genomics Core Facility. Microarray Analysis—Synthesis of cDNA, target hybridization, staining, scanning, and extraction of the hybridization intensity data were performed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, School of Medicine, Biopolymer/Genomics Core Facility using an Affymetrix GeneChip® system (GeneChip® hybridization oven 640, fluidics workstation 450, Scanner, and Operating Software, GCOS version 1.4). The determination of normalized gene expression signals by statistical analysis was performed at the Microarray Core Facility, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine. The quality of the microarray experiment was assessed with affyPLM and Affy, two Bioconductor packages for statistical analysis of microarray data. To estimate the normalized gene expression signals, data analysis was conducted on the probe signal values in the Chips' CEL file at the Affymetrix probe pair (perfect match probe and mismatch probe) level, using the statistical algorithm RMA (Robust Multi-array expression measure) with Affy (41Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (3977) Google Scholar). This probe level data processing includes a quantile normalization method (42Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6291) Google Scholar) to reduce the obscuring variation between microarrays, which might be introduced during the processes of sample preparation, manufacture, fluorescence labeling, hybridization, and/or scanning. With the signal estimates, principal component analysis was performed in R to assess sample variability. With the signal data in a log-transformed format, differential gene expression between controls and mutant strains was assessed by statistical linear model analysis using the bioconductor package limma, in which an empirical Bayes method is used to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes of gene expression, and results in more stable inference and improved power, especially for experiments with small numbers o"

Recent reports show that IP3R activity is strictly regulated by several interacting molecules (e.g. IP3R binding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, huntingtin, presenilin, DANGER, and cytochrome c), and perturbation of this regulation causes intracellular Ca2+ elevation leading to several diseases (e.g. Huntington disease and Alzheimer disease). In this study, we identified protein kinase C substrate 80K-H (80K-H) to be a novel molecule interacting with the COOH-terminal tail of IP3Rs by yeast two-hybrid screening. 80K-H directly interacted with IP3R type 1 (IP3R1) in vitro and co-immunoprecipitated with IP3R1 in cell lysates. Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical staining revealed that 80K-H colocalized with IP3R1 in COS-7 cells and in hippocampal neurons. We also showed that the purified recombinant 80K-H protein directly enhanced IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity by a Ca2+ release assay using mouse cerebellar microsomes. Furthermore 80K-H was found to regulate ATP-induced Ca2+ release in living cells. Thus, our findings suggest that 80K-H is a novel regulator of IP3R activity, and it may contribute to neuronal functions.

Modulation of the cytosolic free calcium (Ca2+) concentration is a highly versatile signaling system involved in the regulation of numerous processes such as fertilization, muscle contraction, secretion, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and synaptic plasticity (1Berridge M.J.

The protein kinase C substrate 80K-H (80K-H) was originally identified as a substrate for protein kinase C. It plays a role as a regulatory subunit of α-glucosidase 2 (20Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol.

Tsunekawa S. Podolsky D.K. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified 80K-H to be a molecule that binds to the CTT of IP3Rs by yeast two-hybrid screening. 80K-H interacted with IP3R1 in vitro and in cell lysates.

In addition, we showed that the purified recombinant 80K-H protein enhanced IP3-induced calcium release activity in a Ca2+ release assay using mouse cerebellar microsomes. Moreover 80K-H regulated ATP-induced Ca2+ release in living cells. We conclude that 80K-H regulates IP3-induced calcium release by interacting with the cytoplasmic CTT of IP3Rs. Animals—All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the RIKEN guidelines for animal experiments. Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used. Plasmid Construction—Expression vector encoding green florescent protein (GFP)-IP3R1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EL were described previously (26Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T.

The cDNA fragments encoding the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (IP3R1/CTT, amino acids 2590–2749), IP3R2 (IP3R2/CTT, amino acids 2542–2701), and IP3R3 (IP3R3/CTT, amino acids 2517–2670) were amplified by PCR from mouse cerebellum cDNA. The full-length 80K-H was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CTGAATTCATGCTGCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GACTCGAGCTACAGCTCGTC-3′ (the underlined letters indicate the EcoRI and XhoI sites for cloning, respectively) from a mouse cDNA library. The expression vectors were constructed using the following vectors: yeast two-hybrid assay, pGKT7 and pGADT7 (Clontech); HA-tagged protein, pcDNA3.1/HA (HA tag was inserted into the NcoI-HindIII site of pcDNA3.1); GST-tagged protein, pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare); and maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged protein, pMAL-C (New England Biolabs). IP3R1 and 80K-H mutants were constructed by utilizing PCR. The details of these methods, including the sequences of the primers used, will be supplied on request. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (28Zhang S. Mizutani A. Hisatsune C. Higo T. Bannai H. Nakayama T.

Briefly the cDNA libraries were prepared from mouse brain and inserted into pGADT7. To search for proteins interacting with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (IP3R1/CTT), the cDNA libraries were screened using pGBKT7-IP3R1/CTT as a bait in AH109 yeast. Positive clones were tested further for specificity by co-transformation into yeast either with pGBKT7-IP3R1/CTT or with pGBKT7 alone. DNA from positive clones was isolated, amplified in Escherichia coli strain HB101, and sequenced. Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized with purified GST-80K-H full-length fusion protein by subcutaneous injection with the complete Freund’s adjuvant at 14-day intervals. The anti-80K-H antibody was affinity-purified by passing the serum onto the MBP-80K-H column covalently coupled with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The anti-GST antibody was affinity-purified by passing the serum onto a GST column.

Cell Culture—A monkey kidney cell line (COS-7 cells) and a human cervix cell line (HeLa cells) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin (Nakarai Tesque). Hippocampal Primary Culture—Hippocampal neurons were prepared from 17–18-day embryonic ICR mice as described previously (31Cai W. Hisatsune C. Nakamura K. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23691-23698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly hippocampal cells were dissociated by trypsin treatment and trituration and were plated on polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in 15-mm culture dishes with 1.0 ml of medium. After plating, cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5.0% CO2, air.

Transfection—Transfection was performed as described previously (32Kawaai K. Ishida S. Matsu-ura T. Kuroda Y. Ogawa N. Tashiro T. Enomoto M. Hisatsune C. Mikoshiba K. Biochemica. 2008; 1: 21-24Google Scholar). Briefly COS-7 cells (1 × 105 cells) were plated in a 35-mm tissue culture dish with 2.0 ml of medium (in some cases, on glass coverslips). After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with 2.0 ml of fresh medium. A plasmid DNA (2.0 μg) or short interfering RNA (20 μm, Stealth siRNA, Invitrogen) was diluted with 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Then FuGENE HD (for DNA, 4.0 μl; for siRNA, 6.0 μl; Roche Diagnostics) was directly added into the Opti-MEM/DNA mixture and vigorously mixed well by tapping. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature (RT) for complex formation, the mixture was added to the cells in a dropwise manner. Co-immunoprecipitation and Pulldown Assay—For immunoprecipitation of exogenous proteins, COS-7 cells expressing HA-80K-H and EGFP-IP3R1 were washed with PBS and were solubilized in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P40 (Nakarai Tesque), 0.1% SDS). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with the appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with TNE buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, HeLa cells were washed once with PBS and were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (5.0 mm EDTA, 5.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF in PBS). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow overnight at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was then incubated with the appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow for overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with IP buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer. For pulldown binding assays, recombinant MBP fusion proteins and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Recombinant GST-proteins and MBP-proteins were mixed in PBS containing 100 mm NaCl and 1.0% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with TNE buffer, and the precipitates were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sampling buffer. Western Blotting Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5.0% skim milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h and probed with the primary antibody for 1 h at RT. After washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and signals were detected with Immobilon Western Detection Reagents (Millipore). Immunostaining—The fixed brains were sectioned parasagittally at 8.0-μm thickness with a cryostat (CM1850, Leica, Frankfurt, Germany). Transfected COS-7 cells, hippocampal primary neurons grown on glass coverslips, and brain sections were washed once with PBS, fixed with 4.0% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.2% for COS-7 cells and brain sections and 0.1% for hippocampal primary neurons) in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 1.0% skim milk with or without 1.0% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in PBS for 60 min at RT. The cells were then stained with the indicated primary antibodies (for COS-7 cells and hippocampal neurons, a mouse anti-GFP antibody (1.0 μg/ml) and commercially available rabbit anti-80K-H antibody (1.0 μg/ml); for brain sections, a rat anti-IP3R1/4C11 and affinity-purified rabbit anti-80-KH antibody (1.0 μg/ml)) for 60 min at RT. Following three washes with PBS for 15 min in total, appropriate secondary antibodies (for COS-7 cells and hippocampal neurons, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; for brain sections, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibodies (Invitrogen)) were applied for 60 min at RT. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories) and observed under confocal fluorescence microscopy (FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Intracellular Ca2+ Imaging—Intracellular Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (33Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Before imaging Ca2+ signals, fluorescence images of monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) were acquired to identify the transfected cells and saved in the computer. Measuring Ca2+ Release from Cerebellar Microsomes—IP3-induced Ca2+ release from cerebellar microsomes was measured as described previously (34Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly the membrane fractions were incubated with 460 nm purified recombinant MBP-80K-H or MBP expressed in E. coli for 15 min on ice and suspended at a concentration of 50 μg/ml protein in buffer containing 1.0 μg/ml oligomycin (Sigma), 2.0 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Diagnostics), 10 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma), and 2.0 μm Fura-2 (Dojindo). After loading Ca2+ into microsomes by activating Ca2+-ATPase using 1.0 mm ATP (Sigma), Fura-2 was alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm, and the fluorescence changes at 510 ± 10 nm were detected in response to 10, 20, 40, 80, 1000, or 5000 nm IP3 application in the presence of 300–400 nm Ca2+. After IP3 stimulation, Ca2+ store size was measured with an ionophore (BrA23187, Sigma). At the end of each set of experiments, maximum and minimum values of Fura-2 fluorescence were obtained in the presence of 2.0 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm EGTA, respectively. Signals were recorded every 0.01 s with MacLab (version 3.6, ADInstruments) at 30 °C. Fits of the Hill equation to Ca2+ release activity were performed by Igor Pro (version 4.04, WaveMetrics) software. Identification of 80K-H as a Protein Binding to the Cytoplasmic CTT of IP3Rs—To identify the proteins that interact with the CTT of IP3Rs, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid screening using the CTT of IP3R1 as a bait (Fig. 1A). We screened ∼1.2 × 106 yeast transformants and obtained 170 positive clones by the nutritional selection assay. Among them, we found three clones that encoded the sequences corresponding to various lengths of the COOH-terminal fragment of the mouse protein kinase C substrate 80K-H (Fig. 1B). The shortest fragment was the COOH-terminal region (amino acid residues 341–528) of 80K-H. To specifically identify the region of 80K-H that binds to IP3R1, we constructed several 80K-H deletion mutants (Fig. 1C, F0–F4) and examined their interaction with the CTT of IP3R1 in yeast. As shown in Fig. 1C, the F0, F1, and F2 fragments but not the F3 or F4 fragments of 80K-H bound to the COOH-terminal of IP3R1, indicating that amino acid residues 365–386 of 80K-H are necessary for interaction with IP3R1. We next examined whether other types of IP3Rs, namely IP3R2 and IP3R3, interact with 80K-H using IP3R2/CTT or IP3R3/CTT in yeast. As shown in Fig. 1D, we found that both IP3R2 and IP3R3 bound to the fragments of 80K-H (F0, F1, and F2) similarly to IP3R1. 80K-H Directly Interacts with IP3R1 in Vitro—To further verify the direct interaction between 80K-H and IP3R1, we performed a pulldown assay with the 80K-H deletion mutants using purified GST-IP3R1/CTT and various MBP fusion proteins (Fig. 2A, F1–F10). Consistent with the results of the yeast two-hybrid assay shown in Fig. 1, GST-IP3R1/CTT was observed to bind to the F1 and F2 fragments of 80K-H but not to the F3 or F4 fragments or MBP alone (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also found that the F7 and F9 fragments but not the F5, F6, F8, or F10 fragments of 80K-H bound to GST-IP3R1/CTT. These results indicate that 80K-H directly binds to the cytoplasmic CTT of IP3R1 in vitro, and the binding region, i.e. the amino acid residues 365–418 of 80K-H (F9 fragment), is sufficient for binding to IP3R1. We do not know why F7 and F9 fragments of 80K-H were strongly bound to IP3R1/CTT compared with F1 and F2 fragments, but the amino acid residues 419–528 may function as a suppressor domain to decide the binding affinity for IP3R1. To determine the region of IP3R1 that is responsible for interaction with 80K-H, we performed pulldown assays using recombinant proteins. First we investigate the possibility whether 80K-H also interacts with the NH2-terminal region of IP3R1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the NH2-terminal region of IP3R1 did not interact with 80K-H. To narrow down the region of IP3R1/CTT that is responsible for interaction with 80K-H, we performed a pulldown assay using various GST-IP3R1/CTT fusion proteins and MBP-80K-H. As shown in Fig. 2C, MBP-80K-H/F9 bound to the Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 fragments but not to the Δ4or Δ5 fragments or GST alone; this indicated that the amino acid residues 2637–2651 of IP3R1 are necessary for binding to 80K-H. We examined the homology of the COOH-terminal region of three types of IP3Rs and found that the binding region of IP3R1 to 80K-H was highly conserved among the three isoforms of IP3R (Fig. 2D). These results, together with the yeast two-hybrid data indicating that 80K-H binds to the CTT of all three IP3R types (Fig. 1D), suggest that 80K-H interacts with the corresponding region of IP3R2 and IP3R3. 80K-H Interacts with IP3R1 in Cell Lysates and Colocalizes on the ER in Intact Cells—To examine whether 80K-H binds to IP3R1 in cell lysates, we performed the co-immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells transiently expressing both HA-80K-H and GFP-IP3R1. As shown in Fig. 3A, when we immunoprecipitated GFP-IP3R1 with anti-GFP antibody, HA-80K-H was co-immunoprecipitated. Conversely GFP-IP3R1 was found in the immunoprecipitates with the HA-80K-H antibody. No binding was observed when control IgG was used. We also demonstrated the endogenous IP3R1-80K-H interaction in HeLa cells, which mainly express IP3R1 (Fig. 3B) (35Hattori M. Suzuki A.Z. Higo T. Miyauchi H. Michikawa T. Nakamura T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11967-11975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover endogenous 80K-H was observed as a meshwork structure with GFP-IP3R1 (Fig. 3C) in COS-7 cells. These results indicated that 80K-H colocalized with IP3R1 on the ER in intact cells. 80K-H Enhances ATP-induced Ca2+ Release—To explore the functional effect of 80K-H binding to IP3Rs, we examined the effect of 80K-H overexpression on ATP-induced Ca2+ release in COS-7 cells. We transiently expressed both mRFP and 80K-H or mRFP alone in COS-7 cells. 80K-H overexpression did not affect the expression level of IP3Rs and several other Ca2+-related proteins (Fig. 4A). We stimulated the cells with various concentrations of ATP (0.33, 3.0, and 10 μm) in the presence or absence (0.5 mm EGTA) of 2.0 mm Ca2+ and imaged the Ca2+ signals (Fig. 4B). In the cells expressing 80K-H, we found that the peak amplitude of Ca2+ transients induced by various concentrations of ATP was significantly increased compared with that in control cells expressing only mRFP (Fig. 4B). This enhancement was also detected in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, indicating that overexpression of 80K-H enhances Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig. 4C). We also obtained similar results in HeLa cells transiently expressing 80K-H (data not shown). When we measured and compared the amount of Ca2+ stored in the ER of COS-7 cells overexpressing either 80K-H or mRFP by using a sarco-ER calcium ATPase inhibitor (cyclopiazonic acid), no significant difference was observed in the Ca2+ stores (data not shown). These results suggest that overexpression of 80K-H enhanced the Ca2+ release activity of IP3Rs in vivo. Knockdown of 80K-H Attenuates ATP-induced Ca2+ Release—We next investigated the knockdown effect of 80K-H on ATP-induced Ca2+ release in COS-7 cells using siRNA for 80K-H. First we checked the specificity of siRNA for 80K-H in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, siRNA targeting 80K-H (si-80K-H) specifically decreased the endogenous 80K-H expression without interfering with the expression of other proteins (IP3Rs, PLCβ2, protein kinase C α, and β-actin). Control siRNA did not affect the expression levels of 80K-H, IP3Rs, PLCβ2, protein kinase C α, and β-actin, and the levels were similar to those in nontransfected cells (Fig. 5A) and non-siRNA control (data not shown). Consistent with this result, the immunosignals of 80K-H almost disappeared in si-80K-H-transfected cells compared with those in the nontransfected cells and control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5B). These results revealed that si-80K-H specifically led to the knockdown of 80K-H expression in COS-7 cells. Then we stimulated the si-80K-H transfected COS-7 cells with various concentrations of ATP (0.33, 3.0, and 10 μm) and examined the Ca2+ signals. The average peak amplitude of Ca2+ release decreased in si-80K-H-treated cells compared with the control siRNA-treated cells at all ATP concentrations (Fig. 5, C and D). No significant difference was observed in the amount of Ca2+ stored between the si-80K-H-transfected cells and control siRNA-transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that 80K-H knockdown decreased ATP-induced Ca2+ release in COS-7 cells. 80K-H Directly Enhanced IP3-induced Ca2+ Release from the Cerebellar Microsomes—To confirm the direct effect of 80K-H on IP3R channel activity, we performed an in vitro calcium release assay using recombinant MBP-80K-H and microsomes prepared from mice cerebella (36Ando H. Mizutani A. Kiefer H. Tsuzurugi D. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 795-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). After preincubation of microsomes with MBP-80K-H or control MBP, Ca2+ release activity was examined by addition of various concentrations of IP3. As shown in Fig. 6, MBP-80K-H significantly enhanced Ca2+ release in response to 20–1000 nm IP3 compared with MBP alone. The xhalf values, which are the apparent IP3 concentrations inducing half of the maximum Ca2+ release, obtained from the Hill equation fitting in this assay were 49.46 ± 1.17 (MBP) and 37.93 ± 1.09 nm (MBP-80K-H); this indicated that MBP-80K-H increased the apparent IP3 sensitivity by ∼1.3 times compared with that of MBP alone. These results demonstrated that 80K-H directly binds to IP3R1 and enhances IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity. 80K-H Colocalized with IP3R1 in Hippocampal Neurons—Finally we stained the mouse brain section with affinity-purified anti-80K-H antibody and anti-IP3R1 antibody to characterize the 80K-H expression pattern in the adult mouse brain. As shown in Fig. 7A, 80K-H was highly expressed in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1–CA3 region and extensively colocalized with IP3R1 in the CA1 hippocampal neurons. We also immunostained primary cultured hippocampal neurons to further clarify the intracellular distribution of 80K-H. As shown in Fig. 7B, 80K-H predominantly colocalized with IP3R1 in the cell body. Higher magnification images of hippocampal dendrites revealed that 80K-H showed a punctate distribution and partially colocalized with IP3R1 in the dendrites. Although IP3R1 is highly expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, 80K-H was barely detected in Purkinje cells (data not shown). In this study, we identified a novel IP3R-interacting protein, 80K-H, using the IP3R1 COOH-terminal domain as a bait. We showed that (i) 80K-H directly binds to IP3R1/CTT, (ii) 80K-H colocalizes with IP3R1 in intact cells and hippocampal neurons, (iii) 80K-H directly enhances IP3R activity in vitro and in vivo, (iv) 80K-H binds to all three types of IP3Rs, and (v) the 80K-H binding region of IP3R1 (amino acids 2637–2651 of IP3R1) was highly conserved among the three types of IP3R. On the basis of these results, we conclude that 80K-H directly binds to IP3Rs and enhances Ca2+ release activity in vivo. Recently several molecules that regulate Ca2+ release activity by binding to the COOH terminus of IP3Rs have been reported, namely cytochrome c (18Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O.

Bezprozvanny I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Bcl-XL (39White C. Li C. Yang J. Petrenko N.B. Madesh M. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 40Li C. Wang X. Vais H. Thompson C.B. Foskett J.K. White C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12565-12570Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly the binding region for these molecules within the IP3Rs overlapped with the 80K-H binding region, and their interaction generally enhanced IP3R activity. Thus, the corresponding domain could play an important role in the activation of the channel activity through protein-protein interaction. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IP3R activation by these interacting molecules are unclear. Our research challenge in the future is to investigate the IP3R gating mechanism and the effect of interacting molecules on IP3R gating. Previously by cDNA microarray analysis, 80K-H was identified as a transcript that was down-regulated in the kidneys of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-deficient mice that suffered from hypocalcemia (41Hoenderop J.G. Chon H. Gkika D. Bluyssen H.A. Holstege F.C. St-Arnaud R. Braam B. Bindels R.J. Kidney Int. 2004; 65: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly the recovery from severe hypocalcemia in these mice by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or dietary Ca2+ supplementation was shown to be accompanied by an increase in 80K-H mRNA expression. In addition, rats with chronic hypocalcemia induced by vitamin D depletion show significant decreases in the resting Ca2+ concentration, IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool, and IP3-mobilizable Ca2+ release in response to several classes of Ca2+-mobilizing agonists in hepatocytes (42Mailhot G. Petit J.L. Demers C. Gascon-Barre M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These reports together with our data, which established that 80K-H enhanced IP3R activity, suggest that the decreased IP3-induced Ca2+ release due to the down-regulation of 80K-H is one of the causes of intracellular Ca2+ perturbations in the case of hypocalcemia. Recently the PRKCSH gene encoding 80K-H was also identified as a genetic background of autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (24Drenth J.P. te Morsche R.H. Smink R. Bonifacino J.S. Jansen J.B. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Li A. Davila S. Furu L. Qian Q. Tian X. Kamath P.S. King B.F. Torres V.E. Somlo S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease is characterized by the formation of multiple liver cysts that arise from proliferating intrahepatic epithelial cells of the bile ducts (cholangiocytes) (43Everson G.T. Taylor M.R. Doctor R.B. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Proliferation of these bile duct cells is also reported in a cholestatic liver disease (cholestasis) in which the loss of IP3Rs in cholangiocytes was reported (44Shibao K. Hirata K. Robert M.E. Nathanson M.H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because abnormal bile duct cell proliferation in a cholestasis model rat is inhibited by chronic infusion of gastrin that increases intracellular IP3 levels, we believe that IP3-mediated Ca2+ signals might be involved in the regulation of bile duct cell proliferation (45Glaser S. Benedetti A. Marucci L. Alvaro D. Baiocchi L. Kanno N. Caligiuri A. Phinizy J.L. Chowdury U. Papa E. LeSage G. Alpini G. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to examine whether the decreased IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling caused by the loss or mutation of 80K-H is responsible for the excessive cholangiocyte proliferation in autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease. In summary, we identified 80K-H to be a novel IP3R-interacting protein that enhanced the Ca2+ release activity of IP3Rs. Because 80K-H is coexpressed with IP3R1 in hippocampal neurons and IP3Rs play an important role in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons (46Fujii S. Matsumoto M. Igarashi K. Kato H. Mikoshiba K. Learn. Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 2000; 7: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 47Taufiq A.M. Fujii S. Yamazaki Y. Sasaki H. Kaneko K. Li J. Kato H. Mikoshiba K. Learn. Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 2005; 12: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 80K-H may contribute to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal neurons by regulating the IP3R1 activity. Further studies using 80K-H knock-out mice would help us to reveal the relationship between 80K-H and IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling in brain function and understand the pathological considerations.

Functional quality control checkpoints are known to contribute to cell surface trafficking of non-N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptors. Here we investigated if similar mechanisms operate for the surface delivery of NMDA receptors. Point mutations in the glycine binding domain of the NR1-1a subunit were generated: D732A, a mutation that results in an ∼3 × 104 decrease in glycine binding affinity; D732E, a conservative change; and D723A, a residue in the same NR1-1a domain that has no effect on glycine binding affinity. Each NR1-1a subunit was co-expressed with NR2A in mammalian cells. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations showed that all mutants were expressed to similar levels as wild-type NR1-1a and associated with NR2A. Cell surface expression measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay found that whereas NR1-1a (D732E)/NR2A and NR1-1a (D723A)/NR2A trafficked as efficiently as NR1-1a/NR2A, there was a 90% decrease in surface expression for NR1-1a (D732A)/NR2A. This was confirmed by confocal microscopy imaging and cell surface biotinylation. Further imaging showed that NR1-1a (D732A) and co-transfected NR2A co-localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker. Dichlorokynurenic acid, a competitive glycine site antagonist, partially rescued surface expression. Mutation of the NR1-1a ER retention motif showed that the ligand binding checkpoint is an early event preceding endoplasmic reticulum sorting mechanisms.

They are important due to the pivotal role they play in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and synaptogenesis during the development of the central nervous system. They are activated by the binding of the co-agonists, l-glutamate and glycine, and the alleviation of voltage-dependent blockade by magnesium ions. Receptor activation results within milliseconds in the opening of an integral ion channel that has a high permeability for calcium ions. The dysfunction of NMDA receptors is implicated in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. This is primarily due to the permeability properties of the NMDA receptor channel; overactivation results in inappropriate increases in intracellular calcium ion concentration and excitotoxic neuronal cell death (reviewed in Ref. 1Cull-Candy S.

There are seven NMDA receptor genes encoding the NR1, NR2A–NR2D, and NR3A–NR3B subunits. Functional NMDA receptors are formed from the co-assembly of the obligatory NR1 subunit with NR2 and/or NR3 subunits. The quaternary structure of NMDA receptors is still not definitively proven, although the weight of experimental evidence supports a tetrameric structure comprising two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (reviewed in Ref. 2Stephenson F.A. Cousins S.L. Kenny A.V. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The glycine and glutamate co-agonist binding sites of NMDA receptors are formed by the N-terminal S1 and S2 extracellular domains of the NR1 and NR2 subunits, respectively (Fig. 1A). It is thought that these two lobes form a Venus flytrap or clamshell structure that is opened following the binding of either glycine (NR1) or glutamate (NR2).

Green T. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 42: 437-443Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structures of the soluble NMDA receptor NR1 S1-S2 and NR2 S1-S2 loop constructs in the presence of the appropriate agonist were resolved, consolidating the findings from the mutagenesis experiments (13Furukawa H. Gouaux E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 14Furukawa H. Singh S.K. Mancusso R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 438: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The cell surface expression of NMDA receptors in neurons is tightly regulated. This is important, since, as mentioned earlier, overactivation of receptors or inappropriate increase in receptor number leads to an excessive influx of calcium ions and resultant excitotoxicity and neuronal cell death as found in ischemia (15Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Conversely, NMDA receptor hypofunction, exemplified by either a decrease in receptor activity or decreased cell surface receptor number, is associated with schizophrenia (16Mohn A.R. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Koller B.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). With regard to NMDA receptor activity, there is therefore a fine balance between levels that are necessary for normal neuronal functional and those that result in neuropathological conditions. NMDA receptor cell surface expression is regulated by standard quality control mechanisms applicable to all membrane proteins (17Ellgard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). These include primary control checkpoints (i.e. the detection and elimination of misfolded subunits by chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and secondary, more protein-specific checkpoints, such as the masking of ER retention motifs that ensure that only correctly folded and assembled receptors are trafficked to the cell surface (reviewed in Refs. 17Ellgard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar and 18Pryblyowski K. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 9672-9676Google Scholar)). For non-NMDA, ionotropic glutamate receptors, additional, functional quality control checkpoints have been shown to contribute to the regulation of cell surface trafficking. It was reported that the integrity of the glutamate binding site is requisite for export of the Caenorhabditis elegans non-NMDA glutamate receptor (GLR-1) (19Grunwald M.E. Kaplan J.M. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the mammalian non-NMDA GluR6 subunit-containing kainate receptors from the ER (20Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Vallaru L. Xu J. Zhu Y. Yan S. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6085-6093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further, exit from the ER of GluR2 subunits is controlled by RNA editing at the Q/R site in the pore-forming re-entrant membrane domain (22Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Usually, GluR2 is retained in the ER, but if the edited site is reversed such that the amino acid is glutamine, as found for the other non-NMDA receptor subunits, rapid ER exit is observed (22Greger I.H. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2002; 34: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Third, the densitization capability of non-NMDA receptors has also been identified as an ER checkpoint. Priel et al. (23Priel A. Selak S. Lerma J. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2006; 52: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) found that only GluR6 homomers that can desensitize reach the cell surface, whereas Greger et al. (24Greger I.H. Akamine P. Khatri L. Ziff E.B. Neuron. 2006; 51: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that GluR2 tetramers containing the point mutation, L483Y that locks the receptor in an active, nondesensitizing conformation state, are retained in the ER. For NMDA receptors, ER retention motifs in the intracellular C-terminal domain and within the third membrane domain of NR1 and NR2 subunits and ER export motifs in the C termini have been shown to regulate surface trafficking (25Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Standley S.H. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J.

Here we investigated whether determinants within the extracellular N-terminal, agonist binding region contribute additional functional quality control checkpoints, as found for the non-NMDA glutamate receptors. Specifically, we have investigated whether the integrity of the glycine co-agonist binding site is required for cell surface delivery of NMDA receptors. We employed a site-directed mutagenesis strategy for the NR1 glycine binding site in conjunction with a cell surface assay to demonstrate that this is indeed the case; we have investigated the relationship between this checkpoint and ER retention mechanisms and we report partial rescue of cell surface trafficking of the glycine binding site mutant by a pharmacological chaperone. Constructs and Antibodies—pCISNR1-1a, pCISNR1-4b, and pCISNR2A were as previously described (30Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Rutter A.R. Freeman F.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). pCISNR1-1a (D732A), pCISNR1-1a (D732E), pCISNR1-1a (D723A), pCISNR1-4b (D753A), pCISNR1-1a (RRR→AAA, residues 893–895), and pCISNR1-1a (D732/AAA) were generated using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the complementary oligonucleotide primers listed in supplemental Table 1. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (MWG-Biotech AG, Ebersberg, Germany). Affinity-purified anti-NR1-(35–53); anti-NR1 C2-(911–920); anti-NR2A-(44–58 Cys), and anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies were raised and characterized as previously reported (30Cik M. Chazot P.L.

A. 2006; 103: 18769-18774Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to calreticulin and the 58-kDa Golgi protein were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Mammalian Cell Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured and transfected with either wild-type or mutant pCISNR1-1a, pCISNR1-4b clones alone or in pCISNR1-1a/pCISNR2A, pCISNR1-4b/pCISNR2A combinations using the calcium phosphate method with a total of 10 μg of DNA (30Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For transfections containing NR1/NR2A clones only, cells were incubated post-transfection in the presence of 1 mm ketamine to prevent NMDA receptor-mediated cytotoxicity. Cells were harvested 20 h post-transfection, and homogenates were prepared, adjusted to 0.5 mg protein/ml, and analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. For transfections where cell surface NMDA receptor expression was measured, HEK 293 cells were subcultured overnight prior to transfection in poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml)-coated 24-well dishes, and 0.5 μg of total plasmid DNA was used per well. For transfections where cells were imaged by confocal microscopy, a coverslip was added to each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. Poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml; 1 ml) was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature, washed two times with 1 ml of H2O, and left to air-dry under sterile conditions. HEK 293 or COS-7 cells were added and subcultured overnight prior to transfection with 0.5 μg of total plasmid DNA/well. For the pharmacological chaperone experiments, glycine or 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (DCKA; Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was added with ketamine to the cell culture media post-transfection. A stock concentration of DCKA was prepared in 10% (v/v) DMSO; this was diluted to the appropriate DCKA concentrations to yield a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v) DMSO in the cell culture media post-transfection for all test and control transfections. Cell Cytotoxicity—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with various pCISNR1/pCISNR2A wild-type and mutant constructs. Twenty hours post-transfection, cell cytotoxicity was determined using the Promega CytoTox 96™ cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as described previously (32Chazot P.L. Coleman S.K. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 39: 24403-24409Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described using 25–50 μg of protein/sample precipitated using the chloroform/methanol method and SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 7.5% polyacrylamide slab minigels (34Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rabbit horseradish-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a final dilution of 1:2000, and immunoreactivities were detected using the ECL Western blotting system. Immunoprecipitation Assays—HEK 293 cells were transfected with pCISNR1-1a/pCISNR2A, NR1-1a (D732A)/pCISNR2A or pCISNR1-1a (D732E)/pCISNR2A. Cells were harvested 20 h post-transfection, and cell homogenates were prepared and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris-citrate, pH 7.4, 240 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, containing benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) at a concentration of 1.5 mg protein/ml. The solubilized material was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Detergent-solubilized extracts of transfected HEK 293 cells (1 mg of protein/ml with a final Triton X-100 concentration of 1% (v/v); 2 ml) were incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-NR1 C2 antibodies (10 μg) or protein A-purified non-immune rabbit Ig (10 μg) as control overnight at 4 °C (34Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune pellets were collected by centrifugation for 3 s at 600 × g and washed with 3 × 1 ml solubilization buffer and then were analyzed by immunoblotting. Determination of NMDA Receptor Cell Surface Expression by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The measurement of cell surface NR1 and NR1/NR2A receptors was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with affinity-purified antibodies directed against extracellular epitopes of NR1 or NR2A subunits (i.e. anti-NR1-(35–53) (1 μg/ml) and anti-NR2A-(44–58) (0.125 μg/ml)), as described by Papadakis et al. (34Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the measurement of total subunit expression in the transfected cells, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, washed with 1× PBS, and incubated with 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and the assay was completed as for the determination of cell surface expression as above. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—HEK 293 cells were transfected with either pCISNR1-1a/pCISNR2A or pCISNR1-1a (D732A)/pCISNR2A, and 20 h post-transfection, cell culture medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated with 6 ml of PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 10 min with shaking. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with 3 × 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, by centrifuging at 200 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of PBS, pH 8.0, and incubated with 1 ml of 10 mm EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin in double-distilled H2O (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with 3 × 10 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 100 mm glycine. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-NR1 C2 and non-immune Ig antibodies as above, except that the solubilization buffer was PBS containing all protease inhibitors, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 240 mm NaCl. Immune pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting using 1 μg/ml ImmunoPure® streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) to detect biotinylated proteins. Endoglycosidase H and N-Glycosidase F Digestion of HEK 293 Transfected Cells—HEK 293 cells were harvested 20 h post-transfection as above, cell homogenates were prepared, and samples (30 μg of protein) were denatured in Denaturing Buffer (50 μl; New England Biolabs (UK) Ltd., Hitchin, UK) at 100 °C for 10 min. For endoglycosidase H digestion, 10× G5 reaction buffer (7 μl) and 500 units of endoglycosidase H were added to a final volume of 70 μl. For N-glycosidase F digestion, 10× G7 reaction buffer (7 μl), 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 500 units of N-glycosidase F were added to a final volume of 70 μl. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Controls were protein samples incubated for 1 h at 37 °C or at 4 °C in the absence of enzymes. All samples were precipitated using the chloroform/methanol method and analyzed by immunoblotting. Confocal Microscopy Imaging of NMDA Receptors Expressed in Mammalian Cells—For the imaging of surface-expressed NMDA receptors, cells were labeled live at 20 h post-transfection. Each coverslip of transfected cells was washed on ice for 5 min with 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The primary antibody, (anti-NR2A-(44–58 Cys); 100 μl of 2 μg/ml) was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Coverslips were washed with 3 × 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, incubated with a dilution of 1:5000 anti-rabbit-Ig Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice, and washed with 3 × 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum followed by 2 × 1 ml of PBS. Cells were fixed by incubation with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed with 2 × 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum followed by 2 × 1 ml of PBS, and mounted onto a microscope slide using 10 μl of mounting solution containing an anti-fading agent (CitiFluor; Citifluor Ltd., Leicester, UK). The coverslips were sealed and kept at 4 °C until analysis. For the imaging of intracellular NMDA receptors, the ER, and the Golgi, transfected HEK 293 or COS-7 cells were first fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were washed with 3 × 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES for 5 min at room temperature. Antibody labeling was then as for immunodetection of surface-expressed NMDA receptors, except that all incubations were at room temperature, and the antibodies used were as follows: for HEK 293 cells, anti-NR2A-(44–58 Cys) (0.5 μg/ml) and for COS-7 cells, anti-NR1 C2 (2 μg/ml) and anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) (2 μg/ml). The concentrations of mouse anti-calreticulin and mouse anti-58-kDa Golgi protein antibodies were 4 μg/ml with 1:400 anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). Transfected HEK 293 and COS-7 cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. Rationale for the Selection of NMDA Receptor NR1 Subunit Mutations—As described in the Introduction, several groups have identified key amino acid residues involved in glycine binding to assembled NMDA receptors. We reviewed the published information to determine NR1 mutations that gave the maximum change in terms of decreased apparent affinity for channel activation by glycine and that were also implicated in agonist binding from the x-ray crystallographic studies. The mutation selected was NR1-1a (D732A), which is in the S2 domain. This mutation had a reported decrease in glycine apparent affinity of 35,000-fold for heteromeric NR1 (D732A)/NR2B receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes (6Williams K. Chao J. Kashiwagi K. Masuko T. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar). For controls, the conservative mutation NR1-1a (D732E) was generated. Also, a mutation was created in a residue that was within the NR1 S2 domain, but when mutated, it did not result in a change in glycine apparent affinity (6Williams K. Chao J. Kashiwagi K. Masuko T. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708PubMed Google Scholar), and the x-ray crystal structure revealed that it did not participate in ligand binding (i.e. NR1-1a (D723A)). A schematic summary of the mutations and the relevant parts of the x-ray crystal structures are shown in Fig. 1. Characterization of the Mutant NMDA Receptor NR1 and NR2 Subunits—In the first instance, all mutated subunit clones were transfected with the appropriate wild-type subunit clones to determine if each was expressed to the same level. Thus, transfected cells were harvested, and total cell homogenates were analyzed by immunoblotting. The results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. There was no significant difference in the overall expression levels between wild-type and mutated subunits. All NR1-1a subunits except NR1-1a (D732A) had a molecular mass of 121 ± 1 kDa (n = 18); the molecular mass of NR1-1a (D732A) was 119 ± 1 kDa (n = 17; p < 0.001). For all subunits, a dimer of NR1-1a immunoreactivity with molecular mass of 217 kDa was clearly visible. This is in agreement with previous reports of an NR1-NR1 disulfide-linked homodimer (34Papadakis M. Hawkins L.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14703-14712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Schuler T. Mesic I. Madry C. Bartholomaus I. Laube B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 37-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); it shows that mutations within the LAOBP domain do not affect dimer formation. Cell cytotoxicity post-transfection is a useful biochemical means to measure functional cell surface NMDA receptor expression, since the cell death has been attributed to activation of functional cell surface NMDA receptors by l-glutamate and glycine in the cell culture media with a subsequent unregulated influx of Ca2+ (30Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To characterize further the NMDA receptor mutated subunits to confirm the decreases in agonist affinity conferred by the selected mutations, each was co-expressed with the wild-type NR2A subunit, and cell death was measured 20 h post-transfection. In the presence of ketamine, the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, there was no detectable cell death for any of the wild-type and mutant NR1/NR2 combinations (Fig. 2). In the absence of ketamine with wild-type NR1/NR2A transfectants normalized to 100% cell death, for the NR1-1a mutations, there was no significant difference in mortality between wild type and the control NR1-1a (D723A)/NR2A mutation. This was in contrast to the significant decreased cell mortality found for both NR1-1a (D732A)/NR2A and NR1-1a (D732E)/NR2A, where values were 9.9 ± 2.0% (n = 15) and 28.7 ± 9.2% (n = 4) compared with 100% for wild type. These findings are consistent with a decreased affinity for the glycine NR1-1a (D732A) and NR1-1a (D732E) mutations. Inactivation of the Glycine Binding Site of NMDA Receptors Results in a Deficit in Cell Surface Trafficking—To investigate if the glycine binding site mutation had an effect on cell surface trafficking of NMDA receptors, each mutant subunit was co-expressed with the appropriate wild-type subunit, and cell surface expression was measured qualitatively by confocal microscopy imaging and cell surface biotinylation and quantitatively by a cell surface ELISA. The results are shown in Fig. 3."
https://openalex.org/W2047790317,"The intracellular fate of iron acquired by bacteria during siderophore-mediated assimilation is poorly understood. We investigated this question in the pathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi. This bacterium produces two siderophores, chrysobactin and achromobactin, during plant infection. We analyzed the distribution of iron into cytosolic proteins in bacterial cells supplied with 59Fe-chrysobactin using native gel electrophoresis. A parental strain and mutants deficient in bacterioferritin (bfr), miniferritin (dps), ferritin (ftnA), bacterioferredoxin (bfd), or iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery (sufABCDSE) were studied. In the parental strain, we observed two rapidly 59Fe-labeled protein signals identified as bacterioferritin and an iron pool associated to the protein chain-elongation process. In the presence of increased 59Fe-chrysobactin concentrations, we detected mini-ferritin-bound iron. Iron incorporation into bacterioferritin was severely reduced in nonpolar sufA, sufB, sufD, sufS, and sufE mutants but not in a sufC background. Iron recycling from bacterioferritin did not occur in bfd and sufC mutants. Iron depletion caused a loss of aconitase activity, whereas ferric chrysobactin supplementation stimulated the production of active aconitase in parental cells and in bfr and bfd mutants. Aconitase activity in sufA, sufB, sufD, sufS, and sufE mutant strains was 10 times lower than that in parental cells. In the sufC mutant, it was twice as low as that in the parental strain. Defects observed in the mutants were not caused by altered ferric chrysobactin transport. Our data demonstrate a functional link between bacterioferritin, bacterioferredoxin, and the Suf protein machinery resulting in optimal bacterial growth and a balanced distribution of iron between essential metalloproteins.

Our data demonstrate a functional link between bacterioferritin, bacterioferredoxin, and the Suf protein machinery resulting in optimal bacterial growth and a balanced distribution of iron between essential metalloproteins. Iron is necessary for most forms of life, being required for the catalytic activity of essential proteins mediating electron transfer and redox reactions. The importance of this metal relies on its electronic structure, which can undergo changes through several oxidation states differing by one electron. The ferric form of iron predominates in aerobic environments, but its bioavailability is severely compromised by its poor solubility (1Neilands J.B. Biol. Met. 1991; 4: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ferrous iron is present at significant levels in the cell but can be toxic as a consequence of its participation in “Fenton-type” redox chemistry (2Pierre J.-L. Fontecave M. BioMetals. 1999; 12: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 3Imlay J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 395-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Thus, iron acquisition, utilization, and storage are subject to different levels of homeostatic regulation. Microorganisms have developed powerful iron acquisition systems based on production of siderophores, which are selective ferric ion chelators secreted in response to iron deficiency (4Faraldo-Gomez J.D. Sansom M.S. P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Once loaded with iron, the siderophore is specifically imported into the cell. This requires active transport which, in Gram-negative bacteria, is achieved by a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor and a permease belonging to the ABC transporter family (5Krewulak K.D. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1781-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Regulation of siderophore production and uptake involves the metalloprotein Fur 3The abbreviations used are:Furferric uptake regulationIsciron-sulfur clusterSufsulfur utilization factorFtnferritinBfrbacterioferritinDpsDNA protein from starved cellsBfdbacterioferredoxinFMPfast migrating proteins 3The abbreviations used are:Furferric uptake regulationIsciron-sulfur clusterSufsulfur utilization factorFtnferritinBfrbacterioferritinDpsDNA protein from starved cellsBfdbacterioferredoxinFMPfast migrating proteins or functional analogs, acting as transcriptional repressors of iron-responsive genes (6Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. BioMetals. 2007; 20: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although major advances have improved understanding of the processes involved in ferric siderophore uptake, there is still little information on the intracellular fate of iron, once released from its ligand. Enzymatic degradation of the ferric siderophore complex and/or enzymatic reduction to the ferrous state are effective mechanisms for iron removal (7Miethke M. Marahiel M.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 413-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined how the cell prioritizes its intracellular iron utilization so that iron-containing proteins preferentially receive iron, at the same time avoiding toxic side reactions. Of the various classes of iron-containing proteins, iron-sulfur proteins and ferritins are of particular interest. ferric uptake regulation iron-sulfur cluster sulfur utilization factor ferritin bacterioferritin DNA protein from starved cells bacterioferredoxin fast migrating proteins ferric uptake regulation iron-sulfur cluster sulfur utilization factor ferritin bacterioferritin DNA protein from starved cells bacterioferredoxin fast migrating proteins Biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins involves complex protein machineries that build iron-sulfur clusters from cytosolic iron and sulfur sources and transfer them to their cognate protein acceptors. Studies in various bacterial species, including Escherichia coli, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and cyanobacteria have led to the identification of the Isc and Suf machinery, which have homologs in eukaryotes (8Barras F. Loiseau L. Py B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2005; 50: 41-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Ayala-Castro C. Saini A Outten F.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 64: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Isc or Suf proteins work together have been an area of intense investigations (11Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 12Fontecave M. Ollagnier de Choudens S. Barras F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2005; 10: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the isc operon appear to mediate a general pathway for the assembly of a variety of iron-sulfur proteins, whereas those encoded by the suf operon play a role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis under conditions of iron deficiency or oxidative stress (13Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol.

The iron donation step for cluster assembly in vivo is unknown (16Layer G. Ollagnier de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16256-16263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Ding H. Yang J. Coleman L.C Yeung S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 7997-8004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the mitochondrial frataxin protein has been proposed to act as an iron donor for assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (18Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 906-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 19Foury F. Pastore A. Trincal M. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and a similar function was assigned to the bacterial homolog CyaY for the Isc machinery, although this still needs to be confirmed (16Layer G. Ollagnier de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16256-16263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability of the Suf pathway to function when iron is limiting suggests not only that Suf is involved in iron-sulfur cluster assembly but also that Suf may act as an iron trap. Ferritins are iron storage proteins that sequester iron in a nonreactive form, protecting the cell from iron-induced toxicity (20Matzanke B.F. Winkelmann G. Carrano C.J. Transition Metals in Microbial Metabolism. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1997: 117-158Google Scholar, 21Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). In bacteria, these proteins are present in the same compartment as other iron-requiring proteins falling into three categories: heme-free ferritins (Ftn), found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes; heme-containing bacterioferritins (Bfr), found only in bacteria; and Dps proteins, also called mini-ferritins, present only in prokaryotes (22Chiancone E. Ceci P. Ilari A. Ribacchi F. Stefanini S. BioMetals. 2004; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 23Smith J.L. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 30: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Ferritins and bacterioferritins are composed of 24 identical subunits, and Dps proteins contain 12 identical subunits. These subunits assemble to make a spherical protein shell surrounding a central cavity able to hold up to between 2,000 and 3,000 ferric iron atoms for ferritins and 500 atoms for mini-ferritins (21Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 24Carrondo M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Ferritins have a binuclear di-iron center constituting the ferroxidase center, which is involved in the oxidation of the ferrous iron (25Le Brun N.E. Andrews S.C. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. Moore G.R. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 26Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsernoglou D. Nat. Struct.

A. 2004; 101: 8557-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ferritins can act as acceptors and donors of ferrous ions, but their precise contribution in bacterial iron metabolism is not well understood. An appropriate system physiologically relevant and representative of the bacterial world is needed to address these unresolved issues. We have developed E. chrysanthemi (Dickeya dadantii) as a model plant pathogen to investigate the role of iron during infection (29Expert D. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1999; 37: 307-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The genome sequence of this bacterium is available and like many other bacterial species pathogenic to mammals, E. chrysanthemi requires powerful iron transport routes to obtain iron from host tissues. Notably, this bacterium produces two siderophores, chrysobactin and achromobactin, which are important for its virulence (30Franza T. Mahé B. Expert D. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Successful infection also requires a functional Suf system (31Nachin L. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The E. chrysanthemi FtnA ferritin and Bfr bacterioferritin have different roles in vivo. Like in E. coli, expression of the cognate ftnA gene is positively controlled by iron and the Fur repressor through a mechanism involving the small antisense RNA RyhB (32Boughammoura A. Matzanke B. Böttger L. Reverchon S. Lesuisse E. Expert D. Franza T. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The E. chrysanthemi bfr gene is clustered into an operon with the bfd gene that encodes a 64-amino acid peptide (Bfd). This peptide shows 70% of sequence identity with the bacterioferritin-associated [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from E. coli K-12 (33Andrews S.C. Harisson P.C. Guest J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3940-3947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Garg P.R. Vargo C.J. Cui X. Kurtz D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The operon is expressed at a basal level and up-regulated at the stationary phase of growth by the sigma S factor (32Boughammoura A. Matzanke B. Böttger L. Reverchon S. Lesuisse E. Expert D. Franza T. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1518-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The E. chrysanthemi genome sequence also revealed the existence of a gene (dps) encoding a putative mini-ferritin (Dps). In this study, we investigated the distribution of iron bound to cytosolic proteins from E. chrysanthemi mutant cells defective in siderophore biosynthesis, supplied with 59Fe via chrysobactin. The addition of iron stimulates growth and leads to global metabolic recovery in iron-deprived cells. We compared mutants deficient in bacterioferritin, bacterioferredoxin, ferritin, mini-ferritin, various Suf proteins, and Fur protein. We demonstrated a functional link between Bfr, Bfd, and the Suf protein machinery, which results in the balanced distribution of iron between essential proteins. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Microbiological Techniques—The bacterial strains and plasmids used are described in supplemental Table S1. The cbsE-1, cbsC-1, acsA-37, acsF::Ω and dps::Ω mutations were introduced into the appropriate bfr, ftnA, suf, and fur deficient mutants by transduction using phage φEC2 as described previously (35Franza T. Enard C. Van Gijsegem F. Expert D. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The rich media used were L broth and L agar (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Tris medium was used as a low iron minimal medium (37Franza T. Sauvage C. Expert D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glassware for Tris medium was treated as described previously (37Franza T. Sauvage C. Expert D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For iron-replete conditions, Tris medium was supplemented with ferric chrysobactin at the concentrations indicated. Ferric chrysobactin was prepared by adding FeCl3 to chrysobactin in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, at a ligand/iron ratio of 3:1. Glucose (2 g/liter) was used as carbon source. The antibacterial agents and chemicals were used as reported previously (35Franza T. Enard C. Van Gijsegem F. Expert D. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Franza T. Sauvage C. Expert D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) unless otherwise specified. Construction of the dps and bfd Deficient Mutants and General DNA Methods—A genomic fragment from the dps locus was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′ sense dps1s (5′-attatcgcctcgctggga-3′) and 3′ reverse dps1r (5′-catcaaaacgtccttcctc-3′) and cloned using the pGEM-T Easy vector. This fragment was then subcloned into the pBC plasmid using appropriate restriction enzymes to introduce a unique EcoRV restriction site into the dps gene. The Ω-Spec interposon from pHP45Ω hydrolyzed with SmaI was inserted into the EcoRV site to obtain plasmid pAB12 (38Résibois A. Colet M. Faelen M. Schoonejans E. Toussaint A. Virology. 1984; 137: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). To introduce a nonpolar mutation in the bfd gene, the apha-3 cassette, obtained by SmaI digestion of pUC18K, was inserted into the T4 Polymerase blunted NsiI site of pAB3 (40Ménard R. Sansonetti P. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Plasmid transformation and marker exchange recombination with the chromosome were performed as described previously (37Franza T. Sauvage C. Expert D. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Correct recombination was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot hybridization experiments. For construction of plasmid pAB14, a genomic fragment from the bfd-bfr encoding locus was amplified by PCR with the primers sense bfr1s (5′-ggtcgtgtagagcggca-3′) and reverse bfdr (5′-gtagaagcggtcaacacagag-3′) and inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector. This fragment was subcloned into the ApaI and SpeI sites of the pBC plasmid. DNA manipulation techniques (chromosomal DNA isolation, cloning, and electrophoresis) were described previously (35Franza T. Enard C. Van Gijsegem F. Expert D. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Plasmids were extracted using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). All of the cloning experiments were performed in the DH5α strain of E. coli. PCR was performed in a DNA thermocycler (Hybaid PCR Express System) with denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 52 °C for 75 s, an extension at 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were cloned using the plasmid pGEM-T Easy, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences of PCR products and plasmids were obtained from Genome Express. In Vivo Labeling of Bacterial Cultures, Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts, and Analysis of Protein-bound 59Fe Iron—An overnight culture in L broth of the strain to be studied was diluted 1:40 in 5 ml of Tris medium supplemented with glucose placed in a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubated with shaking until A600 nm = 0.4 was reached. Iron labeling was started by adding a ferric chrysobactin complex solution prepared with 59FeCl3 (3-20 mCi/mg iron in 0.5 m HCl; GE Healthcare). Samples (1 ml) were taken at the indicated times. Excess unlabeled ferric chrysobactin was added to each sample. Bacterial cells were spun down in a microcentrifuge, at 7000 RPM at 4 °C. The cells were washed in a solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2 and harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20-40 μl of the same solution with DNase I and lysozyme added at final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed by six freeze/thaw cycles. The extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatant fluids were kept at -20 °C. To analyze the fate of iron during bacterial growth, labeled cells were centrifuged at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The cells were washed twice in Tris medium; washing fluids were eliminated by centrifugation. The washed cells were resuspended in Tris medium with glucose and left to grow for 2 h. The samples (1 ml) were taken at the indicated times, and bacterial cells were treated as described above. Whole cell extracts (25 μg protein) were analyzed by native PAGE in 10% acrylamide and Tris-glycine buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The dried gels were autoradiographed at -80 °C, for 48 h, using KODAK BioMax XAR films. For each bacterial strain, six independent time course experiments were performed. The autoradiograms shown are representative of one experiment. For each time point, the amount of 59Fe bound to relevant proteins was determined by scintillation counting of the excised bands from the gels. The results are given as the relative percentages of total counts measured on the gels, for each lane. The data reported are the averages of six independent experiments, and the standard deviations are indicated. Immunodetection of the Bfr Protein—Proteins (25 μg) were loaded and run onto 15% polyacrylamide 0.1% SDS denaturating gels. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA 83; Whatman) at 350 mA for 75 min in 30 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.025% SDS, 20% v/v methanol, pH 8.3, using the Bio-Rad mini-Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. Bfr antiserum was used at a dilution of 1/4000. Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of FMP Iron and Mass Spectrometry—Bands corresponding to the 59Fe-labeled proteins doublet detected by autoradiography of native gels were cut out (Fig. 5A, panel 1) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide and Tris-glycine buffer (Fig. 5A, panel 3), as described by Schägger and Von Jagow (42Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For control experiments, the protein bands excised from the gel were analyzed a second time on native PAGE (Fig. 5A, panel 2) to check for the presence of a 59Fe spot corresponding to the protein doublet detected on the first gel. Individual spots visualized after SDS-PAGE were excised, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Tryptinized peptides were extracted from the gel pieces with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, concentrated, desalted, using a ZipTip (Millipore, Molsheim, France), and spotted onto a steel target with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. The peptide mass fingerprint was acquired after external calibration with ions from des-Arg1-Bradykinin, Angitensin I, Glu1-Fibrinopeptide B, and neurotensin, on a 4800 TOF-TOF spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a YAG-200 Hz laser (355 nm). Operating parameters for the Reflectron included 1500 laser shots/spectrum. Monoisotopic masses were used with a maximum deviation of ± 100 ppm for mass assignment. For protein identification, the peptide mass fingerprint was searched against the ASAP data base, using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK). Protein hits were accepted if the Mascot score was greater than the significance threshold. This procedure was carried out in six independent samples isolated from cytosolic extracts of parental cells supplied with 59Fe-chrysobactin at concentrations of 0.25 μm, for 40 min. Transport Assays—Bacterial cultures were grown in the same conditions used for in vivo labeling experiments. Transport assays were carried out as described by Rauscher et al. (43Rauscher L. Expert D. Matzanke B.F. Trautwein A.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2385-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), with the addition of 59Fe-labeled chrysobactin to the transport medium at a concentration of 0.25 μm. Enzyme Assays—Aconitase activity was assayed in bacterial pellets from 100-ml cultures grown in the conditions indicated and stored at -80 °C for 24 h, as described by Gardner (44Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Intracellular Distribution of Iron in Cells Supplied with 59Fe-Chrysobactin—Previous studies have shown that the ferric chrysobactin complex is dissociated inside the cell through a rapid reductive process, making iron available for metabolic needs (43Rauscher L. Expert D. Matzanke B.F. Trautwein A.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2385-2395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, we used 59Fe-chrysobactin to try to identify intracellular protein targets of iron in E. chrysanthemi cells. We used a double mutant strain deficient in biosynthesis of both chrysobactin and achromobactin (PPV20) to avoid iron exchange between both ligands. In the low iron minimal Tris medium, the doubling time of this mutant was 160 min. The addition of ferric chrysobactin to the medium stimulated the growth rate, the doubling time being 100 min. Cytosolic protein extracts were analyzed by PAGE on nondenaturing gels, and protein-bound iron was visualized by autoradiography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We first tested a concentration range of 0.06-1 μm 59Fe-chrysobactin added over a period of 40 min (Fig. 1A). We detected a continuum of bands increasing in intensity with higher 59Fe concentrations, which could correspond to the banding region revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. In addition, two strong 59Fe signals (designated as 1 and 2 on Fig. 1A), a slowly migrating protein species and a quickly migrating protein doublet, were apparent. A third signal (designated as 3 on Fig. 1A) became visible with concentrations of 59Fe higher than 0.125 μm. We then performed a time course experiment. Protein-bound iron was probed at 10-min intervals over a 40-min period after adding 0.25 μm 59Fe-chrysobactin (Fig. 1B). We observed the same 59Fe signals increasing in intensity with time. Thus, iron binds a wide variety of proteins. Those referred to as signals 1 and 3 could be ferritin-like compounds. To test this possibility, we performed similar experiments with bfr, dps, and ftnA mutant strains carrying defects in the production of Bfr, Dps, or FtnA protein (PPV51, PPV52, and PPV53), respectively. Iron-deprived bacterial cells were supplied with 0.25 μm 59Fe-chrysobactin for 40 min, and protein-bound iron was analyzed (supplemental Fig. S1). Signal 1, identified in the parental strain as a slowly migrating protein, was absent from the bfr mutant but present in dps and ftnA mutants, suggesting that this protein could be Bfr. Signal 3 (Fig. 1, A and B), another slowly migrating protein identified in the parental strain, was present in the ftnA mutant but absent from the dps mutant. This signal was therefore likely to correspond to Dps. A fur mutant, which displays a low level of transcriptional activity of the bfd-bfr operon, showed a particularly strong Dps signal (supplemental Fig. S1). To confirm these data, we increased the concentration of 59Fe-chrysobactin in the medium to 1 μm and compared the signal patterns obtained from mutant strains to those from the parental strain (Fig. 1C). In the parental strain, the signals corresponding to Bfr and Dps were strong, whereas they were absent from the respective mutants. Both signals were absent from the bfr dps double mutant (PPV54) (Fig. 1C). The doublet corresponding to the quickly migrating protein species was present in all of the mutant strains. Its signal intensity increased over time, as observed for the parental strain (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, some of the iron released from chrysobactin is sequestered by Bfr, Dps, and a set of proteins unrelated to ferritins, designated FMP. The amounts of 59Fe bound to these various protein species were quantified (supplemental Table S2). In parental cells supplied with 0.25 μm 59Fe-chrysobactin for 40 min, iron bound to Bfr represented ∼5%, Dps iron represented ∼1%, and FMP iron 16% of total 59Fe detected on the gels. In the bfr mutant, levels of FMP iron were similar to those of the parent strain, whereas they reached 20% in the dps mutant. In the fur mutant, iron bound to Dps and FMP represented 16 and 20% of total 59Fe signal, respectively. We did not detect iron bound to FtnA, probably because the ftnA gene is not expressed in iron-deprived cells (32Boughammoura A. Matzanke B. Böttger L. Reverchon S. Lesuisse E. Expert D. Franza T. J.

Release of Iron from Bacterioferritin Requires Bacterioferredoxin—The roles of bacterioferritin and bacterioferredoxin in iron metabolism are not well understood.

In vitro data indicate that the two pathways may interact. Whether such interactions occur during embryonic development remains unknown. Using embryonic lung morphogenesis as a model, we generated transgenic mice in which exon 2 of the TβRII gene, which encodes the type II TGF-β receptor, was deleted via a mesodermal-specific Cre. Mesodermal-specific deletion of TβRII (TβRIIΔ/Δ) resulted in embryonic lethality. The lungs showed abnormalities in both number and shape of cartilage in trachea and bronchi. In the lung parenchyma, where epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are critical for normal development, deletion of mesenchymal TβRII caused abnormalities in epithelial morphogenesis. Failure in normal epithelial branching morphogenesis in the TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs caused cystic airway malformations. Interruption of the TβRII locus in the lung mesenchyme increased mRNA for Patched and Gli-1, two downstream targets of Shh signaling, without alterations in Shh ligand levels produced in the epithelium. Therefore, we conclude that TβRII-mediated signaling in the lung mesenchyme modulates transduction of Shh signaling that originates from the epithelium. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence for a reciprocal and novel mode of cross-communication between Shh and TGF-β pathways during embryonic development.

TGF-β initiates its cellular actions by interacting with a heteromeric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, the type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptors. The binding of TGF-β ligand to the receptor complex induces phosphorylation of type I by the type II receptors and activates Smads, a family of transcriptional factors that act as intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar). Smad2 and/or Smad3 are phosphorylated in their C-terminal domain upon stimulation by either activin or TGF-β (2Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 is accompanied by their association with Smad4 and translocation of the heteromeric complex to the nucleus where they affect transcription of target genes through interaction with promoter-specific transcriptional factors or by direct DNA binding (3Wrana J.L.

Targeted deletion of each of the three ligand isoforms causes severe abnormalities in morphogenesis of various organs including the lung. Tgf-β2-null mice exhibit perinatal mortality and a wide range of developmental abnormalities that include cardiac, lung, craniofacial, limb, spinal column, eye, inner ear, and urogenital defects (4Sanford L.P. Ormsby I. Gittenberger-de Groot A.C. Sariola H. Friedman R. Boivin G.P. Cardell E.L. Doetschman T. Development. 1997; 124: 2659-2670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tgf-β3 mutants die as neonates due to abnormal lung development and cleft palate (5Kaartinen V. Voncken J.W. Shuler C. Warburton D. Bu D. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Tgf-β1 gene results in abnormalities in the lung, manifested as dilation of the airways (6Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted deletion of Smad3 are viable, but develop lung abnormalities akin to emphysema (7Chen H. Sun J. Buckley S. Chen C. Warburton D. Wang X.F. Shi W. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005; 288: L683-L691Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Little is known about the role of other components of the TGF-β pathway and interactions with other signaling molecules in the lung. Embryonic lung development represents a useful model in which to study complex tissue interactions in organ development. Lung morphogenesis is strictly dependent on cross-talk between two distinct tissues, the endodermal-derived epithelium and the mesodermal-derived lung mesenchyme (8Shannon J.M. Hyatt B.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A major signaling pathway in this communication is Shh, the vertebrate homologue of Drosophila hh, which is highly expressed by embryonic lung epithelium. Patched (Ptc), the receptor for Shh is expressed by the lung mesenchyme, the site of highly focalized Fgf10 production. The role of Fgf10 in directing epithelial morphogenesis is central to lung development (9Tabin C.J. McMahon A.P.

In Fgf10(-/-) embryos, the lung tissue below the main stem bronchi is entirely absent (13Sekine K. Ohuchi H. Fujiwara M. Yamasaki M. Yoshizawa T. Sato T. Yagishita N. Matsui D. Koga Y. Itoh N.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3156-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Shh interacts with the Ptc/Smoothened (Smo) complex on the mesenchymal cell membrane and activates Gli-3, a 190-kDa transcription factor (15Ingham P.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16McMahon A.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Activated Gli-3 binds directly to the Gli-1 promoter and induces its transcription in response to Shh (17Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Gli-1 is a zinc transcription factor that activates the transcription of Ptc (18Grindley J.C. Bellusci S. Perkins D. Hogan B.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, increased transcription of Gli-1 & Ptc are reliable markers of Shh pathway activation. All three Gli family members are expressed in and are important for lung development (18Grindley J.C. Bellusci S. Perkins D. Hogan B.L. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Motoyama J. Liu J. Mo R. Ding Q. Post M. Hui C.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The currently accepted model is that Shh both stimulates and restricts the level and spatial distribution of Fgf10 expression during lung morphogenesis. Consistent with this concept, deletion of Shh leads to diffused, but expanded Fgf10 mRNA throughout the mesenchyme as a consequence of which airways develop into large cystic structures (20Pepicelli C.V. Lewis P.M. McMahon A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1083-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Precisely how Shh controls Fgf10 gene expression has hitherto remained unknown. Because of its established role as a negative regulator of lung branching morphogenesis (21Xing Y. Li C. Hu L. Tiozzo C. Li M. Chai Y. Bellusci S. Anderson S. Minoo P. Dev. Biol. 2008; 320: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) TGF-β is a potential mediator in epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk during lung development. Conventional deletion of TβRII lead to early embryonic lethality, and therefore was not informative for lung development (22Oshima M. Oshima H. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a mesodermal-specific cre-loxP system to delete exon 2 in the TβRII locus in the lung mesenchyme. The lungs of TβRIIΔ/Δ mouse fetuses are abnormal with evidence of cystic airway malformations associated with alterations in Fgf10 gene expression, likely due to interruption of normal epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk. Inactivation of TβRII and hence the specific TGF-β signaling pathway mediated through its normal activity in the lung mesenchyme results in alterations in Ptc and Gli mRNAs in the mutant lungs indicating interference with Shh signaling. Thus, TGF-β signaling, mediated via TβRII can modulate mesenchymal reception of Shh signaling, which originates from the epithelium, indicating cross-communication between the two signaling pathways during embryonic lung morphogenesis. Animals—Dermo1-cre, Rosa26-lacZ, and TβRIIfl/fl mice were generated and genotyped as previously described (23Yu K. Xu J. Liu Z. Sosic D. Shao J. Olson E.N. Towler D.A. Ornitz D.M.

Dermo1-cre; Rosa26-lacZ mice were generated by crossing Dermo1- and Rosa26-lacZ mice. To generate TβRIIfl/fl; Dermo1-cre embryos (TβRIIΔ/Δ), TβRIIfl/+; Derom1-cre mice were crossed with TβRIIfl/fl mice. Detection of β-Galactosidase (LacZ) Activity—LacZ activity was determined by X-gal staining as described (26Pan Q. Li C. Xiao J. Kimura S. Rubenstein J. Puelles L. Minoo P. Gene. 2004; 331: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Whole mount staining was performed for embryonic lungs. Lungs of E15.5 and older were fixed and sectioned by cryostat, and the frozen sections were stained for LacZ activity. Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemistry, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed into serial paraffin sections using routine procedures. Immunostaining were performed as previously described (27Li C. Xiao J. Hormi K. Borok Z. Minoo P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies that were used are: α-SMA (Sigma), PAI-1 (Abcam Cambridge, MA), PECAM (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), Flk1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), β-Tubulin (Biogenix, San Ramon, CA), Collagen1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and TβRII (Abcam Cambridge, MA). Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared from E15.5 Dermo1-cre; TβRIIfl/fl and TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs in RIPA buffer (Sigma) from homogenizer, and then separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were then transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). Membranes were probed with antibodies to TβRII (Abcam) and analyzed with the ECL Western blot analysis system as described by the manufacturer (GE Health, Memphis, TN). In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount and section in situ hybridization were performed as previously described (27Li C. Xiao J. Hormi K. Borok Z. Minoo P. Dev.

The digoxigenin-labeled RNA antisense and sense probes were prepared from following cDNA templates: a 0.4-kb fragment of SpC, a 1.4-kb fragment of Nkx2.1 (29Minoo P. Hu L. Xing Y. Zhu N.L. Chen H. Li M. Borok Z. Li C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2155-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a 0.5-kb fragment of Foxj1, a 0.6-kb fragment of Shh (Dr. Andrew P. McMahon, Harvard University), a 0.7-kb fragment of Ptc (Dr. Matthew P. Scott, Stanford University), a 0.7-kb fragment of Gli-1, a 0.7-kb fragment of Foxf1 (Dr. Peter Carlsson, Göteborg University), a 0.4-kb fragment of Fgf10, a 1.3-kb fragment of Tbx4, and a 1-kb fragment of Tbx5(Dr. Virginia Papaioannou, Princeton University). RNA Extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from embryonic lungs and MRC5 cells (ATCC) by using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen) was used to generate cDNA. Quantification of the selected genes by real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Sciences) as previously described (30Li C. Hu L. Xiao J. Chen H. Li J.T. Bellusci S. Delanghe S. Minoo P. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 86-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Sequence of the primers were as follows: Mouse TβrII:5′-ATG CAT CCA TCC ACG TAA G-3′(forward), 5′-GAC ACG GTA GCA GTA GAA GA-3′ (reverse); human TβrII:5′-CAC GTT CAG AAG TCG GAT GT-3′(forward), 5′-CAT CAG AGC TAC AGG AAC AC-3′(reverse); Mouse TβrII(qPCR): 5′-CAT GAA AGA CAG TGT GCT GAG A-3′(forward), 5′-CTC ACA CAC GAT CTG GAT GC-3′(reverse); Mouse Foxf1:5′-AGC ATC TCC ACG CAC TCC-3′(forward), 5′-TGT GAG TGA TAC CGA GGG ATG-3′(reverse); Mouse Tbx4:5′-GCA TGA GAA GGA GCT GTG G-3′(forward), 5′-TTA CCT TGT AGC TGG GGA ACA-3′(reverse); Human PAI-1: 5′-AAC GGC CAG TGG AAG ACT C-3′(forward), 5′-GGG CGT GGT GAA CTC AGT AT-3′(reverse); Human Ptc:5′-AAC AAA AAT TCA ACC AAA CCT C-3′(forward), 5′-TGT CCT CGT TCC AGT TGA TGT G-3′(reverse); Human Gli-1:5′-CAG GGA GGA AAG CAG ACT GA-3′(forward), 5′-ACT GCT GCA GGA TGA CTG G-3′(reverse); Human Fgf10:5′-CGG GAC CAA GAA GGA GAA CT-3′(forward), 5′-ACG GCA ACA ACT CCG ATT-3′(reverse); Human GAPDH:5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′(forward), 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′(reverse). Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed in 1% RNA formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted. Blots were hybridized with probes specific for TβRII, Shh, Ptc, Gli-1, Fgf10, Gapdh, and then autoradiographed or measured with Kodak Molecular Imaging Software Ver 4.0 to determine the quantity. 32P-labeled probes were synthesized from the following cDNA fragments: the TβRII probe was from a 0.4-kb PCR product of TβRII coding region. The Shh probe was from a 0.6-kb cDNA (Dr. Brigid L. M. Hogan, Vanderbilt University). The Ptc probe was from a 0.7-kb cDNA (Dr. Matthew P. Scott, Stanford University), The Gli-1 probe was from a 0.7-kb cDNA. The Fgf10 probe was from a 0.4-kb cDNA. The GAPDH probe was as reported before (31Hamdan H. Liu H. Li C. Jones C. Lee M. deLemos R. Minoo P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 336-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and TGF-β Treatment—Human pulmonary mesenchymal cell line MRC5 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained in EMEM medium (ATCC), containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. MRC5 cells were treated with recombinant TGF-β (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 200 ng/ml for 2 h and then collected for RNA extraction. TβRII Expression during Lung Development—TβRII has been reported to be expressed in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme of the lung (32Zhao Y. Shah D.U. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To elucidate the expression pattern of TβRII in the murine lung, we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Expression of TβRII mRNA can be detected by RT-PCR throughout lung development (Fig. 1 C). Commercially available antibody (Abcam) detects TβRII protein in mesenchymal cells localized around the airways (Fig. 1, arrows) and blood vessels (Fig. 1, arrowhead) in E15.5 lungs (Fig. 1A) and throughout the mesenchyme in E18 lungs (Fig. 1B). TβRII mRNA is clearly expressed in human lung epithelial carcinoma, H441 and A549 cell lines as well as mouse-immortalized epithelial MLE15 cells (Fig. 1D). Recombination Mediated by Dermo1-cre in the Lung Mesenchyme—Recombination driven by Dermo1-cre in the lung was analyzed by crossing with the reporter mouse strain Rosa26-LacZ. Double transgenic, Rosa26-LacZ; Dermo1-cre fetuses were identified by PCR genotyping, and the lungs were excised and stained for LacZ. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of Dermo1-cre resulted in nearly 100% recombination of the loxP sites in Rosa26-lacZ lung mesodermal cells (Fig. 2A, panels a–f). This recombination was entirely mesenchymal-specific in that no epithelial cells showed LacZ staining (Fig. 2A, panels a, b, d, and f, arrows). Inactivation of TβRII by Dermo1-cre-driven Recombination—Conventional deletion of TβRII led to early embryonic lethality (22Oshima M. Oshima H. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a conditional Cre-LoxP approach to specifically delete exon 2 in the TβRII locus in mesodermal lineages, including those of the lung. Accordingly, we crossed TβRIIfl/fl females with Dermo1-cre male mice and backcrossed the heterozygotes to generate TβRIIfl/fl; Dermo1-cre progeny. The latter genotype is referred to simply as TβRIIΔ/Δ. To validate Dermo1-cre-induced recombination and deletion of exon 2 within the TβRII gene, we used three approaches. First, we utilized lung DNA with PCR primers that could distinguish between deleted and intact TβRII alleles. The deletion in TβRII gene was verified by genomic PCR analysis shown in Fig. 2B, panel b. Second, we measured TβRII protein content by Western blot analysis in protein extracts of total lung tissue from control and TβRIIΔ/Δ embryos. These studies showed greater than 60% decrease in total lung TβRII protein, the remainder indicating non-mesenchymal (e.g. epithelial and endothelial) TβRII protein (Fig. 2B, panels c and d). In contrast, the protein level of TβRI and phosphorylated Smad2 (p-Smad2) remained the same. Therefore mesenchymal deletion of TβRII in the lung does not alter the level of phosphorylated Smad2 and TβRI. Finally, functional deletion of TβRII was verified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor (PAI-1), which is a downstream target of TGF-β signaling. In the control lungs, diffuse PAI-1 was detected throughout both the epithelium and the mesenchyme, but particularly in the progenitor of parabronchial smooth muscle cells (PBSMC) in the subepithelial mesoderm (Fig. 2C, panel b, arrows). In contrast, PAI-1 in the TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs was found only in the epithelium. As expected, there was virtually no PAI-1 staining in the mesoderm, nor in the PBSMC progenitors in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs (Fig. 2C, panel d, arrowheads). Ultrastructure and Cellular Differentiation in TβRIIΔ/Δ Lungs—Dermo1-cre-induced deletion of exon 2 within the TβRII gene was embryonically lethal by day 16–17 of gestation. E16–17 fetuses developed gross abnormalities in multiple organs that caused fetal demise. We therefore, collected and characterized lungs from TβRIIΔ/Δ E15.5 fetuses. Gross morphological assessment of the proximal lung structure showed a readily discernible phenotype manifested as disorganized formation of tracheal cartilage (Fig. 3N). Both the number as well as the shape of the tracheal cartilage was altered. The first and the second generation bronchi in the mutant lungs were devoid of cartilage altogether (not shown). Mesodermal deletion of TβRII also impacted the shape and the size of the various lung lobes as shown in Fig. 3. However, the overall process of lobation and the number of lobes were normal (Fig. 3, H–L). Histological assessment showed a distinct phenotype in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs, characterized by the presence of large, dilated airways, lined with columnar epithelial cells in the proximal lung (Fig. 4A). The epithelial cells throughout the TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs showed expression of NKX2.1, a transcription factor associated with onset of lung epithelial morphogenesis and normal lung structural development(Fig. 4B, panels a and d) (33Minoo P. Su G. Drum H. Bringas P. Kimura S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 60-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Transcripts for Surfactant Protein C, SPC, a marker of distal epithelial cells and a target of NKX2.1 was also expressed in the mutant lungs. Also, differentiation of ciliated cells as evidenced by expression of Foxj1 appeared to be normal in the absence of epithelial TβRII activity (Fig. 4B). The normal level and distribution of Surfactant Protein B, SPB, expressed in proximal and distal, differentiated epithelium, as well as β-tubulin, an established marker of airway ciliated cells were also observed by immunohistochemistry (data not show). Collectively, these data indicate that the absence of TβRII in the lung mesenchyme does not alter lung epithelial cell identity and differentiation. Expression of TGF-β Targets in TβRIIΔ/Δ Lungs—In wild-type embryonic lungs, α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells are found as rings of smooth muscle progenitor cells surrounding the columnar epithelium of the proximal airways (Fig. 4C, panel a). In contrast, we found reduced α-SMA-positive cells surrounding the dilated airways in the mutant lungs (Fig. 4C, panel b). This is the same layer of smooth muscle cells in which PAI-1 was found to be abundantly expressed in the wild-type lung and drastically reduced in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs (Fig. 2C). Immunohistochemistry was also performed to determine potential changes in the expression or spatial localization of other mesenchymal genes including collagen type I and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) known to be modulated by TGF-β (6Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Zeng X. Gray M. Stahlman M.T. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of PECAM were found in the mutant lungs (Fig. 4C, compare panels c and d). Another marker of endothelial cell differentiation, Flk1 appeared to have the same level and distribution in the mutant lungs as wild type (Fig. 4C, panels e and f). Collagen production is also under TGF-β control (6Zhou L. Dey C.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Both in the wild-type control and the mutant lungs, collagen Type I was localized to the extracellular matrix surrounding both the distal and the proximal airways (Fig. 4C, panels g and h). No drastic alteration in collagen type I was observed in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs suggesting that either TGF-β is signaling through utilization of type I receptor (homotetramer) or that collagen production and deposition may not be entirely TGF-β-dependent. Expression of Fgf10 in TβRIIΔ/Δ Lungs—Whole mount and section in situ hybridization were performed for a number of genes with established roles during lung morphogenesis. Because the shape and size of the airways can be regulated by FGF10 activity and its expression domain, we investigated the expression pattern of Fgf10 in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed increased expression, and expansion of the Fgf10 domain in the mutant embryonic lungs (Fig. 5A, panels e and f). A clearer demonstration of this alteration was observed by in situ hybridization experiments on tissue sections (Figure 5A, compare panels c and g). In the control lungs, Fgf10 mRNA was localized to mesenchymal cells adjacent to the growing tip of the peripheral airways (Fig. 5A, panels c and d) consistent with previously reported results (12Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mutant lungs, however, we found an expanded Fgf10 expression domain and likely increased mRNA in the peripheral mesenchyme adjacent to the branching airways (Fig. 5A, panels e–h). This alteration in Fgf10 expression domain may explain the phenotype of the TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs in which airways are significantly dilated. Two transcription factors, Foxf1 and Tbx4 have been found to stimulate Fgf10 expression in the lung mesenchyme (35del Moral P.M. De Langhe S.P. Sala F.G. Veltmaat J.M. Tefft D. Wang K. Warburton D. Bellusci S. Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 36Cardoso W.V. Lu J. Development. 2006; 133: 1611-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, in situ hybridization on tissue sections (Fig. 5B, panels a, b, d, and e) and real-time PCR (Fig. 5C) revealed increased transcripts for both in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs compared with controls. Expression of another Tbx gene, Tbx5 remained unchanged (Fig. 5B, panels c and f). These data support the finding that Fgf10 is both increased and expanded in its expression domain in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs. Cross-talk between TGF-β and Shh Pathways—Shh is thought to negatively regulate Fgf10 magnitude and distribution, thereby, controlling lung branching morphogenesis (20Pepicelli C.V. Lewis P.M. McMahon A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1083-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 37Lebeche D. Malpel S. Cardoso W.V. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mechanistic connection between Fgf10 and Shh remained unknown. We therefore examined Shh signaling by investigating the level and distribution of Shh and its downstream targets Ptc and Gli-1 in the mutant lungs compared with the TβRIIfl/fl controls. Whole mount and tissue section in situ hybridization showed similar levels and spatial localization of Shh mRNA in the control and mutant lungs (Fig. 6, A, D, G, and J). In contrast, there was a significant increase in the level of mRNA for both Ptc (Fig. 6, B, E, H, and K) and Gli-1 (C, F, I, and L) in the TβRIIΔ/Δ mutant lungs compared with the control. To validate the above in situ hybridization results, we used Northern blot analysis as shown in Fig. 7. Transcripts for TβRII were decreased by nearly 80% in TβRIIΔ/Δ lung tissue, compared with controls. Other changes included a ∼1.8-fold increase in Ptc and Gli-1 mRNA and a 1.5-fold increase in Fgf10. The magnitude of Shh remained nearly the same in the mutant and control lungs confirming the in situ hybridization findings.FIGURE 7Quantification of mRNA changes in TβRIIΔ/Δ lungs. Total RNA from E15.5 TβRIIΔ/Δ and TβRIIfl/fl (control) embryonic lungs was used for Northern blot analysis (A), and the results were quantified by densitometry and normalized by GAPDH (B). Values are fold induction or repression, compared with TβRIIfl/fl controls (arbitrarily adjusted to 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because deletion of TβRII occurs specifically in the lung mesenchyme, one potential hypothesis is that TGF-β signaling through TβRII normally represses Gli-1 and Ptc mRNA levels in the lung mesenchymal cell layer. To determine the validity of this hypothesis, we used cultured MRC5 cells, which are derived from normal lung mesenchymal cells of a 14-week-old male fetus, and assessed the impact of exogenous TGF-β treatment on Gli-1 and Ptc mRNA levels by real-time PCR. In support of our in vivo observations, the results clearly showed that TGF-β represses steady state levels of both Gli-1 and Ptc mRNAs by nearly 50% (Fig. 8). Fgf10 has been proposed to be a target of Shh signaling in the lung (36Cardoso W.V. Lu J.

https://openalex.org/W2029209982,"Expression of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene is tightly linked to its roles in DNA damage repair and maintenance of chromosomal stability and genomic integrity. Three transcription factors that activate (USF, NF-κB, and Elf1) and a single factor that represses (SLUG) BRCA2 promoter activity have been reported. In addition, a 67-bp region (–582 to–516) associated with inhibition of promoter activity has been identified. However, it remains unclear how the 67-bp region contributes to regulation of BRCA2 expression. Here, we describe the affinity purification of a 120-kDa protein that binds to a silencer-binding region within the 67-bp repression region of the BRCA2 promoter. Mass spectrometry revealed the identity of the protein as poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1). Gel shift, antibody super-shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that Parp-1 is associated with the BRCA2 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Parp-1 inhibitors (either 3-AB or NU1025) and Parp-1 gene specific siRNA resulted in increased levels of endogenous BRCA2 expression. Inhibition of Parp-1 activity (by 3-AB) reduced histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation and blocked Parp-1 binding to the BRCA2 promoter. These results indicate that Parp-1 down-regulates BRCA2 expression through an interaction with a repression region of the BRCA2 promoter.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and represents the leading cause of cancer in women. BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with familial predisposition to breast and other cancers (1Wooster R. Bignell G. Lancaster J. Swift S. Seal S. Mangion J. Collins N. Gregory S. Gumbs C.

Germline mutations in BRCA2 account for about 25% of autosomal dominant familial breast cancers (3Thorlacius S. Struewing J.P. Hartge P. Olafsdottir G.H. Sigvaldason H. Tryggvadottir L. Wacholder S.

While the role of BRCA2 in sporadic breast cancer remains unclear, loss of heterozygosity of the BRCA2 locus has been detected in over 50% of sporadic breast tumors. This suggests a role for BRCA2 in sporadic breast tumor development. However, somatic mutations in BRCA2 (5Teng D.H. Bogden R. Mitchell J. Baumgard M. Bell R. Berry S. Davis T. Ha P.C. Kehrer R.

Cancer. 1997; 76: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism of BRCA2 involvement in breast cancer progression is through deregulation of the BRCA2 gene. The BRCA2 gene encodes a 3418-amino acid nuclear protein that has been implicated in maintenance of genomic integrity and in the cellular response to DNA damage (8Bertwistle D. Swift S. Marston N.J. Jackson L.E. Crossland S. Crompton M.R. Marshall C.J. Ashworth A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5485-5488PubMed Google Scholar). Absence of BRCA2 function is associated with centrosome amplification, chromosomal rearrangement, aneuploidy, and reduced efficiency of homologous recombination-mediated double-strand break repair. BRCA2 binds directly to proteins (such as RAD51, BCCIP, PALB2, and BRAF35) that are critical for meiotic and mitotic recombination, DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, and chromosome segregation. The expression of the BRCA2 gene is stringently regulated during the cell cycle. In proliferating cells, BRCA2 expression is increased relative to the rate of cell proliferation (8Bertwistle D.

Trans. 2006; 34: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). While BRCA2 expression is closely linked to its involvement in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, the mechanisms that regulate BRCA2 expression are not well understood. Examination of the minimal promoter sequence of BRCA2 has revealed several canonical elements for the binding of transcription factors including E-box, E2F, and Ets recognition motifs (10Davis P.L.

NF-κB has also been shown to bind the –144 to –59-bp region of the promoter and induce BRCA2 expression (11Wu K.J. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G.J. Couch F.J. J. Biol.

Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. BRCA2 Reporter Constructs—Three BRCA2 promoter constructs, Del-9, Del-10, and pGL3Prom shown in Fig. 1A, were cloned into the pGL3 reporter vector as described previously (11Wu K.J. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G.J. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Six mutations were systematically introduced into the 67-bp region (–582 ∼–516) in Del-9 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The six mutated constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and identified as Del-9mut1, Del-9mut2, Del-9mut3, Del-9mut4, Del-9mut5, and Del-9mut6, respectively. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Plasmid DNAs for transient transfection were isolated using a plasmid maxi kit (Promega). MCF-7 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. All transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 μg of the BRCA2 promoter construct and 0.1 μg of the pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector were used for each transfection. The pRL-TK Renilla luciferase vector was used to control for transfection efficiency. Each transfection experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated a minimum of three times. Firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Approximately 48-h post transfection, cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and harvested with 600 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 5 μl was added to 100 μl of firefly luciferase substrate. Light units were measured in a luminometer. Renilla luciferase activity was measured in the same tube after addition of 100 μl of Stop and Glo reagent. For Parp-1 inhibitor treatment experiments, transfected cells were first incubated in regular media for 12 h and then switched to the media containing 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) (10 mm) or NU1025 (100 μm) for another 12 h before the cells were harvested. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Double-strand oligonucleotides were generated from single-strand oligonucleotides (Table 1) with biotinylated 5′-ends. The biotin-labeled double-strand oligonucleotides were then used as probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were isolated from cultured MCF-7 cells using NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce). DNA-protein binding reactions were performed in a binding buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were initiated by addition of 0.05 pmol of DNA probe to 20 μg of the nuclear extracts. Electrophoresis was performed in a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 100 V for 120 min. The gels were then incubated in 0.5× TBE buffer for 15 min at room temperature, and finally transferred to a Nylon membrane. Membranes were cross-linked at 120 mJ/cm2. The signals were visualized using the Light Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). Competition experiments and antibody supershift experiments were carried out similarly except that the unlabeled competitor cold probes (5 pmol or 100×) and anti-Parp-1 antibody (5 μg) (Cell Signaling Technology) were added in the binding reaction, respectively. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were also performed by using end-blocked probes. The biotinylated double-strand probes were modified by binding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) to the DNA ends according to the manufacturer's instructions. 20 μg of MCF-7 nuclear extracts were incubated with the streptavidin-labeled probes in the binding buffer with a final volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to a Nylon membrane as described above. Signals were developed by using an ECL detection system (Millipore).TABLE 1List of oligonucleotides used in the construction of probes for EMSA and DNA affinity pull-down assaysNameSequence of oligonucleotidesWT5-gatgggtttcacaatttttcaagca-3 (Sense)5-tgcttgaaaaattgtgaaacccatc-3 (Antisense)M5-gatgaccctgtggctttttcaagca-3 (Sense)5-tgcttgaaaaagccacagggtcatc-3 (Antisense) Open table in a new tab DNA Affinity Pull-down of a DNA-binding Protein—Biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were coated to Dynabeads M280 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dynal Biotech), and then incubated with the MCF-7 nuclear extracts in a binding buffer (80 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2.5 mm EDTA) at 25 °C for 1 h. These beads were followed by washing three times with the binding buffer. Protein fractions were eluted by adding elution buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 4% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT) and stored at –80 °C. The protein fractions were separated on 10% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by the SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit (Invitrogen). Discrete protein bands identified in the eluted fractions were characterized by MS/MS mass spectrometry (Bruker MALDI-TOF-TOF). Mass spectrometry data were analyzed by using MASCOT search engine software. Western Blotting—MCF-7 cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, and cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets (Roche Applied Science). Approximately 100 μg of total protein from whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against Parp-1 and BRCA2 (Cell Signaling Technology). Signals were developed by an ECL detection system. Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was carried out using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). A total reaction volume of 25 μl was prepared containing 0.5 μl of template cDNA, 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Takara), and 200 nm each of the forward and reverse PCR primers. The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 40 s. A non-template control was included in each experiment. Melting curve analysis and agarose electrophoresis were carried out to validate the specificity of the amplification products. Relative expression was determined using the Ct method (13Gibson U.E. Heid C.A. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar): fold value = 2–[ΔΔCt], where ΔΔCt =ΔCt sample –ΔCt calibrator; ΔCt = (Ct gene of interest)–(Ct β-actin). All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample and were repeated three times. All experimental data were expressed as mean ± S.D. siRNA against Parp-1—A pair of siRNA oligonucleotides (catalogue 111005) directed against human Parp-1 were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). A nonspecific negative control (NC) siRNA (sense: 5-uucuccgaacgugucacgutt, anti-sense: 5-acgugacacguucggagaatt) was obtained from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. siRNA oligonucleotides (200 nm) were transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared and used for Western blotting, and RNA was prepared and used for RT-PCR and real time RT-PCR analyses. The PCR primers for BRCA2 and Parp-1 are listed in Table 2.TABLE 2Nucleotide sequences of the primers used in RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCRGeneSense primerAntisense primerPCR sizebpParp-15-ctactcggtccaagatcgcc-3′5-ttgaaaaagccctaaaggctca-3′240BRCA25-caagcagatgatgtttcctgtcc-3′5-agaactaagggtgggtggtgtagc-3′243 Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—A total of 1 × 107 MCF-7 cells were fixed and lysed in a volume of 500 μl with ChIP lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). DNA was sheered by sonication 10 × 20 s (amplitude 4 u), precleared with protein G-agarose, and immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of rabbit anti-Parp-1, histone H3 (acetyl K9) (Abcam Inc.), Histone H3 (Abcam Inc.) or normal rabbit serum according to the manufacturer's instructions. A target 119-bp fragment of the BRCA2 promoter was PCR-amplified using a pair of primers: 5′-agcgaaactccgtctcaaaa-3′ (F) and 5′-ccgtttccttgcttgaaaaa-3′ (R). A 166-bp GAPDH PCR fragment was also amplified with the following primers: 5′-tactagcggttttacgggcg-3′ (F) and 5′-tcgaacaggaggagcagagagcga (R) as a control. PCR conditions were the same as described above. A standard curve was constructed from known dilutions of input chromatin. For the quantitative ChIP studies, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with or without 10 mm 3-AB for 4 h, fixed, lysed, immunoprecipitated, and PCR-amplified as described above. Identification of cis-Acting Regulatory Elements in a 67-bp Inhibitory Region of the BRCA2 Promoter—Our previous study showed that deletion of the –582 to –516-bp region resulted in 2.5-fold activation of the human BRCA2 promoter (11Wu K.J. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G.J. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that the 67-bp region contains cis-acting regulatory element(s) that are critical for negative regulation of basal transcription activity of the human BRCA2 promoter. To more accurately map the potential cis-acting regulatory element(s) within the 67-bp inhibitory region, a series of mutation constructs were generated as shown in Fig. 1A. Firefly luciferase activity was assayed following transient transfection of MCF-7 cells with these BRCA2 promoter constructs. Normalized luciferase activities for each mutant construct relative to 1) the construct containing the 67-bp region with no mutations (Del-9) and 2) the construct with the 8-kb BRCA2 promoter (pGL3Prom) (11Wu K.J.

The results indicate that the BRCA2 promoter is regulated not only by a putative silencer but also by a potential enhancer within the 67-bp region. Mutation of the GTTTCACAAT element (Del-9mut3) caused a 2.5-fold activation of the promoter, whereas a 1.5-fold reduction in the activity was detected following mutation of the AGGAAA motif (Del-9mut5). Interestingly, the combination of this AGGAAA motif (Del-9mut5, 1.5-fold activation) and the previously reported Elf1 (Ets family member) binding site (–61 to –53, 2-fold activation) was associated with a 10-fold activation of the BRCA2 promoter. 5R. C. Zhao, unpublished data. PARP-1 Specifically Binds and Negatively Regulates the BRCA2 Promoter—To identify the specific DNA-binding protein for the GTTTCACAAT motif, nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells were incubated with a biotinylated wild-type (WT) probe. The biotinylated DNA-protein complex was bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, eluted, and separated by sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2A, a ∼120-kDa protein band was detected. To control for nonspecific protein binding to DNA, we repeated the experiment utilizing a biotinylated mutant probe. As expected, the ∼120-kDa protein was not eluted. To identify the potential DNA-binding protein, the ∼120-kDa protein band was excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry. Parp-1 was finally identified with a significant probability score of 174 (scores greater than 79 are significant (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). To confirm Parp-1 binding to the BRCA2 promoter, we analyzed nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells by EMSA using biotinylated WT and mutant probes (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2C, incubation of the nuclear extracts with the WT probe gave a specific DNA-protein complex. The 100× non-biotinylated cold WT probe completely eliminated this complex whereas the non-biotinylated cold mutant probe had little influence. No DNA-protein complex was detected when the nuclear extracts were incubated with the biotinylated mutant probe (Fig. 2C). Antibody super-shift results further confirmed that the observed DNA-protein complex contained Parp-1. In the presence of the Parp-1 antibody, the complex was super-shifted and the intensity of the original complex was reduced (Fig. 2C). To exclude the possibility that Parp-1 binds the ends of the probe nonspecifically, we carried out gel shift assays using MCF-7 nuclear extracts and the labeled probes that had been end-blocked with streptavidin. Binding of nuclear extracts to an end-blocked WT probe produced a shifted complex that was not observed with an end-blocked mutant probe (Fig. 2D). In addition, BRCA2 promoter activity was induced in the cells treated with Parp-1 specific inhibitor, 3-AB at 10 mm or NU1025 at 100 μm concentrations (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the data indicate that Parp-1 associates with and negatively regulates the BRCA2 promoter. Parp-1 Binds to the BRCA2 Promoter in Vivo—To show that Parp-1 binds to the BRCA2 promoter in vivo, we carried out ChIP analysis. Fixed and sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-Parp-1 antibody and PCR-amplified for BRCA2 promoter target sequences. The amplification of glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 3A, BRCA2 promoter sequences were only amplified in the anti-Parp-1-immunoprecipitated chromatin. Real-time PCR demonstrated that the BRCA2 promoter sequences were enriched ∼10-fold in anti-Parp-1 immunoprecipitated chromatin over chromatin immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) (Fig. 3B), indicating that Parp-1 occupies the BRCA2 promoter in vivo. Depletion of Parp-1 Induces BRCA2 Expression—To establish whether the physical presence of Parp-1 was important for the regulation of BRCA2 expression, Parp-1 expression was knocked down by a Parp-1 specific siRNA in MCF-7 cells. To control for the effects of transfection and nonspecific siRNA, MCF-7 cells were also transfected with a nonspecific negative control siRNA. The BRCA2 mRNA and protein expression levels were analyzed in MCF7 cells 48-h post transfection. The BRCA2 mRNA levels were increased substantially following depletion of Parp-1 (Fig. 4A). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that depletion of Parp-1 resulted in a 2.5-fold induction of BRCA2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4B). However, no change in BRCA2 mRNA levels was detected in cells transfected with nonspecific negative control siRNA. In keeping with these observations, the BRCA2 protein expression levels were also increased in the cells transfected with the Parp-1 siRNA (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of Parp-1 Activity Also Induces BRCA2 mRNA Expression—To determine the effects of Parp-1 inhibitors on the production of BRCA2 in MCF-7 cells, the cells were treated with two different Parp-1 inhibitors, 3-AB (10 mm), and NU1025 (100 μm). The BRCA2 mRNA expression levels were examined after 4, 12, 24, and 48 h of treatment. As shown in Fig. 4D, a 2-fold induction of BRCA2 mRNA expression was detected at the 4-h time point, and this was maintained up to 12 h. However, the level of induction slowly declined after 24 and 48 h of treatment (data not shown). Thus, inhibition of Parp-1 enzymatic activity resulted in a significant increase in the level of BRCA2 mRNA that was consistent with the level of BRCA2 promoter activation induced by the same inhibitors (Fig. 2E). This suggests that Parp-1 negatively regulates BRCA2 expression predominantly at the level of transcription initiation. Inhibition of Parp-1 Activity Reduces Histone H3(K9) Acetylation and Blocks Parp-1 Binding to the BRCA2 Promoter—To further elucidate the role of Parp-1 in the regulation of the BRCA2 promoter, a correlation between the lysine 9 (K9) acetylation on histone H3 and DNA binding ability of Parp-1 at the BRCA2 promoter was assessed. In this study, Parp-1 enzymatic activity was inhibited by 10 mm 3-AB. The BRCA2 promoter target sequences were PCR-amplified from chromatin that was immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, amplification of the BRCA2 promoter target sequences was decreased 2.5–3.0-fold in both anti-Parp-1 (Fig. 5, A and B) and anti-histone H3 (acetyl K9) (Fig. 5, A and C) immunoprecipitated chromatin when the MCF-7 cells were treated with 3-AB for 4 h. However, a minimal change was observed in PCR-amplified BRCA2 promoter target sequences from anti-histone H3-immunoprecipitated chromatin (Fig. 5, A and D). 3-AB treatment also caused a mild reduction in the levels of acetylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that Parp-1 enzymatic activity may be required for the acetylation of the core histone H3 and relaxation of the chromatin in the promoter region of BRCA2. This would allow Parp-1 access to its specific binding sites and cause a down-regulation of BRCA2 expression. Studies on BRCA2 indicate a pivotal role for this protein in the biology of most eukaryotic cells. In human mammary epithelial cells, the expression of BRCA2 protein appears to be regulated by a series of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The present study provides evidence of another mechanism for the regulation of BRCA2 gene expression. Our data demonstrate sequence-specific binding of Parp-1 to the BRCA2 promoter. In particular, we showed that transcription of BRCA2 is enhanced in the presence of Parp-1 inhibitors and Parp-1 siRNA. Overexpression of Parp-1 in MCF-7 cells did not demonstrate a significant change in BRCA2 expression. This is possibly due to the fact that Parp-1 is already highly expressed in these cells (data not shown). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Parp-1 activation and its physical presence play a critical role in BRCA2 transcription regulation. Parp-1 is the founding member of a 17 protein family of structurally related molecules (14Ame J.C. Spenlehauer C. de Murcia G. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 882-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar, 15D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. D'Silva I. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The Parp-1 gene is highly conserved, especially at amino acids comprising structural motifs and functional domains. There is an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a C-terminal β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) binding domain. The central section of Parp-1 contains an auto-modification domain, which also associates with other proteins (16Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Parp-1 has important roles in DNA damage repair (17Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 18Durkacz B.W. Omidiji O. Gray D.A. Shall S. Nature. 1980; 283: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), but more recent evidence has demonstrated a role for Parp-1 in transcriptional regulation (19Ju B.G. Solum D. Song E.J. Lee K.J. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 119: 815-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Parp-1 has been reported to regulate target genes via at least two non-exclusive mechanisms. First, Parp-1 is a constituent of chromatin and Parp-1 activity mediates chromatin relaxation thereby altering accessibility to transcription factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, Parp-1 is present at transcriptionally repressed chromatin regions. Parp-1 activation and its subsequent removal is a prerequisite for transcriptional activity to occur (20Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gevry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L. Cell. 2004; 119: 803-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). This PAR-mediated chromatin loosening is observed at larval salivary gland polytene-chromosome puffs (21Tulin A. Spradling A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). At other promoters, Parp-1 is recruited to nucleosomes with topoisomerase IIb. Activation of Parp-1 by topoisomerase-induced DNA strand breaks induces gene transcription (22Bong-Gun J.U. Lunyak V.V. Perissi V. Garcia-Bassets I. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2006; 312: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The second mechanism by which Parp-1 or PAR can modulate transcription is by acting as part of gene-specific enhancer/promoter binding complexes. It can regulate transcription by modifying the activity of enhancer and promoter elements. Parp-1 acts to stimulate transcription with some activators, but can inhibit transcription with other factors, depending on the cell type and promoter context (23Miyamoto T. Kakizawa T. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Soldatenkov V.A. Chasovskikh S. Potaman V.N. Trofimova I. Smulson M.E. Dritschilo A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Parp-1 can bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Various binding sequences have been described, and although there is a shared tri-nucleotide sequence between two of these sites (“tgttg” (25Huang K. Tidyman W.E. Le K.U. Kirsten E. Kun E. Ordahl C.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and “ttgannacaa” (26Zhang Z. Hildebrandt E.F. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Anderson M.G. Virology. 2002; 295: 107-116Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar)), there is no significant match between the other known Parp-1 binding sequences. The probe we used contains the tri-nucleotide sequence in the BRCA2 promoter. Parp-1 can also contact DNA by binding to secondary hairpin structures (27Lonskaya I. Potaman V.N. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Oussatcheva E.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Soldatenkov V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17076-17083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Parp-1 also has a stimulatory effect on some transcription factors and co-factors, which does not necessarily require Parp-1 polymerase activity (28Anderson M.G. Scoggin K.E. Simbulan-Rosenthal C.M. Steadman J.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 30Cervellera M.N. Sala A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10692-10696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the catalytic activity of Parp-1 is important at the BRCA2 locus. Therefore, the transcriptional role of Parp-1 that is not required its polymerase activity likely does not account for the observed effects on BRCA2. Others have demonstrated a dual effect of Parp-1 at some promoters whereby Parp-1 inhibition represses expression and Parp-1 knockdown has the opposite effect (31Amiri K.I. Ha H.C. Smulson M.E. Richmond A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7714-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism is that Parp-1 binding represses transcription but activation of Parp-1 followed by auto poly-(ADP-ribosy)lation and disassociation from DNA leads to induction of transcription. Our findings show that both Parp-1 inhibition and depletion induce BRCA2 expression. This argues that this dual mechanism does not occur at the BRCA2 locus. Ambrose et al. (32Ambrose H.E. Papadopoulou V. Beswick R.W. Wagner S.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6244-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have shown that Parp-1 inhibition and Parp-1 depletion by siRNA induces Bcl-6 mRNA expression in Bcl-6 expressing cell lines. Here, the Parp-1-binding site reported was flanked by upstream inhibitory Bcl-6 and STAT-5-binding sites, suggesting a model in which local Parp-1 activation and consequent chromatin relaxation causes increased accessibility to Bcl-6 and STAT-5 and reduced Bcl-6 transcription. Our data show that inhibition of Parp-1 activity is associated with induction of BRCA2 transcription and conversely that increased Parp-1 activation at the BRCA2 locus causes repression of BRCA2 transcription. We speculate that a substantial reduction in the amount of Parp-1 would have the same effect as inhibition of enzyme activity. According to the model that Ambrose et al. have proposed, locally activated Parp-1 at the BRCA2 locus and consequent chromatin relaxation causes accessibility to the putative repressor, causing a repression of BRCA2. Importantly, there is a “ggaa” (–532 ∼ –529) sequence that is an Ets recognition motif located downstream of the Parp-1 binding site in the BRCA2 promoter. Elf1, an Ets family member, has been found to bind the BRCA2 promoter (–61 ∼–53) near the USF binding site and activate BRCA2 transcription when the site is not occupied by USF (10Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Wu K.J. Jiang S.W. Thangaraju M. Wu G.J. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35548-35556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we predict that there may be an Ets family member binding to the “ggaa” (–532 ∼–529) motif, acting as an enhancer of Parp-1 activation and causing chromatin relaxation. Further studies are needed to evaluate this possibility. Repression of the BRCA2 gene is important because accumulation of BRCA2 in the cell may potentially lead to cell death. Manish et al. have shown that SLUG represses the transcription of BRCA2 in cells expressing SLUG protein. However, since SLUG protein is not expressed in MCF-7 cells, it appears that there are other proteins that regulate the transcription of BRCA2 in MCF-7 cells. Our data suggest that Parp-1 accounts for this activity. In summary, we have found that Parp-1 binds to the BRCA2 promoter in a sequence-specific manner and negatively regulates BRCA2 expression. Further evaluation of the role of Parp-1 may reveal a very unique mechanism of BRCA2 gene expression regulation and help us to understand the possible causes of some sporadic breast cancer cases."

https://openalex.org/W1984794849,"Rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) is currently the closest known, fully sequenced homolog of human Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Both these viruses encode complement inhibitors as follows: Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-complement control protein (KCP) and RRV-complement control protein (RCP). Previously we characterized in detail the functional properties of KCP as a complement inhibitor. Here, we performed comparative analyses for two variants of RCP protein, encoded by RRV strains H26-95 and 17577. Both RCP variants and KCP inhibited human and rhesus complement when tested in hemolytic assays measuring all steps of activation via the classical and the alternative pathway. RCP variants from both RRV strains supported C3b and C4b degradation by factor I and decay acceleration of the classical C3 convertase, similar to KCP. Additionally, the 17577 RCP variant accelerated decay of the alternative C3 convertase, which was not seen for KCP. In contrast to KCP, RCP showed no affinity to heparin and is the first described complement inhibitor in which the binding site for C3b/C4b does not interact with heparin. Molecular modeling shows a structural disruption in the region of RCP that corresponds to the KCP-heparin-binding site. This makes RRV a superior model for future in vivo investigations of complement evasion, as RCP does not play a supportive role in viral attachment as KCP does."

One major pathway for Listeria entry involves binding of the bacterial protein Internalin B to the host receptor tyrosine kinase Met (hepatocyte growth factor receptor). Activation of Met and downstream signaling cascades is critical for Listeria entry. Internalin B is composed of several structural domains including an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat that is sufficient for binding Met and stimulating downstream signal transduction. Internalin B is monomeric, whereas the leucine-rich repeat is dimeric when expressed as an isolated fragment. The different quaternary states of Internalin B and the leucine-rich repeat suggest that these two Met ligands might cause distinct biological effects. Here we demonstrate that Internalin B and the leucine-rich repeat fragment exhibit agonist properties that differentially influence Met down-regulation in lysosomes. Specifically, Met stability is increased in response to the leucine-rich repeat fragment compared with Internalin B. Interestingly, Internalin B and the leucine-rich repeat stimulate equivalent rates of clathrin-mediated Met internalization. However, the leucine-rich repeat is defective in promoting lysosomal down-regulation of Met and instead enhances receptor recycling to the cell surface. In addition, the leucine-rich repeat causes prolonged Met activation (phosphorylation) and increased cell motility compared with Internalin B. Taken together, our findings indicate that individual domains of Internalin B differentially regulate Met trafficking. The ability of the leucine-rich repeat fragment to promote Met recycling could account for the increased cell motility induced by this ligand.

InlB is a modular protein consisting of a N-terminal cap followed by a 213-amino acid leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an interrepeat domain, and a C-terminal region containing “GW” modules that anchor InlB non-covalently to the bacterial cell wall (24Lecuit M. Ohayon H. Braun L. Mengaud J. Cossart P. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5309-5319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Braun L. Nato F. Payrastre B. Mazie J.C. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). InlB binds Met in a 1:1 stoichiometry primarily through the concave surface of the LRR region, although a second contact involving the inter-repeat region of InlB strengthens this interaction (14Niemann H.H. Jager V. Butler P.J. van den Heuvel J. Schmidt S. Ferraris D. Gherardi E. Heinz D.W. Cell. 2007; 130: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies confirm that a fragment containing only the N-cap and LRR domains (i.e. the LRR fragment) comprises the minimal region for binding and inducing Met phosphorylation (7Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the LRR fragment used in studies on Met activation (7Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Copp J. Marino M. Banerjee M. Ghosh P. van der Geer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7783-7789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) has a different quaternary structure than InlB. Whereas full-length InlB is monomeric, the isolated LRR domain is a disulfide-linked dimer. LRR dimerization results from a cysteine residue in InlB that is normally unavailable for disulfide formation. Truncation of InlB to generate the LRR fragment results in the surface exposure of this cysteine residue located near the C terminus of the LRR fragment. The different quaternary structures of monomeric InlB and the dimeric LRR fragment raise the possibility that these two Met ligands could exhibit some differences in biological activity. Although it is unclear whether the LRR fragment is produced physiologically during Listeria infection, we are interested in using InlB and its derivatives as tools to examine aspects of Met-mediated signal transduction and trafficking. Our structure/function analysis of InlB identified the LRR fragment with agonist properties reminiscent of InlB, with the exception that LRR promotes Met stability. Down-regulation plays a key role in regulating the temporal activity of signaling receptors, and mutations or other conditions that interfere with down-regulation are thought to contribute to the development of several cancers (26Peschard P. Park M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 519-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Bache K.G. Slagsvold T. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2707-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). “Down-regulation” refers to ligand-induced depletion of a surface receptor, typically resulting from receptor internalization and degradation in a lysosomal compartment (28Abella J.V. Peschard P. Naujokas M.A. Lin T. Saucier C. Urbe S. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9632-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We found that compared with InlB, the LRR fragment is defective in promoting Met down-regulation. LRR and InlB induce Met internalization at similar rates, indicating that the differences in receptor degradation caused by these two ligands are due to alterations in intracellular trafficking. Compared with InlB, the LRR fragment is defective in targeting Met to the degradative pathway and, instead, promotes receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. InlB and LRR are comparable in their abilities to induce initial Met activation (i.e. Met tyrosine phosphorylation); however, receptor phosphorylation in response to the LRR fragment is more sustained than that induced by InlB. The ability of LRR to prolong Met phosphorylation raised the possibility that the truncated ligand might be more potent than InlB for inducing one or more Met-mediated biological activities. Consistent with this idea, we show that the LRR fragment was more effective than InlB in promoting epithelial cell motility. Collectively, our results indicate that individual domains of InlB differentially regulate Met trafficking and impact Met-mediated biological activity.

Recombinant human HGF was purchased from PeproTech Inc, Rocky Hill, NJ, and Alexa594-labeled-transferrin (Tfn) and Alexa594-labeled dextran was obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Line and Cell Culture—Human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in complete media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The H10 cell line derived from kidney epithelial cells from embryos of Met null –/– mice (29Kjelsberg C. Sakurai H. Spokes K. Birchmeier C. Drummond I. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F222-F228PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Lloyd Cantley (Yale University School of Medicine). H10 derivatives stably expressing wild type (WT) or mutant Met alleles (KinD) (19Li N. Lorinczi M. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16764-16775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were grown in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml puromycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely starved in media lacking sera (incomplete media) overnight at 37 °C before use unless specified otherwise. For studies using cycloheximide, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37 °C for 30–60 min to prevent de novo synthesis of Met during receptor stimulation as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. Ligand Purification and Labeling, Confocal Microscopy—The purification and labeling of InlB and its derivatives has been described in detail elsewhere (18Li N. Xiang G.S. Dokainish H. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography was used to separate dimeric LRR from LRR monomers. Briefly, 2–2.5 mg of LRR in 120 μl was injected (10 μl/run) onto a Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and the separation of LRR dimers from monomers was monitored by size and SDS/PAGE. For confocal microscopy, serum-starved cells grown on coverslips were co incubated in incomplete media containing 5.0 μg/ml Alexa594-labeled Tfn or 5.0 μg/ml Alexa594-labeled dextran with 2 nm Alexa488-labeled InlB or 2 or 10 nm Alexa488-labeled LRR or LRR-C242A. The cells were rapidly cooled and analyzed for ligand uptake as previously published (18Li N. Xiang G.S. Dokainish H. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Li N. Lorinczi M. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16764-16775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All images were taken using identical acquisition parameters, and the amount of internalized LRR or LRR-C242A is expressed as a percentage of internalized InlB. Colocalization analyses were preformed as previously described (30Strick D.J. Elferink L.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5699-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) on cells stained for endogenous EEA1 or CD63. Routinely, a minimum of 10 cell areas was analyzed using MetaMorph software v7.1.3.0 (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), and the data were normalized to the percentage of co-localization with EEA1 at the 0-min chase time. Flow Cytometry-based Recycling Assay—Serum-starved HeLa cells grown on 10-cm plates were incubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 h at 37 °C to inhibit protein synthesis. The cells were then stimulated with 2 nm InlB or 10 nm LRR for 15 min at 37 °C to induce Met internalization. Residual surface Met was cleaved by incubation with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FACS buffer) before resuspension in serum-free media containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 5, 10, or 15 min to allow Met trafficking. After the appropriate chase time cells were shifted to ice to prevent further endocytic trafficking of Met and were resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in FACS buffer. To determine the level of Met present on the cell surface, 2 × 105 cells were aliquoted into triplicate wells of a 96-well plate. Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-HGF receptor antibody for 30 min on ice followed by 20 min of incubation with donkey anti-goat phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. After staining, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) in FACS buffer for 20 min at room temperature. Residual formaldehyde was removed by washing in FACS buffer before measurement of the mean yellow fluorescent signal for 20,000 events by a BD FACSArray. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the values were expressed as the level of Met present on the cell surface after each chase time. Data were normalized to the level of Met present on the cell surface after 0 min of chase, so that the surface level of Met at time 0 was 1. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection Studies—siRNA depletion experiments were performed using commercially available control, Grb2, and Met (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) or CHC (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) siRNAs. Cells were cultured for 1 day before transfection and transfected using empirically determined concentrations of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Typically cells were treated with 40–60 pmol of siRNA with 1–1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, respectively, to routinely accomplish a 95% decrease in protein levels as determined by Western analysis. All experiments were routinely performed 72 h after siRNA transfection. Cell Surface Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Duplicate sets of HeLa cells were plated in 4-well tissue culture plates (Nunc A/S, Rochester, NY) at a concentration of 2 × 105/well. The following day sera-starved cells were stimulated with 2 nm InlB, 2 nm LRR, 10 nm LRR, or 2 nm LRR-C242A in incomplete media for 2–8 min at 37 °C. The cells were rapidly cooled on ice to inhibit endocytosis, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with primary anti-human HGF receptor antibody in PBS containing 10% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature, and unbound antibody was removed using three ice-cold PBS washes, then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. For measuring total receptor, one duplicate plate of cells was first fixed in paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min before the addition of the primary antibody. One well of cells lacking primary antibody was used as an additional negative control. To detect antibody-bound protein complexes, cells were incubated with 1-Step-ABTS reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 30 min at room temperature, and the colorimetric reaction was terminated by the addition of 1% SDS. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a VERSAmax microplate reader and SOFTmax® PRO 3.0 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Experiments were performed in triplicate, and values were calculated as the ratio of surface Met (X) to total receptor (Y) at each time point (tx), normalized to the control value at time zero (t0). For the kinetic studies, values representing the relative amount of internalized Met were calculated using the formula ((X/Y)t0 – (X/Y)tx)/tx. Western Blot Analysis—Western analysis was performed using ECL plus (GE Healthcare), and the resulting digitized blots were quantified using MetaMorph software as previously described (19Li N. Lorinczi M. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16764-16775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Wound Healing and Three-dimensional Tubulogenesis Assays—Cell migration was analyzed using an in vitro wound-healing model (31Santos M.F. McCormack S.A. Guo Z. Okolicany J. Zheng Y. Johnson L.R. Tigyi G. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of MDCK or HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well plates and serum-starved for 48 or 24 h, respectively, in media supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum before each experiment. MDCK cells were wounded mechanically by scraping with a 200-μl pipette tip (3 separate wounds per well). Immediately after wounding, the cells were incubated in media containing ligand. At the indicated time points after wounding, wound areas were imaged with a NIKON TE2000 multifunction inverted microscope. Multiple positioning marks were made to ensure that identical areas were imaged between time points. The relative gap distance from three independent experiments was measured in pixels using MetaMorph software. MDCK tubulogenesis assays were performed in three-dimensional matrix gels as previously described (32O'Brien L.E. Yu W. Tang K. Jou T.S. Zegers M.M. Mostov K.E. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 676-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were trypsinized and suspended at 3 × 104 cells/ml in a neutralized rat tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences) solution composed of 3.5 mg/ml glutamine, 2.35 mg/ml NaHCO3, 1× minimum Eagle's medium, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), and 2 mg/ml collagen I. 150 μl of the cell-collagen I mixture was added to each well of 8-well culture slides. After the collagen gel solidified, the cells were incubated in complete media, which was changed every other day. Cysts routinely formed at 7–8 days under these conditions. For inducing tubulogenesis, cysts were incubated in complete media containing 2 nm InlB, 2 nm HGF, or 10 nm LRR and renewed every 24 h. One group of cells incubated in growth media lacking ligand served as a control. Phase contrast imaging was preformed using a NIKON TE2000 multifunction inverted microscope equipped with a 20× objective. The LRR Fragment Is Unable to Target Met to the Degradative Pathway—We previously reported using InlB as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms of Met endocytosis and intracellular trafficking (18Li N. Xiang G.S. Dokainish H. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. Traffic. 2005; 6: 459-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Li N. Lorinczi M. Ireton K. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16764-16775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In particular, we were interested in identifying the minimal region of InlB required for Met internalization and degradation. We focused on the LRR fragment of InlB (herein referred to as LRR) as it has been shown to bind Met, induce receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and activate downstream signaling cascades (7Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K.

Microbiol. 2001; 42: 955-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). InlB and LRR were expressed and purified as recombinant His-tagged proteins and used to examine Met endocytosis and degradation. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE shows that, consistent with earlier reports (7Banerjee M. Copp J. Vuga D. Marino M. Chapman T. van der Geer P. Ghosh P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), InlB purifies as a monomeric species, whereas LRR is composed of monomers and disulfide-linked dimers when purified under non-reducing conditions (supplemental Fig S1A). LRR dimers convert to inactive monomers in the presence of reducing agents. Conversely, an LRR mutant incapable of forming disulfide-linked homodimers due to a mutation in the sole cysteine residue in LRR (C242A) purifies as a monomeric species under non-reducing conditions (supplemental Fig S1A). To confirm that LRR dimers but not LRR monomers are functionally active, the LRR preparation was subjected to sizing chromatography. Fractions enriched in LRR monomers or dimers were isolated, and their ability to induce Met phosphorylation at tyrosine 1234 and 1235 in the Met kinase domain was examined. For these studies we used HeLa cells, an established cell model for examining the mechanisms for receptor endocytosis and degradation. HeLa cells express high levels of Met on their surface and have a well documented response to Met signaling (34Kermorgant S. Zicha D. Parker P.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2037376047,"WE have recently described an electro-chemical method of measuring the oxygen tension in the fluid phase of serum agar cultures of bone marrow flecks1. Oxygen tension decreased, at first fairly quickly and then more slowly over a period of three days. This was ascribed to the utilization of oxygen by the surviving cells. In this communication we describe some preliminary experiments upon the effect of amethopterin and 6-mercaptopurine on the oxygen tension pattern of similar cultures. At the beginning of the experiments the culture fluid was equilibrated with air containing 5 per cent carbon dioxide; the carbon dioxide was required to keep the pH. of the fluid in the physiological range. After a number of hours the fluid was replaced either with fresh medium alone, or with medium containing the drugs. As this fluid was also equilibrated with the air–carbon dioxide mixture, the oxygen tension rose but not usually to the starting level. This may have been due to the mixing of the fresh medium with the relatively anoxic serum agar also present in the culture chamber. Thereafter, in the normal controls the oxygen tension continued to fall until the experiment was concluded. This is illustrated by the control curve seen in Fig. 1."
