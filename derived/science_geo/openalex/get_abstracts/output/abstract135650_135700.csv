https://openalex.org/W1991388146,"REVIEW Semiconductor devices generally take advantage of the charge of electrons, whereas magnetic materials are used for recording information involving electron spin. To make use of both charge and spin of electrons in semiconductors, a high concentration of magnetic elements can be introduced in nonmagnetic III-V semiconductors currently in use for devices. Low solubility of magnetic elements was overcome by low-temperature nonequilibrium molecular beam epitaxial growth, and ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As was realized. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that the magnetic transition temperature can be as high as 110 kelvin. The origin of the ferromagnetic interaction is discussed. Multilayer heterostructures including resonant tunneling diodes (RTDs) have also successfully been fabricated. The magnetic coupling between two ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As films separated by a nonmagnetic layer indicated the critical role of the holes in the magnetic coupling. The magnetic coupling in all semiconductor ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic layered structures, together with the possibility of spin filtering in RTDs, shows the potential of the present material system for exploring new physics and for developing new functionality toward future electronics."

The mechanisms by which dislocations form during early growth are poorly understood. When nanocrystalline materials grow by oriented attachment at crystallographically specific surfaces and there is a small misorientation at the interface, dislocations result. Spiral growth at two or more closely spaced screw dislocations provides a mechanism for generating complex polytypic and polymorphic structures. These results are of fundamental importance to understanding crystal growth."
https://openalex.org/W2119441821,"REVIEW High-efficiency light-emitting diodes emitting amber, green, blue, and ultraviolet light have been obtained through the use of an InGaN active layer instead of a GaN active layer. The localized energy states caused by In composition fluctuation in the InGaN active layer are related to the high efficiency of the InGaN-based emitting devices. The blue and green InGaN quantum-well structure light-emitting diodes with luminous efficiencies of 5 and 30 lumens per watt, respectively, can be made despite the large number of threading dislocations (1 × 10 8 to 1 × 10 12 cm −2 ). Epitaxially laterally overgrown GaN on sapphire reduces the number of threading dislocations originating from the interface of the GaN epilayer with the sapphire substrate. InGaN multi-quantum-well structure laser diodes formed on the GaN layer above the SiO 2 mask area can have a lifetime of more than 10,000 hours. Dislocations increase the threshold current density of the laser diodes."

The experimentally determined structure consists of a beta-phase silicon carbide core, an amorphous silicon oxide intermediate layer, and graphitic outer shells made of boron nitride and carbon layers separated in the radial direction. The structure resembles a coaxial nanocable with a semiconductor-insulator-metal (or semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor) geometry and suggests applications in nanoscale electronic devices that take advantage of this self-organization mechanism for multielement nanotube formation."
https://openalex.org/W2019159182,"Differential actions of acetylcholine on the excitability of two subtypes of interneurons in layer V of the rat visual cortex were examined. Acetylcholine excited low-threshold spike (LTS) cells through nicotinic receptors, whereas it elicited hyperpolarization in fast spiking (FS) cells through muscarinic receptors. Axons of LTS cells were mainly distributed vertically to upper layers, and those of FS cells were primarily confined to layer V. Thus, cortical cholinergic activation may reduce some forms of intralaminar inhibition, promote intracolumnar inhibition, and change the direction of information flow within cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2091444924,"Transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappaB/rel (NF-kappaB) family may be important in cell survival by regulating unidentified, anti-apoptotic genes. One such gene that protects cells from apoptosis induced by Fas or tumor necrosis factor type alpha (TNF), IEX-1L, is described here. Its transcription induced by TNF was decreased in cells with defective NF-kappaB activation, rendering them sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis, which was abolished by transfection with IEX-1L. In support, overexpression of antisense IEX-1L partially blocked TNF-induced expression of IEX-1L and sensitized normal cells to killing. This study demonstrates a key role of IEX-1L in cellular resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis."

Here, we purify from nuclear extract of Raji cells a complex consisting of human Rad50, Mre11, and another protein factor with a size of about 95 kDa (p95), which is likely to be Nibrin, the protein encoded by the gene mutated in Nijmegen breakage syndrome. We show that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex possesses manganese-dependent single-stranded DNA endonuclease and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activities. These nuclease activities are likely to be important for recombination, repair, and genomic stability.

Genetic studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutants sensitive to ionizing radiation and to other agents that cause DNA double-stranded breaks have identified a large number of genetic loci required for the repair of such breaks. Many of these genes, including RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54, MRE11, and XRS2, show epistasis and are collectively known as the RAD52 epistasis group. Mutants of theRAD52 group also have defects of varying degrees in mitotic and meiotic recombination, which are initiated via DNA double-stranded break formation. Because meiotic recombination is essential for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomal pairs during meiosis I, the RAD52 group mutants often exhibit severe meiotic abnormalities, including inviability (see Refs. 1Klein H.

Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1993; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), the 3′ ssDNA tails formed as a result of break processing are bound by recombination proteins, which then mediate a search for the chromosomal homolog and heteroduplex DNA formation with the homolog (5Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1993; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). The RAD52 group genes may be divided into two categories. The first class consists of theRAD50, MRE11, and XRS2 genes, whose protein products are thought to be involved in the nucleolytic processing of DNA double-stranded breaks (6Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Consistent with this classification, the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins have been shown to be homologous to theEscherichia coli SbcC and SbcD proteins, which combine to form a complex with endonuclease and exonuclease activities (7Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The second category of the RAD52 group genes includesRAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, and RDH54,whose products nucleate onto the ssDNA tails generated from break processing and then mediate the formation of heteroduplex DNA between the recombining chromosomes (1Klein H.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), also has a role in heteroduplex DNA formation remains to be established.Important insights concerning the mechanism by which theRAD52 group proteins form heteroduplex DNA have been garnered through biochemical studies of purified human and yeast proteins (9Cox M.M.

However, no information as to the biochemical functions of the RAD50 and MRE11 encoded products is currently available. The Rad50 and Mre11 proteins are of special interest because genetic studies in yeast have indicated that they are also indispensable for nonhomologous DNA end joining (12Schiestl R.H. Zhu J. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14 (4450): 4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and for the maintenance of telomere length (13Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The human homologs ofRAD50 and MRE11 genes have been identified (14Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S.

Here, we purify a complex of human Rad50, Mre11, and a protein species with an apparent size of 95 kDa from nuclear extract of Raji cells. This 95-kDa protein, or p95, is most likely the same protein found to co-immunoprecipitate with Rad50 and Mre11 proteins from HeLa cell extract (14Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L.

Our biochemical studies now reveal that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex possesses an endonuclease activity and a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFor identifying the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins in human cells, polyclonal antisera were raised in mice against GST-Rad50 and GST-Mre11 fusion proteins produced in and purified from E. coli. As shown in Fig. 1 A, in theleft panel, the anti-Rad50 serum detected in nuclear extract of Raji cells a protein band with an apparent size of about 150 kDa, which was in excellent agreement with the predicted size of 153 kDa for Rad50 protein (15Petrini J.H.J. Walsh M.E. DiMare C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Weaver D.T. Genomics. 1995; 29: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The anti-Mre11 serum detected a band with an apparent size of about 80 kDa (Fig. 1 A, right panel) in the Raji nuclear extract, which was in excellent agreement with the predicted size of 81 kDa for Mre11 protein (14Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S. Bressan D.A. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4832-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).The human Rad50 and Mre11 proteins are associated in a tight complex (14Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S. Bressan D.A. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4832-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To purify the Rad50-Mre11 complex, a scheme involving ammonium sulfate precipitation of nuclear extract, followed by chromatographic steps in columns of Source Q, Hydroxyapatite, Sepharose 6B, Phenyl-Superose, a second Sepharose 6B step, and Mini S was used, and the elution of the Rad50-Mre11 complex from the columns was monitored by immunoblot analysis. Interestingly, during the second gel filtration step on Sepharose 6B, we found a 95-kDa protein species coeluting precisely with the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins. When the protein pool consisting of Rad50, Mre11, and p95 was further fractionated in either Mini S or Mini Q, precise coelution of p95 with Rad50 and Mre11 proteins was again observed. The final protein pool used for the biochemical studies described below contained Rad50, Mre11, and p95 in nearly homogeneous form (Fig. 1 B). The yield of this complex of Rad50, Mre11, and p95 from 80 ml of packed volume of Raji cell pellet was about 50 μg. Two independent preparations of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex obtained using Mini S as the final step of purification and one preparation of this complex purified using Mini Q as the final column gave the same results when used in the biochemical studies described below. We believe that p95 is identical to the protein species with the same size which in immunoprecipitation studies (14Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S. Bressan D.A. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4832-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was found to be associated with Rad50 and Mre11 proteins in HeLa cell extract. Interestingly, the p95 species appears to be substoichiometric in regard to Rad50 and Mre11 (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that either p95 is associated with a fraction of the Rad50-Mre11 complex or p95 is of a lower stoichiometry in the protein complex.The Rad50 and Mre11 proteins are structurally related to the SbcC-SbcD complex, which possesses a ssDNA endonuclease activity (7Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For this reason, it was of great interest to test whether the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex has a ssDNA endonuclease activity. To do this, purified Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was incubated with φX circular ssDNA, and at different times, SDS was added to 0.3% to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixtures were run in an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to visualize the DNA species. As shown in Fig.2 A, with increasing reaction time, the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex converted the ssDNA into forms with progressively faster gel mobility, indicating that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex indeed has an associated ssDNA endonuclease activity.Figure 2Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex has manganese-dependent endonuclease activity. A, φX 174 ssDNA (1 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex in 100 μl of reaction buffer. At the times indicated, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, mixed with 1 μl of 3% SDS and 2 μl of loading buffer, and then run in a 0.8% agarose gel (lanes 2–8).

B, φX174 supercoiled DNA (1 μg) was incubated with 1 μg of Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex in 100 μl of reaction buffer. At the times indicated (lanes 2–8), 10 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, mixed with SDS, and then run in a 0.8% agarose gel. In lane 1, the DNA was incubated in buffer without Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex. sc, supercoiled DNA; nc, nicked circular duplex formed as a result of Rad50-Mre11-p95 nucleolytic action.

Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex, 60 ng (lanes 3) or 120 ng (lanes 2 and 4–6) was incubated with 100 ng of φX ssDNA in the absence of metal (lane 5), in the presence of 2 mmMn2+ (Mn, lanes 2–4), and in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ (Mg,lane 6) for 60 min. SDS was added to the reaction mixture inlane 2 to 0.3% at the beginning of the incubation, and the DNA substrate was incubated in buffer alone in lane 1. kb, kilobases pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclease would also act on double-stranded DNA, the nuclease reaction was repeated, substituting the φX ssDNA with the double-stranded supercoiled form. Incision of the φX supercoiled DNA by Rad50-Mre11-p95 would generate a nicked circular duplex DNA molecule. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex converted some of the supercoiled DNA into the nicked circular form, but the incision of the supercoiled DNA clearly occurred at a much slower rate than the incision of ssDNA (Fig.2 C). For instance, at the reaction end point of 70 min, only about 15% of the supercoiled DNA had been incised, as compared with about 80% incision of the circular ssDNA by 30 min (Fig.2 C).The addition of SDS at the beginning of the reaction abolished nuclease activity (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, the nuclease function was dependent on manganese, which could not be at all substituted by magnesium (Fig. 2 D). In this regard, the Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclease activity resembles the SbcC-SbcD nuclease complex, which is also specifically dependent on manganese for activity (7Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).To confirm that the nuclease activity is intrinsic to the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex, we subjected fractions from the last step of protein purification in Mini S to immunoblot analysis to determine their content of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex, and the same fractions were also used in nuclease assays with φX ssDNA as substrate. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the level of nuclease activity paralleled the amount of Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex in the Mini S fractions. When a Mini Q column was used instead of Mini S as the final purification step, we again observed co-elution of the nuclease activity with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex (Fig.3 B).Figure 3Nuclease activity coelutes chromatographically with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex. A, Mini S fractions 6–13 were subjected to immunoblot analyses to determine their content of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex and assayed for nuclease activity using φX ssDNA as substrate. Coelution of the nuclease activity with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was seen. Neither nuclease activity nor Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was found in the remaining Mini S fractions (fractions 1–5 and fractions 14 and 15). B, Mini Q fractions 9–15 were examined for the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex and for nuclease activity; co-elution of the nuclease activity with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was again seen. Neither nuclease activity nor Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was found in the remaining Mini Q fractions (fractions 1–8).

A portion of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 digested DNA was run in an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to examine the extent of nucleolytic action (Fig. 4 A), and other portions were incubated with terminal transferase and [α-32P]ddATP and with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, with or without prior treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Fig. 4 B shows that the product of nucleolytic action was labeled readily by terminal transferase, indicating the presence of a 3′ hydroxyl group. Also, labeling of the nucleolytic product by polynucleotide kinase was stimulated markedly by prior phosphatase treatment of the digested DNA, indicating the presence of a 5′ phosphate (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclease generates 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ phosphate termini.Figure 4Nuclease action generates 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ phosphate termini. A, DNA digested with Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex (lane 2) and DNA from the control reaction without the nuclease complex (lane 1) were run in an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. B, DNA digested with Rad50-Mre11-p95 (lane 2) and DNA from the control reaction (lane 1) were treated with terminal transferase and [α-32P]ddATP, purified by GeneClean, and then run in an agarose gel. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. C, DNA digested with Rad50-Mre11-p95 (lanes 2 and 4) and DNA from the control reaction (lanes 1 and 3) were treated with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then analyzed as described for B.

The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis to determine whether there was exonucleolytic digestion of the end-labeled species. As shown in Fig. 5 A, we found that incubation of the 3′ end-labeled species with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex for 10 min resulted in >70% loss of the32P label, whereas little release of the 32P label was observed with the 5′ end-labeled species even after 30 min, indicating that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex also acts exonucleolytically, in the 3′ to 5′ direction. The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, like the endonuclease function, has a specific requirement for Mn2+ (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex has 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. A, for examining exonuclease activity, 200 ng of the 5′ and 3′ end-labeled DNA species were incubated with 200 ng of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex in 20 μl of reaction buffer. At the times indicated, a 5-μl portion of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer containing 1% SDS. The reaction samples were run in a 0.8% agarose gel, which was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed (lower panel) and then dried and subjected to autoradiography (upper panel, AUTORAD). Inlanes 1 and 5, the end-labeled DNAs were incubated in buffer without Rad50-Mre11-p95. B, the 3′ end-labeled DNA (60 ng) was incubated in buffer alone (lane 1) and with 60 ng of Rad50-Mre11-p95 protein complex for 60 min either without metal ion (lane 2), with 2 mmMn2+ (Mn, lane 3), or with 2 mm Mg2+ (Mg, lane 4) as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have presented evidence that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex has Mn2+-dependent endonuclease and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activities. The Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclease generates 3′ hydroxyl and 5′ phosphate termini, suggesting that when mediating DNA scission in vivo, the nuclease complex creates DNA termini that are suitable for priming DNA synthesis and for ligation. The nuclease activity in this protein complex likely resides in the Mre11 protein, because the S. cerevisiae Mre11 protein alone has been found to possess endonuclease activity. 3L.

Given the high degree of conservation of these proteins among eukaryotes, it seems reasonable to suggest that, in addition to DNA repair, the human Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex also plays an important role in recombination and telomere length homeostasis. In these chromosomal transactions, Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclease activities may function alone or in combination with other novel protein factors. Among such novel protein factors there could be a DNA helicase, which would cooperate with the Rad50-Mre11-p95 endonuclease activity to create a 3′ ssDNA tail (3Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N.

Genetic studies on Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutants sensitive to ionizing radiation and to other agents that cause DNA double-stranded breaks have identified a large number of genetic loci required for the repair of such breaks. Many of these genes, including RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54, MRE11, and XRS2, show epistasis and are collectively known as the RAD52 epistasis group. Mutants of theRAD52 group also have defects of varying degrees in mitotic and meiotic recombination, which are initiated via DNA double-stranded break formation. Because meiotic recombination is essential for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomal pairs during meiosis I, the RAD52 group mutants often exhibit severe meiotic abnormalities, including inviability (see Refs. 1Klein H. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A.

Extensive genetic evidence in yeast indicates that DNA double-stranded breaks are processed exonucleolytically, yielding 3′ overhanging single-stranded (ss) 1The abbreviations used are: sssingle-strandedGSTglutathione S-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: sssingle-strandedGSTglutathione S-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. tails of about 600 bases in length (3Cao L.

Cell. 1991; 64: 1155-1161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). According to the double-stranded break repair model for recombination (5Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1993; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), the 3′ ssDNA tails formed as a result of break processing are bound by recombination proteins, which then mediate a search for the chromosomal homolog and heteroduplex DNA formation with the homolog (5Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1993; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). The RAD52 group genes may be divided into two categories. The first class consists of theRAD50, MRE11, and XRS2 genes, whose protein products are thought to be involved in the nucleolytic processing of DNA double-stranded breaks (6Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 387-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Consistent with this classification, the Rad50 and Mre11 proteins have been shown to be homologous to theEscherichia coli SbcC and SbcD proteins, which combine to form a complex with endonuclease and exonuclease activities (7Connelly J.C. Leach D.R.F. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The second category of the RAD52 group genes includesRAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, and RDH54,whose products nucleate onto the ssDNA tails generated from break processing and then mediate the formation of heteroduplex DNA between the recombining chromosomes (1Klein H.

Important insights concerning the mechanism by which theRAD52 group proteins form heteroduplex DNA have been garnered through biochemical studies of purified human and yeast proteins (9Cox M.M. Proc.

However, no information as to the biochemical functions of the RAD50 and MRE11 encoded products is currently available. The Rad50 and Mre11 proteins are of special interest because genetic studies in yeast have indicated that they are also indispensable for nonhomologous DNA end joining (12Schiestl R.H. Zhu J. Pete"

https://openalex.org/W2080758883,"The E2F family of transcription factors are essential for the regulation of genes required for appropriate progression through the cell cycle. Five members of the E2F family have been previously reported, namely E2F1-5. All five are key elements in transcriptional regulation of essential genes, and they can be divided into two functional groups, those that induce S-phase progression when overexpressed in quiescent cells (E2Fs 1–3), and those that do not (E2Fs 4–5). Here, we describe the identification of a novel member of this family, which we refer to as E2F-6. E2F-6 shares significant homology with E2Fs 1–5, especially within the DNA binding, heterodimerization and marked box domains. Unlike E2Fs 1–5, E2F-6 lacks a transactivation and a pocket protein binding domain, hence, forms a unique third group within the E2F family. E2F-6 is a nuclear protein that can form heterodimers with the DP proteins (both DP-1 and DP-2) in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that the complex formed between E2F-6 and the DP proteins, possesses high DNA binding activity, displaying a preference for a TTTCCCGC E2F recognition site, which is slightly different to the E2F consensus site derived from the E2 promoter (TTTCGCGC). In contrast to the other members of the E2F family, ectopic expression of E2F-6 inhibits transcription from promoters possessing E2F recognition sites rather than activating transcription. In addition, overexpression of E2F-6 suppresses the transactivational effects of co-expression of E2F-1 and DP-1. The inhibitory effect of E2F-6 is dependent on its DNA binding activity and its ability to form heterodimers with the DPs. Interestingly, ectopic expression of E2F-6 leads to accumulation of cells in S-phase. Our data suggest that E2F-6 expression delays the exit from S-phase rather than inducing S-phase, which further emphasizes the functional difference between E2F-6 and the previously known E2F family members."

The hybrid EWS-Fli1 protein acts as a strong transcriptional activator and, in contrast to wildtype Fli1, is a potent transforming agent. Similar rearrangements involving EWS or the highly homologous TLS with various transcription factors have been found in several types of human tumors. Employing yeast two-hybrid cloning we isolated the seventh largest subunit of human RNA polymerase II (hsRPB7) as a protein that specifically interacts with the amino terminus of EWS. This association was confirmed by in vitro immunocoprecipitation. In nuclear extracts, hsRPB7 was found to copurify with EWS-Fli1 but not with Fli1. Overexpression of recombinant hsRPB7 specifically increased gene activation by EWS-chimeric transcription factors. Replacement of the EWS portion by hsRPB7 in the oncogenic fusion protein restored the transactivating potential of the chimera. Our results suggest that the interaction of the amino terminus of EWS with hsRPB7 contributes to the transactivation function of EWS-Fli1 and, since hsRPB7 has characteristics of a regulatory subunit of RNA polymerase II, may influence promoter selectivity."

In the present study we show that prodigiosins (prodigiosin, metacycloprodigiosin, and prodigiosin 25-C) inhibit the acidification activity of H+-ATPase chloride dependently, but not membrane potential formation or ATP hydrolysis activity, and suggest that they promote H+/Cl− symport (or OH−/Cl− exchange, in its equivalence) across vesicular membranes. In fact, prodigiosins displayed H+/Cl− symport activity on liposomal membranes. First of all, they decreased the internal pH of liposomes depending on the external chloride, and raised it depending on the internal chloride when external buffer was free from chloride. Second, their effect was electroneutral and not seriously affected by the application of an inside positive membrane potential generated by K+ and valinomycin. Finally, they promoted the uptake of [36Cl] from external buffers with concomitant intraliposomal acidification when external pH was acidic relative to liposome interior.

We reported previously that prodigiosin 25-C raises lysosomal pH and suppresses glycoprotein processing due to its uncoupling effect on vacuolar (lysosomal) H+-ATPase without showing apparent protonophoric activity (8Kataoka T.

Although prodigiosin 25-C also affects mitochondrial F-ATPase and produces swelling of mitochondria besides Golgi, it did not affect the cellular ATP level, showing relatively specific perturbation of vacuolar pH when treated in vivo, which makes it a promising drug for the analysis of vacuolar function.In the present paper, we show that H+/Cl−symport activity is expressed even on liposomal membranes and present evidence that prodigiosins are a new group of H+/Cl− symporters (or OH−/Cl− exchangers, in their equivalence) that uncouple (dissociate) proton translocation from otherwise coupled catalysis (for example, ATP hydrolysis) in such a way that they inhibit acidification but neither catalysis nor membrane potential formation. A preliminary account of this work was presented in the 22nd Meeting of the Japan Bioenergetics Group (9Ohkuma S. Matsuya H. Okamoto M. Honno H. Sato T. Kataoka T. Nagai K. Jpn. Bioenerg. Group Abst. 1996; 22: 28-29Google Scholar).RESULTSProdigiosins Inhibit Acidification, but Affect Neither ATP Hydrolysis nor Membrane Potential Formation Mediated by V-ATPaseProdigiosins have a general structure of methoxybipyrrolopyrromethene with hydrocarbon side chain(s) attached to the “right-hand” pyrrole ring. In this study, we used prodigiosin, metacycloprodigiosin, and prodigiosin 25-C (Fig.1) but present the results of metacycloprodigiosin in most cases because the results were almost the same among the three prodigiosins. In the previous paper (8Kataoka T. Muroi M. Ohkuma S. Waritani T. Magae J. Takatsuki A. Kondo S. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we showed that prodigiosin 25-C increased lysosomal pH in cultured cells as a result of its uncoupling activity on the lysosomal H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), although prodigiosin 25-C uncoupled F-ATPases, too. Fig. 2 A shows the dose responses of the effect of metacycloprodigiosin, as compared with bafilomycin A1, on the acidification, bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase, and membrane potential formation of lysosomal V-ATPase. Metacycloprodigiosin (and prodigiosin), like prodigiosin 25-C, inhibited acidification with an IC50 of 5 ∼ 20 nm (at 170 μg of protein/ml; corresponding to 30 ∼ 120 pmol/mg of protein) but hardly affected ATPase activity up to ∼1 μm (>50 ∼ 100 times that of the IC50 acidification inhibition). This contrasts with the effect of bafilomycins which inhibit both acidification and ATPase activities with an IC50 of about 1 nm (Fig.2 B; for bafilomycin A1). Furthermore, prodigiosins did not affect the membrane potential formation of V-ATPase either (Fig. 2 A, for metacycloprodigiosin), which also contrasts with the effect of bafilomycins (IC50inhibition of membrane potential formation ∼1 nm) (Fig.2 B; for bafilomycin A1). This feature is unique to prodigiosins and not shared by the other basic substances tested so far in our laboratory. The insensitivity to prodigiosins of ATPase and membrane potential formation was shared also with F-ATPases (mitochondrial and bacterial H+-ATPases). 2H. Konno, H. Matsuya, M. Okamoto, T. Sato, Y.

Tsuruta T. Seno M. Doyama M. New Functionality Materials: Design, Preparation and Control. Elsevier Science Publishers, 1993: 131-138Google Scholar); 2) change the participating ion from H+ to another cation, either through ionophoric activity (of say nigericin, a H+/K+ exchange ionophore) or by changing the ion specificity of the ATPase (like (V or F)-type Na+-ATPase or respiratory Na+ pump) (32Kalm G.

Dawson A.P. Stockdale M. Gains N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 120-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), or by changing the ion specificity of the ATPase (like the relationship between halorhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin (36Sasaki J. Brown L.S. Chon Y.-S. Kandori H. Maeda A. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1995; 269: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar)). But, the prodigiosins did not show any ionophoric activity against H+ and/or K+ (8Kataoka T. Muroi M. Ohkuma S. Waritani T. Magae J. Takatsuki A. Kondo S. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, H+/Cl− symport (or OH−/Cl− exchange) activity was suspected. In fact, their activity to inhibit vesicular acidification required chloride (with no obvious saturation), even in the presence of K+-valinomycin added to the assay buffer to dissipate ΔΨ and to eliminate possible participation of chloride channel(s). 2H.

On the basis of these observations, we next tested if prodigiosins show H+/Cl− symport (or OH−/Cl− exchange) activity on phospholipid membranes using liposomes that are devoid of proton pump protein.H+/Cl- Symport (OH-/Cl- exchange) Activity of Prodigiosins on LiposomesProdigiosins Produced Chloride Gradient-dependent Perturbation of Intraliposomal pHDepending on the preliminary observations, we performed a direct assay of the H+/Cl− symport activity of prodigiosins by measuring the effect of prodigiosins on the chloride-dependent change of internal pH of the liposomes (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3 A, liposomes containing the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe pyranine (24Kano K. Fendler J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 509: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) prepared in KCl were diluted 40-fold in external buffer containing either gluconate (sodium gluconate) or chloride (NaCl). In control experiments, Me2SO or EtOH (solvent control), added instead of prodigiosins or TBT, did not produce significant change in the fluorescence, and the addition of MES-TMAH produced a rapid decrease in fluorescence to a certain extent (indicative of the presence of non-trapped extraliposomal pyranine) followed by a slow gradual decrease of fluorescence (indicating acidification of the liposome interior), suggesting limited permeability of liposomal membranes to protons (or hydroxyl anions). On the other hand, metacycloprodigiosin (1 μm), like TBT (100 nm), produced a rapid increase in the pyranine fluorescence (indicating internal alkalinization) in gluconate buffer but not in chloride buffer. However, the addition of MES-TMAH (pH 6.0) produced a marked decrease of pyranine fluorescence (indicating intraliposomal acidification) in prodigiosin- or TBT-treated liposomes relative to control (Me2SO or EtOH), and the rate of this decrease was greater in chloride than in gluconate buffer.Figure 3Chloride gradient-dependent changes of intraliposomal pH produced by metacycloprodigiosin and TBT. Liposomes containing pyranine, prepared in a buffer (20 mm HEPES-TMAH, pH 7.5) containing either (A) KCl (25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2) (Cl--containing liposomes) or (B) potassium gluconate (25 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mmMgSO4) (Cl--free liposomes) were diluted 40-fold in external buffer (20 mm HEPES-TMAH, pH 7.5) containing either 25 mm sodium gluconate or NaCl and the pyranine fluorescence was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, Cl--containing liposomes.

The addition of MES-TMAH (pH 6.0) produced a further decrease of pyranine fluorescence in prodigiosin- or TBT-treated liposomes relative to control (Me2SO or EtOH), and the rate of this decrease was greater in chloride than in gluconate buffer. But also note that the rate of this decrease was not zero in gluconate, and greater in prodigiosin- than TBT-treated liposomes. Essentially the same results were obtained with prodigiosin 25-C and prodigiosin (see below). In additional control experiments, 1 μm NH4Cl did not show such activity, while nigericin produced a quick fluorescent decrease indicative of intraliposomal acidification due to external H+/internal K+ exchange.Dependence of the Prodigiosin-mediated Liposomal Acidification on External Chloride IonIn Fig.4 A, pyranine-containing liposomes prepared in potassium gluconate were diluted 40-fold in external buffer consisting of different ratios (1:0, 1:1, 1:3, 1:7, and 0:1) of NaCl and sodium gluconate. The results clearly show that both metacycloprodigiosin and TBT acidified intraliposomal pH almost linearly with no obvious saturation dependent on the chloride concentration as summarized in Fig. 4 B: again note that the rate of the acidification in gluconate was greater in prodigiosin- than TBT-treated liposomes. This result is also consistent with the ionophoric nature of intraliposomal acidification driven by prodigiosins. In order of effectiveness, the inhibitors ranked as follows: TBT > prodigiosin, metacycloprodigiosin > prodigiosin 25-C: the effective concentrations in chloride buffer for 50% of maximum fluorescence quenching in 10 s were 1.0, 0.7, and 9.0 nmol/mg phospholipid for prodigiosin, metacycloprodigiosin, and prodigiosin 25-C, respectively, as compared with 23 pmol/mg phospholipid for TBT.Figure 4Chloride dose responses of intraliposomal acidification mediated by metacycloprodigiosin and TBT. Liposomes containing pyranine, prepared in 20 mm HEPES-TMAH (pH 7.5), 25 mm potassium gluconate, and 2.5 mmMgSO4 were diluted 50-fold in external buffer (20 mm HEPES-TMAH (pH 7.5) containing 25 mm NaCl or sodium gluconate (pH 7.5), alone or in combination at ratio of 1:0, 1:1, 1:3, 1:7, or 0:1, respectively) and the pyranine fluorescence was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At the times indicated (arrows), 100 nm of either metacycloprodigiosin (1% M2SO as solvent control) (top) or TBT (1% EtOH as solvent control) (bottom) was added.

The rate of increase of fluorescence after the addition of prodigiosin was slightly accelerated by the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 5 A). However, this occurred irrespective of the cation species (sodium or potassium) (with the relative extent of the acceleration being unchanged), similarly to TBT (Fig. 5IB) the electroneutrality of whose action has been well established (37Singh A.P. Nichols P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38Antonenko Y.N. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The membrane potential measured by the fluorescence of diS-C3-(5) and oxonol-V also suggested little membrane potential difference produced by prodigiosins. These results suggest that the H+/Cl− symport (or OH−/Cl− antiport) mediated by prodigiosin is electroneutral in essence.Figure 5Electroneutrality of intraliposomal alkalinization induced by metacycloprodigiosin (A) and TBT (B). Potassium-loaded liposomes containing pyranine were prepared from phosphatidylcholine (100 mg) in 2.0 ml of 25 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-TMAH (pH 7.5), and 500 μm pyranine, diluted 50-fold into 2 ml of assay buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES-TMAH (pH 7.5) and 25 mm solution of either sodium gluconate or potassium gluconate, and the pyranine fluorescence was recorded as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence or absence of valinomycin.

Like TBT and manganese porphyrin (a recently reported chloride ionophore (39Chaniotakis N.A. Chasser A.M. Meyerhoff M.E. Groves J.T. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 40El-Etri M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L386-L392PubMed Google Scholar)), prodigiosins showed some, albeit weak, activity to mediate the movement of chloride into organic solvent, notably at acidic pH (data not shown). However, the phase transfer activity of prodigiosins does not necessarily explain their “catalytic activity” to promote transport of Cl− across membranes coupled with H+ (or in exchange with OH−). So, we next measured [36Cl] movement in parallel with the change in intraliposomal pH. As shown in Fig. 6, all three prodigiosins tested, like TBT, mediated dose- and time-dependent uptake of chloride into liposomes coupled with concomitant intraliposomal acidification (indicating uptake of H+ or extrusion of OH−). Among the prodigiosins tested, prodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin are the most potent with prodigiosin 25-C having about half their activity. Fig. 7 shows the pH dependence of intraliposomal uptake of [36Cl] and H+ promoted by metacycloprodigiosin and TBT. The results show an accelerated uptake of both [36Cl] and H+ at acidic pH for both metacycloprodigiosin and TBT, although slight differences are noted between metacycloprodigiosin and TBT in pH dependence. The temperature dependence of the uptake of [36Cl] into liposomes indicated an activation energy of about 15 ∼ 16 kcal/mol for both metacycloprodigiosin and TBT which matched with the value reported for TBT (41Wieth J.O. Tosteson M.T. J. Gen.

The assay buffer contained 20 mmMES-TMAH (pH 6.0), 5 mm KCl, and Na[36Cl] (0.1 μCi/ml). 250 μl each of the above liposome suspension and assay buffer were mixed and the reaction started at 37 °C. At 1 min, 5 μl of either prodigiosins (1% Me2SO as solvent control) or TBT (1% EtOH as solvent control) was added to the assay buffer to attain the indicated final concentrations. Mean ± S.D. of triplicates are plotted. Fluorescence assays were performed as described under Fig. 3, after dilution of 40 μl of the above liposome suspension into the above assay buffer.

Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) and cytochrome oxidase complexes (43Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 44Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar)), others to combined molecular fluorescence micromanipulation technology (45Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshidaa M. Kinoshita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar) (showing molecular spin of H+-ATPase molecules). Nevertheless, one important aspect of energy transduction, “energy coupling,” remains to be clarified. From a biochemical point of view, specific modifiers of energy transduction would represent a breakthrough, just as uncouplers opened the way to the chemiosmotic hypothesis of Mitchell in 1961.Prodigiosins were initially thought of as candidates of such modifiers to help elucidate the energy transduction mechanism: prodigiosins inhibited the acidification mediated by various H+-translocating ATPases without inhibiting ATP hydrolysis nor membrane potential formation (8Kataoka T. Muroi M. Ohkuma S. Waritani T. Magae J. Takatsuki A. Kondo S. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), unlike ordinary uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation or ATPase inhibitors. However, evidence has been accumulating that prodigiosins have an ionophoric nature and we demonstrated in the present study that prodigiosins act as a H+/Cl− symporter (or OH−/Cl− antiporter, in its equivalence) on liposomes, by showing: 1) alkalinization and acidification of intraliposomal pH depending on the outward and inward chloride gradient, respectively; 2) the electroneutrality of their effects; and finally, 3) the pH gradient (outside acid)-dependent uptake of radioactive chloride into liposomes in parallel with intraliposomal acidification.These results on the whole favor the idea that the uncoupling effect of prodigiosins is due to their H+/Cl− symport activity across biological membranes. In fact, their effective concentrations for H+/Cl− symporting activity on liposomes decreased in parallel with the amount of phospholipid used, and were comparable to those on organellar membranes (8Kataoka T. Muroi M. Ohkuma S. Waritani T. Magae J. Takatsuki A. Kondo S. Yamasaki M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) when expressed on the basis of the amount of vesicles used (in the order of nmol/mg: for 50% maximum pH change in 10 s).2 The possibility of specific interaction of prodigiosins with H+-translocators is, however, not completelyexcluded, especially at higher concentrations where they inhibited catalytic (ATPase) activity. Studies are now in progress to unravel the mode of direct interaction between prodigiosins and the enzymes. The reason for the much higher effectiveness of TBT on liposomes (Figs. 4and 6)2,3 is not clear. It may reflect difference of permeability against the ionophore between liposomes and organellar membranes due to compositional differences (for example, absence or presence of proteins).The H+/Cl− symport (or OH−/Cl− antiport) activity of prodigiosins also explains several previous findings: 1) that the ATP level was hardly affected by prodigiosin 25-C; 2) mitochondrial swelling induced by prodigiosin 25-C, and so on. As prodigiosins did not affect the membrane potential formation, they are not expected to affect ATP formation in mitochondria where the proton motive force is stored mainly in the form of transmembrane potential. In this regard, prodigiosins are quite similar to the traditional OH−/Cl− exchangers, triorganotins (for example, TBT), which inhibit vesicular acidification but hardly affect membrane potential formation in reconstituted cytochrome oxidase proteoliposomes (46Barranco J. Darszon A. Gómez-Puyou A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 100: 1402-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) nor ATP formation in the photophosphorylation driven by halorhodopsin (47Mukohata Y. Kaji Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Like prodigiosins, triorganotins induce mitochondrial swelling (48Stockdale M. Dawson A.P. Selwyn M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 49Wulf R.G. Byington K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 167: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which is explained by the uptake of osmotically active Cl− in exchange for respiration-induced OH− (equivalent to coupled transport of Cl− with respiration-induced H+).

The chick homolog of the helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator Id2 is expressed in cranial but not trunk neural folds and subsequently in some migrating cranial neural crest cells. Ectopic expression of Id2 with recombinant retroviruses converted ectodermal cells to a neural crest fate, demonstrating that proper regulation of Id2 is important for sustaining epidermal traits.

Among the many putative protein targets identified for Rac (and/or Cdc42), the Ser/Thr kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK) is a prime candidate for mediating some of Rac's cellular effects. This report shows that Rac1 binds to and stimulates the kinase activity of PAK1 approximately 2- and 4–5-fold, respectively, better than Rac2. Mutational analysis was employed to determine the structural elements on Rac and PAK that are important for optimal binding and activation. The most notable difference between the highly homologous Rac isomers is the composition of their C-terminal polybasic domains. Mutation of these six basic residues in Rac1 to neutral amino acids dramatically decreased the ability of Rac1 to bind PAK1 and almost completely abolished its ability to stimulate PAK activity. Moreover, replacing the highly charged polybasic domain of Rac1 with the less charged domain of Rac2 (and vice versa) completely reversed the PAK binding/activation properties of the two Rac isomers. Thus, polybasic domain differences account for the disparate abilities of Rac1 and Rac2 to activate PAK. PAK proteins also contain a basic region, consisting of three contiguous lysine residues (Lys66-Lys67-Lys68), which lies outside of the previously identified Cdc42/Rac-binding domain. Mutation of these Lys residues to neutral residues decreased PAK binding to activated Rac1 and Rac2 (but not Cdc42) and greatly reduced PAK1 activation by Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 proteins in vivo. In contrast, mutation of lysines 66–68 to basic Arg residues did not decrease (and in some cases enhanced) the ability of Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 to bind and activate PAK1. Our studies suggest that the polybasic domain of Rac is a novel effector domain that may allow the two Rac isomers to activate different effector proteins. In addition, our results indicate that a basic region in PAK is required for PAK activation and that binding of Rac/Cdc42 to PAK is not sufficient for kinase activation.

The Rho GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and consist, in mammalian cells, of several distinct Rho (RhoA, -B, and -C isoforms), Rac (Rac1, -2, and -3 isoforms), Cdc42 (Cdc42Hs and G25K isoforms), RhoG, RhoE, and TC10 subfamily members (1Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). By cycling between inactive GDP- and active GTP-bound forms, Rho GTPases act as molecular switches and thereby regulate signal transduction pathways that control a wide range of biological processes. For instance, Rho GTPases play a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and have been implicated as key regulators of cell motility and adhesion in response to extracellular stimuli. Rho regulates focal adhesion assembly and actin stress fiber formation in lysophosphatidic acid- or bombesin-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells (2Ridley A.J. Hall A.

Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A.

Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 16: 5069-5080Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In some cell types, cross-talk between Rho GTPases is believed to occur, such that Cdc42 activation leads to Rac activation, which subsequently leads to Rho activation (5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar). In addition to their effects on cytoskeletal remodeling, Rho GTPases (Rac and Cdc42) stimulate the activity of the c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (6Coso O.A.

Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases are also key components of signaling pathways leading to oncogenesis (12Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 13Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition to inducing the expression of growth-promoting genes, Rho GTPases can trigger an invasive phenotype (Rac1) and appear to be required (Rac and Rho) for Ras-induced malignant transformation (12Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 13Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In contrast to other Rho family members, Rac proteins have an additional distinct biological role. Rac regulates the activity of the NADPH oxidase enzyme complex in phagocytic cells (14Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 15Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), and the superoxide anion (O⨪2) generated by this complex plays a key role in bactericidal host defense mechanisms. Mammalian cells contain two Rac genes, Rac1 and Rac2. Although cells of myeloid lineage, such as neutrophils, express both Rac1 and Rac2 proteins, Rac2 expression in these cells is ∼20-fold higher than Rac1 expression. In distinct contrast, nonmyeloid cells exclusively express the Rac1 isoform. Rac1 and Rac2 have 92% sequence identity overall and exhibit their highest amino acid divergence at their C termini, particularly in a region that constitutes a polybasic domain. The polybasic domain in Rac1 is composed of six contiguous basic amino acids, whereas in Rac2 three of these six residues have been converted to neutral amino acids. It is currently unknown whether the two Rac isoforms are differentially activated by extracellular stimuli, stimulate different effectors and/or regulate distinct biological functions. In neutrophils, Rac1 and Rac2 are equally able to stimulate the respiratory burst in vitro in a semirecombinant system (16Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Xu X. Uhlinger D.J. Conroy L. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, their effectiveness in vivo may differ (17Dorseuil O. Reibel L. Bokoch G.M. Camonis J. Gacon G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In order to regulate the various aforementioned biological processes, Rho GTPases interact with multiple downstream effectors to trigger complex, interconnected signaling pathways. One of these downstream targets is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases termed p21cdc42/rac -activated kinases (PAKs), 1The abbreviations used are: PAKp21-activated kinaseCRIBCdc42/Rac interactive bindingGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphatePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. which are stimulated by Rac and Cdc42, but not Rho, in a GTP-dependent manner (18Manser E.

PAKs are related to Ste20p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a protein kinase required for pheromone-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and are believed to play a similar role in mammalian cells by regulating the c-Jun N-terminal/stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (9Zhang S.

Increasing evidence suggests that PAKs are involved in certain aspects of cytoskeletal remodeling, consistent with their role as potential effectors of Rac/Cdc42 GTPases. Recent studies have shown that PAK1 translocates to areas of active cytoskeletal rearrangement upon growth factor stimulation (20Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and a PAK1 mutant, postulated to mimic the structural changes induced by GTPase binding, caused lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling when microinjected or transfected into fibroblasts (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Furthermore, PAK phosphorylates the heavy and light chains of myosins (22Brzeska H. Knaus U.G. Wang Z. Bokoch G.M. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies from this laboratory also link PAKs to the stimulation of the neutrophil respiratory burst (25Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). For instance, one of the NADPH oxidase components, the cytosolic p47phox protein, is phosphorylated by activated PAK on several physiologically relevant sites. 2U. G. Knaus, unpublished data. Multiple phosphorylations precede p47phox translocation to the membrane, assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, and subsequent superoxide anion generation. In addition, extracellular stimuli capable of inducing O⨪2 production in neutrophils, such as the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe, activate PAKs in a time-dependent manner that closely parallels the time courses of Rac and p47phox translocation and superoxide anion production (25Knaus U.G.

In this report, we have demonstrated that Rac1 binds to and stimulates the kinase activity of PAK much more efficiently than Rac2, and we have identified the polybasic domain of Rac as a novel effector site for Rac/PAK interaction. This domain is critical for effective Rac/PAK binding and appears to dictate the differential potency of PAK stimulation by Rac1 versus Rac2. Furthermore, we identified a polybasic region on PAK that is important for Rac/PAK interaction. This domain is upstream of and distinct from the previously defined Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. Mutational analysis of this PAK domain revealed that PAK activation by GTPases in vivo is dependent on the basic charge of this domain. Our results reveal previously unidentified structural regions on Rac and on PAK that have critical impact on GTPase-dependent PAK activation. Wild type and activated Rac1 and Rac2 C-terminal mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis as described previously (26Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. Bourne J.R. Solski P.A.

Template DNA consisted of wild type or activated (G12V) human Rac1 and Rac2 cDNA containing a Glu-Glu (EEEEYMPME) epitope tag at their N termini, and forward and reverse primers consisted of oligonucleotides encoding the Glu-Glu epitope tag and the desired wild type or mutant C-terminal amino acids of Rac1 or Rac2, respectively. Table Isummarizes the specific mutants generated. The Rac1(6Q) mutant contains 6 neutral Gln residues substituted for the polybasic domain (amino acids 183–188) of Rac1. The Rac1 → 2 mutant contains amino acids 183–188 of Rac2 substituted for the polybasic domain of Rac1. The Rac2 → 1 mutant contains the polybasic domain of Rac1 substituted for amino acids 183–188 of Rac2, and the C178S mutant contains a Ser substituted for Cys178 of Rac1. Wild type and activated Rac1 and Rac2 sequences were subcloned in frame into theBamHI site of pRK5, a mammalian expression vector that adds an N-terminal Myc epitope tag to expressed proteins; pGEX-4T-3, a bacterial expression vector; and pAcG2T, a baculovirus-expression vector. Escherichia coli- and baculovirus-expressed GTPases were purified as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cleaved with thrombin (from human plasma; Sigma) (27Knaus U.G.

Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using internally derived oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutant PAK1 sequence, K66–68L, K66–68R, or K66–68Q. Two overlapping strands containing the mutated sequence were then used as polymerase chain reaction templates to allow synthesis of full-length PAK1 containing the mutations. Transient transfections in COS-7 cells (1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were performed as described by Zhang et al. (9Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Co-transfections with N-terminal Myc-tagged wild type or mutant PAK1/pCMV6 or PAK1/pRK5 plasmid constructs and Myc-tagged wild type or mutant Rac1 or Rac2/pRK5 plasmid constructs were performed for 24 h in HeLa cells at a DNA ratio of 9:1 or 4:1. 24–40 h post-transfection, COS-7 or HeLa cells were scraped from their 100-mm dish into 250 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 50 IU/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). After 15 min on ice, the lysates were pelleted for 5 min at 14 K at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots of PAK-transfected cell lysates were diluted with detergent-free lysis buffer and incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 60-min incubation with 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of bovine serum albumin-coated protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with detergent-free lysis buffer, and twice with kinase buffer. In vitro PAK kinase assays were performed essentially as described (25Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were incubated in 70 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of 0.25–3 μg of GTPγS-bound Rac proteins for 20 min at 30 °C. For analysis of PAK autophosphorylation, incubations were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7% gels), followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Substrate phosphorylation by activated PAK1 was measured by adding 2 μg of a peptide derived from the NADPH oxidase component, p47phox (amino acids 324–331), to the kinase assay. After the 20-min incubation, an aliquot of the kinase reaction supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose filters (Pierce) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the amount of radiolabel incorporated into substrate was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. In vivo PAK kinase activation was evaluated after co-transfection as described above, except 5 μm okadaic acid and 1 μm microcystein LR (LC Laboratories) were added to the lysis buffer. Aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6.5% gels), and activation of PAK1 was determined by Western blot analysis of the mobility shift caused by PAK1 autophosphorylation. To assess binding of PAK to wild type and mutant Rac proteins, varying amounts of COS-7 cell lysates expressing wild type PAK1 were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). For overlay assays, blots were renatured and blocked overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer), followed by incubation with 1–2 μg/ml [35S]GTPγS-labeled Rac proteins (27Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCl, 3 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween 20, the blots were exposed to Kodak XAR film for 12 h at −70 °C and quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Rac1 and Rac2 are highly homologous proteins and primarily differ at their C termini. Most notably, Rac1 contains an intact polybasic domain consisting of six contiguous basic amino acids at its C terminus, but this domain is disrupted by three neutral amino acids in Rac2. To investigate the relative ability of Rac1 versus Rac2 to bind PAK and determine the role of the polybasic domain (amino acids 183–188) in PAK binding, we mutated the six basic Arg/Lys residues of the Rac1 polybasic domain to neutral Gln residues ((Rac1(6Q), TableI) and expressed this mutant, as well as Rac1(wt) and Rac2(wt), in bacteria or insect cells. Purified wild type and mutant Rac proteins were labeled with [35S]GTPγS, and binding to PAK was probed in overlay assays. Fig.1 depicts Rac protein binding to varying amounts of wild type PAK1 protein renatured on nitrocellulose. Using the association between wild type Rac1 and PAK1 as a standard, we detected ∼50% lower levels of Rac2(wt) protein bound to PAK1. In addition, we found that substitution of neutral amino acids for the six basic amino acids of Rac1 (Rac1(6Q)) resulted in a 75% loss of binding to PAK1. Since the polybasic domain of Rac1 is intact but the comparable domain in Rac2 is disrupted, our results suggested that the polybasic domain of Rac1 might facilitate PAK1 binding. In order to test this premise, we prepared Rac1/Rac2 chimeras, where the polybasic domains of the two Rac homologues were swapped with each other (Rac1 → 2, Rac2 → 1). The Rac1 → 2 mutant showed decreased binding to immobilized PAK1 when compared with Rac1(wt), and the extent of binding was similar to that of Rac2(wt). Likewise, consistent with the notion that the polybasic domain of Rac1 accounts for its enhanced affinity for PAK, the Rac2 → 1 mutant exhibited increased binding, comparable with Rac1(wt) levels. These results demonstrate that differences in the polybasic domains of the two Rac isoforms completely account for their disparate affinities for the effector protein PAK1. To investigate the relative ability of Rac1versus Rac2 to activate PAK and determine the role of the polybasic domain in PAK activation, immunoprecipitates of PAK1(wt)-expressing cell lysates were incubated with bacterially expressed, GTPγS-activated wild type, mutant, or chimeric Rac1/Rac2 proteins in vitro, and autophosphorylation of the kinase was monitored by autoradiography as an index of PAK activation (Fig.2). Optimal stimulation of PAK autophosphorylation was observed with Rac1(wt), leading to a high level of 32P incorporation into the molecule and the appearance of multiple, slower migrating autophosphorylated forms of PAK1. In vitro activation by Rac2(wt) resulted in ∼5-fold less PAK1 autophosphorylation than Rac1(wt), and the Rac1 polybasic mutant (Rac1(6Q)) had ∼50-fold lower levels of PAK1 autophosphorylation in comparison with Rac1(wt). A similar pattern of PAK activation was also observed with post-translationally modified, baculovirus-expressed Rac1(wt), Rac2(wt), and Rac1(6Q) proteins (Fig. 2). A control mutation containing a Ser substituted for the Cys residue just upstream of the polybasic region (Rac1(C178S)), exhibited stimulatory activity toward PAK1 comparable with the Rac1(wt) protein. The ability of the Rac1/Rac2 chimeric proteins to stimulate PAK autophosphorylation corresponded well with their observed differences in binding affinity to the kinase. The replacement of the polybasic domain of Rac2 with the polybasic domain of Rac1 (Rac2 → 1) increased PAK1 autophosphorylation to Rac1(wt) levels and the reverse replacement (Rac1 → 2) diminished PAK1 autophosphorylation to Rac2(wt) levels. The importance of the polybasic domain probably depends on charge, rather than specific amino acid sequence, since a mutant protein, Rac1 → 1 (KR switch) (Fig. 2; see also Table I), containing different, but similarly charged amino acids substituted for the polybasic domain of Rac1, showed levels of PAK1 autophosphorylation comparable with Rac1(wt). The effect of the various C-terminal Rac mutants on PAK autophosphorylation correlated well with their ability to stimulate PAK-dependent substrate phosphorylation. Fig.3 confirms that Rac1(6Q) cannot stimulate PAK activity toward an exogenous substrate and that the ability of the Rac1 and Rac2 isoforms to stimulate PAK activity is largely dependent on the composition of their polybasic domains. The observed effects of wild type and mutant Rac proteins on PAK activity were reproducible over a wide range of Rac protein concentrations (0.25–3 μg/kinase reaction), which were calculated based upon the active, GTPγS-bound form of each protein. The relative ability of Rac1, Rac2, and Rac1(6Q) to activate PAK was also assessed in vivo. Activated forms (G12V) of Rac1, Rac2, Rac1(6Q), and control vector plasmid were co-transfected with Myc-tagged PAK1(wt) plasmid into HeLa cells. After 24 h, cell lysates were blotted and probed with anti-Myc antibody, and PAK activation was evaluated by assessing the appearance of autophosphorylated bands, which migrate more slowly in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Although Rac2 and Rac1(6Q) were expressed at significantly higher levels than Rac1 in co-transfected HeLa cells, Rac2 and Rac1(6Q) showed only a 29–34 and 10–12% ability, respectively, to stimulate PAK autophosphorylation, in comparison with Rac1 (Fig. 4). Our combined results indicate that the polybasic domain of Rac plays a crucial role in PAK1 binding and activation and demonstrate that the presence of an intact versus a disrupted polybasic domain dictates the relative ability of Rac1 versus Rac 2 to bind to and activate PAK1. A core GTPase-binding domain on PAK1 (amino acids 75–132) was postulated (18Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) and further reduced to a minimal CRIB motif (amino acids 75–88 in PAK1) (28Burbelo P.D. Dreschsel D. Hall A. J. Biol.

To determine which PAK residues might be involved in the differential binding of Rac1 versus Rac2 to PAK1, we investigated the binding of Rac1, Rac2, Rac1(6Q), and Cdc42 proteins to PAK1 fragments in overlay assays (data not shown). These experiments suggested that a polybasic region upstream of the CRIB domain might affect the interaction between Rac proteins and PAK1. To elucidate the influence of this highly charged domain (Lys66–Lys68) on PAK binding and activation by GTPases, the three basic residues in PAK1 were mutated to neutral Gln, hydrophobic Leu, or basic Arg residues. The PAK mutants were expressed in COS-7 or HeLa cells and analyzed for in vitro GTPase binding. Comparable amounts of PAK1(wt) and the three PAK mutants were renatured on nitrocellulose and incubated with [35S]GTPγS-Rac1, – Rac2, and – Cdc42, and bound radiolabel was quantitated (Fig.5 A).

A major limitation on the bandwidth of multimode glass and plastic optical fibers is modal dispersion, in which different optical modes propagate at different velocities and the dispersion grows linearly with length. However, in plastic optical fibers, experimental and theoretical results indicate that the modes are not independent but are highly coupled, which leads to a characteristic square-root length dependence and an unanticipated large enhancement of the bandwidth to gigahertz levels. The ever increasing demands for low-cost, high-bandwidth communications media for voice, video, and data transmission in short- and medium-distance applications are generating a new assessment of multimode optical fibers to serve as high-speed fiber links."

Since hENT1 and rENT1 share extensive protein sequence similarity, but display distinct functional differences with respect to dipyridamole and dilazep inhibition, generation of chimeric molecules between the two proteins should help identify structural domains of hENT1 involved in the binding of vasoactive compounds. Furthermore, since vasodilators and the substrate analog NBMPR interact at common or overlapping sites (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 2Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 16Jarvis S.M. McBride D.

Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar), such chimeras should also shed light on the site of NBMPR (and permeant) binding. Therefore, in the present investigation, a series of chimeric transporters were generated between hENT1 and rENT1 using recombinant DNA techniques. The chimeric proteins were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and evaluated for dipyridamole and dilazep sensitivity. Our results suggest that the binding site for vasoactive drugs is located within the amino-terminal half of hENT1 and that the region extending from residues 100 to 236 (incorporating TMs 3–6) includes the primary site(s) of interaction. The different chimeric transporters created between hENT1 and rENT1, which have 456 and 457 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 1), are illustrated in Fig. 2. The additional amino acid residue present in rENT1 is a cysteine, located just before TM 8. A four-letter nomenclature was chosen to represent each chimera. The numbers of Rs and Hs in the name indicate the approximate percentage of each wild-type cDNA in a particular construct, where the letter R represents the DNA and encoded amino acid sequence of rENT1 and the letter H denotes that of hENT1. For instance, RRHH is a 50:50 chimeric transporter whose amino-terminal half is rENT1 and whose carboxyl-terminal half is hENT1; RHHH is a 25:75 chimeric transporter whose amino-terminal one-quarter is rENT1 and whose carboxyl-terminal three-quarters is hENT1. The two junction points are represented by arrows A and B in Fig. 1.Figure 2Schematic representation of hENT1/rENT1 chimeric molecules.

Both cDNAs have a common EcoRI restriction site in the middle of their coding sequence which, in our topology model, corresponds to the start of the central cytoplasmic loop between TM 6 and TM 7 (arrow B in Fig. 1). To make use of thisEcoRI site for the construction of chimeras,EcoRI sites present in the non-coding regions of the hENT1 cDNA were removed by deletion PCR (22Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, 219 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region of the hENT1 cDNA and most of the 3′-untranslated region (up to three nucleotides downstream of the stop codon) were eliminated. This deleted version of the hENT1 cDNA, which was functionally identical to the original clone when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, was used in subsequent studies. Plasmids pKS(+)-hENT1 and pGEMT-rENT1 also share a SalI site upstream of the cDNAs they carry. This SalI site and the common internal EcoRI site were used to interchange the 5′-halves of the hENT1 and rENT1 cDNAs to create the 50:50 chimeras RRHH and HHRR. All other chimeric transporters were produced in two steps by the overlap extension PCR method (23Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar) by using Pyrococcus furiosus DNA polymerase. The hybrid molecules generated by PCR were subcloned into the SalI and EcoRI sites of either pKS(+)-hENT1 or pGEMT-rENT1 depending on the type of chimera under construction.

In contrast, the two transporters differ markedly in their sensitivity to inhibition by vasoactive drugs (18Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R.

We have exploited this difference to identify regions of hENT1 responsible for vasoactive drug binding. Since vasoactive drugs compete with NBMPR and nucleosides for binding to the transporter (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy.

Pharmacol. 1986; 30: 659-665PubMed Google Scholar), such regions are likely to be localized within, or adjacent to, the permeant-binding site. Ligand binding studies have established that radiolabeled NBMPR and dipyridamole bind to es-type transporters from guinea pig lung (which are dipyridamole-sensitive) with the same stoichiometry (1:1), whereas the corresponding dipyridamole-insensitivees-type transporters from rat lung bind only NBMPR (24Shi M.M. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By using the topology model shown in Fig. 1 as a guide, six chimeric transporters (Fig. 2) composed of reciprocal domain swaps were generated between hENT1 and rENT1. To increase the probability of obtaining functional chimeras, the two grafting sites (Fig. 1) were engineered in regions at the beginning of putative cytoplasmic domains, thereby minimizing disruption to native TMs and loops. Graft site A was close to the start of the first putative cytoplasmic loop between residues 99 and 100 of h/rENT1. Graft site B was close to the start of the large central putative cytoplasmic loop between residues 231 and 232. RNA transcript from each chimeric cDNA was synthesized by in vitro transcription and microinjected into Xenopusoocytes, which were then assayed for nucleoside transport activity (10 μm uridine influx) in the presence and in the absence of inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures” (18Griffiths M.

Endogenous nucleoside transport activity was measured in water-injected oocytes (typically <3% that in RNA transcript-injected oocytes). As shown in Figs. 3 and4, all of the chimeras were functional and inhibited by NBMPR (1 μm) to a similar extent as the parent proteins, suggesting that the native conformation was generally retained in all constructs. However, chimera HRHH consistently displayed a substantially lower level of functional expression than the other chimeras, and an incubation period of 30 min was required to obtain transport activity comparable to the wild-type proteins. One reason for such a low level of expression could be improper plasma membrane targeting. Uridine influx (10 μm) in oocytes expressing recombinant HRHH was in the range 0.6–1.2 pmol/oocyte·30 min−1, compared with 0.43–0.84 pmol/oocyte·min−1 for hENT1, rENT1, and the other chimeric constructs.Figure 4Inhibition of the hENT1 series of chimeras by NBMPR, dipyridamole, and dilazep.

This concentration of dipyridamole caused almost complete inhibition of hENT1 but had no effect on rENT1 (Figs.3 A and 4 A) (18Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A.

For clarity, the results obtained for different chimeras are discussed in two groups, the rENT1 series (panel A in Fig. 2) and the hENT1 series (panel B in Fig. 2). With the rENT1 series (where pGEMT-rENT1 was the parent plasmid), regions of hENT1 were sequentially transplanted into equivalent positions in rENT1 to determine whether the dipyridamole inhibition function of hENT1 could be transferred to rENT1. The results are presented in Fig. 3 and summarized TableI. The first of the series, HHRR, was a 50:50 chimera in which the amino-terminal half of rENT1 (incorporating TMs 1–6) was replaced with that of hENT1 (the splice site is shown asarrow B in Fig. 1). Dipyridamole (1 μm) was able to inhibit most of the uridine transport mediated by this chimera (Fig. 3 B), and the extent of residual HHRR-mediated uridine influx was very similar to that observed with hENT1 (Fig.4 A), suggesting that the site of drug interaction is within the amino-terminal half of hENT1.Table IEffects of dipyridamole (1 μm) on hENT1/rENT1 chimeric transportersTransporterDipyridamole inhibitionHHHH (hENT1)++++RRRR (rENT1)−HHRR++++HRRR+RHRR+++RRHH−RHHH+++HRHH+Values of percentage inhibition calculated from the data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 (corrected for endogenous uridine transport activity) are represented as follows: ++++, inhibition equivalent to hENT1 (80–90%); +++, 60–70%; +, 15–20%; −, no inhibition. Open table in a new tab Values of percentage inhibition calculated from the data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 (corrected for endogenous uridine transport activity) are represented as follows: ++++, inhibition equivalent to hENT1 (80–90%); +++, 60–70%; +, 15–20%; −, no inhibition. Therefore, the next splice site was designed about the middle of TMs 1–6 (arrow A in Fig. 1) with a view to localizing dipyridamole recognition domains within the amino-terminal half of the protein. This resulted in two chimeric transporters, namely HRRR and RHRR. The construct HRRR, composed of hENT1 from the amino terminus to the end of TM 2 and rENT1 for the rest of the protein, displayed only modest inhibition by dipyridamole (Fig. 3 C),narrowing the region of interest to TMs 3–6 (including 12 residues of the preceding intracellular loop). For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to this region as TMs 3–6. The abbreviation TMs 1–2 will be used to describe the domain from the amino terminus to the end of TM 2. The next chimera in the series, RHRR, was created by transplanting TMs 3–6 of hENT1 into the corresponding region of rENT1. The resulting chimera was strongly inhibited by dipyridamole (Fig. 3 D) but to a lesser extent than chimera HHRR. Thus, the rENT1 series of chimeras suggested that dipyridamole inhibition, and hence binding, may involve two domains present in the amino-terminal half of hENT1, with TMs 3–6 being the major site of interaction. With this information, three mirror image chimeras, designated as the hENT1 series, were generated in pKS(+)-hENT1. In this series, regions of rENT1 were successively transplanted into hENT1 to determine whether dipyridamole insensitivity could be transferred from rENT1 to hENT1 and, if so, by which regions of sequence. Results are illustrated in Fig. 4 and summarized in Table I. Dipyridamole (1 μm) was unable to inhibit RRHH-mediated uridine transport (Fig. 4 B), confirming that dipyridamole interacts with the amino-terminal half of hENT1, as noticed with the reciprocal 50:50 chimera HHRR. Replacing TMs 1–2 of hENT1 by those of rENT1 resulted in construct RHHH, which was dipyridamole-sensitive, but exhibited significantly higher residual uridine influx in the presence of dipyridamole than did wild-type hENT1 (Fig. 4 C). In other words, there was a small decrease in dipyridamole inhibition when hENT1 lacked its amino-terminal region containing TMs1–2, indicating that this region may play a minor role in determining dipyridamole sensitivity as suggested by chimera HRRR. The last of the reciprocal chimeras, HRHH, was generated by substituting TMs 3–6 of hENT1 with the corresponding region of rENT1. Functionally, chimera HRHH showed a large decrease in dipyridamole inhibition compared with native hENT1 (Fig. 4 D), implicating TMs 3–6 as the major site of dipyridamole interaction and confirming the results obtained with chimera RHRR. Similar patterns of inhibition were obtained when transport assays were performed on the two series of chimeras in the presence of 1 μm dilazep (Figs. 3 and4). To quantify the relative contributions of TMs 1–2 and TMs 3–6 to dipyridamole inhibition, full dipyridamole dose-response curves (0.3 nm to 10 μm inhibitor) were determined for hENT1, rENT1, and each of the chimeras (with the exception of low activity HRHH). Representative results are shown in Figs.5 and 6. IC50 values (± S.E.), obtained by linear regression analysis of indirect Hill plot transformations of the dose-response curves, are summarized in Table II. Hill coefficients were in the range 0.90–1.25, consistent with a single site of dipyridamole binding.Figure 6Dose-response curves for dipyridamole inhibition of the hENT1 series of chimeras. Initial rates of uridine uptake in the presence of increasing concentrations of dipyridamole (0.3 nm to10 μm) were corrected for endogenous nucleoside transport activity (measured in water-injected oocytes) and are expressed as a percentage of the uninhibited flux for each transporter: hENT1 (A), RRHH (B), and RHHH (C).

Chimera HHRR displayed a dipyridamole IC50 value (211 nm) similar to that of hENT1 (198 nm), demonstrating that structural domains responsible for dipyridamole sensitivity are indeed confined to the amino-terminal half of hENT1. This was further confirmed by the reciprocal chimera RRHH, which showed an IC50 value comparable to rENT1 (≥10,000 nm). Chimera RHHH exhibited an IC50 value (298 nm) slightly higher than hENT1, consistent with TMs 1–2 having a small effect on dipyridamole binding affinity. A similar result was noticed with the reciprocal chimera HRRR, where an IC50 value of 1940 nm was obtained, compared with ≥10,000 nm for rENT1. Chimera RHRR, generated by grafting TMs 3–6 of hENT1 into rENT1, displayed an IC50value (339 nm) approaching that of hENT1, highlighting the major importance of this region of the transporter. As shown in Fig. 1, the major protein sequence differences between hENT1 and rENT1 lie in the large putative extracellular loop between TMs 1 and 2, in the putative central cytoplasmic loop between TMs 6 and 7, and in TM 9. It might be anticipated, therefore, that these regions could be responsible for the different dipyridamole sensitivities displayed by the two transporters. The present chimeric study has eliminated involvement of the central cytoplasmic loop and, as well, the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein (including TM 9). It has also been demonstrated that the amino terminus up to the end of TM 2, and including large extracellular loop, contributes only minimally to dipyridamole inhibition. Instead, the key structural requirements for dipyridamole sensitivity reside in TMs 3–6 (residues 100–231). Since dipyridamole is a competitive inhibitor of es transport and NBMPR binding, TMs 3–6 are also likely to form part of the NBMPR and nucleoside binding pocket. Consistent with this interpretation, photoaffinity labeling studies with purified erythrocyte hENT1 have shown that the site of covalent attachment of NBMPR is within 16 kDa of the site of N-linked glycosylation (predicted to be Asn-48 in the extracellular loop between TMs 1 and 2) (25Kwong F.W.P. Wu J.S.R. Shi M.M. Fincham H.E. Davies A. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22127-22134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since hENT1 and rENT1 exhibit very similar activity profiles with respect to uridine transport and NBMPR binding, the overall characteristics of the binding pocket should be the same in both proteins. That of rENT1 may, however, lack specific amino acid side chains involved in dipyridamole binding and/or contain residues that sterically hinder binding of this and other vasodilator drugs. The amino acid sequences of hENT1 and rENT1 in TMs 3–6 (between splice sites A and B in Fig. 1) are 83% identical and 95% similar, with differences between the two proteins occurring mainly as single residue substitutions across the region. Thus, introduction of point mutations to this region of hENT1 (rather than microdomain swaps) will provide more specific information on vasoactive drug binding. Another outcome of the present study is that it opens the way to identification of hENT1 residues involved in NBMPR (and permeant) binding."
https://openalex.org/W2068048784,"Recently two germline mutations in the oligomerization domain of p53 have been identified in patients with Li–Fraumeni and Li–Fraumeni-like Syndromes. We have used biophysical and biochemical methods to characterize these two mutants in order to better understand their functional defects and the role of the p53 oligomerization domain (residues 325–355) in oncogenesis. We find that residues 310–360 of the L344P mutant are monomeric, apparently unfolded and cannot interact with wild-type (WT) p53. The full length L344P protein is unable to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is therefore an inactive, but not a dominant negative mutant. R337C, on the other hand, can form dimers and tetramers, can hetero-oligomerize with WTp53 and can bind to a p53 consensus element. However, the thermal stability of R337C is much lower than that of WTp53 and at physiological temperatures more than half of this mutant is less than tetrameric. Thus, the R337C mutant retains some functional activity yet leads to a predisposition to cancer, suggesting that even partial inactivation of p53 oligomerization is sufficient for accelerated tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W1970867969,"Little is known about the molecular background to senescence in T-lymphocytes. In fibroblast systems replicative senescence has been shown to correlate with a number of changes in the expression of the proteins normally regulating progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and recently the Ink4 inhibitor p16 was implicated as a central regulator of replicative senescence in human fibroblasts. It has, however, been claimed that p16 is not expressed in T-lymphocytes. In the present study we have analysed G1 regulating proteins in ageing human T-lymphocytes. We show that PHA and IL-2 stimulated T-lymphocytes cease to proliferate after around 20 population doublings, these cells can not thereafter be restimulated to growth, and were also found to exhibit markers for senescence. We found that T-lymphocytes accumulate p16 and p15 protein during successive population doublings and display high levels of these proteins as they enter into replicative senescence. There was also an increased binding of p16 to the Cdk6 kinase in senescent cells, and a decreased Cdk6 as well as Cdk2 kinase activity. The levels of other G1 regulating proteins were also altered in the senescent cells, such as slightly elevated levels of p21/WAF1, and downregulation of Cdk2 and cyclinD3. The levels of p27/ Kip1 is down regulated in proliferating cells but rise to approximately 15% of the levels in un-stimulated quiescent cells. As a high proportion of T-cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemias have deletions of both p15 and p16, our data suggest that inactivation of these genes makes it possible for leukemic cells to avoid senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1988883407,"The Cdx2 gene is one of three murine homologues of the Drosophila homeobox gene caudal. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in Cdx2 exhibit a variable phenotype including tail abnormalities, stunted growth and a homeotic shift of vertebrae. Most strikingly, however, 90% of heterozygous mice were reported to develop multiple intestinal adenomatous polyps, most notably in the proximal colon (). These observations led us to propose that mutation of CDX2 may be involved in the genesis of some human colorectal tumours. A survey of DNA from 85 colorectal tumours revealed that one with extensive microsatellite instability (RER+ phenotype) has mutations in both alleles of CDX2. Both mutations occur in coding regions which contain repetitive elements and are consistent with those found in RER+ tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2013723454,"Using a radioligand binding assay we have demonstrated that phosphacan, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan of nervous tissue that also represents the extracellular domain of a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase, shows saturable, reversible, high-affinity binding (Kd ∼6 nm) to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Binding was reduced by only ∼35% following chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycan, indicating that the interaction is mediated primarily through the core protein rather than the glycosaminoglycan chains. Immunocytochemical studies also showed an overlapping localization of FGF-2 and phosphacan in the developing central nervous system. At concentrations of 10 μg protein/ml, both native phosphacan and the core protein obtained by chondroitinase treatment potentiated the mitogenic effect of FGF-2 (5 ng/ml) on NIH/3T3 cells by 75–90%, which is nearly the same potentiation as that produced by heparin at an equivalent concentration. Although studies on the role of proteoglycans in mediating the binding and mitogenic effects of FGF-2 have previously focused on cell surface heparan sulfate, our results indicate that the core protein of a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan may also regulate the access of FGF-2 to cell surface signaling receptors in nervous tissue.

Phosphacan and neurocan are nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that are high-affinity ligands of several immunoglobulin superfamily neural cell adhesion molecules and of the extracellular matrix proteins tenascin-C and tenascin-R (1Margolis R.K.

Neurocan is synthesized by neurons and is a member of the family of hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that also includes aggrecan, versican, and brevican, whereas phosphacan, which is produced by astrocytes, is an alternative splicing product representing the extracellular domain of a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase.

In view of the finding that phosphacan and neurocan are high-affinity ligands of amphoterin and HB-GAM, we examined their interactions with FGF-2, a growth factor whose binding to the heparan sulfate chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans has been much explored in relation to FGF-2 presentation to cell surface receptors. FGF-2, a heparin-binding protein that occurs in several isoforms of 16–25 kDa generated by use of alternative translation initiation sites and by proteolysis, is a mitogenic and/or differentiation factor for a variety of cell types of mesodermal and neuroectodermal origin, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (5Burgess W.H Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). FGF-2 also has a wide distribution in nervous tissue, where it acts as a neurotrophic factor that promotes neuronal survival, stimulates neurite outgrowth, induces the synthesis of neurotransmitters, and is a mitogen and differentiation factor for glial cells (7Sensenbrenner M.

The expression of FGF-2 is developmentally regulated from the late embryonic period to adulthood in the rat central nervous system, and this is reflected both in an increase in FGF-2 levels and a shift from lower to higher molecular weight forms (9Caday C.G. Klagsbrun M. Fanning P.J. Mirzabegian A. Finkelstein S.P. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 52: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Giordano S. Sherman L. Lyman W. Morrison R. Dev. Biol. 1992; 152: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Its biological effects are mediated through interactions with high-affinity transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors and are modulated by its binding to low-affinity receptors in the form of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (6McKeehan W.L.

Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that the phosphacan core protein binds with high affinity to FGF-2, is localized in regions of the central nervous system where FGF-2 is also present, and potentiates the mitogenic effects of FGF-2 on NIH/3T3 cells. These results suggest that FGF-2 interactions with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans may play a previously unsuspected role in mediating their biological actions and that at least in certain tissues this process may be of equal importance to the well established relationship of FGF-2 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Phosphacan, phosphacan-KS, and neurocan (originally designated the 3F8, 3H1, and 1D1 proteoglycans, respectively) were isolated from rat brain by ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and immunoaffinity chromatography (12Rauch U.

Briefly, proteins were coated in removable Immulon-4 wells, and binding of 125I-labeled phosphacan and neurocan was measured in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mg/ml heat-treated BSA, following incubation with gentle shaking (45 rpm) for 3–12 h at room temperature. Reversibility of binding was demonstrated by incubation for varying periods in the presence of an excess of unlabeled proteoglycan (13Milev P. Friedlander D.R. Sakurai T. Karthikeyan L. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Grumet M. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1703-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Scatchard plots were generated, and dissociation constants were determined using the Macintosh version of the Ligand program (15Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). Phosphacan and neurocan were labeled to a specific activity of 1–10 × 1018 cpm/mol with 125I by the lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase method using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 10–25 μg of protein were labeled per reaction, and free iodine was removed using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To evaluate the effects on their binding properties of removing the chondroitin sulfate chains from phosphacan and neurocan, the labeled proteoglycans were treated for 1 h at 37 °C with protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Rockville, MD) at a concentration of 0.5 unit/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, and completeness of digestion was confirmed by SDS-PAGE on a 5% gel and autoradiography of the resulting core glycoproteins. Double immunofluorescence localization of proteins was performed as described previously (16Meyer-Puttlitz B. Junker E. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), using the 3F8 monoclonal antibody to phosphacan (12Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K.

NIH/3T3 cells grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon) at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well. After the cells became confluent (4–5 days) they were transferred overnight to DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. FGF-2 (5 ng/ml) was added in DMEM, 0.5% FBS, 1 mg/ml BSA either alone or together with proteoglycan (10 μg of protein/ml) or heparin (10 μg/ml). Before addition to cells, FGF-2 was preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in the medium described above with proteoglycan, or heparin, or medium alone. After 17 h the cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine (24 h, 1 μCi/well), washed twice with PBS, collected in 0.15m NaOH containing 0.02% SDS, and transferred to liquid scintillation vials for measurement of thymidine incorporation. In a radioligand binding assay, phosphacan and neurocan bound to FGF-2 to the extent of 46–67% of the input radioactivity, and binding was reduced by only ∼35% following chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycans, indicating that these interactions are mediated primarily through the core proteins rather than the glycosaminoglycan chains (Fig. 1). The purity of the proteoglycans and the effectiveness of the chondroitinase digestion were demonstrated by the shift of all125I-labeled proteoglycan from the stacking gel to core proteins of the expected size in the separating gel following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1). Binding of the COOH-terminal half of neurocan (designated neurocan-C) containing the EGF-, lectin-, and complement regulatory-like domains was ∼20% less than that of the full-length proteoglycan and was also reduced by one-third after chondroitinase treatment, whereas there was very little binding of other proteins tested, such as the neural cell adhesion molecule Ng-CAM (8%), the 3G2 monoclonal antibody to Ng-CAM (3.5%), or cartilage aggrecan (11%), whose binding was not affected by chondroitinase treatment (Fig. 1). Binding was reversible and inhibited to the extent of 90% or greater by unlabeled ligand (phosphacan or neurocan, 30–90 nm) as well as by heparin or heparan sulfate, but only by ∼20% by aggrecan or chondroitin sulfate (data not shown).125I-Labeled FGF-2 also bound to immobilized native or chondroitinase-treated phosphacan and neurocan, although the percent bound was somewhat lower (i.e. 18–20% for phosphacan and 11–14% for neurocan, data not shown). This difference in extent of binding is probably attributable to partial hindrance of FGF-2 access to its binding site(s) as a result of immobilizing the large proteoglycans by adsorption to plastic. Saturation curves and Scatchard plots for the binding of chondroitinase-treated phosphacan and neurocan to FGF-2 gave dissociation constants of 6–12 nm (Fig.2), and similar dissociation constants were obtained for binding of native phosphacan and neurocan and of chondroitinase-treated neurocan-C. Immunocytochemical studies showed an overlapping localization of FGF-2 with phosphacan (Fig.3) and neurocan (data not shown) in the developing central nervous system, which is a necessary condition if their high affinity interactions demonstrated in radioligand binding assays are to be biologically relevant.Figure 3Double immunofluorescence showing the co-localization of FGF-2 (A, C, E) and phosphacan (B, D, F) in the central nervous system.

Neurocan had no potentiating activity, and the effect of phosphacan was only slightly reduced by chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycan (Fig. 4). Similar effects (data not shown) were observed using (at 10 μg of protein/ml) the unfractionated native or chondroitinase-treated PBS-soluble chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of rat brain, from which phosphacan, phosphacan-KS, and neurocan were isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography (12Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of which they constitute the major components. When added by themselves in the absence of FGF-2, neither phosphacan, phosphacan-KS, nor the unfractionated proteoglycans showed any mitogenic activity, demonstrating that like heparin and heparan sulfate they specifically modulate the activity of FGF-2 in the absence of any intrinsic growth stimulatory properties and that the effects observed were not due to contaminating growth factors that co-purified with the proteoglycans. Our studies have demonstrated that phosphacan and neurocan are high-affinity ligands of FGF-2 and that both native phosphacan and its core protein potentiated the mitogenic activity of FGF-2 on NIH/3T3 cells to an extent essentially equivalent to that of heparin. Although neurocan did not show similar potentiating effects, it is possible that neurocan may also modulate the mitogenic activity of FGF-2 for particular cell types in the central nervous system but that this was not evident in our assays due to different properties of the FGF-2 receptors in 3T3 cells. Alternatively, neurocan may not be involved in the presentation of FGF-2 to its receptors but rather modulate its actions in other ways, such as by serving as a reservoir for FGF-2 in the extracellular space. Neither the binding affinities nor the extent of mitogenic potentiating activity were greatly affected by chondroitinase treatment of the proteoglycans, and the relatively small decreases observed following removal of chondroitin sulfate (20–30%) may be largely related to effects of the glycosaminoglycan chains on the core protein conformation, rather than implying a direct participation in the binding and presentation of FGF-2. These interactions therefore appear to be largely mediated by the proteoglycan core (glyco)proteins and in this respect differ both from the interaction of FGF-2 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (which is mediated by the heparan sulfate chains) and from the binding of phosphacan and neurocan to differentiation factors such as amphoterin and the heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM)/pleiotrophin. However, the interactions of phosphacan and neurocan with FGF-2 resemble its binding to a carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence present in a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan form of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which serves as a precursor for the 85-kDa M-CSF that is generated by proteolytic processing (18Suzu S. Kimura F. Yamada M. Yanai N. Kawashima T. Nagata N. Motoyoshi K. Blood. 1994; 83: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of two other chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, betaglycan and decorin, to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), is also mediated by their core proteins rather than the glycosaminoglycan chains (19Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Whereas betaglycan is considered to serve as a co-receptor for TGF-β, both decorin and the proteoglycan precursor of M-CSF neutralize rather than potentiate the mitogenic activities of their growth factor ligands. The high-affinity binding of the phosphacan core protein to FGF-2 and its ability to potentiate the mitogenic effects of FGF-2 to an extent comparable with that of heparin and heparan sulfate on a weight basis (and with 10 times greater potency on a molar basis) suggest that FGF-2 interactions with chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans may play a previously unsuspected role in mediating their biological actions and that at least in certain tissues this mechanism may be of equal importance to the well established relationship of FGF-2 with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The specific localization and developmental regulation of phosphacan and neurocan in the central nervous system (12Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K.

Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2327-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) suggests that their interactions with FGF-2 may partially regulate growth factor availability and activity during nervous tissue histogenesis. Because phosphacan is an mRNA splicing product that contains the entire extracellular domain of a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (17Maurel P. Rauch U. Flad M. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2512-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), binding of FGF-2 to phosphacan may also compete with or otherwise modulate similarly high-affinity FGF-2 interactions with the transmembrane phosphatase and thus provide an additional mechanism for tyrosine kinase/phosphatase-mediated FGF-2 signaling across the plasma membrane.

Although p53 contributes to transcriptional activation of the p21waf1 and bax genes, accumulation of these proteins requires that these genes are free of UV induced pyrimidine dimers. We assessed the level of expression of p53 and the p53 regulated p21waf1 and bax gene products in normal diploid fibroblasts (NDF) and several nucleotide excision repair deficient fibroblasts following UV-irradiation. At low UV fluences, increased expression of p53, p21waf1 and bax was only observed in fibroblasts deficient in transcription coupled repair (TCR). Whereas p53 protein levels increased in all cell types at high UV fluences, p21waf1 levels initially decreased and then recovered in a manner dependent on TCR. At later times, expression of p21waf1 and bax was only elevated in TCR-proficient cells. The lack of TCR strongly correlated with an enhanced induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of modulation of the p53/p21waf1/pRb pathway on clonogenic survival following UV irradiation. Expression of E2F-1, E2F-4, and the large tumour antigens of SV40 and Polyomavirus conferred UV sensitivity to NDF whereas p21waf1 protected cells against UV treatment. We propose that the fluence dependent attenuation of protective functions of p53 by blockage of transcription favours apoptosis following UV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2117804665,"It has been proposed that hydrogen produced from basalt–ground-water interactions may serve as an energy source that supports the existence of microorganisms in the deep subsurface on Earth and possibly on other planets. However, experiments demonstrated that hydrogen is not produced from basalt at an environmentally relevant, alkaline pH. Small amounts of hydrogen were produced at a lower pH in laboratory incubations, but even this hydrogen production was transitory. Furthermore, geochemical considerations suggest that previously reported rates of hydrogen production cannot be sustained over geologically significant time frames. These findings indicate that hydrogen production from basalt–ground-water interactions may not support microbial metabolism in the subsurface."

Agonists stabilize the active conformation, whereas antagonists stabilize the inactive conformation. In a systematic search for residues that participate in receptor function, several regions of the m5 muscarinic receptor were randomly mutated and tested for their functional properties. Mutations spanning one face of transmembrane 6 (TM6) were found to induce high levels of receptor activity in the absence of agonists (constitutive activity). The same face of TM6 contained several residues crucial for receptor activation by agonists and one residue identified as a contact site for both agonists and antagonists. In addition, one mutation induced agonist-like responses from the receptor when exposed to classical antagonists. These results suggest that TM6 is a switch that defines the activation state of the receptor, and that ligand interactions with TM6 stabilize the receptor in either an active or an inactive conformation.

The muscarinic receptors belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors that have significant sequence and functional homology with the visual pigment rhodopsin. There is considerable physical and modeling data to suggest that G-protein-coupled receptors have seven transmembrane domains (TM1–7) 1The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembrane domainPCRpolymerase chain reactionNMSN-methyl scopolamineQNBquinuclidinyl benzilateGppNHpguanyl-5′-yl imidophosphate. and these are α-helical (5Chabre M.

Interactions between muscarinic receptors and G-proteins are believed to be mediated by cytoplasmic loops (i1–i3) linking the transmembrane domains (7Kubo T. Bujo H. Akiba I. Nakai J. Mishina M.

The second internal loop (i2) and a small number of amino acids adjacent to TM5 and TM6 in the N- and C-terminal regions of the third cytoplasmic loop (N-i3 and C-i3) appear to make the largest contribution to receptor-G-protein coupling (9Burstein E.S.

A limitation of data collected from classical site-directed mutagenesis is that since relatively few residues have actually been tested, therelative contribution of the individual residues and even the overall domains is difficult to gauge in a broad context. To gain such a broad perspective, it would be necessary to systematically mutate at least a significant proportion of the residues of a receptor and test the relative functional consequences of those mutations. The combination of random mutagenesis with high throughput assays of receptor function make the systematic mutagenesis of a muscarinic receptor feasible. We have been systematically examining the structure-function relationships of receptors by random mutagenesis (9Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

Mutations in this region have profound effects on interactions with ligands, and many mutations in TM6 cause elevated activity in the absence of added agonists (constitutive activity). Random mutations were introduced into the m5 receptor by PCR using a primer having the consensus sequence of the targeted region, but with bases randomly misincorporated at a rate of 11.5% at each position (9Burstein E.S.

To construct receptors containing point mutations, a NheI site was introduced at positions Leu-457 and Leu-458 (CTCCTG to CTGCTA) without changing the amino acid sequence. Point mutations were introduced by PCR using mutagenic oligonucleotides where the bases encoding Asn-459 and Phe-451 were replaced with an equimolar mixture of all four bases (9Burstein E.S.

Open table in a new tab Constitutive activity and maximum response are expressed as a percentage of the maximum response of the wild-type receptor to carbachol.

Constitutive activity was measured as receptor activity in the absence of agonists that could be reversed by the antagonist atropine. For the Asn-459 mutants, this measurement was confirmed using benztropine. Maximum response was defined as the difference between the receptor's maximum response to carbachol and its minimum response to atropine. EC50 denotes the concentration of a ligand that produces a half-maximal response from the receptor in the absence of other ligands. Where the EC50 of atropine could not be determined because of low levels of constitutive activity, receptors were incubated with a fixed concentration of carbachol (2–8 times the EC50 of CCh for that receptor), and varying concentrations of atropine. The resultant atropine IC50 values (concentration inhibiting half of the carbachol-induced activity) were then adjusted for carbachol occupancy using the equation: KI(atr) = IC50(atr)/{1 + [CCh]/EC50(CCh)}, where atr is atropine.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) on membrane preparations derived from COS and TSA cells transfected with representative mutant receptors. Receptor expression levels and [3H]NMS binding affinities were determined using six concentrations of [3H]NMS. [3H]NMS affinities were (log Kd): wild-type, −9.9 ± 0.1; I447S, −9.6 ± 0.4; N459H, ∼−8.5 ± 0.5; F451L, −10.1 ± 0.4; S465Y,T466P, −9.7 ± 0.0. None of these mutant receptors were found to be significantly overexpressed compared with the wild-type (Bmax, pmol/mg protein) wild-type, 0.8 ± 0.1; I447S, 0.7 ± 0.5; F451L, 0.7 ± 0.3. Bmax for N459H could not be accurately determined because of its low affinity for [3H]NMS. Data for S465Y,T466P are published (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Carbachol affinities were measured in the presence of 50 μm GppNHp and in competition with 400 pm[3H]NMS, except N459H, which was competed against 2 nm [3H]NMS. Carbachol potencies were: (log IC50): wild-type, −4.4 ± 0.1; I447S, −6.7 ± 0.1; N459H, −4.8 ± 0.5; F451L, −5.2 ± 0.2; S465Y,T466P, −6.1 ± 0.2. Radioligand binding studies could not be conducted on the mutant F451P because of its low affinity for [3H]NMS. We have used random mutagenesis to identify functionally important residues in the five regions of the m5 muscarinic receptor indicated in Fig.1 A. Each region of 20–21 amino acids was targeted individually. Mutations were introduced using a PCR protocol that produced an average of five amino acid substitutions per receptor (11Hill-Eubanks D. Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brauner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3058-3065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A library of between 500 and 1,200 unique recombinant receptors was constructed for each region to be tested, and the receptors were assayed for functional activity. Functional receptors were identified, sequenced, and characterized pharmacologically. Out of a library of 1,200 receptors containing mutations in TM6, 34 functional receptors were identified and characterized. It was immediately noticeable that many of these receptors showed high basal activity levels, and that this agonist-independent (constitutive) activity was reversed by antagonists. Fig. 1 B shows a comparison of the constitutive activity levels of receptors containing random mutations in TM6 (filled bars) with those containing mutations in TM5, i2, N-i3, and C-i3. The highest levels of constitutive activity and the highest proportion of constitutively activated receptors were seen in library of receptors mutated in TM6. High levels of constitutive activity were also seen in receptors mutated in i2.2 The 34 functional receptors obtained from the TM6 mutant receptor library were sequenced, and their pharmacology was evaluated using the agonist carbachol and the antagonist atropine. TableI summarizes these data. The receptor tolerated multiple, non-conservative mutations to 14 of the 21 residues in TM6 without severely compromising its ability to be activated by carbachol. These side chains are therefore not essential either for receptor activation by carbachol or for maintaining the overall structure of the receptor. We combined these data with data from an analogous study on the cytoplasmic extension of TM6, C-i3 (9Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When the primary structures of TM6 and C-i3 were mapped onto a perfect α-helix (Fig. 1 C), one face of that predicted helix was composed entirely of residues that tolerated multiple, nonconservative mutations without significantly affecting receptor function. We suggest that this face of TM6 makes nonspecific interactions with the lipid bilayer and cytoplasm, and points away from potential ligand and intraprotein contacts. This same orientation of TM6 has been predicted from molecular modeling (22Baldwin J.M. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 23Baldwin J. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 24Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In contrast, six residues were identified that either tolerated no mutations or were only mutated in severely compromised receptors. Trp-455, Tyr-458, and Val-464 were only mutated in receptors where the potency of carbachol was decreased by over 500-fold, and mutations to Thr-454, Pro-457, and Val-462 were never seen in any of the functional mutants. As the library of 1,200 receptors certainly contained a wide range of receptors that were mutated at these positions, it follows that the receptors which were mutated at these residues were inactive, whether through decreased expression, misfolding or inability to bind or respond to carbachol. The exact side chains of these residues are therefore likely to be important for normal muscarinic receptor expression or function. For Trp-455, Tyr-458, Thr-454, and Pro-457, these results are consistent with earlier data from site-directed mutagenesis of the closely related m3 muscarinic receptor (15Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 10: 331-338Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, the effects of mutating Val-462 and Val-464 have not been previously examined. As shown in Fig. 1 C, these functionally conserved residues cluster on one face of TM6. We suggest that this region is involved in internal protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions necessary for receptor folding and activation. The associated cluster of functionally conserved residues in C-i3 has been extensively characterized and plays important roles in G-protein activation (9Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4052-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of Table I also reveals a pattern in the mutations within TM6 that cause constitutive activity. All six of the most activated receptors had mutations to either Phe-451 or Ser-465, suggesting that mutations at these sites can cause constitutive activity. In addition, two constitutively activated mutants containing single point mutations were identified: A450V and I447S; thus, mutations at these positions can certainly cause constitutive activity. The phenotypes of these two mutants are compared with the wild-type receptor in Fig.2 A. The basal activities of the mutant receptors were substantially higher than that of the wild-type. Atropine had a strong negative effect on the activity of the mutants, but little effect on the wild-type. Carbachol increased the activity of both the wild-type and mutant receptors, but acted on at much lower concentrations (i.e. had higher potency) on the constitutively activated mutants compared with the wild-type. As shown in Table I, an increase in the potency of carbachol was observed in the majority of the constitutively activated mutants. In contrast, the potency of the antagonist atropine was similar for most of the constitutively activated receptors. A unique phenotype was seen in a receptor with the three mutations F451L, N459H, and S465C. This receptor had one of the highest levels of constitutive activity, but unlike most of the other activated receptors the potency of carbachol was not increased. Strikingly, the potency of atropine was dramatically decreased (4,000-fold). As described above, it is probable that the constitutive activity of this mutant is caused by the mutations to Ser-465 and Phe-451; however, as other receptors having these substitutions did not have decreased potencies for atropine, it is likely that the change in atropine potency is caused by the mutation in Asn-459. To characterize the functional properties of important residues identified in this study, we made extensive series of point mutations to Ser-465, Phe-451, and Asn-459. As we have reported previously (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 12 amino acid substitutions to Ser-465 were tested, and most of these were found to cause increases in both constitutive activity and agonist potency. Bulky and basic substitutions caused the largest effects. The observed constitutive activity could be suppressed by atropine, which acted with similar potency on all the receptors. Careful mathematical analysis of these results revealed that the observed changes in carbachol potency could be explained as a consequence of increased constitutive activity, with no suggestion of any direct contact between Ser-465 and carbachol. As described in detail elsewhere (e.g. Ref. 26Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), agonists activate receptors by preferentially binding to and stabilizing an active receptor conformation, whereas antagonists preferentially bind to and stabilize an inactive conformation. Constitutive activity occurs when unliganded receptors exist in an active conformation, and is seen at low levels even in wild-type muscarinic receptors (27Hilf G. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 225: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brauner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Jakubik J. Bacakova L. El-Fakahany E.E. Tucek S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutations that increase constitutive activity increase the proportion of receptors in the active conformation. As this conformation has a higher affinity for agonists, agonists act with higher potency on more strongly constitutively activated receptors. Like Ser-465, most mutations to Phe-451 caused significant levels of constitutive activity that could be suppressed by atropine (TableII, Fig.3 B); however, there was no correlation between agonist potency and constitutive activity. For example, the mutant F451N was strongly constitutively activated but the potency of carbachol was dramatically decreased. This phenotype suggests that the mutation F451N disrupts the receptor's interactions with agonists in addition to causing constitutive activity. No structure-activity relationship was seen linking amino acid substitutions to Phe-451 to a particular phenotype. An extraordinary result was seen for the mutant F451P; in this case, atropine actually induced an agonist-like response from the receptor. Fig. 2 Cillustrates the ability of two antagonists, atropine and quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), to stimulate an agonist-like response from F451P. Asn-459 differed from Ser-465 and Phe-451 in that, of the wide range of substitutions tolerated at this residue, only histidine and serine caused significant increases in constitutive activity. With the exception of the very conservative mutation N459Q, all mutations to Asn-459 caused decreases of over 100-fold in atropine potency (TableII, Fig. 2 D), indicating that an amide residue is required in this position for high affinity atropine binding. Mutation of Asn-459 also caused large decreases in the potency of QNB, an antagonist that, like atropine, contains both an ester and a hydroxyl moiety (data not shown). In contrast, the potency of benztropine (an atropine analogue that has neither of these functional groups) was affected less than 10-fold by most of these mutations. These data suggest that Asn-459 interacts with the hydroxyl and/or ester moieties of atropine (as suggested in Ref. 17Bluml K. Mutschler E. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 269: 18870-18876Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated a strict requirement for an amide group at position 459. This, coupled with the drastic decreases in atropine potency observed when this residue is mutated, suggests that in the wild-type receptor, Asn-459 makes two hydrogen bonds with atropine. Carbachol potency was also decreased by mutation of Asn-459. Even the constitutively activated receptors N459S and N459H failed to show the large increases in agonist potency normally characteristic of activated receptors (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brauner-Osborne H. Brann M.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The smallest effects on carbachol potency were seen when Asn-459 was replaced with other residues capable of donating hydrogen bonds (e.g. histidine, lysine, and serine) compared with non-donating residues (e.g. phenylalanine and valine). We therefore suggest that a hydrogen bond donated by Asn-459 contributes to receptor activation by carbachol. The smaller decreases seen in carbachol potency relative to atropine may reflect that only one bond is affected. Conceivably, a decrease in carbachol potency could result from many causes, for example the loss of a receptor-ligand interaction; a nonspecific, structural effect; or steric interference with the carbachol binding site. Nonspecific structural effects are unlikely because the majority of the mutant receptors bind benztropine with normal affinity. Nonspecific effects on the active conformation only are also unlikely because most of the mutant receptors retain similar levels of constitutive activity to the wild-type. In addition, many mutations to Asn-459 actually increase the potency and efficacy of the agonist McN-A-434 (data not shown); hence, the mechanism of receptor activation is also probably unimpaired. We therefore suggest a direct contact between Asn-459 and carbachol. Asn-459 is conserved in all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, yet is replaced by phenylalanine in all catecholamine receptors. Modeling experiments have predicted that Asn-459 is perfectly positioned to donate a single hydrogen bond to the ester moiety of acetylcholine (and hence carbachol) when bound through its nitrogen headgroup to Asp-110 in TM3 (31Hibert M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar, 32Klimkowski V.J. Ellis J.M. Brann M.R. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The proposed binding of carbachol and atropine to Asn-459 and Asp-110 is illustrated in Fig. 4. We suggest that the functional face of TM6 (including Ile-447, Phe-451, and Ser-465) plays a vital role in maintaining the inactive conformation of the muscarinic receptor. The evidence for this is as follows. First, a wide range of structurally dissimilar substitutions to Ser-465, Ile-447, and Phe-451 induce constitutive activity. It is very unlikely that multiple, unrelated substitutions could strengthen specific interactions within the active conformation of the receptor, but it is perfectly reasonable that they could disrupt the receptor's ability to maintain its inactive conformation. Second, as mutations spanning the length of TM6 can cause constitutive activity, TM6 probably makes these important interactions along its entire length, most likely with another transmembrane domain. The two-state model provides a compelling explanation for how mutations cause constitutive activity. If receptors exist in structurally distinct active and inactive conformations, residues that make important, constraining interactions in the inactive conformation may make relatively unimportant interactions in the active conformation. Mutations that disturb these interactions would selectively destabilize the inactive conformation, increasing the proportion of the unliganded receptor in the active conformation and causing constitutive activity. In order for mutations in TM6 to have differential effects on the two conformations, we propose that the position of TM6 is subtly different in the inactive and active receptor conformations. We have also demonstrated that TM6 interacts with muscarinic ligands. In addition to the interactions between Asn-459 and carbachol and atropine described above, this laboratory has previously shown that mutations to Tyr-458 (Tyr-506 in the m3 muscarinic subtype) causes decreases in agonist but not antagonist binding (15Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, there is strong experimental evidence that muscarinic agonists and antagonists also bind to Asp-110 in TM3 (12Fraser C.M. Wang C.D. Robinson D.A. Gocayne J.D. Venter J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 840-847PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kurtenbach E. Curtis C.A.M. Pedder E.K. Aitken A. Harris A.C.M. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4092-4097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that carbachol binding to Asn-459 in TM6 and Asp-110 in TM3 stabilizes the receptor in an active conformation, whereas atropine binding to the same residues stabilizes the receptor in an inactive conformation. The relative orientations of TM3 and TM6 are likely to differ in the active and inactive receptor conformations. Recently published physical data demonstrate that, in rhodopsin, residues on the extreme intracellular sides of TM3 and TM6 lie in close proximity (33Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) and physically move relative to one another on receptor activation (34Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). In the β-adrenergic receptor, residues in TM3 and TM6 become exposed to water when the receptor is activated (35Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In m5, we have recently shown that TM3 extends into the cytoplasm where it plays a vital role in activating G-proteins; in fact, many mutations in this region are also constitutively activating.2 Together, these results suggest that the relative orientations of TM3 and TM6 may change on receptor activation such that the cytoplasmic tail of TM3 can interact with G-proteins. As ligand interactions with TM3 and TM6 stabilize the receptor in its active or inactive conformations, TM6 is acting as a ligand-dependent switch."

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Furthermore, glycopeptides formed from glycosylation of peptides in the ER of yeast cells are known to be routed to the cytosol, rather than secreted (19Römisch K. Ali B.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Römisch K. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given these findings we asked if a cytosolic PNGase, like that found in higher eukaryotes, is present in yeast. Our results indicate that such an enzyme is present in yeast and is expressed at high levels in stationary phase cells. Furthermore, the results suggest that the PNGase could function in catabolism of glycopeptides and malformed glycoproteins. The yeast strain used in this study was W303-1a (MATa ade2-1 ura3-1 his 3–11 trp1-1 leu2–3, 112 can1–100). Cells were grown at 25 °C in 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% dextran, and 0.003% adenine sulfate (YPAD). Unless noted, 10 ml of cells were grown at 25 °C with shaking in a 50-ml centrifuge tube. The following 14C-labeled glycopeptides were used in this study: fetuin glycopeptide I, ([14C]CH3)2Leu-Asn(GlcNAc5Man3Gal3NeuAc3)-Asp-Ser-Arg; ovalbumin high mannose glycopeptide, ([14C]CH3)2Glu-Glu-Lys-Tyr-Asn(GlcNAc2Man5.5)-Leu-Thr-Ser-Val-Leu-Hse, where Hse represents homoserine; and glycoasparagine GP-IVD, ([14C]CH3)2Asn(Glc NAc2Man6). The methods for preparation of these glycopeptides were reported previously (11Kitajima K. Suzuki T. Kouchi Z. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol.

Desialylation of fetuin glycopeptide I was carried out as described (21Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PNGase activity was identified by paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography as reported previously (11Kitajima K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, 6 μl of reaction mixture in a polyethylene microtube contained 2 μl (20 μg of total protein) of the enzyme fraction from yeast prepared as below, 5 mm DTT, 70 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.2), and 25 μm asialofetuin glycopeptide I. Incubation was at 25 °C for 16 h. Quantitation of radioactivity was carried out by using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that cleaved 1 μmol of asialofetuin glycopeptide I/h. Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity and amidase activity, which act upon GlcNAc-peptide, were also assayed as described previously (21Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells in a 10-ml culture grown to a total A600 of 50–60 (A600/ml of 5–6) as described above were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet (200 μl) was resuspended in a 1.5-ml polyethylene tube with 300 μl of chilled B88 buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.8), 150 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 250 mmsorbitol) with various protease inhibitors (aprotinin (Sigma), 2 μg/ml; leupeptin, (Sigma) 2 μg/ml; antipain hydrochloride (Sigma), 4 μg/ml; benzamidine hydrochloride (Sigma), 20 μg/ml) and 4 mm DTT. Glass beads (0.5-mm diameter; 0.3 g) were added, and the cells were lysed by 4 × 15-s periods of agitation in a Fisher Vortex Genie 2 vortex mixer at full speed. Then the samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) on an aliquot of the cell extract taken prior to addition of DTT. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. To study the effect of pH on activity the cell extract (2 μl, 20 μg of protein) and 2 μl of asialofetuin glycopeptide (75 μm) were added to 2 μl of 400 mm Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 5.0–7.0) or Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.6–8.4) containing 10 mm DTT and incubated at 25 °C for 16 h. The molarity of the reaction mixtures was adjusted to 0.17 m by addition of NaCl. For substrate specificity studies fetuin glycopeptide I, asialofetuin glycopeptide I, or ovalbumin high mannose-type glycopeptide (25 μm each) was added to the reaction mixture and assayed for PNGase activity as described above. The Km value for PNGase was determined using asialofetuin glycopeptide I as the substrate. Stationary phase yeast cells (total A600 of 140) were used. Preparation of spheroplasts was carried out by zymolyase digestion (Zymolyase-100T; ICN) as described (23Dunn B. Wobbe R.C. Ausubwl F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 13.13.1-13.13.9Google Scholar), and the spheroplasts were lysed in 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) with 4 mm DTT and various protease inhibitors as described above. The extract thus obtained was clarified by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman) for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in B88 buffer, including 4 mm DTT with or without 2.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Both the 55,000 rpm supernatant and pellet fractions were assayed for PNGase as described above. Cells in YPAD medium (200 ml) were grown in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask, and theA600 was measured every 2 h fromA600/ml of 0.137 to 4.6. Cells (totalA600 of 5.0) were collected, and cell extract was prepared as described above except that glass beads and buffer added for extraction were one-third of that described above. A known tripeptide substrate for oligosaccharyl transferase, [3H]acetyl-Asn-BPhe-Thr-amide (10.6 μCi/nmol), where BPhe representsp-benzoylphenylalanine, was kindly provided by Qi Yan, SUNY at Stony Brook. Glycosylation of the peptide by yeast microsomes was carried out as described earlier (24Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the reaction product in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was applied to a ConA-agarose column (Sigma; 0.9 × 1.2 cm) equilibrated with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 0.1 mm MgCl2. Equilibration buffer was used to elute the fraction that did not bind. Subsequently, the ConA-agarose beads containing bound peptide were mixed with a solution of 0.5 m α-methylmannoside in equilibration buffer stirred well with a Pasteur pipette and eluted with the same buffer. The purified glycopeptide thus obtained was desalted by passage through a Sep-Pak Light cartridge (Waters/Millipore), eluted with 60% acetonitrile, and evaporated to dryness. Authentic deglycosylated peptide was prepared either by digestion of glycopeptide (20,000 dpm) with 1 unit of PNGase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) or 5 milliunits of Endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) in 20 μl of 50 mm Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 2 h, respectively. Unglycosylated peptide, glycopeptide, PNGase F-deglycosylated peptide, and Endo H-deglycosylated peptides were subjected to paper chromatography (see TableI). The RF of each compound was determined after measuring the radioactivity by liquid scintillation counter. For additional characterization, the binding of each reference sample to a 1.0-ml anionic column (HiTrap Q, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in 0.1% acetonitrile (v/v) was examined. The isolated purified glycopeptide (20,000 dpm) also was digested with yeast cytosol (100 μg of protein) prepared by zymolyase treatment as described above, incubated for 24 h at 25 °C, and the reaction product was analyzed using the same analytical methods.Table IChromatographic characterization of product of incubation of soluble fraction with [3 H]acetyl-Asn(CHO)-BPhe-Thr-amide(Glyco)peptide structureaAll peptides contained an acetyl group at their N terminus and an amide at their C terminus.RFvaluebRF values were determined by cutting 0.5-cm segments from the paper chromatogram extending from the origin to the solvent front (15 cm for Solvent A and 17 cm for Solvent B) and measuring the radioactivity in each.Anion exchange bindingeThe samples were applied to an anion exchange column and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% acetonitrile.Solvent AcSolvent A, 1-butanol/ethanol/H2O = 2/1/1 for 2.5 h.Solvent BdSolvent B, 1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O = 5/2/2 for 3.5 h.Unglycosylated peptideAsn-BPhe-Thr0.630.75NoGlycosylated peptideAsn(CHO)-BPhe-Thr0.0170.01NoPNGaseF-deglycosylated peptideAsp-BPhe-Thr0.520.76YesEndo H-deglycosylated peptideAsn(GlcNAc)-BPhe-Thr0.480.60NoReaction product from yeast cytosol0.500.75Yesa All peptides contained an acetyl group at their N terminus and an amide at their C terminus.b RF values were determined by cutting 0.5-cm segments from the paper chromatogram extending from the origin to the solvent front (15 cm for Solvent A and 17 cm for Solvent B) and measuring the radioactivity in each.c Solvent A, 1-butanol/ethanol/H2O = 2/1/1 for 2.5 h.d Solvent B, 1-butanol/acetic acid/H2O = 5/2/2 for 3.5 h.e The samples were applied to an anion exchange column and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% acetonitrile. Open table in a new tab Preparation of permeabilized spheroplasts in which the plasma membrane was disrupted but both cytosol and intracellular membrane vesicles remain intact was carried out as described earlier (25Baker D. Hicke L. Rexach M. Schleyer M. Schekman R. Cell. 1988; 54: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. A 300-ml culture in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask was grown until theA600/ml was 4.7. The cells were then harvested and digested with zymolyase as described (23Dunn B. Wobbe R.C. Ausubwl F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 13.13.1-13.13.9Google Scholar) and then incubated in 0.7m sorbitol, 0.75% bacto-yeast extract, 1.5% bacto-peptone, and 1% dextrose for 20 min at 25 °C. The cells were harvested, and cell pellet (6 ml) was resuspended to aA600 of 300/ml in B88 buffer containing 40 mm creatine phosphate (Boehringer Mannheim) and 10 mm DTT. The cells were then quickly frozen with liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C until use. A reaction mixture of 0.5 ml of the permeabilized cells with [3H]acetyl-Asn-BPhe-Thr-amide (6 × 106dpm; 260 pmol) contained 1 mm ATP (Sigma), 50 μm GDP-Man (Sigma), and 0.2 mg/ml creatine phosphate kinase (Boehringer Mannheim). Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 ml of stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem) containing 0.25 ml of ConA-agarose), and the glycosylated peptide was recovered on the ConA-agarose beads (24Roos J. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fraction that did not bind to ConA-agarose (unglycosylated and deglycosylated peptide) was desalted by using a Sep-Pak Light cartridge, evaporated to dryness, and then passed over a Q-Sepharose HiTrap ion exchange column as described above. Unglycosylated peptide, [3H]acetyl-Asn-BPhe-Thr-amide, was recovered in the flow-through fraction. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer until the elute contained below 100 dpm/0.5 ml. The deglycosylated peptide, [3H]acetyl-Asp-BPhe-Thr-amide, was recovered by elution with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 6% acetonitrile. Radioactivity was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. To study the effect of tunicamycin on product formation, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml of tunicamycin for 60 min just before the preparation of the permeabilized spheroplasts. The same concentration of tunicamycin was also added to the special medium used for preparation of permeabilized cells. At the time of assay forN-glycosylation/de-N-glycosylation, 50 ng/ml tunicamycin was also added in the reaction mixture to prevent the synthesis of any dolichol-PP-oligosaccharide during this time. Previously, a highly sensitive PNGase assay method was established using [14C]asialofetuin glycopeptide I as a substrate (11Kitajima K. Suzuki T. Kouchi Z. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This method is based on a kinetic comparison of glycan release from glycopeptide (detected by paper chromatography) and the introduction of negative charge on the core peptide resulting from conversion of Asn into Asp (confirmed by paper electrophoresis). Only when these two occur at the same rate can we conclude that the observed activity is that of PNGase. Although it was reported that PNGase activity could not be detected in yeast (19Römisch K. Ali B.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), using the above mentioned assay method we detected this activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W303-1a, as well as in a variety of other strains. 2Strains used are as follows: PS593 (MATα leu2 ura3 trp1 his3), A364A (MATa ade1 his7 lys2 tyr1 ura1 gal1-1), L40 (MATa ade2-leu2 his3 trp1 LYS2::lexAop-HIS3 URA3::lexAop-lacZ), and Y153 (MATa ade2 leu2 his3 trp1 gal4 gal80 LYS2::UASG -HIS3 URA3::UASG lacZ). With both methods, the product migrated with a mobility that was identical to the authentic Asp-containing peptide prepared by PNGase F digestion of the starting glycopeptide (not shown). On the other hand, we could detect neither endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity nor amidase activity, which could act upon GlcNAc-peptide, thereby giving rise to a product identical to deglycosylated product formed PNGase. The absence of detectable activity for these enzymes clearly excludes the possibility that the deglycosylation occurred in two steps as follows: (-Asn(CHO)-Xaa-Ser- → -Asn(GlcNAc)-Xaa-Ser- → -Asp-Xaa-Ser-). The pH optimum of the yeast enzyme was determined to be 6.6 using Mes buffer and 7.0 using Hepes buffer, which is similar to that reported for the animal enzyme (10Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1124-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Kitajima K. Suzuki T. Kouchi Z. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Arch. Biochem.

Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the animal enzymes (11Kitajima K. Suzuki T. Kouchi Z. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 15181-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the yeast enzyme required DTT for activity and was inhibited by NEM. The yeast enzyme exhibited maximal activity at 37 °C after 1–3 h, but over a longer course of time the enzyme was unstable at temperatures above 30 °C (not shown). Since no decrease in activity was observed at 25 °C for up to 24 h, we routinely used this temperature for assay conditions. Unlike commercially available bacterial PNGase F and almond PNGase A, the mouse L-929 cell line PNGase does not efficiently cleave sialylated glycopeptides (26Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15181-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar to L-929 PNGase, the yeast enzyme showed lower activity (36%) toward the sialylated fetuin glycopeptide I compared with asialoglycopeptide I. The yeast PNGase showed higher activity (160%) toward high mannose-type glycopeptide, but no activity toward high mannose-type glycoasparagine, suggesting that the peptide length of the substrate is critical for enzyme activity. This property has been described for all PNGases examined (1Takahashi N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. CRC Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 183-198Google Scholar, 2Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1993; 5: 163-170Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 3Suzuki T. Kitajima K.

TheKm value for the asialofetuin glycopeptide I substrate was 200 μm, which is comparable with that of PNGase from animals (21Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wang L.-X. Tang M. Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Fan J.-Q. Lee Y.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11137-11146Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PNGase activity was not detected in spent growth medium. This suggests that either the PNGase is not secreted or upon secretion it is extremely labile. Assays of the cytosol (soluble) and membrane (pellet) fractions prepared by lysis of zymolyase-generated spheroplasts revealed that 94% of the PNGase activity was recovered in the cytosol fraction. In contrast, when the activity of oligosaccharyl transferase, an ER resident enzyme, was assayed in both fractions, 91% of the activity was recovered in the pellet fraction, whereas no activity was detected in the cytosol fraction. These results were consistent with other studies using animal cells (10Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1124-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Kitajima K. Suzuki T. Kouchi Z. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although we do not exclude the possibility that inside the cells the enzyme is associated with fragile vesicular structures that are lysed during spheroplast lysis. The low level of activity found in the particulate fraction was enhanced 2.0-fold in the presence of 0.8% Tween 80. It is unknown if this apparent activation is due to lysis of a membrane vesicle-associated PNGase of the type reported in rat liver (29Weng S. Spiro R.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or is the result of the release of soluble PNGase entrapped in the crude membrane pellet. In any case, it is clear that after cell breakage and centrifugation the yeast enzyme exhibits a subcellular distribution similar to that observed in animal cells, although the precise localization of the neutral PNGase within the yeast cell remains to be determined. PNGase activity could barely be detected in the crude lysates of log phase cells but dramatically increased at stationary phase (Fig.1). This finding leads us to speculate that this enzyme activity may be involved in stabilizing cells in stationary phase, a stress condition (30Ruis H. Schuller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Of course, we cannot yet be certain if the enzyme in stationary phase and the low activity detected that in growth phase is due to the same protein. In this connection, it is intriguing that recently a second, soluble neutral PNGase was identified in log phase of L-929 cells (31Chang T. Suzuki T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. FASEB J. 1997; 11: A1247Google Scholar). This second enzyme had properties that differed from the earlier identified L-929 PNGase purified from confluent cells (21Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, like in mammalian cells, glycopeptides do not exit from the ER via a conventional vesicular transport mechanism, but instead are released from the ER into the cytosol (19Römisch K. Ali B.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Römisch K. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7227-7231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since we detected PNGase in yeast in the soluble fraction, we hypothesized that the glycosylated peptide, once it exited from the ER into the yeast cytosol, might be degraded by the action of this soluble PNGase and thereby be converted to deglycosylated peptide. To investigate this possibility, we first prepared the labeled glycopeptide [3H]acetyl-Asn(CHO)-BPhe-Thr-amide by incubation of the corresponding peptide with crude lysate. The glycopeptide formed was isolated and tested as a substrate for the PNGase in the yeast-soluble (cytosol) fraction. The peptide formed in the yeast cytosol was shown to be distinct from the unglycosylated peptide, [3H]acetyl-Asn-BPhe-Thr-amide, and from the Endo H-deglycosylated GlcNAc-peptide, [3H]acetyl-Asn(GlcNAc)-BPhe-Thr-amide, as judged by paper chromatography (Table I). In contrast, in both paper chromatography systems the reaction product had a mobility virtually identical to that of the authentic PNGase F-deglycosylated peptide, [3H]acetyl-Asp-BPhe-Thr-amide. This indication that the product was formed by the action of PNGase was further confirmed by its binding to an anion exchange column (Q-Sepharose), indicating that the peptide formed was negatively charged, as expected upon conversion of the Asn into an Asp residue. Neither the starting peptide nor the glycopeptide formed bound to Q-Sepharose. Moreover, the migration position of the reaction product after incubation with yeast cytosol was identical to that purified with authentic PNGase F-deglycosylated peptide (not shown). No deamidation product of the C-terminal amide group was detected on paper electrophoresis when the starting peptide was incubated with cytosol for 24 h. These results established that the glycopeptide is a substrate of yeast PNGase in the cytosol. After 24-h incubation at 25 °C, 79% of the glycopeptide was deglycosylated by yeast PNGase. Under the incubation conditions used, we could not detect any Endo H-like enzyme action on the glycotripeptide judging from paper chromatography in solvent B (not shown). Next, we asked if sequential glycosylation of peptide in the ER followed by deglycosylation in the cytosol could be detected in permeabilized yeast spheroplasts supplemented with an ATP generating system. After addition of the peptide substrate for glycosylation by oligosaccharyl transferase in the ER, aliquots of the incubation mixture were removed at various times, and the radioactivity in three fractions, glycosylated, unglycosylated, and deglycosylated peptide, was determined after the fractions were separated from each other by using ConA-agarose and Q-Sepharose. As shown in Fig.2 (solid line), over the 2-h time course the amount of labeled peptide rapidly decreased and the amount of labeled glycopeptide rapidly increased up to 60 min, after which time the level barely changed. The deglycosylated peptide appeared at a slower rate, comparable with that expected from the in vitrodeglycosylation (79% conversion at 24-h incubation; see above). When the pool of oligosaccharide-PP-dolichol was depleted by treatment of cells with tunicamycin, the formation of both glycosylated and deglycosylated peptide was inhibited (Fig. 2, dashed line). When 5 mm NEM was added instead of 10 mm DTT, the formation of deglycosylated peptide wascompletely inhibited. Although the glycosylation was also inhibited to a lesser extent (one-third of control level after incubation for 2 h), the amount of glycosylated peptide increased progressively up to this time point. PNGase is involved in quality control of newly synthesized glycoproteins and the production of free oligomannosides from both glycoproteins and glycopeptides in mammalian or avian (12Suzuki T.

McCracken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 17Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we asked if PNGase might participate in this degradation process. Formation of free oligosaccharides has been reported to occur in yeast (33Bélard M. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar), but this was considered to be the result of hydrolysis of the dolichol-linked biosynthetic intermediates in theN-glycosylation of proteins; there has been no evidence reporting the degradation of glycoprotein/glycopeptides as a source of free oligosaccharides in yeast. We have found a soluble neutral PNGase in S. cerevisiae, which indicates that this enzyme is distributed over the entire range of eukaryotes from fungi to mammals. So far PNGases from a bacterium and a fungus have been cloned and sequenced (34Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Trumble A. Changchien L.-M. Duceman B. Maley F. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol.

Upon examination of the sequences in the S. cerevisiae genome data base no homology between these proteins and proteins in yeast could be detected. This enzyme activity is induced to a high level only in stationary phase cells. In other experiments (data not shown) the level of the activity was shown to be further elevated by various stress conditions, such as incubation with tunicamycin to block glycosylation or with DTT to inhibit disulfide bond formation in proteins. Since it has been shown that these stresses bring about protein unfolding and activation of molecular chaperones both in the cytosol and the ER (30Ruis H. Schuller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 36Kohno K. Normington K. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. Mori K. Mol. Cell.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we speculate that this neutral PNGase may function in a quality control system for newly synthesized glycoproteins in yeast. Presumably it would do this by deglycosylating newly formed glycoproteins that did not fold correctly and were exported from its site of synthesis with ER to the cytosol. To test this idea we utilized a glycosylatable hydrophobic peptide that is readily taken up into the ER and permeabilized yeast spheroplasts that retain their cytosol, as well as their internal organelles. The results indicated that the glycosylatable peptide was formed and then processed with kinetics in accord with the sequence of events shown in Scheme I. The reactions actually measured kinetically were the glycosylation step, which requires prior translocation into the ER, the site of action of oligosaccharyl transferase (18Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the de-N-glycosylation, which we expect to occur in the cytosol, because we have tentatively identified this to be the site of PNGase. Formation of the deglycosylated peptide was found to require prior glycosylation, since tunicamycin treatment, which inhibitsN-glycosylation, also abolished formation of the deglycosylated peptide. If these reactions with peptides are a valid model for what happens with unfolded glycoproteins, we speculate that yeast may have a catabolic system analogous to that found in mammalian cells (18Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the future, we plan to study the structure of the yeast PNGase in detail and to test its postulated function in glycoprotein degradation. T. S. thanks Profs.

https://openalex.org/W1971596285,"PAX6 is a transcription factor with two DNA-binding domains (paired box and homeobox) and a proline-serine-threonine (PST)-rich transactivation domain. PAX6 regulates eye development in animals ranging from jellyfish toDrosophila to humans. Heterozygous mutations in the humanPAX6 gene result in various phenotypes, including aniridia, Peter's anomaly, autosomal dominant keratitis, and familial foveal dysplasia. It is believed that the mutated allele ofPAX6 produces an inactive protein and aniridia is caused due to genetic haploinsufficiency. However, several truncation mutations have been found to occur in the C-terminal half ofPAX6 in patients with Aniridia resulting in mutant proteins that retain the DNA-binding domains but have lost most of the transactivation domain. It is not clear whether such mutants really behave as loss-of-function mutants as predicted by haploinsufficiency. Contrary to this theory, our data showed that these mutants are dominant-negative in transient transfection assays when they are coexpressed with wild-type PAX6. We found that the dominant-negative effects result from the enhanced DNA binding ability of these mutants. Kinetic studies of binding and dissociation revealed that various truncation mutants have 3–5-fold higher affinity to various DNA-binding sites when compared with the wild-type PAX6. These results provide a new insight into the role of mutant PAX6 in causing aniridia.

PAX6 is an evolutionarily conserved gene that regulates the development of the eye in animals ranging from jellyfish toDrosophila to humans (for review, see Ref. 1Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The induction of ectopic compound eyes by overexpressing mouse and squidPax6 (2Halder G. Callaerts P. Gehring W.J.

A. 1997; 94: 2421-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) clearly indicates that not only is the structure of PAX6 conserved but also its biochemical properties are conserved. Recent reports have shown that PAX6 is also involved in pancreas development (4Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 5St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chaowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Like other members of the PAX family, PAX6 functions as a transcriptional activator. Structural analysis of PAX6 has identified two DNA-binding domains (a paired domain at the N terminus and a paired like homeodomain in the middle), a glycine-rich hinge region that links the two DNA-binding domains, and a proline-serine-threonine-rich (PST) transactivation domain at the C terminus. Our recent studies designed to characterize the transactivation domain revealed that the four exons, which constitute the PST domain, synergistically stimulate transcriptional activation and that the transactivation potential is not localized but distributed throughout the PST domain (6Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The transcription factors of the PAX family recognize their target genes via the DNA binding function of the paired domain (7Chalepakis G. Wijnholds J. Giese P. Schachner M. Gruss P.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 444-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) indicated that several genes could also be regulated through the homeodomain of PAX6. Mutations in PAX6 genes are responsible for several naturally occurring mutant phenotypes including aniridia in humans (12Glaser T. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Nat.

Science. 1994; 265: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The human and murine PAX6 proteins have an identical amino acid sequence (23Walthers C. Gruss P.

Mutations in PAX6 result in semidominant phenotypes,i.e. heterozygous mutations cause aniridia in humans and small-eye in rodents, while homozygous mutations lead to severe brain abnormalities, microencephaly, and early postnatal death with no eyes and no nose in rodents (20Matsuo T.

Genet. 1994; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In addition, mice with heterozygous mutations in PAX6 have lower levels of pancreatic hormones (4Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J. Ee H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). A haploinsufficiency mechanism has been postulated for the heterozygous phenotype. According to this theory, the function of the protein product of the mutant allele is lost and the normal PAX6 protein produced by the wild-type allele does not reach the threshold level necessary for normal eye development (1Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The mutation spectrum of PAX6 observed inaniridia and small-eye includes large deletions as well as intragenic mutations (1Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 26Prosser J. van Heyningen V. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 27Glaser T. Walton D.S.

Human Mutat. 1998; : S207-S208Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Most intragenic mutations result in truncations of the PAX6 protein; only four of the detected mutants are due to missense mutations, one that affects the nuclear translocation signal (15Hanson I.M.

Lyons L.A. Saunders G.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 801-811PubMed Google Scholar) and three that affect the paired DNA-binding domain (28Hanson I.M. Fletcher J.M. Jordan T. Brown A. Taylor D.

The loss of function in the mutant PAX6 proteins that have lost the DNA binding can be clearly explained. What is not clear is the role of truncated PAX6 proteins that arise due to certain mutations that occur at the C-terminal region ofPAX6 and result in mutants that (i) lack all or part of the PST domain but retain both DNA-binding domains or (ii) lack all of the PST domain and part of the homeodomain but retain the paired-box DNA-binding domain (1Callaerts P.

Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 51-82Google Scholar). In the study reported here, we demonstrate that these mutants are not simple loss-of-function mutants or unstable mutants. On the contrary, they have gained a stronger DNA-binding capacity, and since they lack most of the transactivation activity, thereby function as dominant-negative repressors. Surprisingly, we found that all those mutants with intact DNA-binding domains were able to repress the wild-type PAX6 activity by binding to the target site with a higher affinity than wild-type protein.

Primers used to amplify specific regions of PAX6 are listed in Table I. All the C-terminal deletion constructs used a common 5′ primer containing a HindIII restriction site and a Kozak consensus sequence for translational initiation (PAX6(1–422)). The 3′ primers differed in sequence, but all contained an SpeI restriction site and a stop codon. Endonuclease digestion with SpeI and XbaI generated compatible cohesive ends.

Transfections for all cells were performed with plasmid DNA coated with the polycationic lipid LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected at 60–80% confluency using 15 μl (30 μg) of LipofectAMINE per 60-mm dish. HEB3 cells were transfected at 70–80% confluency using 6 μl (12 μg) of LipofectAMINE per 60-mm dish. For transfections with the pRc-CMV-PAX6 expression vectors, each 60-mm dish was transfected with 2 μg of CD19–2(A-ins)-luciferase (Czerny and Busslinger, 1995), 1 μg of pRc-CMV effector plasmid, and 0.4 μg of pSV2 β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega) as internal control. Cell extracts were prepared after 24–48 h of transfection. Luciferase activity was measured at room temperature using a luciferase assay kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Briefly, 50-μl aliquots of substrate A were placed into 75 × 12-mm luminometer sample tubes (Sarstedt). Then, 10 μl of individual cell extracts and 50 μl of substrate B were added sequentially into the tubes, which were then placed immediately into a luminometer for measurement. The luminometer was set to measure the luciferase signal for 10 s with a 2-s delay. β-galactosidase activity was detected using a Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent assay kit (Tropix) according to manufacturer's protocol. The measurement protocol was the same as for the luciferase assay. Luciferase activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected HEB3 or NIH 3T3 cells according to the method of Schreiber et al. (32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W.

The protein concentration of each nuclear extract was measured by the Bradford assay and adjusted to equal protein concentration after dilution with the nuclear extraction buffer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in a 20-μl binding reaction incubated at room temperature for 30 min in a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl) (33Singh S.

Each binding reaction contained 0.25 to 1 μg of nuclear extracts, 1–3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 16–100 fmol of probes labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probes on a 4.5 or 6% native polyacrylamide gel using a buffer containing 50 mmTris, 200 mm glycine, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA.

Haploinsufficiency diseases such as aniridia and small-eye usually result from heterozygous mutations in which a mutant null allele coexists with a wild-type allele. In some cases, competition between the protein products of the mutant allele and the wild-type allele may result in phenotypic variability. PAX6 strongly activates transcription of the CD19-luc reporter, whereas most mutant PAX6 proteins with truncated PST domains have less than 30% of the wild-type activity (Figs. 2 A and 6). Since such mutant PAX6 proteins retain the paired domain, they may compete for target binding sites with the wild-type PAX6. To test this possibility in vivo, we co-transfected equal amounts of mutant and wild-type PAX6 expression plasmids (Fig. 1) with a CD19-luc reporter into NIH 3T3 cells, and then assessed the combined transactivation potential of mutant and wild-type PAX6 (Fig.2, A and B). Interestingly, all mutant PAX6 proteins with truncations in the PST domain repressed the wild-type PAX6 activity (Fig. 2, A andB). However, the missense mutants PAX6 (I87R) and PAX6 (R26G), which lose their DNA binding ability through the paired domain (30Tang H.K. Chao L. Saunders G.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), did not repress the activity of wild-type PAX6. The repression by truncation mutants was much stronger than expected from a simple competition for DNA-binding sites of the wild-type and mutant PAX6 proteins and suggested that mutant PAX6 had dominant-negative effects.Figure 6Kinetic analysis of CD19–2(A-ins)-binding site to increasing amounts of PAX6 and truncation mutants. Fold differences in KD value between wild-type and truncated (mutant) PAX6 proteins. Since PAX6 binds DNA as monomer through its paired domain we calculated the fold difference inKD values using the following formula: Dis DNA, P is wild-type protein, and Pm is mutant protein: KDW/KDM = ([P][D]/[PD]) × ([PM D]/[PM][D]). At any point in the log phase of reaction where amount of probe and protein used were same: KDW/KDM = [PD]/PM D]. Increasing concentrations of wild-type and mutant proteins were individually incubated at the indicated concentrations with the32P-labeled probe as described under “Materials and Methods.” The protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA by gel electrophoresis and the amount of free DNA and protein-DNA complexes were quantitated using a PhosphorImager and Image Quant program as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data shown is mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Schematic diagram of wild-type and mutant PAX6 expression constructs.

We analyzed the DNA binding properties of the nuclear extracts prepared from NIH 3T3 cells co-transfected with mutant and wild-type PAX6 expression vectors. The wild-type PAX6 showed binding to the CD19–2(A-ins) probe (Fig.2 C, lane 2). In the presence of mutant PAX6, however, the wild-type PAX6 showed very weak DNA binding, whereas mutant PAX6 showed strong DNA binding (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3–6). No intermediate complex was detected between the wild-type and mutant PAX6-DNA complexes, suggesting that both mutant and wild-type PAX6 bound DNA as monomers. Assuming that both the mutant and wild-type PAX6 proteins accumulated in nuclei at comparable levels, the simplest model for the dominant repression effect of the mutants would be that deletion of the PST domain resulted in increased DNA binding ability of mutant PAX6. The same nuclear extracts used in the EMSA were assessed for expression of wild-type and mutant PAX6 proteins by Western blotting using an immune serum raised against Escherichia coli-produced recombinant PAX6 (16–422). As expected, the wild-type PAX6 protein was detected at constant levels in extracts transfected with wild-typePAX6 alone or co-transfected with wild-type and mutantPAX6 (data not shown), indicating that the reduction in DNA binding of wild-type PAX6 was due to the competition for DNA-binding sites by the mutant PAX6 rather than a reduction in protein level. Although the antibody used cannot quantitatively detect each mutant PAX6 protein because it was raised against the PAX6 with an intact PST domain, the mutant proteins had accumulated in sufficient amounts to be detected by the polyclonal antibody and EMSA. It is also possible that the mutant proteins were expressed in much higher quantity than the wild type, and therefore showed higher binding. However, later experiments shown in Figs. 5, A-C, 7, and 8 revealed that this was not the reason for lower PAX6 binding.Figure 7Dissociation analysis of complex of PAX6 or truncation mutants with CD19–2(A-ins)-binding site by increasing amounts of unlabeled binding sites. Using a fixed amount of either wild type or mutant (A) PAX6(1–317), (B) PAX6(1–353) protein and radiolabeled probe and increasing amounts of unlabeled oligonucleotides an EMSA was performed. Scatchard plots generated by plotting the ratio of bound labeled oligonucleotides to total labeled nucleotides versus amount of total oligonucleotides are shown. The trend lines were generated using “Microsoft Excel 97” of Microsoft to calculate the slope. The slope of trend line indicates the difference in affinities of wild-type and mutant proteins.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells transfected with either a single plasmid of the wild-type PAX6, mutant PAX6(1–344), mutant PAX6(4V/G), or an equimolar mixture of wild-type PAX6 and mutant PAX6(1–344) plasmids. Since missense mutations have not been detected in aniridia patients, mutant PAX6(4V/G) was generated to find out the possible effect of missense mutations. This mutant did not show any significant difference in the transactivation potential nor on DNA binding (6Tang H.K. Singh S. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7210-7221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Protein expression of transfected mutant and wild-type PAX6was detected by the polyclonal antibody against the paired domain (data not shown). The protein-DNA complexes formed by the binding of each nuclear extract to the CD19–2(A-ins) probe (Fig.3 A, lanes 3, 7, 11, and15) were efficiently ablated by adding either a 100-fold excess of unlabeled CD19–2(A-ins) probe (Fig. 3 A, lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16) or polyclonal antibody against PAX6 (aa 16–422) (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5, 9, 13, and 17), but not by adding the nonspecific antibody (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6, 10, 14, and 18). Addition of the anti-PAX6 antibody also resulted in supershifting of the protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5, 9, 13, and 17). Interestingly, the DNA-PAX6(1–344) complex was ablated less efficiently by the specific oligonucleotide and antibody than was the wild-type PAX6-DNA complex (Fig. 3 A, lanes 16 and 17), consistent with our finding that the DNA binding ability of the mutant PAX6(1–344) was stronger than that of the wild-type P"

Activation of the enzyme by calmodulin (CaM) also allows CaMKI to be phosphorylated and activated by a second enzyme, CaMK kinase (CaMKK). To more thoroughly characterize the regulation of CaMKI by CaM and its interrelationship with phosphorylation by CaMKK, we have carried out a detailed structure-function analysis using recombinant wild-type (WT) and mutant forms of CaMKI and CaMKK. CaMKI-WT, in the absence of CaM, or CaMKI-299 and CaMKI-298 were autoinhibited and could not be phosphorylated by CaMKK-433 (a truncated constitutively active form of CaMKK). Removal of Phe298(CaMK-297) generated a constitutively active form of CaMKI that was also phosphorylated by CaMKK-433. CaMKI-WT was essentially inactive in the absence of CaM (K0.5 for activation by CaM ∼30 nm). Mutation of Ile294 and Phe298 to alanine (CaMKI-2A) resulted in measurable basal enzyme activity. Additional mutation of Ile286 and Val290 to alanine (CaMKI-4A) increased this basal activity. Mutation of Trp303 (CaMKI-W303S) resulted in a large increase in the K0.5 for CaM (∼100 μm), supporting a role for this residue as an initial target for CaM. Mutation of Phe307 (CaMKI-F307A) resulted in increased basal enzyme activity, supporting a role for this residue in autoinhibition of CaMKI.

CaMKI is a monomeric enzyme of ∼42 kDa that has widespread tissue distribution and that can phosphorylate a number of substrates including synapsin I, synapsin II (32Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F.

Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of a truncated autoinhibited fragment of CaMKI, the regulatory domain (residues Ile286-Met316) binds to the catalytic domain via an αR1-helix-loop-αR2-helix structure not observed in other protein kinases (28Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues in the αR1 helix interact with a hydrophobic channel on the surface of the COOH-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain. Following αR1, the regulatory domain does not enter the active site, but instead turns away to form a protuberant loop (residues 300–304) that includes Trp303. The αR2 helix (residues 305–316) then unexpectedly interacts with the outside of the ATP-binding loop in the NH2-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain, resulting in a striking distortion of this loop. Thus the regulatory domain of CaMKI forms multiple interactions with the catalytic domain that appear likely to interfere with both peptide substrate and MgATP binding. In addition to their regulation by CaM, CaMKI and CaMKIV are activated by phosphorylation by a highly specific CaMKK at an equivalent threonine (Thr177 in CaMKI) in the so-called “activation-” or “T-loop”, present near the active site of both kinases (7DeRemer M.F.

CaMKK must bind to CaM to be active. In addition, CaMKK cannot phosphorylate Thr177 of CaMKI unless CaM is bound to the substrate enzyme (10Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G.

Notably, in the structure of the autoinhibited form of CaMKI, the activation loop, although disordered, appears to be accessible (28Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CaMKI has suggested a general model of autoinhibition of enzyme activity. To address the function played by specific amino acids in the autoinhibition of CaMKI, and also in its activation by CaM and phosphorylation by CaMKK, we have carried out a detailed structure-function analysis of the regulation of CaMKI, using recombinant wild-type and mutants forms of CaMKI and CaMKK. The results obtained from these enzymatic studies of full-length CaMKI, together with the crystal structure of the autoinhibited enzyme, provide a detailed model for the regulation of this enzyme by CaM and phosphorylation. ATP, Nonidet P-40, dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol, EDTA, EGTA, Tris, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, SDS, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. HEPES, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Calbiochem. [γ32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Thin layer cellulose sheets were from Eastman Kodak.

The peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, were >95% pure as analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, and had the expected amino acid composition and mass spectra. PC12 mRNA was reverse-transcribed with 10 pmol of random mix primers using an RT-PCR kit (Stratagene). The following oligonucleotides (Operon) were synthesized. Oligo KK-1S corresponded to cDNA encoding rat CaMKKα and introduced a BamHI site. Oligo KK-505AS corresponded to the complement of rat CaMKK and introduced an EcoRI site. PCR was performed using: KK-1S (5′-CCCGGATCCATGGAGCGCAGTCCAGCCGTC-3′) and KK-505AS (5′-CCCGAATTCTCAGGATGCAGCCTCATCTTC-3′) using the following conditions: 30 cycles 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified product was purified using an agarose electrophoresis gel purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen). CaMKK cDNA and all other deletion or substitution constructs were sequenced by the Rockefeller University DNA sequence Facility. The following oligonucleotides (Operon) were synthesized: KK-433AS (5′-CCCGAATTCTCACTCCTCCTCAGTCACCTC-3′), KK-444AS (5′-CCCGAATTCTCACCAGCTGGGGATGAGCTT-3′), and KK-457AS (5′-CCCGAATTCTCAACGCTTTCTCAGCATAGA-3′). Oligo KK-433AS, KK-444AS, and KK-457AS correspond to the complements of the coding strand and introduced EcoRI sites. Each deletion mutant was amplified by PCR using the respective primers together with the KK-1S oligonucleotide from 10 ng of CaMKK cDNA usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). The amplified DNAs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and the fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a ligation kit (Takara Shuzo) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. CaMKI-299 plasmids and CaMKI-293 were prepared as described (27Yokokura H. Picciotto M.R. Nairn A.C. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23851-23859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides (Operon) were synthesized: KI-1S (5′-CCCGGATCCATGCCAGGGGCAGTGGAAGGCCCC-3′), KI-297AS (5′-CCCGAATTCCTAGTTCTTCTTGATCTGCTCACT-3′), and KI-298AS (5′-CCCGAATTCCTAAAAGTTCTTCTTGATCTGCTC-3′). Oligo KI-1S corresponded to cDNA encoding rat CaMKI and introduced a BamHI site. Oligo KI-297AS and KI-298AS corresponded to the complements of the coding strand and introduced EcoRI sites. PCR reactions were performed using pGEX-2T/CaMKI-WT as a template, and the fragments were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T as described above. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a Quickchange kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. pGEX-2T/CaMKI-WT was used as a template together with the following sense (S) and antisense (AS) primers (mutated bases are underlined): KI-W303S-S (5′-GGAAGCTTGCTTCGACTTGCTCTTGGC), KI-W303S-AS (5′-GCCAGGAGCAAGTCGAAGCAAGCTTCC), KI-F307A-S (5′-TGGAAGCAAGCTGCCAATGCTACCGCT), KI-F307A-AS (5′-AGCGGTAGCATTGGCAGCTTGCTTCCA), KI-2A-S (5′-AGTGAGCAGGCCAAGAAGAACGCTGCCAAGAGC), and KI-2A-AS (5′-GCTCTTGGCAGCGTTCTTCTTGGCCTGCTCACT). For the CaMKI-4A mutant, pGEX-2T/CaMKI-2A served as the template, and the following primers were used: KI-4A-S (5′-GATAAGAATGCCCACCAGTCAGCCAGTGAGCAG), and KI-4A-AS (5′-CTGCTCACTGGCTGACTGGTGGGCATTCTTATC). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 16 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min and 68 °C for 12 min. The reaction mixtures were digested with DpnI for 1 h, then 1 μl of digested samples were transfected into XL1 blue Escherichia coli. BL21 (DE3) cells containing each expression plasmid were grown overnight at 37 °C in 100 ml of LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin. 1 liter of LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 100 ml of the overnight culture and incubated at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration 0.3 mm, and each culture was incubated for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin. All further steps were carried out at 4 °C. Nonidet P-40 and MgCl2were added to a final concentration of 0.5% and 5 mm,respectively, cells were lysed using a French press, and lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were recovered and applied to a column of glutathione-Sepharose-4B (10 ml wet volume) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The column was washed extensively with equilibration buffer and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 5 mm glutathione. Fractions were collected, and protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Fractions containing expressed protein were pooled and dialyzed against equilibration buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Glycerol was added to 20% (v/v), and aliquots were stored in −80 °C. An antibody was prepared against a synthetic peptide encompassing residues 10–29 of CaMKKα (QDPRAELVERVAAISVAHLE) (15Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Purified peptide was coupled to bovine thyroglobulin using glutaraldehyde. Antisera CC135 was prepared in New Zealand White rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. The synthetic peptide was coupled to activated CH-Sepharose beads and used to affinity-purify the sera essentially as described (37Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Bertuzzi G. Nairn A.C. Synapse. 1995; 20: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmmagnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 2–5 × 102 cpm/pmol), 1 μm CaM, and 1.5 mm Ca2+. For studies of the phosphorylation of CaMKI or CaMKIV, the final concentrations of kinases in the standard reaction mixtures were: CaMKI, 10 μg/ml; CaMKIV, 10 μg/ml; and CaMKK, 5 μg/ml. After 2 min of preincubation at 30 °C, reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mβ-mercaptoethanol). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography or analysis using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For studies of the effect of phosphorylation on enzyme activity, recombinant CaMKI and CaMKIV (10 μg/ml) were preincubated in the absence or presence of CaMKK (2 μg/ml) for the indicated times at 30 °C under the conditions described above except that nonradioactive ATP was used. A 1/10 volume of each preincubation mixture was aliquoted into a second peptide phosphorylation assay using synapsin I site 1 peptide (100 μm) as substrate. Reactions were stopped by addition of acetic acid to a final concentration of 10%, and32P-incorporation into the peptide substrate was determined using a standard P-81 filter paper assay. For analysis of the CaM dependence of CaMKI and CaMKIV, enzyme activity was measured using the synapsin I site 1 peptide (100 μm) as substrate, and various concentrations of CaM as indicated. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described (32Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7273-7281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel pieces containing32P-labeled proteins were excised from dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels and digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (50 μg/ml). Tryptic digests were hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl, and phosphoamino acids were separated on thin layer cellulose sheets (20 × 20 cm) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in 8.7% acetic acid, 2.5% formic acid, followed by electrophoresis in the same direction at pH 3.5 in 10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine. Dried sheets were subjected to autoradiography. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the regulation of CaMKI by CaM and phosphorylation by CaMKK. For these studies, rat CaMKKα was cloned from PC12 cells by RT-PCR, and recombinant protein was expressed as a GST-fusion protein. CaMKKα was initially identified as an enzyme that could phosphorylate and activate CaMKIV (15Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 39Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 119: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKKα was found to phosphorylate CaMKI (15Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 40Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G.

We compared the ability of recombinant CaMKKα to phosphorylate and activate CaMKI and CaMKIV (Figs. 1 and2). CaMKI was phosphorylated essentially only on threonine, and CaMKIV was phosphorylated on both serine and threonine (Fig. 1 B). Notably, the total incorporation of32P into CaMKIV was much greater than that into CaMKI, but this higher phosphorylation resulted from increased serine phosphorylation, presumably as a result of autophosphorylation of activated CaMKIV (41Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of either CaMKI or CaMKIV by CaMKKα was associated with large increases in enzyme activity that paralleled the phosphorylation of threonine in both enzymes (Fig. 2). The rate of increase in threonine phosphorylation, as well as the fold-increase in kinase activity, was higher for CaMKI than for CaMKIV, suggesting that CaMKKα slightly prefers CaMKI as a substrate compared with CaMKIV.Figure 2Activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV by CaMKK. Recombinant CaMKI (A) or CaMKIV (B) were preincubated (10 μg/ml) in the absence (open symbols) or presence (closed symbols) of CaMKK (2 μg/ml) with Ca2+/CaM and MgATP for the indicated times. CaMKI or CaMKIV activity was then measured using synapsin site 1 peptide as substrate in a second incubation as described under “Experimental Procedures”. The data shown are the average of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CaMKKα, like other CaM kinases, contains putative autoinhibitory and CaM-binding domains following its catalytic domain (15Tokumitsu H.

It was necessary to define the positions of these regulatory subdomains for use in the studies described below. CaMKK-WT and several COOH-terminal truncations were expressed as recombinant proteins (Fig. 3,A and B). Enzyme activity was measured using CaMKI-293 or CaMKI-WT as a substrate in the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3 C and Fig.4).

https://openalex.org/W2017824230,"Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) are multisubunit complexes whose expression and targeting require the assembly of the pore-forming α1 with auxiliary β and α2/δ subunits. The developmentally regulated expression and differential assembly of β isoforms with the α1B subunit to form N-type VDCC suggested a unique role for the β4 isoform in VDCC maturation (Vance, C. L., Begg, C. M., Lee, W.-L., Haase, H., Copeland, T. D., and McEnery, M. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14495–14502). The focus of this study is the expression and assembly of α1B and β isoforms in the epileptic mouse, lethargic(lh/lh), a mutant anticipated to produce a truncated β4 subunit (Burgess, D. L., Jones, J. M., Meisler, M. H., and Noebels, J. L. (1997) Cell 88, 385–392). In this report, we demonstrate that neither full-length nor truncated β4 protein is expressed in lh/lh mice. The absence of β4 inlh/lh mice is associated with decreased expression of N-type VDCC in forebrain and cerebellum. The most surprising characteristic of the lh/lh mouse is increased expression of β1b protein. This result suggests a previously unidentified cellular mechanism wherein expression of the total pool of available β subunits is under tight metabolic regulation. As a consequence of increased β1b expression, the β1b is increased in its incorporation into α1B/β complexes relative to wild type. Thus, in striking similarity to the population of N-type VDCC present in immature rat brain, the population of N-type VDCC present in adultlh/lh mice is characterized by the absence of β4 with increased β1b expression and assembly into N-type VDCC. It is intriguing to speculate that the increased excitability and susceptibility to seizures observed in the lh/lhmouse arises from the inappropriate expression of an immature population of N-type VDCC throughout neuronal development.

There has been continued effort to determine the molecular origin of epileptic seizures with the objective of identifying new therapeutic strategies (1Hosford D.A. Wang Y. Epilepsia. 1997; 38: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has been directed to epileptic strains of animals that exhibit absence seizures with electrographic firing patterns, onset, localization, and drug response similar to humans (2Noebels J.L.

It is important to consider that although mutations in α1 have been demonstrated to alter the biophysical properties of the VDCC (7Kraus R.L. Sinnegger M.J. Glossmann H. Hering S. Striessnig J. J.

Importantly, thelh gene is anticipated to produce a truncated β4 protein that does not possess a consensus α1 binding domain that mediates α1/β interaction (14De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P.

There is little information available on the mechanisms that regulate the level of expression of β isoforms and their assembly with α1. Assembly of N-type VDCC subunits has been analyzed in several developing and differentiating systems (15McEnery M.W. Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.L. Choi Y. Dubel S.J. J. Bioenerg.

Expression of β isoforms is also highly regulated during rat brain ontogeny, with β1b increasing approximately 3-fold and β4 increasing 10-fold during the interval between postnatal day 2 (P2) and adult (17Vance C.L.

Postnatal assembly of β isoforms with α1B to form N-type VDCC indicated differential association of β isoforms in immature versusmature forebrain homogenates. β1b was the predominant β detected in assembled immature N-type VDCC at P2 (17Vance C.L.

Thus, differences in the β component of the N-type VDCC defined both an immature and a mature population of N-type VDCC (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol.

Although the significance of β heterogeneity has not been fully explored in vivo, these developmental studies suggested a unique role of β4 in N-type VDCC maturation. The lh/lh mouse offers the opportunity to study patterns of β isoform expression that occur in response to abnormal expression of β4. The focus of this study is the level of α1B and β subunit expression and assembly of N-type VDCC in the lh/lh mouse with emphasis upon identifying possible compensatory mechanisms that occur from altered β4 expression. Lethargic (B6EiC3H-a/A-lh) and wild-type mice (strain B6EiC3H) were obtained from Jackson Labs. All reagents were obtained from sources previously cited (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H.

Statistical analysis was performed by a paired t test or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test. pvalues less than 0.05 were considered significant. The lhgene mutation was anticipated to lead to truncation of β4 to an N-terminal fragment predicted to have a mass of 21 kDa (9Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Thelh mRNA was detected at levels 20% of the wild-type β4 message (9Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that the lhgene product may be expressed in lh/lh mice. Using β4-specific antibodies, we probed forebrain and cerebellar homogenates from lh/lh mice to evaluate the level of expression of full-length β4. In contrast to wild-type mice where we detected full-length β4 (62 kDa), there was no β4 detected in either forebrain or cerebellum from lh/lh mice (Fig.1). To further investigate expression of the lh gene product, we used an antibody (Ab CW24) raised to amino acids 53–70 in the β4 which are also present in all β isoforms (16McEnery M.W. Haase H. Vance C.L. Dubel S.J. Morano I. Copeland T.D. Choi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ab CW24 identified two populations of high (β1b and β2) and low (β3 and β4) molecular weight β isoforms previously characterized in rat brain (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The relative intensity of these bands clearly differed among the lh/lh versus wild-type mouse samples (Fig. 1). However, with the exception of 42–40-kDa proteolytic β fragments, there were no detectable Ab CW24-immunoreactive proteins that could be attributed to the predicted 21-kDa product of the lh gene in eitherlh/lh mouse forebrain or cerebellum. These results suggest that the lh mutation causes a complete loss of β4 protein. To investigate the pool of available β isoforms in forebrain and cerebellum of lh/lh and wild-type samples, the level of expression of all β isoforms was quantified using a pan-specific anti-β antibody (Ab CW24) and a panel of β isoform-specific antibodies. There are regional differences in expression of β isoforms with increased expression of all β isoforms (with the exception of the β4) in forebrain samples. Significantly, we observed differences in expression among specific β isoforms in lh/lh mice compared with wild-type mice. The level of expression of all β isoforms as detected by the anti-β pan-specific antibody is lower in lh/lh forebrain and cerebellum than in wild-type samples (Fig.2), indicating that the level of total β isoforms is not maintained in the lh/lh samples. In bothlh/lh forebrain (p < 0.001) and cerebellum (p < 0.05), the level of expression of β1b was increased compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2). In forebrain, the increase in β1b expression was greater than 50%. These results are consistent with our previous characterization of β1b as an inducible and regulated protein (16McEnery M.W. Haase H. Vance C.L. Dubel S.J. Morano I. Copeland T.D. Choi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, differences in the levels of expression of β2 and β3 in lh/lh versuswild-type mice were not statistically significant in either forebrain or cerebellar samples. The density of N-type VDCC has been previously shown to be higher in forebrain versus cerebellar samples (21Wagner J.A. Snowman A.M. Biswas A. Olivera B.M. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 3354-3359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Maeda N. Wada K. Yuzaki M. Mikoshiba K. Brain Res. 1989; 489: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Litzinger M.J. Mouritsen C.L. Grover B.B. Esplin M.S. Abbott J.R. J. Child Neurol. 1994; 9: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β4 is the predominant isoform associated with VDCC from cerebellum, and β3 is the predominant isoform associated with VDCC from forebrain (5Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A.

Therefore, these patterns of VDCC subunit expression suggested regional differences in acquisition of functional N-type VDCC in cerebellum and forebrain from lh/lh versus wild-type mice. Using125I-CTX radioligand binding assays and Scatchard analyses (18McEnery M.W. Snowman A.M. Sharp A.H. Adams M.E. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11095-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), we observed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in expression of N-type VDCC inlh/lh forebrain (1.49 ± 0.41 pmol/mg) compared with wild-type forebrain (2.70 ± 0.63 pmol/mg). There was a single125I-CTX binding site detected in the forebrain samples with Kd values of approximately 28 pmfor both the lh/lh and wild-type samples. The level of α1B expressed in forebrain samples was also quantified (Fig. 3) to examine possible discrepancies between expression of125I-CTX binding sites and α1B protein (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite the decrease in 125I-CTX binding sites inlh/lh forebrain, similar levels of α1B protein are expressed in forebrain of lh/lh and wild-type mice. These data strongly suggest that expression of α1Bprotein in forebrains of lh/lh mice is maintained at wild-type levels, while the assembly of α1B into a complex that can support 125I-CTX binding is compromised. The decreased expression of 125I-CTX binding sites inlh/lh forebrain (Fig. 3) may reflect the decreased availability of β (Fig. 2) required to traffic α1B to the plasma membrane (26Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We also observed decreased expression (p < 0.05) of125I-CTX binding sites in lh/lh cerebellum (0.32 ± 0.05 pmol/mg) compared with wild-type cerebellum (0.53 ± 0.10 pmol/mg). However, in contrast to the forebrain samples, radioligand binding experiments detected two125I-CTX binding sites in cerebellum. The high affinity site (Kd values of approximately 70 and 67 pm for the lh/lh and wild-type cerebellar samples, respectively) is characteristic of the N-type VDCC. The low affinity site for 125I-CTX detected in cerebellar samples is likely because of the low affinity binding of 125I-CTX for the P/Q-type VDCC (5Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13804-13810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and was not pursued further in these studies. In contrast to lh/lh forebrain, decreased α1Bprotein is expressed in lh/lh mouse cerebellum, suggesting that expression of α1B protein is not maintained at wild-type levels. It seems reasonable to consider that the loss of the β4 from lh/lh cerebellum cannot be entirely compensated despite the increased level of expression of β1b (Fig. 2). The decreased expression of N-type VDCC or altered expression of other VDCC in the cerebellum of the lh/lh mouse may be the molecular basis of ataxia associated with the lh/lh phenotype. It should be stated that the level of expression of functional N-type VDCC in sympathetic neurons was also decreased in “β3 knock-out mice” (27Smith S.M. Namkung Y. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the lh/lh mouse, the “β3 knock-out” mouse is phenotypically normal (27Smith S.M. Namkung Y. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The expression of other β isoforms in response to the elimination of β3 has not yet been reported. To determine the structural consequences of abnormal β isoform expression in lh/lh mice upon N-type VDCC assembly, the endogenous α1B/β subunit complexes were evaluated in immunoprecipitation assays using anti-α1B, anti-β generic (Ab CW24), and β isoform-specific antibodies (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The assay conditions were defined such that the pan-specific anti-β antibody immunoprecipitated a similar fraction of N-type VDCC in all samples (Fig. 4). The relative contribution of β isoforms to the N-type VDCC present in forebrain and cerebellum oflh/lh is clearly altered compared with the wild-type mice (Fig. 4). As anticipated from the lack of detectable β4 in forebrains from lh/lh mice (Fig. 1), the disparity in the association of β4 with N-type VDCC in lh/lh versuswild-type mice was quite dramatic, as antibodies to β4 immunoprecipitated less than 10% of the total N-type VDCC solubilized from the cerebellum of lh/lh mouse (Fig. 4). With regard to the N-type VDCC extracted from forebrain, the fraction of N-type VDCC associated with β1b was statistically increased in lh/lh versus wild type mice (Fig. 4). In contrast, neither the association of β2 nor β3 with the N-type VDCC was affected in forebrains of lh/lh versus wild-type mice (Fig.4). However, although β1b was increased in expression inlh/lh cerebellum (Fig. 2), there was no statistically significant increase in incorporation of any β isoform into cerebellar N-type VDCC (Fig. 4). It is reasonable to suggest that down-regulation of α1B expression (Fig. 3), rather than increased incorporation of β1b into assembled N-type VDCC, is the primary mechanism of compensation in lh/lh cerebellum. Additional studies are required to determine whether the compensatory mechanisms that alter β subunit composition of the N-type VDCC in thelh/lh mouse influence the expression and assembly of other VDCC. Although the specific biophysical properties derived from the population of N-type VDCC present in wild-type and lh/lhforebrain have yet to be determined, it is interesting to note that β1b and β4 have similar effects upon closed state inactivation of recombinant N-type VDCC (8Patil P. Brody D.L. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Similar kinetic effects of β1b and β4 suggest tolerance of the β1b assembled into N-type VDCC, and this atypical channel composition may explain the absence of the neurodegeneration frequently observed in other epileptic mouse strains (3Doyle J. Ren X. Lennon G. Stubbs L. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N. Shaughnessy J.D. Hawkes R. Frankel W.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). These results are the first to indicate that assembly of the high voltage-activated N-type VDCC is altered in the lh/lh mouse. These findings do not exclude the possibility that the expression of other high voltage-activated VDCC is also effected as β4 is associated with mature L-type, N-type, and P/Q-type VDCC (17Vance C.L.

However, it is interesting to point out that although low voltage-activated T-type channels have been implicated in the initiation of thalamic seizures in absence epilepsies (28Snead O.C. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Coulter D.A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 100: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the T-type α1G and α1H isoforms do not contain consensus β binding domains (14De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), suggesting that T-type VDCC expression, unlike the high voltage-activated VDCC, may not be directly regulated by β subunits. Differential modulation of the N-type VDCC by protein kinases inlh/lh mice is another property that may result from the assembly of β1b in place of β4. The β1b (31Pragnell M. Sakamoto J. Jay S.D. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) contains consensus sites for protein kinase A modification; conversely in the β4, the protein kinase A consensus sites are absent (32Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the inappropriate inclusion of β1b into the N-type VDCC complex in thelh/lh mouse in lieu of β4 may alter protein kinase-mediated modulation of the channel and thus effect calcium entry and calcium-dependent signaling. In earlier studies, β4 was discriminated from the other β isoforms by virtue of its striking increase in expression during development (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,33Tanaka O. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 30: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The importance of β4 to neuronal functioning is reflected in the epileptic and ataxic phenotype of the lh/lh mice, which stands in contrast to the “β3 knock-out” mouse that is phenotypically normal (27Smith S.M. Namkung Y. Scheller R.H. Tsien R.W. Shin H.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The phenotype of lh/lh mice is evident at postnatal day 15 (10Dung H.C. Swigart R.H. Tex. Rep. Biol. Med. 1972; 30: 23-39PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dung H.C. Swigart R.H. Tex. Rep. Biol. Med. 1971; 29: 273-288PubMed Google Scholar), which is consistent with the loss of β4 that is normally increased in expression after P7 in developing rat brain (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The question now arises as to whether the phenotype oflh/lh mice arises primarily because of the loss of β4 or as a result of the increased fractional contribution of β1b to N-type VDCC complexes. Our recent report that identifies β4 as a marker for N-type VDCC maturation unifies these two possibilities (17Vance C.L. Begg C.M. Lee W.-L. Haase H. Copeland T.D. McEnery M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14495-14502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The increased fractional contribution of β1b to N-type VDCC complexes and the absence of β4 assembled into adult lh/lh N-type VDCC result in a population of N-type VDCC that is strikingly similar to immature (P2) N-type VDCC in β subunit composition (17Vance C.L.

We propose that the mechanism that promotes absence seizures inlh/lh mice, a form of epilepsy more commonly associated with immature brain (28Snead O.C. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 146-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), may be a consequence of prolonged and inappropriate expression of immature α1/β complexes. We thank Stefan J.

https://openalex.org/W2026692323,"Ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors is mediated by interactions with coactivators. Recently, a consensus interaction motif (LXXLL) has been identified in a number of coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). SRC-1 contains three such motifs in the central (nuclear receptor binding domain-1, NBD-1) and a single one in the C-terminal (NBD-2) regions. To define the nature and role of the two NBDs in SRC-1, interaction studies between the two NBDs and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) were performed. Although NBD-1 and NBD-2 showed similar ligand- and AF-2-dependent interactions with TR in solution, these two NBDs possessed distinct interaction properties with TR when TR is bound to a thyroid hormone-response element (TRE). Both in vitro and in vivo interaction studies demonstrate that NBD-1, but not NBD-2, exhibits ligand-dependent interaction with TR in the presence of TREs. In addition, a natural isoform of SRC-1, SRC-1E, which lacks NBD-2, preserved TR as well as progesterone receptor-mediated coactivator function on reporter gene expression. Finally, we found that NBD-1 failed to interact with a TR and retinoid X receptor heterodimer complex on a transcriptionally inactive direct repeat +4 TRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These observations indicate that DNA-induced, as well as ligand-induced, conformational change(s) of TR may influence the nature of its binding to SRC-1, and that the two NBDs of SRC-1 may play different roles to regulate ligand-dependent transactivation of TRs.

The liganded NRs bind to their cognate hormone response elements, located in the promoter regions of target genes, and stimulate transcriptional activation by transmitting the signals to the basal transcriptional machinery via protein-protein interactions. NRs have been shown to interact directly with components of the basal transcription machinery such as TFIIB (1Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

In addition, the coactivators, which serve as bridging molecules between the NRs and basal transcriptional machinery, are also required to mediate ligand-stimulated transactivation (5Meyer M.-E.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2776-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of NRs has shown that there are two major activation domains. The N-terminal domain (AF-1) contains a ligand-independent activation function, whereas the extreme C-terminal region of the ligand-binding domain (AF-2) exhibits ligand-dependent transactivation (7Lees J.A.

A consensus interaction motif, an helical leucine-charged residue-rich domain (LXXLL), was identified in many coactivators (21Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 27Thénot S. Henriquet C. Rochefort H. Cavaillès V. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). These coactivators, mutated in their LXXLL motif, could not maintain ligand-dependent interaction with NRs (21Torchia J.

Interestingly, some of the coactivators, including SRC-1, TIF2, TRAM-1, RIP140, p120, and CBP/p300 contain multiple LXXLL interaction motifs (20Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S.

For example, RIP140 has nine LXXLL motifs, each of which showed ligand- and AF-2-dependent interaction with estrogen receptor (ER) (31Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear hormone receptor corepressor, N-CoR (33Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar), has two nuclear receptor interaction sites (34Seol W.

However, little is known about the functional role of the multiple nuclear receptor interaction sites of coactivators or corepressors.SRC-1 belongs to the 160-kDa protein subset of the nuclear receptor coactivator (NCoA) gene family that includes TIF2 and TRAM-1. The NCoA proteins are characterized by a basic helix-loop-helix/Per-AhR-Sim domain in the N-terminal, serine-threonine-rich sequence in central, and a glutamine (Q)-rich sequence in the C-terminal regions (15Kamei Y.

Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). SRC-1 interacts with a variety of NRs in a ligand-dependent manner, and enhances ligand-stimulated transactivation in cotransfection assays (14Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 20Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). SRC-1 contains seven LXXLL motifs in its entire sequence. However, yeast two-hybrid analysis of the interaction between ER and the seven LXXLL motifs has shown that SRC-1 exhibits three functionally active LXXLL motifs in the central region (termed nuclear receptor binding domain-1, NBD-1) and another at the C terminus (termed NBD-2) out of the seven motifs (31Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The three LXXLL motifs in NBD-1 are also conserved among the other two NCoA proteins, TIF2 and TRAM-1. However, the LXXLL motif in C-terminal NBD-2 is specific for SRC-1, as the other two NCoA proteins do not contain a LXXLL motif in the homologous C-terminal region.To understand the nature and role of the two NBDs of SRC-1, in vitro and in vivo interactions between TR and the two NBDs of SRC-1 were analyzed by several approaches in the present study. We also studied SRC-1E (15Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), a natural SRC-1 isoform lacking NBD-2, to compare its coactivator function with that of SRC-1. Our findings suggest that DNA-induced, as well as ligand-induced, conformational change(s) of TR may influence the nature of its binding to SRC-1, and that the two NBDs of SRC-1 may play different roles in the regulation of ligand-dependent transactivation of TRs.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here suggest an important role of the conformational changes of NRs induced by DNA binding as well as ligand binding for their interactions with coactivators. In the present study, we showed different interaction properties among full-length, N- and C-terminal fragments of SRC-1 with NRs. We then characterized two NBDs, NBD-1 and NBD-2, located at the central and C-terminal regions of SRC-1, respectively. We found that NBD-1, but not NBD-2, could interact with TR in the presence of TREs. In addition NBD-1 failed to interact with TR on a transcriptionally inactive TRE.The LXXLL motifs in coactivators are critical for ligand- and AF-2-dependent interaction with NRs (21Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 31Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). However, there are several lines of evidence indicating that AF-2 is not the only region that mediates ligand-dependent interaction with NRs. First, although the majority of putative coactivators contain this motif, Lee et al. cloned a number of ligand-dependent TR-interacting proteins (Trips) such as Trip1 (SUG1), Trip6, Trip7 (HMG-14, 17), and Trip10, which do not contain this sequence (45Lee J.W. Choi H.-S. Gyurist J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, recent studies using a helix 3 mutant in the LBD of ER or TR demonstrate that the helix 3 as well as the AF-2 (helix 12) are important for ligand-dependent interaction with SRC-1 and TRAM-1 (20Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 46Henttu P.M. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Third, SRC-1 is able to enhance the estrogen-stimulated transcriptional activity of an AF-2 mutant of ER (47Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the full-length, but not fragments of, SRC-1 retained ligand-dependent interaction with AF-2 mutants. Although the possibility that all LXXLL motifs are needed to interact with AF-2 mutants cannot be ruled out, the overall conformation of SRC-1 or subregion(s) other than the LXXLL motifs in SRC-1 may also participate in ligand-dependent interaction with NRs.Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the different interaction properties of the two NBDs in SRC-1. Thus, both NBD-1 and NBD-2 can interact independently with TR in a ligand-dependent manner in solution. However, when TR binds to a TRE, NBD-1, but not NBD-2, exhibits ligand-dependent interaction with TR. Even though each interaction site contains LXXLL sequences, each site has a different affinity and selectivity for NRs (21Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 31Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Our observation regarding the different properties of NBD-1 and NBD-2 are consistent with these findings. We and others previously reported evidence that conformational changes of TR occur after DNA binding (42Ikeda M. Wilcox E.C. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23096-23104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 48Saatcioglu F. Deng T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 75: 1095-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 49Toney J.H. Wu L. Summerfield A.E. Sanyal G. Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, NBD-2 may no longer be accessible to TR due to a DNA-induced conformational change.TR bound to a TRE can mediate transactivation. Transcriptional activities of the AF-2 mutants of TR correlate well with the ability of NBD-1 to interact with the AF-2 mutants, but not with NBD-2. In addition, although NBD-1 is conserved among the 160-kDa proteins of the NCoA family such as SRC-1, TIF2, and TRAM-1, NBD-2 is not. These data then suggest that NBD-1 plays a predominant role in the interaction of SRC-1 with DNA-bound TR. In fact, transfection studies using SRC-1 mutated in one or combination of the three LXXLL motifs in NBD-1 have shown that the mutants decrease or fail to enhance ligand-induced RAR- or ER-mediated transactivation (21Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 31Heery D.M. Kallkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar).Arguing against our hypothesis that NBD-1 may be more important for coactivator function than NBD-2 is the observation by Oñateet al. (14Oñate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar) that NBD-2 of SRC-1 blocks the ligand-induced PR- and TR-mediated transactivation in cotransfection experiments. Using an in vitro transcription system, their group also recently has shown that NBD-2, but not NBD-1, inhibits the progesterone-stimulated PR-driven transcription (50Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In contrast, we clearly showed that the expression of NBD-1 (ΔVP16 NBD-1) can inhibit the ligand-stimulated transactivation of TR. Moreover, a natural isoform of SRC-1, SRC-1E, which lacks the LXXLL motif in NBD-2, exhibited enhanced ligand-stimulated transactivation of TR and PR on the cognate response elements. Recent studies from other laboratories indicated that SRC-1E is a more potent activator compared with SRC-1 (35Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Ito T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Herry D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We did not observe this difference. The reason(s) for the discrepancy between the results of our laboratory and those of Hayashi et al. (35Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Ito T. Seo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Kalkhoven et al. (36Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Herry D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) is not known. Further studies will be necessary to investigate the role of the LXXLL motif in NBD-2.Kurokawa et al. (51Kurokawa R. Söderström M. Hörlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) previously compared the interaction properties of nuclear hormone receptor corespressor, N-CoR, with RAR/RXR heterodimers among functionally active DR5 and inactive DR1 DNA response elements. They showed that retinoic acid dissociates nuclear hormone receptor corespressor from the RAR/RXR heterodimer complex on DR5, but not on DR1. They concluded that DNA response elements can allosterically regulate RAR-corepressor interaction. Similar to this phenomenon, we show that a TRE regulates the TR-coactivator interaction. NBD-1 interacts with TR on a transcriptionally active TRE, DR4. In contrast, NBD-1 fails to interact with TR on an inactive TRE, UUU, in EMSA. This finding is also consistent with a crucial role of NBD-1 in TR action.The two NBDs in SRC-1, which contain multiple LXXLL motifs and are present in several coactivators, may allow interaction with multiple NRs via multiple sites. Recent findings revealed that liganded NR may form multiple complexes with NCoAs, CBP/p300 and P/CAF (20Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

However, several NRs may interact with a coactivator via multiple interaction motifs, which then may, in turn, allow these NRs to contact additional cofactors. A different type of NR may also interact with a particular coactivator through the multiple interaction sites and thus possibly serve as a mediator of cross-talk among NRs.In summary, we have characterized two NBDs in SRC-1. DNA-induced, as well as ligand-induced, conformational change(s) of TR may influence the nature of its binding to SRC-1. Thus, the two NBDs of SRC-1 may play different roles in the regulation of ligand-dependent transactivation of TRs.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). For example, in the nucleus, a cap-binding protein complex facilitates pre-mRNA splicing accuracy and efficiency and possibly nuclear export (19Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the heterotrimeric initiation factor eIF4F, which includes the cap-binding subunit eIF4E, promotes ribosome binding and translation initiation (21Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and loss of the blocked 5′ end leads to 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (13Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J.

Consistent with the multiple effects of cap on gene expression, the RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase, like the RNA 5′-triphosphatase (25Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and guanylyltransferase (26Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Nagata S. Mizumoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9521-9528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is essential for viability in yeast (27Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).In an effort to gain a more complete understanding of the role of the cap in mammalian RNA metabolism, we identified human ESTs homologous to the cloned Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase and used them to clone a cDNA encoding the human enzyme (hMet). hMet contains several motifs that are conserved among other RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferases. In the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (Adomet), purified recombinant hMet converted the GpppG ends of transcripts to m7GpppG. In addition, hMet formed ternary complexes with human capping enzyme (HCE) and the hyperphosphorylated elongating form of human RNA polymerase II (pol IIo).DISCUSSIONThe cap structure that is characteristic of RNA pol II transcripts consists of m7G linked via a 5′-5′-triphosphate bridge to the first residue in pre-mRNAs. Capping of nascent transcripts proceeds by the sequential action of RNA 5′-triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and guanine-7-methyltransferase to form the monomethylated cap 0 structure, m7GpppN. Although typical of yeast mRNAs (34Sripati C.E. Groner Y. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2898-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cap 0 structures in higher eukaryotes are usually converted in the nucleus to m7GpppNmcap 1 structures by 2′-O-methylation (1Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Additional methylation can occur in the cytoplasm to form m7GpppNmpNm cap 2 structures (35Cory S. Adams J.M. J. Mol.

Rottman F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5234-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the possible role(s) of cap 2′-O-ribose methylation are only beginning to be elucidated (38Schierle B.S. Gershon P.D. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2897-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 39Kuge H. Richter J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), numerous important biological consequences have been described for m7G.Many if not all aspects of mRNA synthesis and function depend on cap-binding protein complexes that specifically recognize m7GpppN. Ribosome binding during initiation of translation is facilitated by interactions of eIF4F with cap (21Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar, 22Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear events such as in pre-mRNA splicing, 3′ end formation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport are mediated by a different cap-binding protein complex (19Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, guanine N-7 methylation of 5′ ends can influence transcript stability both positively and negatively. Guanine N-7 methylation blocks pyrophosphorolysis of GpppN structures that protect transcripts against 5′-exonucleolytic degradation (13Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J. Nature. 1977; 266: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 7-methyl group contributes to the substrate specificity of the yeast mRNA decapping enzyme, Dcp1p (23LaGrandeur T.E. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which increases transcript susceptibility to exonuclease.Cap methylation studies have focused on virion-associated enzymes (11Furuichi Y. Muthukrishnan S. Tomasz J. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5043-5053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although cap methyltransferases have been purified from mammalian sources (30Ensinger M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5283-5291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1987; 34: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the corresponding gene was not previously cloned and characterized. Here we report the identification and primary structure of a human cDNA that encodes a protein with activity and sequence motifs characteristic of RNA methyltransferases (32Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 33Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A C-terminal truncation mutant of hMet (1–389) that retained previously identified methyltransferase motifs but not motif X was without enzymatic activity. However, motif X is not present in ABD1, and thus its possible role in RNA methylation needs to be further investigated. In this context, it is interesting to note that C-terminal deletion of as few as 55 amino acids from the 436-amino acid ABD1 protein was shown to be lethal (27Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Comparison of the human and yeast sequences in this region shows several conserved residues (Fig. 1), but which if any are specifically required for methyl group transfer from Adomet to caps remains to be determined.Selective capping of RNAs transcribed by pol II, but not pol I and III, was recently explained by the finding of specific association between capping enzymes and the hyperphosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (7Yue Z. Maldonado E. Pillutla R. Cho H. Reinberg D. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E.

Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Yeast RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase has also been shown by affinity chromatography to bind specifically to hyperphosphorylated GST-CTD (8McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Although we did not detect binding of full-length hMet to pol II in immunoprecipitation experiments, preliminary studies of hMet 1–389 indicate that the truncation mutant can bind pol IIo. 3R. Pillutla, unpublished results. Thus association of hMet with pol II may be hindered by C-terminal residues (including motif X) that are not present in ABD1. Binding of hMet to HCE and to HCE/pol IIo complexes suggests that it is recruited to the transcription machinery by association with HCE. Eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 5′-terminal cap, m7GpppN (1Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar).

For example, in the nucleus, a cap-binding protein complex facilitates pre-mRNA splicing accuracy and efficiency and possibly nuclear export (19Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, the heterotrimeric initiation factor eIF4F, which includes the cap-binding subunit eIF4E, promotes ribosome binding and translation initiation (21Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and loss of the blocked 5′ end leads to 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (13Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J.

Consistent with the multiple effects of cap on gene expression, the RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase, like the RNA 5′-triphosphatase (25Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and guanylyltransferase (26Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In an effort to gain a more complete understanding of the role of the cap in mammalian RNA metabolism, we identified human ESTs homologous to the cloned Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase and used them to clone a cDNA encoding the human enzyme (hMet). hMet contains several motifs that are conserved among other RNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferases. In the presence of S-adenosylmethionine (Adomet), purified recombinant hMet converted the GpppG ends of transcripts to m7GpppG. In addition, hMet formed ternary complexes with human capping enzyme (HCE) and the hyperphosphorylated elongating form of human RNA polymerase II (pol IIo). DISCUSSIONThe cap structure that is characteristic of RNA pol II transcripts consists of m7G linked via a 5′-5′-triphosphate bridge to the first residue in pre-mRNAs. Capping of nascent transcripts proceeds by the sequential action of RNA 5′-triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and guanine-7-methyltransferase to form the monomethylated cap 0 structure, m7GpppN. Although typical of yeast mRNAs (34Sripati C.E. Groner Y. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2898-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cap 0 structures in higher eukaryotes are usually converted in the nucleus to m7GpppNmcap 1 structures by 2′-O-methylation (1Shatkin A.J.

Nuclear events such as in pre-mRNA splicing, 3′ end formation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport are mediated by a different cap-binding protein complex (19Lewis J.D. Izaurralde E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, guanine N-7 methylation of 5′ ends can influence transcript stability both positively and negatively. Guanine N-7 methylation blocks pyrophosphorolysis of GpppN structures that protect transcripts against 5′-exonucleolytic degradation (13Furuichi Y. LaFiandra A. Shatkin A.J.

A C-terminal truncation mutant of hMet (1–389) that retained previously identified methyltransferase motifs but not motif X was without enzymatic activity. However, motif X is not present in ABD1, and thus its possible role in RNA methylation needs to be further investigated. In this context, it is interesting to note that C-terminal deletion of as few as 55 amino acids from the 436-amino acid ABD1 protein was shown to be lethal (27Mao X. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell.

Comparison of the human and yeast sequences in this region shows several conserved residues (Fig. 1), but which if any are specifically required for methyl group transfer from Adomet to caps remains to be determined.Selective capping of RNAs transcribed by pol II, but not pol I and III, was recently explained by the finding of specific association between capping enzymes and the hyperphosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (7Yue Z.

https://openalex.org/W2083951294,"The model carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) has historically been characterized as “UV-mimetic” with respect to its genotoxic properties. However, recent evidence indicates that 4-NQO, unlike 254-nm UV light, may exert significant cytotoxic and/or mutagenic potential via the generation of reactive oxygen species. To elucidate the response of eukaryotic cells to 4-NQO-induced oxidative stress, we isolated Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of this mutagen. One such mutant, EBY1, was cross-sensitive to the oxidative agents UVA and diamide while retaining parental sensitivities to 254-nm UV light, methyl methanesulfonate, and ionizing radiation. A complementing gene (designated yPTPA1), restoring full UVA and 4-NQO resistance to EBY1 and encoding a protein that shares 40% identity with the human phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator hPTPA, has been isolated. Targeted deletion ofyPTPA1 in wild type yeast engendered the identical pattern of mutagen hypersensitivity as that manifested by EBY1, in addition to a spontaneous mutator phenotype that was markedly enhanced upon exposure to either UVA or 4-NQO but not to 254-nm UV or methyl methanesulfonate. Moreover, the yptpa1 deletion mutant exhibited a marked deficiency in the recovery of high molecular weight DNA following 4-NQO exposure, revealing a defect at the level of DNA repair. These data (i) strongly support a role for active oxygen intermediates in determining the genotoxic outcome of 4-NQO exposure and (ii) suggest a novel mechanism in yeast involving yPtpa1p-mediated activation of a phosphatase that participates in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, implying that hPTPA may exert a similar function in humans.

To exert its neoplastic effect, 4-NQO must first undergo metabolic activation to the proximate carcinogen 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide, which, following acylation, reacts with DNA to form stable quinoline-purine monoadducts, i.e. at the exocyclic N-2 and N-6 positions of guanine and adenine, respectively (1Sugimura T. Okabe K. Nagao M. Cancer Res. 1966; 26: 1717-1721PubMed Google Scholar, 2Galiègue-Zouitina S. Bailleul B. Ginot Y. Perly B. Vigny P. Loucheux-Lefebvre M.-H. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1858-1863PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells, these genotoxic “bulky” DNA lesions are processed largely by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in a manner analogous to classical dipyrimidine photoproducts (viz. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts) generated by the model DNA-damaging agent 254-nm UV light (3Prakash S.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As such, mutants that are deficient in NER are hypersensitive to the genotoxic effects of 254-nm UV light, as well as 4-NQO (3Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 4Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Van Houten B.

The apparent strong similarity in modes of cellular processing for 254-nm UV light- and 4-NQO-induced DNA damage in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems has often resulted in categorization of the latter agent as “UV-mimetic” (7Felkner I.C. Kadlubar F. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 1448-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide nucleotide excision repair apurinic methyl methanesulfonate kilobase(s). However, this designation may be inappropriate, because several recent investigations have clearly demonstrated that 4-NQO, unlike 254-nm UV light, can generate a substantial degree of intracellular oxidative stress. This may herald significant consequences for 4-NQO-exposed cells at the level of cell killing and mutagenesis. Indeed, it was shown that 4-NQO is a potent inducer of the Escherichia colisoxR/S regulon that responds to intracellular superoxide imbalances (8Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3250-3252PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that 4-NQO undergoes redox cycling to produce superoxide anion, which can be further converted into genotoxic reactive oxygen species (e.g. singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals) that engender modified bases and DNA strand breaks (8Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3250-3252PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamamoto K. Inoue S. Kawanishi S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1397-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been shown in vitro that activated 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide can generate the highly premutagenic product 8-oxo-guanine, as well as strand breaks, in the presence of Cu(II) (9Yamamoto K. Inoue S. Kawanishi S. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1397-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Kohda K. Tada M. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Kawazoe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In E. coli, 8-oxoguanine is removed by the formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), which in turn generates apurinic (AP) sites as secondary lesions (11Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Lederer F. Gouyette A. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3916-3922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP sites are also highly premutagenic but can be efficiently removed from cellular DNA by AP endonucleases (12Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 13Ramotar D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that bacterial mutants lacking either Fpg or AP endonucleases are hypersensitive to the mutagenic effects of 4-NQO (but not of 254-nm UV light) (8Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3250-3252PubMed Google Scholar,14Ruiz-Laguna J. Ariza R.R. Prieto-Alamo M.J. Boiteux S. Pueyo C. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 425-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Based on the demonstrated ability of 4-NQO to induce oxidative stress that contributes to cell killing and mutagenesis in bacteria, we postulated that this agent may act similarly in eukaryotic cells. As such, using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the aim of the present investigation was to identify novel eukaryotic genes implicated in the cellular response to 4-NQO-induced oxidative DNA damage. Our strategy involved, sequentially (i) isolation of a large panel of yeast mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of 4-NQO, (ii) categorical preclusion from further analysis of any mutants showing full cross-sensitivity to 254-nm UV light, because these are likely to carry mutations in previously identified DNA repair genes, e.g. comprising the NER pathway known to participate in the processing of UV-type dipyrimidine photoproducts, as well as classical 4-NQO-induced bulky DNA adducts, and (iii) appropriate characterization of any remaining mutants expressing putative defects specifically in the processing of 4-NQO-induced oxidative DNA damage. In this manner, we identified a novel 4-NQO-sensitive yeast mutant that retains parental resistance to 254-nm UV light, while displaying certain hallmarks consistent with a deficiency in the repair of oxidative DNA lesions. A gene complementing this defective phenotype was isolated from a yeast genomic library, and was shown to correspond to a previously identified, but functionally uncharacterized, yeast gene with a predicted amino acid sequence that manifests significant identity with the human phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator hPTPA. Our data strongly support a genotoxic role for reactive oxygen species in 4-NQO-exposed yeast, and provide novel in vivo evidence for the participation of cellular phosphatases in the repair of oxidative DNA damage in eukaryotic cells. The wild type S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were DBY747 (MATa, leu2-3, 112, his3-Δ1, trp1-289a, ura3-52, laboratory stock), DBY747-1 (isogenic to DBY747, excepttrp1::hisG), W303a (MATa, ade2-1, his3-11, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, ura3-1, provided by Dr. M. Stark, University of Dundee, UK), FY86 (MATα; his3Δ 200, ura3-52, leu2Δ1, provided by Dr. Fred Winston, Harvard University), and MKp-o (MATa, can1-1000, ade2-1, lys2-1, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his3Δ200, trp1-Δ901, provided by Dr. Bernard Kunz, Deakin University, Australia). The mutant strain EBY1 is isogenic to DBY747, except that it bears a mutated copy of the yPTPA1gene (see below). EBY2, EBY3, and EBY4 were derived, respectively, from DBY747-1, MKp-o, and W303a by deleting a portion of theyPTPA1 coding region and replacing it with the selective marker LEU2 (see below). Likewise, CHY26 and CHY27 were derived, respectively, from DBY747-1 and EBY2 by deleting a portion of the coding region of the yPTPA2 gene and replacing it with the selective marker TRP1 (see below). The yeast strains DEY10-2C (isogenic to W303a, exceptpph22Δ1::URA3), DEY142-4D (isogenic to W303a, except MATα, pph21Δ1::HIS3), and DEY22-12 (isogenic to W303a, except pph21Δ1::HIS3, pph22-12) were all generously provided by Dr. M. Stark (University of Dundee, UK). Yeast cells were grown in either complete yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) or minimal synthetic (SC) medium, to which nutritional supplements were added at 20 μg/ml (15Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). Standard genetic analysis and transformation were carried out as described previously (16Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar, 17Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1992; 7: 253-263Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The E. coli strain used for plasmid maintenance was HB101. Exponentially growing wild type yeast (strain DBY747) were treated with 0.1% MMS for 1 h, and surviving colonies were streaked onto YPD agar plates containing 0.4 μg/ml of 4-NQO. This drug concentration permits 90–95% growth of wild type, and strains that did not sustain growth at this drug concentration were scored as mutant. A 1.5-kb SmaI/HindIII yeast DNA fragment bearing the yPTPA1 coding region and flanking 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was derived from pDR1022 (see below) and subcloned into the pBluescript vector K/S to produce the plasmid pTV3. This plasmid was digested with SalI/PstI to release a 125-base pair fragment from within the coding region of theyPTPA1 gene. The released fragment was substituted with theS. cerevisiae LEU2 selective marker, which was obtained as a 2.5-kb SalI/PstI fragment from the plasmid YEp13 (16Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar), to produce plasmid pTV4. A linear 3.2-kb fragment,yptpa1Δ::LEU2, was obtained from pTV4 by digestion with HindIII and ScaI and transformed directly into the wild type haploid strains DBY747, FY86, and MKp-o using the lithium acetate procedure (17Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1992; 7: 253-263Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Leu2+transformants bearing a chromosomal deletion of the yPTPA1gene were verified by Southern blot analysis (16Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; : 194Google Scholar), using a32P-labeled 1.0-kb fragment of the yPTPA1 coding region as probe. To construct a yptap2 deletion mutant, the entire yPTPA2 gene was first isolated from strain DBY747 by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the upstream (5′-TCTTTTAAAGCTTAAGAAAATCG-3′) and downstream (5′-GGAAAAAGTACGTACCG-3′) primers containing the restriction sites HindIII and SnaBI (18Ramotar D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 145: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These primers amplified a 1.9-kb HindIII/SnaBI DNA fragment, which was then subcloned into pBluescript digested withHindIII and SmaI to produce pCH1. pCH1 was in turn digested with EcoRI, which removes 160 nucleotides from the N-terminal end of the yPTPA2 coding region, and a 1.2-kbEcoRI fragment containing the TRP1 selective marker gene was inserted at the EcoRI site to produce pCH2. Digestion of pCH2 with HindIII and BamHI produced the yptpa2Δ::TRP1 3.0-kb DNA fragment, which was transformed into strains DBY747 and EBY2. yptpa2 deletion mutants were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The sensitivities of the various yeast strains to 4-NQO, diamide, and methyl methanesulfonate (all purchased from Sigma) were measured using exponential phase cultures. Overnight cultures grown to saturation at 30 °C in YPD were diluted into fresh medium at an A600 of 0.2 (∼2 × 106 cells/ml) and incubated to anA600 of 1.0. Aliquots were then treated with various concentrations of drugs at 30 °C with shaking (250 rpm) for 1 h. Relative survival was determined by immediately diluting the samples in sterile 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and plating onto YPD agar. Colonies were counted after 3–4 days of growth at 30 °C. In the case of γ-irradiation treatment, exponential cells were irradiated in cold YPD medium using a Co60 source at a dose rate of 55.5 radians/s (experiments carried out in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Resnick, NIEHS, NIH). For exposure to defined regions of the UV wavelength spectrum, mid-log phase yeast were irradiated in sterile distilled water using fluorescent 25-W lamps emitting either UVA (GE model F25T8-BL), UVB (Spectroline model XX25B), or 254-nm UV light (GE model G25T8). Cells were treated at relatively low density (105 cells/ml in 35-mm Petri dishes) and with constant shaking to avoid cellular shielding. The incident light was rigorously purified using 2-mm-thick glass filters (Schott, Mainz, Germany) to virtually eliminate contaminating wavelengths below 290 nm in the case of UVB (filter WG 305) and below 320 nm for UVA (filter WG 345). The incident UVB (λ > 290 nm), UVA (λ > 320 nm), and 254-nm UV light dose rates were measured using a Spectroline DRC 100X digital radiometer equipped with DIX 300, DIX 365, and DIX 254 sensors, respectively. This assay was performed as described previously (19Masson J.-Y. Ramotar D. Can. J. Microbiol. 1996; 42: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were replicated as a thin line along the drug gradient, and after 2 days of growth at 30 °C the distance of growth of each strain is expressed as a percentage of the wild type. Growth all along the gradient is considered to be 100%. Spontaneous mutation rates were determined using a fluctuation test as described previously (20Ramotar D. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7368-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The measurement of the drug-induced mutation rate was done by directly adding the appropriate concentration of drug to the selective medium. For UVA treatment, a 24-well plate containing the culture was irradiated with UVA 2 days after the cells were exhausted of adenine, by which time they had grown from an initial inoculum of ∼5,000 to a final density of ∼1.0 × 106 cells. Chromosomal DNA from either untreated or 4-NQO-treated cells were isolated and analyzed as described previously (21Masson J.-Y. Ramotar D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasmids pEB1 and pEB2 were constructed by subcloning the 1.5-kb SmaI/HindIII DNA fragment carrying the yPTPA1 gene into the single copy vector YCplac33 and the 2μ multicopy vector YEplac195, respectively, cut with SmaI and HindIII (22Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). Similarly, the plasmids pEB3 and pEB4 were constructed by subcloning the 1.9-kbHindIII/SnaBI polymerase chain reaction fragment of the yPTPA2 gene into YCplac33 and YEplac195, respectively, also cut with HindIII and SmaI. The multicopy plasmids pPPH21 and pPPH22, respectively, bearing the entirePPH21 and PPH22 genes were provided by Dr. M. Stark. Total RNA was prepared by the rapid glass bead method (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose blot was probed with a random primed 32P-labeled 1.1-kbHindIII/SnaBI fragment derived from the coding region of the yPTPA1 gene. The primers, 5′-CCCTGTGGCCGAATTCCATCTGCTC-3′and 5′-ATCTACAGGATCCAGAGACAT-3′containing, respectively, the restriction sites EcoRI and BamHI (underlined), were used to amplify a 632-base pair fragment consisting of the promoter region of yPTPA1 gene from −615 to +17 base pairs. The EcoRI/BamHI fragment was subcloned into the multicopy vector YEP356R (provided by Dr. Fred Winston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), such that the ATG start codon of theyPTPA1 gene forms the initiation codon for the E. coli reporter lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase. To determine the location of the mutation in the yPTPA1 gene derived from the mutant EBY1, the primers 5′-CCCTGTGGCCGAATTCCATCTGCTC-3′ and 5′-TAATGCTTGGGATCCACATTTATA-3′ were used to isolate a 1.5-kb DNA fragment of the yPTPA1 gene, with the underlinedEcoRI/BamHI sites, respectively, from strain EBY1 carrying the mutant allele. The fragment was subcloned into pBluescript, and only one strand of the mutant allele of theyPTPA1 gene was entirely sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 543-5467Crossref Scopus (52771) Google Scholar). All additional DNA fragments isolated by polymerase chain reaction were also sequenced by this method. In an attempt to identify novel eukaryotic genes implicated in the repair of 4-NQO-induced oxidative DNA damage, a panel of 55 S. cerevisiae mutants exhibiting hypersensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of this agent was initially isolated. Fifty of the mutants among this collection were excluded from further analysis, because they displayed strong cross-sensitivity to 254-nm UV light, i.e.reflecting the UV-mimetic character of 4-NQO, therefore indicating the involvement in the observed 4-NQO hypersensitivity of previously identified genes comprising, e.g. the NER pathway (3Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 4Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 173-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining five 4-NQO-sensitive mutants all retained parental resistance to 254-nm UV light and MMS and were therefore deemed potentially deficient in the processing of oxidative DNA damage. One of these 4-NQO-sensitive, 254-nm UV light-resistant mutants, designated EBY1, was shown to be highly cross-sensitive to the oxidizing agents UVA (320–400 nm) and diamide (Fig. 1). Moreover, EBY1 displayed only marginal sensitivity to UVB (290–320 nm), which has a much smaller oxidative component relative to UVA (Fig.1), as well as to hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). Finally, EBY1 also manifested parental resistance to ionizing radiation (Fig. 1) and bleomycin (data not shown), providing evidence that it is not defective in the Rad52 recombinational/double-strand break repair pathway (25Paques F. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6765-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mutation conferring 4-NQO and UVA sensitivity to EBY1 was recessive, because a diploid strain constructed by crossing EBY1 (MATa) with a wild type strain FY86 (MATα) showed wild type resistance to 4-NQO (data not shown). Dissection of eight tetrads derived by sporulating the diploid EBY1 X FY86 produced 2:2 segregation of the 4-NQO sensitivity in the progeny, indicating that EBY1 carries a single mutation. Because UVA, 4-NQO, and diamide all generate free radicals, we reasoned that the hypersensitivity of EBY1 to these agents may be because of a defect in a pathway that signals the repair of, or itself repairs, oxidatively damaged DNA. Furthermore, the fact that the mutagen-hypersensitive phenotype of EBY1 was clearly distinct from that of other known yeast DNA repair-deficient mutants suggested that this strain may harbor a mutation at an uncharacterized locus. To isolate the complementing gene, a yeast genomic library constructed in the single copy vector YCp50, and bearing the URA3 selective marker, was introduced into strain EBY1. At least 10,000 Ura+ colonies were replica plated onto YPD agar containing 0.4 μg/ml of 4-NQO, a drug concentration that completely suppressed growth of the mutant but not the parental strain. Two Ura+ colonies, EBY1/pDR1022 and EBY1/pDR1023, were found to be resistant to 4-NQO and UVA (data not shown). The plasmids isolated from the two independent Ura+colonies were identical, because each contained a 12-kb DNA fragment bearing the same restriction enzyme pattern. The portion of the pDR1022 plasmid that conferred 4-NQO or UVA resistance to strain EBY1 was traced to a 1.5-kb SmaI/HindIII DNA fragment derived from chromosome IX. The fragment contained a single open reading frame (designated YIL153w in accordance with theS. cerevisiae gene data base nomenclature) and predicted to encode a polypeptide of 394 amino acids in length. Comparison with protein sequences in the GenBankTM data base revealed thatYIL153w encodes a protein that shares 31, 54, 38, and 40% identity with proteins encoded by, respectively, a S. cerevisiae gene yPL152w (accession number z73508), a fission Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene (accession number z98980), a Drosophila gene (accession number x98401), and the human PTPA (hPTPA) gene (accession number x73478) (26Cayla X. Van Hoof C. Bosch M. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. Peeters B. Merlevede W. Goris J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15668-15675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter gene encodes the human phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator PTPA that modulates the weak tyrosyl phosphatase activity of PP2A (26Cayla X. Van Hoof C. Bosch M. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. Peeters B. Merlevede W. Goris J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15668-15675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cayla X. Goris J. Hermann J. Hendrix P. Ozon R. Merlevede W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 658-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For simplicity, we refer to the yeast genes YIL153w andYPL152w as yPTPA1 and yPTPA2 and the encoded proteins as yPtpa1p and yPtpa2p, respectively. No homologue of yPtpa1p has yet been isolated from prokaryotic cells. A detailed comparison between S. cerevisiae yPtpa1p and human hPTPA1 is shown in Fig. 2. These proteins share four highly conserved regions (I, II, III, and IV) that are also present in yPtpa2p and in the proteins predicted by the S. pombe and Drosophila genes, suggesting that they play an important role in cellular metabolism. A computer search for functional motifs revealed that only region II contains the consensus sequence of an ATP binding site (28Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Because yPtpa2p shares significant identity with yPtpa1p, it is possible that the observed phenotype of strain EBY1 might also arise from a genetic defect in the yPTPA2 gene. To test this, we isolated the yPTPA1 and yPTPA2 genes from strain EBY1 using polymerase chain reaction and subjected both to DNA sequence analysis (18Ramotar D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 145: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). No alteration was found in the nucleotide sequence of the yPTPA2 gene, as compared with DNA sequences in theS. cerevisiae data base. In contrast, a single base pair substitution was found in the yPTPA1 gene derived from strain EBY1. The mutation was located at codon 60, where TAC was mutated to the TAA stop codon. Thus, the phenotypes associated with EBY1 are because of a defective yPTPA1 gene and not its homologue yPTPA2. To directly confirm that the yPTPA1 gene is responsible for the observed phenotypes in strain EBY1, we replaced a portion of theyPTPA1 coding region, with the selective markerLEU2 in the parental strain DBY747. The resulting mutant EBY2 (yptpa1Δ::LEU2) showed identical sensitivity to UVA and 4-NQO, as compared with EBY1 (Fig.3, A and B). Deletion of the yPTPA1 gene in three additional parent strains FY86, MKp-o, and W303 also produced mutants with marked sensitivities to UVA and 4-NQO (data not shown), eliminating the possibility that the observed phenotypes were strain-specific. Like EBY1, none of the deletion mutants showed sensitivies to other DNA-damaging agents including MMS, γ-rays, and 254-nm UV light. Full parental UVA and 4-NQO resistance was restored to EBY2 by the single copy centromeric plasmid, pEB1, carrying the entire yPTPA1gene (positions −615 to +1400), including its putative promoter, the entire coding region, and 200 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon (Fig. 3, A and B). IncreasingyPTPA1 gene dosage by using a multicopy plasmid pEB2 conferred no further mutagen resistance, suggesting that yPtpa1p is not limiting in the cell (Fig. 3 B). Although the above data confirm that yPtpa1p is essential for cellular resistance to UVA and 4-NQO, they do not completely exclude a role for yPtpa2p. To directly test this, a mutant was constructed by deleting the yPTPA2 gene from the parent strain DBY747 by replacing it with the auxothropic marker gene TRP1. The resulting mutant CHY26 retained parental resistance to UVA, to 4-NQO, and to other DNA-damaging agents such as MMS (Fig. 3 B; data shown only for 4-NQO). Furthermore, a yptpa1 yptpa2 double mutant CHY27 was no more sensitive to 4-NQO than the single yptpa1mutant EBY2 (Fig. 3 B). These data confirm that yPTPA1 and not yPTPA2 is required for UVA and 4-NQO tolerance. It should also be noted that 4-NQO resistance could not be restored to strain CHY27 by the plasmid pEB3, which bears a single copy of the yPTPA2 gene (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, however, if the yPTPA2 gene was inserted into the multicopy vector YEplac195, and the resulting plasmid pEB4 was introduced into strain CHY27, full parental 4-NQO resistance was restored (Fig. 3 B). This latter observation may not be surprising in view of the high degree of homology between yPtpa1p and yPtpa2p, but nonetheless confirms that the endogenous level or activity of yPtpa2p is insufficient to compensate for complete loss of yPtpa1p. To determine whether yPtpa1p is inducible by cellular stress, the putative yPTPA1promoter region (spanning positions −615 to +1) was fused to the reporter gene lacZ, encoding β-galactosidase. Upon introduction of the fusion plasmid construct into either EBY2 or the wild type strain, each expressed the same basal level of β-galactosidase activity (120 units/mg protein). This activity could not be induced by exposure to either UVA or 4-NQO nor by stress conditions including heat and osmotic shock. It would therefore appear that the endogenous level of yPtpa1p is sufficient for its biological function. Mutants deficient in any of the three major DNA repair pathways,i.e. the nucleotide excision, post-replicational, and recombinational pathways, show hypermutability in response to a wide spectrum of DNA-damaging agents including 4-NQO. We therefore tested whether the hypersensitivity of EBY2 to 4-NQO might be attributable to a defect in DNA repair. The parental and mutant strains were challenged, or not, with 0.5 μg/ml of 4-NQO for 1 h, followed by isolation of chromosomal DNA and quantitation of strand breaks by alkaline sucrose density gradient analysis (21Masson J.-Y. Ramotar D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Undamaged DNA isolated from either the parent or the muta"
https://openalex.org/W1968029587,"Class I ribonucleotide reductases consist of two subunits, R1 and R2. The active site is located in R1; active R2 contains a diferric center and a tyrosyl free radical (Tyr⋅), both essential for enzymatic activity. The proposed mechanism for the enzymatic reaction includes the transport of a reducing equivalent, i.e. electron or hydrogen radical, across a 35-Å distance between Tyr⋅ in R2 and the active site in R1, which are connected by a hydrogen-bonded chain of conserved, catalytically essential amino acid residues. Asp266 and Trp103 in mouse R2 are part of this radical transfer pathway. The diferric/Tyr⋅ site in R2 is reconstituted spontaneously by mixing iron-free apoR2 with Fe(II) and O2. The reconstitution reaction requires the delivery of an external reducing equivalent to form the diferric/Tyr⋅ site. Reconstitution kinetics were investigated in mouse apo-wild type R2 and the three mutants D266A, W103Y, and W103F by rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance with ≥4 Fe(II)/R2 at various reaction temperatures. The kinetics of Tyr⋅ formation in D266A and W103Y is on average 20 times slower than in wild type R2. More strikingly, Tyr⋅ formation is completely suppressed in W103F. No change in the reconstitution kinetics was found starting from Fe(II)-preloaded proteins, which shows that the mutations do not affect the rate of iron binding. Our results are consistent with a reaction mechanism using Asp266 and Trp103 for delivery of the external reducing equivalent. Further, the results with W103F suggest that an intact hydrogen-bonded chain is crucial for the reaction, indicating that the external reducing equivalent is a H⋅. Finally, the formation of Tyr⋅ is not the slowest step of the reaction as it is in Escherichia coli R2, consistent with a stronger interaction between Tyr⋅ and the iron center in mouse R2. A new electron paramagnetic resonance visible intermediate named mouseX, strikingly similar to species X found inE. coli R2, was detected only in small amounts under certain conditions. We propose that it may be an intermediate in a side reaction leading to a diferric center without forming the neighboring Tyr⋅. Class I ribonucleotide reductases consist of two subunits, R1 and R2.

The three established classes of ribonucleotide reductases catalyze the de novo synthesis of all four deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The iron-containing class I is the one best characterized (2Sjöberg B.-M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J.

The common protein structure of class I ribonucleotide reductase is α2β2, i.e. it is composed of two homodimeric proteins, R1 and R2. Protein R2 contains a diferric iron center and a stable free radical on a tyrosine residue necessary for enzymatic activity, whereas protein R1 contains the substrate binding site. The sequence homology in both proteins is >90% between human, mouse, and hamster ribonucleotide reductases, but only about 25% between mouse and E. coli (3Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the general enzymatic properties are almost the same. The three-dimensional structures of R1 and R2 from E. colihave been determined, and the holoenzyme has been model-built (5Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H.

In the model, the radical-forming residue Tyr-122⋅ is situated in R2 in a hydrophobic pocket close to the μ-oxo-bridged diiron center, about 35 Å distant from the active site in R1.

Biol. 1996; 262: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Despite the low sequence homology between mouse and E. coliR2 (3Thelander L. Gräslund A. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 30. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar), the overall structure and the enzymatically important features are very similar (9Kauppi B.

The ligands of the iron center as well as the R2 part of the proposed electron transfer pathway can be superimposed. Whereas the hydrogen bonds of the Fe1 ligand His173involved in the proposed electron transfer pathway are the same as inE. coli R2, His270, a ligand of Fe2, has fewer hydrogen bonds and is, therefore, less constrained in mouse R2. The electron transfer pathway was suggested to consist of the conserved amino acids (Fe1) His173-Asp266-Trp103-Tyr370in R2 and Tyr738-Tyr737-Cys429 in R1 (mouse numbering) forming a hydrogen-bonded chain between the iron center in R2 and the active site in R1. Mutation of D266A and W103(Y/F) in mouse R2 leads to a complete loss of enzymatic activity (10Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L.

Additionally, the unchanged Mn2+ binding constants, as a probe for Fe2+ binding, and the UV-visible spectra strongly indicate a stiochiometric iron binding in all mutant R2 proteins, including W103F (10Rova U.

Rapid freeze-quench (RFQ)-EPR and -Mössbauer studies at 5 °C yielded an EPR- and Mössbauer-visible transient, denoted speciesX, that was kinetically competent to be a direct precursor of Tyr⋅ (14Bollinger Jr., J.M.

Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8015-8023Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas preloading of the anaerobic R2 with ferrous iron yielded about 60 s−1 (15Tong W.H.

Soc. 1996; 118: 2107-2108Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that iron binding to the aerobic R2 is the second slowest step in R2 reconstitution (SchemeFS1). The slowest step in both procedures was found to be the formation of the stable Tyr⋅, with an unchanged rate of 1 s−1. Mössbauer studies revealed no other iron center intermediates beside species X starting from apoR2 (14Bollinger Jr., J.M. Tong W.H. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8015-8023Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas in the studies with preloaded R2, 10–20% of the iron showed unusual isomer shifts (15Tong W.H. Chen S. Lloyd S.G. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Stubbe J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2107-2108Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting small amounts of accumulated iron center intermediates appearing before species X (e.g. peroxo or diferryl as proposed in Scheme FS1). Our results on the reconstitution kinetics of mouse R2 proteins as well as the earlier findings in E. coli wild type R2 can be summarized in the reaction pathway sketched in SchemeFS1. Here, we have investigated the kinetics of the reconstitution reaction in wild type mouse R2 protein and in three mutants (D266A, W103Y, and W103F) on the R2 part of the proposed electron transfer pathway, thus probing its role in the reconstitution reaction. Our kinetic results show that the external electron is delivered via the proposed electron transfer pathway and give strong evidence for the participation of an intact hydrogen-bonded chain in the reconstitution reaction. To explain our findings, we propose a novel reaction scheme consisting of the delivery of electron/proton pairs, i.e. hydrogen radicals, to the iron site. Theoretical calculations (16Siegbahn P.E.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Crabtree R.H. Theor. Chem. Acc. 1997; 97: 289-300Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have recently shown that movement of an uncharged H⋅ in a hydrogen-bonded system is energetically favorable compared with electron transfer, which involves charge separation. Thus we will refer to the electron transfer pathway as radical transfer pathway (RTP). All experiments were done in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl with a ratio of ferrous iron to protein R2 dimer of 4 or 6. The mouse proteins were overexpressed in logarithmically growing BL21(DE3) pLysS bacteria. They contained pETR2 plasmids encoding wild type mouse R2 protein (11Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or the mutant mouse R2 proteins D266A, W103Y and W103F (10Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were purified according to Rova et al. (10Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Wild type protein was purified as in Mann et al. (11Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Grinding with aluminum oxide could be omitted due to the pLysS strain. Mutant and wild type mouse R2 were mainly obtained as apo protein. If necessary Tyr⋅ and the iron center in wild type mouse R2 were removed by hydroxyurea/EDTA treatment and subsequent passage through a G-25 column. Fractionation yielded a protein pool with less than 10% N-terminal degraded protein monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas up to 50% N-terminal degraded protein were detected in a second protein pool. Reconstitution kinetics from both protein pools under identical conditions exhibited no significant difference (data not shown). E. coli R2 proteins were prepared as described for wild type in (17Sjöberg B.-M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli apoproteins were produced by growing cells in iron-depleted medium (18Åberg A. Ormö M. Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9845-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). About 150 ml of buffer was thoroughly degassed in a septum-sealed 250-ml bulb for several h. A second bulb containing 5 to 15 mg of Mohr's salt crystals (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 was sealed with a septum and evacuated. The bulbs were repeatedly flushed with oxygen-free argon (L'air liquide, Alphagaz, Sorbal 500) and evacuated. The bulbs were left under a slight excess pressure of argon. A 60-ml plastic syringe was made anaerobic by washing twice with argon gas and twice partly filled with degassed buffer and argon gas. Then the appropriate volume of anaerobic buffer to prepare the desired iron concentration was transferred into the bulb containing Mohr's salt. Rapid freeze-quench (19Ballou D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was performed with a System 1000 apparatus from Update Instruments by mixing 1:1 aerobic protein solution (usually 100 μm) and anaerobic Fe2+solution (400–600 μm). An EPR tube connected with a funnel fixed in a home-built holder was immersed completely into an isopentane bath. The stirred isopentane in the bath was cooled by a steady flow of gaseous N2, which in turn was cooled by liquid N2. For sample preparation stirring was switched off to avoid movement of the funnel and to allow its proper placement beneath the nozzle. Funnels were made from tips for 5-ml Gilson pipetman by cutting off the small end and widening it. One syringe of the System 1000 apparatus was washed twice with the anaerobic Fe2+ solution and then filled for experiments. The stability of both anaerobic Fe2+ solutions in the bulb and in the syringe was tested by transferring them to anaerobic cuvets at different resting times and measuring their UV-visible spectra. Comparisons with a spectrum of freshly prepared Fe2+ and oxidized Fe3+ showed that in both solutions the oxidation of Fe2+ after 6 h was less than 10%. The reaction mixtures were quenched by spraying into isopentane (−100 to −120 °C), and the crystals were packed to the bottom of an EPR tube with known inner diameter using a packing rod from Teflon. The usually recommended isopentane temperature of −140 °C was difficult to maintain with our equipment. Quenching time determination according to Ballou (19Ballou D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed an increase of quenching time from 8 ± 3 ms at −140 °C to 14 ± 3 ms at −100 °C without change in the accuracy of rate determination. As the determined rates of the EPR visible intermediates did not require a further decrease in quenching time (see Table I), we used for practical reasons the much easier obtained isopentane temperatures between −100 °C and −120 °C. The ram velocity was 1 cm/s because this produced crystals that could be packed easily. The isopentane in the EPR tube was removed, and then the EPR tubes were kept for at least 30 min under high vacuum to get rid of the isopentane trapped between the crystals. During this time the tubes were stored in a separate n-pentane bath cooled to −120 °C. Keeping samples under these conditions did not influence the intensity of any detectable EPR signal. Especially, samples containing species X from E. coli and mouseX were tested for stability of signal intensity.Table IKinetic constants (rate kform and final yield (Tyr· /R2)∞) for the reconstitution reaction of wild type, D266A, and W103Y mouse R2 protein at various temperatures and iron/R2 ratiosProteinIron/R2Tkform(Tyr·/R2)∞°Cs−1Wild type450.14 ± 0.020.73 ± 0.074100.35 ± 0.030.77 ± 0.08418aMouse X is visible.2.5 ± 0.20.79 ± 0.07425aMouse X is visible.8.6 ± 0.80.86 ± 0.08432aMouse X is visible.25.2 ± 9.60.88 ± 0.08Wild type650.17 ± 0.021.1 ± 0.086100.20 ± 0.051.0 ± 0.15625aMouse X is visible.7.1 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.05Fe(II)-preloaded wild type640.11 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.08D266A6100.025 ± 0.0040.40 ± 0.086150.050 ± 0.0060.54 ± 0.066250.29 ± 0.040.31 ± 0.05W103Y6100.05 ± 0.010.35 ± 0.086150.13 ± 0.020.50 ± 0.096200.18 ± 0.030.45 ± 0.05Fe(II)-preloaded W103Y6160.11 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.02Values and errors were achieved by fits with GraFit®.a Mouse X is visible. Open table in a new tab Values and errors were achieved by fits with GraFit®. The reaction time was varied by changing the length of the reaction tube between mixer and spray nozzle. The ram velocity was kept constant because it influences the freezing velocity of the crystals and therefore the dead time of the sample. For every time course, a 15-min sample was prepared by push-push mode RFQ and compared with an infinite value prepared from long-aged samples (e.g. contents of the reaction tubes). This comparison yielded the packing factor of about 0.5 used to calculate concentrations in the RFQ samples. For every protein batch a blank sample containing only apoprotein was measured. Slow freeze-quench samples were obtained by hand-mixing. EPR tubes filled with 80 μl of apoprotein and the septum-sealed bulb with the anaerobic Fe2+ solution were thermostated at the reaction temperature. A gas-tight Hamilton syringe with a long needle was washed several times with the anaerobic Fe2+ solution to remove oxygen. Then, 80 μl of Fe2+ solution was thermostated inside the syringe at the reaction temperature by immersing the syringe but not the end of the needle into the water bath. After temperature equilibration, the iron solution was swiftly injected into the apoprotein solution, and the reaction was stopped by immersing the EPR tube in coldn-pentane (−120 °C). For very short time points like 4 s, the mixing was done quickly above the n-pentane bath. The results confirmed that this was done rapidly enough to avoid changes in temperature. To investigate if iron binding is the rate-limiting step in the reconstitution reaction or if it is affected by the mutation, both wild type and W103Y R2 proteins were preincubated with ferrous iron before oxygen addition. An EPR tube fitted with a stopcock was filled with 200 μl of protein solution (approximately 23–30 μm). Anaerobic protein solution was obtained by equilibration of the EPR tube with argon for 30 min on ice. Then a 3–4-fold molar excess of ferrous iron (a freshly prepared, argon-purged solution of Mohr's salt) was added anaerobically to the protein. The mixture was then preincubated at 4 °C (wild type R2) or 16 °C (W103Y R2) for 5 min. Then a 3-fold molar excess of oxygen was added in form of 50 μl of oxygen-saturated water equilibrated at the reaction temperature. The reaction was stopped as described above (SFQ). The EPR measurements were made at 9 GHz (X-band) on a Bruker ESP 300 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments continuous flow cryostat for temperatures below 77 K or a cold finger Dewar for 77 K. Signals were measured at three different microwave powers to ensure that they were not saturated with microwave power. An average spin concentration was calculated by comparison with a 1 mm copper standard (12 mmH3ClO4, pH 1.8) or a mouse R2 standard with a well known radical content calibrated earlier against the copper standard. Composite spectra containing the signal of the stable tyrosyl radical (Tyr⋅) and the new EPR singlet (mouse X) were evaluated by subtracting fractions of the Tyr⋅ spectrum of the corresponding 15-min sample using the ESP 300 software. The concentration of mouse X given by the resulting spectra was determined by comparison with the copper standard. The concentration of Tyr⋅ in these composite spectra was calculated in two ways, from the multiplication factor used and the Tyr⋅ content of the 15-min samples and by the difference between total radical and mouseX concentration. The Tyr⋅ concentrations measured were corrected for the Tyr⋅ content of the blank. The packing factor was estimated by comparing the Tyr⋅ concentration in samples frozen directly and those that were produced by RFQ, both aged for long reaction times. The Tyr⋅ concentrations were divided by the protein concentration corrected for the packing factor. Tyr⋅/R2 versus time plots were first evaluated with a first order rate equation including a variable for the dead time, which varied between 13 and 30 ms. For presentation in the figures, the dead time was added to the reaction times calculated from the length of the reaction tube. The reconstitution reaction of wild type mouse R2 with 4 or 6 Fe(II)/R2 was investigated at several temperatures between 5 and 32 °C by RFQ and SFQ methods. At 5 and 10 °C reaction temperatures none of the EPR spectra recorded between 4 and 77 K from RFQ or SFQ samples quenched from 8 ms reaction times up did reveal any EPR visible species beside Tyr⋅. As shown in the inset of Fig.1, all spectra recorded have about the same shape as the final spectrum after 15 min, showing only the stable Tyr⋅. Fig. 1 (filled symbols) shows the time course of the reconstitution reaction of apo wild type mouse R2 at 5 °C with 4 Fe(II)/R2. The curve obtained by RFQ samples could be fitted to the first order rate equation (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), yielding a formation ratekform = 0.14 s−1 (TableI, Equation 1). [Tyr·][R2]t=[Tyr·][R2]∞×1−e−kform×tEquation 1 where ([Tyr⋅]/[R2])t,∞ are the concentration ratios at time t and at long times, respectively. Both ([Tyr⋅]/[R2])∞ andkform (Table I) are parameters determined by fitting Equation 1 to the experimental points ([Tyr⋅]/[R2])t. With 4 Fe(II)/R2, the maximal yield was 0.8 Tyr⋅/R2. With 6 Fe(II)/R2, the amount was increased to 1.1 Tyr⋅/R2 without change of kform, in good agreement with previous results (11Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 12Ochiai E. Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15758-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SFQ samples gave the same kinetic results as the RFQ samples, showing that both methods are compatible (Fig. 1, filled triangles). Scheme FS1 will yield a very complex kinetic pattern for formation and decay of its intermediates if the rates are such that all intermediates can accumulate to reasonable amounts (≥0.1 [Tyr⋅]∞). If one or more intermediates do not accumulate, the mathematical description can be simplified. In the case of mouse R2, the situation seems to be even simpler as we detect no intermediate but only the product Tyr⋅. This is the classical pattern of a kinetic reaction including a rate-limiting step, where the time dependence of the product is described by Equation 1. Equation 1 derives from time dependence of C in a consecutive reaction (Reaction 1), A→kaB→kbC REACTION1shown in Equation 2 and the condition kb ≫ka. C=A01+kae−kbt−kbe−katkb−kaEquation 2 From kb ≫ka, it follows that kb −ka ≈ kb andkae−kbt−kbe−kat≈ −kbe−kat; inserting them in Equation 2 yields Equation 1. As we cannot follow the different states of the iron by EPR, we cannot exclude that early intermediates, e.g. R2 − [Fe2O2]4+, might accumulate, but the effects of the mutations, as we will see below, show clearly thatkform is dominated by k5in Scheme FS1. Thus, we used Equation 1 for fitting the kinetics of Tyr⋅ in all our measurements. The mutation W103F interrupts the hydrogen-bonded chain formed by conserved residues from the surface of the R2 protein to the iron site. Any change in the reconstitution reaction of such a mutant protein may be regarded as a hint that this particular hydrogen bond is involved in the delivery of the external electron and may elucidate some aspects of the reaction mechanism. Up to now it was not clear whether W103F forms an unstable Tyr⋅ or does not at all form Tyr⋅ upon reconstitution, whereas its light absorption spectra indicates formation of a normal iron center (10Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2107547344,"Newly synthesized phosphatidylinositol phosphates have been implicated in many membrane-trafficking reactions. They are essential for exocytosis of norepinephrine in PC12 cells and chromaffin cells, suggesting a function in membrane fusion. We have now studied the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates in synaptic vesicle exocytosis using synaptosomes. Under conditions where phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositols is blocked, norepinephrine secretion was nearly abolished whereas glutamate and GABA release was still elicited. Thus phosphatidylinositides are essential only for some membrane fusion reactions, and exocytotic release mechanisms differ between neurotransmitters."

In a first series of experiments, the possible involvement of the cytoskeleton in the control of CPT-I activity was studied. The results of these investigations can be summarized as follows. (i) Very mild treatment of permeabilized hepatocytes with trypsin produced around 50% stimulation of CPT-I activity. This effect was absent in cells that had been pretreated with okadaic acid (OA) and seemed to be due to the action of trypsin on cell component(s) distinct from CPT-I. (ii) Incubation of intact hepatocytes with 3,3′-iminodipropionitrile, a disruptor of intermediate filaments, increased CPT-I activity in a non-additive manner with respect to OA. Taxol, a stabilizer of the cytoskeleton, prevented the OA- and 3,3′-iminodipropionitrile-induced stimulation of CPT-I. (iii) CPT-I activity in isolated mitochondria was depressed in a dose-dependent fashion by the addition of a total cytoskeleton fraction and a cytokeratin-enriched cytoskeletal fraction, the latter being 3 times more potent than the former. In a second series of experiments, the possible link between Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CM-PKII) and the cytoskeleton was studied in the context of CPT-I regulation. The data of these experiments indicate that (i) purified Ca2+/CM-PKII activated CPT-I in permeabilized hepatocytes but not in isolated mitochondria, (ii) purified Ca2+/CM-PKII abrogated the inhibition of CPT-I of isolated mitochondria induced by a cytokeratin-enriched fraction, and (iii) the Ca2+/CM-PKII inhibitor KN-62 prevented the OA-induced phosphorylation of cytokeratins in intact hepatocytes. Results thus support a novel mechanism of short-term control of hepatic CPT-I activity which may rely on the cascade Ca2+/CM-PKII activation → cytokeratin phosphorylation → CPT-I de-inhibition.

The data of these experiments indicate that (i) purified Ca2+/CM-PKII activated CPT-I in permeabilized hepatocytes but not in isolated mitochondria, (ii) purified Ca2+/CM-PKII abrogated the inhibition of CPT-I of isolated mitochondria induced by a cytokeratin-enriched fraction, and (iii) the Ca2+/CM-PKII inhibitor KN-62 prevented the OA-induced phosphorylation of cytokeratins in intact hepatocytes. Results thus support a novel mechanism of short-term control of hepatic CPT-I activity which may rely on the cascade Ca2+/CM-PKII activation → cytokeratin phosphorylation → CPT-I de-inhibition. Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in liver provides a major source of energy to this organ and supplies extrahepatic tissues with ketone bodies as a glucose-replacing fuel (1McGarry J.D.

Moreover, recent determination of flux control coefficients of the enzymes involved in hepatic long-chain fatty acid oxidation shows that CPT-I plays a pivotal role in controlling the flux through this pathway under different substrate concentrations and pathophysiological states (6Drynan L. Quant P.A. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Spurway T.D. Sherrat H.S.A. Pogson C.I. Agius L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CPT-I is subject to long-term regulation in response to alterations in the nutritional and hormonal status of the animal (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Diabetes Rev. 1994; 2: 132-155Google Scholar, 5McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Short-term control of CPT-I activity involves inhibition by malonyl-CoA, the product of the reaction catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (8McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Since the latter enzyme is a key regulatory site of fatty acid synthesis de novo (cf. Refs. 1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Zammit V.A. Diabetes Rev. 1994; 2: 132-155Google Scholar, 3Guzmán M. Geelen M.J.H. Biochim.

Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-I allows an elegant explanation for the coordinate control of the partition of hepatic fatty acids into esterification and oxidation. As a matter of fact, evidence has accumulated during the last two decades highlighting the physiological importance of malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-I not only in liver but also in extrahepatic tissues (1McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J.

During the last years, however, a novel mechanism of control of hepatic CPT-I activity has been put forward. Studies using permeabilized hepatocytes have shown that various agents exert short-term changes in CPT-I activity in parallel with changes in the rate of long-chain fatty acid oxidation (3Guzmán M. Geelen M.J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Guzmán M. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These short-term changes in hepatic CPT-I activity are assumed to be mediated by a malonyl-CoA-independent mechanism, since they survive cell permabilization, extensive washing of the permeabilized cells (to allow complete removal of malonyl-CoA), and subsequent preincubation of the cell ghosts at 37 °C before determination of CPT-I activity (to allow recovery of the original conformational state of CPT-I) (10Guzmán M. Kolodziej M.P. Caldwell A. Costorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Evidence has also been presented showing that the stimulation of hepatic CPT-I by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (OA), used as a model compound to study the short-term regulation of CPT-I, does not involve the direct phosphorylation of CPT-I (10Guzmán M. Kolodziej M.P. Caldwell A. Costorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that the OA-induced stimulation of CPT-I is prevented by KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ca2+/CM-PKII) (11Velasco G. Guzmán M. Zammit V.A. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and by taxol, a stabilizer of the cytoskeleton (12Velasco G. Sánchez C. Geelen M.J.H. Guzmán M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that both activation of Ca2+/CM-PKII and disruption of the cytoskeleton may be necessary for the OA-induced stimulation of CPT-I to be demonstrated. It is conceivable that these two processes may be related, since Ca2+/CM-PKII is one of the protein kinases more actively involved in the control of the integrity of the cytoskeleton by phosphorylating cytoskeletal proteins (13Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). However, the events underlying this novel mechanism of control of CPT-I activity are as yet unknown. The present work was thus undertaken to study the molecular basis of the malonyl-CoA-independent short-term control of hepatic CPT-I activity. l-[methyl-3H]Carnitine, carrier-free [32P]Pi, [1-14C] acetyl-CoA, the ECL detection kit, and the protein kinase C assay kit were from Amersham International (Amersham, Bucks, United Kingdom). Tetradecylglycidate was kindly donated by Dr. J. M. Lowenstein (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA). The anti-CPT-I polyclonal antibody (raised against peptide residues 428–441 of rat liver CPT-I) was kindly given by Dr. V. A. Zammit (Hannah Research Institute, Ayr, United Kingdom). The anti-cytokeratin 8, anti-cytokeratin 18, and anti-actin monoclonal antibodies were kindly given by Dr. P. M. P. Van Bergen en Henegouwen (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Colchicine and cytochalasin B were kindly gifted by Dr. J. M. Andreu (CIB, Madrid, Spain). 3,3′-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) was from Acros Chimica (Geel, Belgium). OA, KN-62, A23187, and classical protein kinase C were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Ca2+/CM-PKII was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Purified cytokeratins 8 and 18 were from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). cAMP-dependent protein kinase, trypsin, and the anti-actin and anti-pan cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) which had free access to food and water were used in all experiments. Hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method and routinely incubated in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 1% (w/v) defatted and dialyzed bovine serum albumin as described before (9Guzmán M. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated either from hepatocytes or from intact liver and CPT-I activity was measured as the malonyl-CoA-sensitive incorporation of radiolabeledl-carnitine into palmitoylcarnitine exactly as described before (10Guzmán M. Kolodziej M.P. Caldwell A. Costorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When CPT-I activity was determined in suspensions of mitochondria containing cytoskeletal fractions (Figs. 3 and 4), CPT activity in the cytoskeletal fractions was subtracted from the CPT-I activity experimentally determined. In any event, CPT activity determined in those cytoskeletal fractions was always marginal and on the basis of protein content never accounted for more than 5% of the CPT-I activity measured in mitochondrial suspensions. Preparations of mitochondria were practically devoid of peroxisomes, as judged from the low recovery of catalase activity (<5%) in those preparations.Figure 4Effect of Ca 2+ /CM-PKII on CPT-I activity. Rat liver mitochondria (1.5–2.0 mg of protein/ml) were preincubated for 30 min in the absence (−) or presence (+) of cytoskeletal Fraction II (0.05–0.06 mg of protein/ml). Purified Ca2+/CM-PKII was subsequently added (+) or not (−) to the incubations, which were run for 10 additional min. Aliquots were subsequently taken to determine CPT-I activity.

Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In other experiments, however, CPT-I activity was determined by a more complex procedure (Fig. 1). In this “two-step” assay, hepatocytes are permeabilized with digitonin, and then extensively washed with a medium containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mmpotassium fluoride, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm EGTA. The permeabilized cell pellets were taken up in that medium with the additions indicated and CPT-I activity was subsequently determined after preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min (10Guzmán M.

Mitochondrial fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and proteins were further transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were then blocked with 5% fat-free dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. They were subsequently incubated with the anti-CPT-I antibody (1:10,000) in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20 for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed thoroughly. The blots were then incubated with anti-sheep peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature, and finally subjected to luminography with an ECL detection kit. Isolated hepatocytes were sedimented (2 min at 100 × g) and resuspended in a cytoskeleton stabilizing buffer consisting of 10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 0.25 m sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with a proteinase/inhibitor mixture (11Velasco G.

J. 1995; 311: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fraction corresponding to total cytoskeleton (Fraction I) as well as the fraction enriched in intermediate filaments (Fraction II) were prepared according to van Bergen en Henegouwen et al.

Cytoskeletal fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and proteins were further transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The blots were then blocked with 2% Protifar (Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). They were subsequently incubated with the anti-actin, anti-tubulin, anti-cytokeratin 8, and anti-cytokeratin 18 monoclonal antibodies (1:10,000) in TBST with 0.2% Protifar for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed thoroughly. The blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature, and finally subjected to luminography with the ECL detection kit. After isolation, hepatocytes were washed twice in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) defatted and dialyzed bovine serum albumin. Hepatocytes (6–8 mg of cellular protein in 1.5 ml of the aforementioned medium) were subsequently incubated in that medium at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.2 mCi of [32P]Pi and subsequently exposed to the additions indicated. One ml of cells was rapidly sedimented (5 s at 12,000 × g) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) Igepal, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS, supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (11Velasco G.

J. 1995; 311: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Further treatment of the samples and immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal anti-pan cytokeratin antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose were performed as described (11Velasco G. Guzmán M. Zammit V.A. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Guzmán M. Bijleveld C. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of cytokeratin phosphorylation was calculated by simultaneously determining (i) the specific radioactivity of the γ-phosphate of intracellular ATP, (ii) the amount of 32P incorporated into the cytokeratin bands, and (iii) the mass of protein in those cytokeratin bands. (i) To determine the specific radioactivity of the γ-phosphate of intracellular ATP, hepatocytes were labeled with 32P for 60 min to achieve steady-state labeling of proteins before addition of the agonists (16Avruch J. Witters L.A. Alexander M.C. Bush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4754-4761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the indicated times, 1.0 ml of cells was precipitated with 0.15 ml of 2 m HClO4. After neutralization with K2CO3, samples were centrifuged (20,000 × g, 15 min). Supernatants were filtered through a filter of 0.22-μm pore diameter and subsequently used for nucleotide separation exactly as described by Gualix et al. (17Gualix J. Abal M. Pintor J. Garcı́a-Carmona F. Miras-Portugal M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1957-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of nucleotides was determined by measuring in parallel the nucleotide concentration after transformation of the A259 peak areas to masses by correlation with standards and the 32P incorporation into those peaks (18Holland R. Witters L.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the γ-phosphate of ATP was taken to be the difference between the specific activities of ATP and ADP (18Holland R. Witters L.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Haystead T.A.J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). (ii) To determine the amount of 32P incorporated into cytokeratins, immunoprecipitates were obtained and treated exactly as described above, the two labeled bands in the gels were cut out and their radioactivity was determined. (iii) To determine the amount of protein in the labeled bands corresponding to cytokeratins 8 and 18, immunoprecipitates were obtained exactly as described above except that [32P]Pi was omitted from the hepatocyte incubation medium. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE together with varying concentrations of purified cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18. Bands were visualized by the silver staining technique (20Ohsawa K. Ebata N. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the amount of protein in the cytokeratin bands was calculated by interpolating the values of optical density of the immunoprecipitated protein bands in the standard curve of protein massversus optical density constructed with the commercial, purified cytokeratins 8 and 18. The standard curve was corrected for the contaminating proteins present in the commercial preparations of purified cytokeratins 8 and 18. In order to improve the visualization of the stained protein bands of the immunoprecipitate (e.g. Fig. 6), the amount of immunoprecipitate applied for determination of cytokeratin mass was routinely 3 times the amount used for other purposes (e.g. cytokeratin phosphorylation, Western blotting). Values of cytokeratin mass inferred were corrected for this factor. Permeabilized hepatocytes or isolated mitochondria (1.5–2.0 mg of protein/ml), supplemented or not with cytoskeletal fractions (as indicated in every case), were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in either of the following phosphorylation media, and aliquots of the incubations were subsequently taken to determine CPT-I activity as described above. (i) Ca2+/CM-PKII phosphorylation medium contained 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 30 ng/μl calmodulin, 50 nm OA, and 0.6 ng/μl purified Ca2+/CM-PKII, essentially as recommended by the supplier. (ii) cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation medium was exactly as described before (10Guzmán M. Kolodziej M.P. Caldwell A. Costorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (iii) Protein kinase C phosphorylation medium contained 3 milliunits/μl purified protein kinase C and the assay components according to the supplier. Intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA were determined in neutralized perchloric acid extracts by a radioenzymatic method (15Guzmán M. Bijleveld C. Geelen M.J.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, results shown represent the mean ± S.D. of the number of hepatocyte preparations indicated in each case. Incubations of hepatocytes or mitochondria as well as enzyme assays were always carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by Student'st test. In a first set of experiments aimed at determining whether extramitochondrial components may be involved in the control of CPT-I activity (12Velasco G. Sánchez C. Geelen M.J.H. Guzmán M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), permeabilized hepatocytes were treated with trypsin in very mild conditions (low doses, 4 °C, 2 min) and CPT-I activity was subsequently determined. As shown in Fig.1, when hepatocytes were incubated without further additions and then permeabilized with digitonin, trypsin was able to stimulate CPT-I by approximately 50% in these cell ghosts. Preincubation of hepatocytes with OA led to a similar activation of CPT-I in the permeabilized cell system (Fig. 1). However, trypsin was unable to produce any further stimulation of CPT-I in ghosts prepared from OA-pretreated hepatocytes (Fig. 1). The cytoskeletal stabilizer taxol has been shown to prevent the changes in hepatic CPT-I activity induced by a number of cellular effectors including OA (12Velasco G. Sánchez C. Geelen M.J.H. Guzmán M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).

After trypsin removal, CPT-I activity was determined in permeabilized cells or in mitochondria isolated from those permeabilized hepatocytes. Results correspond to four different experiments. To test whether trypsin may cleave CPT-I itself under these digestion conditions, mitochondria were isolated from control and trypsin-treated permeabilized hepatocytes and CPT-I was subsequently detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1). As expected (5McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar), a major band with a molecular mass of 88 kDa was detected in the blots. In addition, no differences were observed between the two preparations of mitochondria (Fig. 1). T"
https://openalex.org/W2078336183,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a clonal disorder of the pluripotent haemopoietic stem cell, the hallmark of which is the constitutively activated Bcr–Abl protein tyrosine kinase. During the initial chronic phase of CML the primitive multipotent leukaemic progenitor cells remain growth factor dependant and are capable of producing terminally differentiated cells. Although the available evidence suggests that Bcr–Abl directly affects signalling pathways involved in controlling the development of primitive haemopoietic progenitors the identification of the specific biological consequences of Bcr–Abl activity in these progenitors has been hampered by the lack of suitable systems modelling CML. By transfecting the multipotent haemopoietic cell line FDCP-Mix with a temperature sensitive mutant of Bcr–Abl we have developed the first working model that mirrors the chronic phase of CML. FDCP-Mix cells expressing Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase activity remain growth factor dependent and retain their ability to differentiate. Normal neutrophilic cells are formed in response to G-CSF and GM-CSF. In addition, the transfected FDCP-Mix cells grown at the permissive temperature for Bcr–Abl tyrosine kinase activity display enhanced survival and proliferation in low concentrations of growth factor. These findings are consistent with the initial subtle changes seen in CML progenitor cells during the chronic phase and confirm that Bcr–Abl effects are context specific, i.e. they depend on the origin and developmental potential of the transfected cells. This questions the significance of studies in non-haemopoietic and differentiation blocked haemopoietic cells."

Here we show that this phenomenon may be attributable to a subunit-specific chemical modification of the receptor directly by the toxin. N-Methyl-d-aspartate (30 μm)-induced whole cell responses in mature (22–29 daysin vitro) rat cortical neurons were potentiated nearly 2-fold by a 3–5-min treatment with 2 mm potassium cyanide, as did a similar treatment with 4 mm dithiothreitol. A 1-min incubation with the thiol oxidant 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (0.5 mm) readily reversed the potentiation induced by either cyanide or dithiothreitol. Cyanide did not increase further currents previously potentiated by dithiothreitol nor was it able to potentiate responses during brief co-application with the agonist. Transient expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells with wild-type and mutated recombinantN-methyl-d-aspartate subunits (NR) demonstrated that cyanide selectively potentiated NR1/NR2A receptors, presumably via the chemical reduction of NR2A. In contrast, currents mediated by NR1/NR2B receptors were somewhat diminished by the metabolic inhibitor. Some of the effects of cyanide on NR1/NR2B receptors may be mediated by the formation of a thiocyanate adduct with a cysteine residue located in NR1. Cyanide thus is able to distinguish chemically between two different N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subtypes and produce diametrically opposing functional effects.

Cyanide is a mitochondrial poison that adversely affects cellular respiration by inhibiting the reoxidation of cytochromea3 by molecular oxygen, thereby obstructing the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation (1Lehninger A. Biochemistry. Worth Publishers, New York1978: 477-508Google Scholar). Cytochromea3 and cytochrome a form the cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is the terminal enzyme in the electron transport chain. Transferring electrons to oxygen, cytochrome c oxidase is the cellular respiratory component responsible for the critical need for oxygen. Thus, cyanide intoxication in cells is akin to oxygen starvation. In neuronal systems, cyanide treatment has been a widely used model of hypoxia (2Kanthasamy A.G. Borowitz J.L. Pavlakovic G.

Interestingly, a direct interaction between cyanide and the NMDA receptor has recently been demonstrated. Cyanide treatment of cultured rat hippocampal or cerebellar neurons potentiated NMDA-induced physiological responses, including single channel activity in excised outside-out membrane patches (15Patel M.N. Peoples R.W. Yim G.K. Isom G.E. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1319-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Sun P. Rane S.G. Gunasekar P.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1341-1348PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise site of action of cyanide at the receptor remained to be elucidated. In the present investigations we have evaluated the possible interaction of KCN on the NMDA receptor redox modulatory sites (17Aizenman E. Lipton S.A. Loring R.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Via these sites, disulfide-reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT; see Refs. 17Aizenman E. Lipton S.A.

Lett. 1995; 189: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) can reverse the effects of reductants or depress native responses. Cyanide has well established properties as a disulfide reducing agent in many preparations (27Catsimpoolas N. Wood J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4132-4137Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28Vanaman T.C. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wagner P.D. Yount R.G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17520-17524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus an effect on the NMDA thiol-sensitive sites would not be surprising. Nonetheless, the experiments described here demonstrate that cyanide can be used to distinguish between different NMDA receptor subtypes by producing either a potentiation or a depression of the physiological responses mediated by this ligand-gated ion channel. Tissue culture and all common reagents were purchased from Sigma, excluding the following: iron-supplemented bovine calf serum, HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT), and minimal essential medium, Life Technologies, Inc. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1; ATTC CCL61) were grown in Ham's F-12 nutrient medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1 mm glutamine (CHO media) in 50- or 200-ml flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were passaged at a 1:10 dilution at 80% confluency, approximately every 2 days, no more than 30 times. Cerebral cortices were obtained from E-16 Sprague-Dawley C-D rats and dissociated according to methods described previously (31Hartnett K.A. Stout A.K. Rajdev S. Rosenberg P.A. Reynolds I.J. Aizenman E. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, cortices were incubated in minimal essential medium solution containing 0.03% trypsin for 2 h at 37 °C. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of 3–5 × 105 cells/ml in growth medium (v/v 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum, 10% Ham's F12 nutrient mixture, 10% heat-inactivated iron-supplemented bovine calf serum, 25 mmHEPES, 24 units/ml penicillin, 24 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine) into 35-mm tissue culture dishes containing five 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips each, for electrophysiological recordings. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Growth medium was changed three times per week. After 15 days in culture, non-neuronal cell proliferation was inhibited with 2 μm cytosine arabinoside after which the growth medium contained 2% serum and no F-12. Cells were mostly used between 22 and 29 days in vitro(DIV), although some later experiments utilized cells at 8 DIV. The cDNAs for the NMDA subunits and the positive transfection marker green fluorescent protein (32Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5409) Google Scholar) were previously subcloned into mammalian expression vectors (33Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 173: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar, 35Brimecombe J.C. Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 11019-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates (35-mm wells) approximately 24 h prior to transfection with 1.3 μg of total DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free CHO media per well. Of the total DNA 0.3 μg were green fluorescent protein-containing plasmid, and the remaining 1 μg was composed of a 1:3 ratio of NR1- to NR2-containing plasmids (34Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar). After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with the transfection solution, cells were refed with CHO medium containing 300 μm ketamine or 1 mm5,7-dichlorokynurenate to prevent the cell death that accompanies NMDA receptor expression (34Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were used for recording approximately 40–50 h after the start of the transfection. A construct containing the cDNA for rat NR1 pN60 (36Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar) was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis to produce NR1(C744S). Mutagenic primers (36-mers) were designed to mutate the codon for cysteine 744, TGC, to that of serine, TCC, utilizing a commercially available PCR-based procedure (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1.25 min; 18 cycles of 94 °C for 0.75 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 15 min; and a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. To remove methylated template DNA, the PCR products were restriction-digested with DpnI (Stratagene). Epicurian Coli XL-1 Blue supercompetent Escherichia coli(Stratagene) were heat shock-transformed with the PCR products and colonies selected; plasmid DNA was isolated and digested withHindIII and NotI (Life Technologies, Inc.) to excise the mutated NR1 cDNA. This was subcloned into the equivalent restriction sites of pRc/CMV. Sequencing of the restriction fragment was performed to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and absence of spontaneous unwanted sequence alterations. The NR1(C744A,C798A) double mutant was the kind gift of S. Traynelis, Emory University, Atlanta, GA. Electrophysiological measurements were obtained at a membrane voltage of −60 mV using the whole cell patch-clamp configuration. Methods of data acquisition and analysis have been described previously (18Tang L.H. Aizenman E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The external recording solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 μm glycine (pH 7.2). For recordings from cortical neurons 0.25 μm tetrodotoxin (Calbiochem) was added to this solution. Patch electrodes (2–4 MΩ) were filled with 140 mm CsF, 10 mm EGTA (Sigma), 1 mmCaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). NMDA, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), DTT, potassium cyanide (KCN) orN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) were dissolved in extracellular solution and applied onto cells by a multi-barrel fast perfusion system (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). All results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. For statistical comparisons a parametric test (t test) was used, unless the standard deviations of the two groups analyzed were significantly different from each other, in which case a non-parametric test was utilized (Mann Whitney two sample test). Cyanide as a disulfide-reducing agent is used in biochemical experiments at concentrations in the range of 1–40 mm (27Catsimpoolas N. Wood J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4132-4137Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 28Vanaman T.C. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wagner P.D. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1900-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Since the NMDA receptor reduction process is both time- and concentration-dependent (18Tang L.H. Aizenman E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we opted to use a concentration roughly 2–20 times higher than the concentrations utilized by Isom and co-workers (100 μm to 1 mm; see Refs. 15Patel M.N. Peoples R.W. Yim G.K. Isom G.E. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1319-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar and 16Sun P. Rane S.G. Gunasekar P.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1341-1348PubMed Google Scholar) to accelerate and maximize the reduction process but without damaging the cells. Cortical neurons were therefore incubated for several minutes in extracellular recording solution containing 2 mm KCN. Whole cell measurements of NMDA (30 μm) receptor-mediated currents were performed under control conditions and at 1-min intervals during the KCN treatment (Fig. 1 A). During the KCN incubation itself, we noted a rapid, small, variable increase in inward leak current, which always decreased in amplitude and eventually disappeared a few seconds later, even while the toxin was still present in the bath. We observed that the NMDA-induced responses increased in amplitude in a time-dependent fashion during the cyanide exposure. After a 3-min treatment with the mitochondrial inhibitor, the NMDA-generated currents had increased 1.6 ± 0.8-fold (x-fold =x2/x1; n= 10) over control responses; by 5 min, responses were potentiated 1.8 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3). This action of KCN in cortical neurons is similar to that reported earlier for NMDA-induced responses in cerebellar granule cells (16Sun P. Rane S.G. Gunasekar P.G. Borowitz J.L. Isom G.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1341-1348PubMed Google Scholar). The oxidizing agent DTNB (0.5 mm) quickly (<1 min) and effectively reversed the actions of KCN and further depressed the NMDA-induced current amplitudes to 81.1 ± 17.3% (n = 3) of the initial control responses (Fig. 1 A). Hence, KCN produced effects on the NMDA receptor resembling those previously reported for the sulfhydryl-reducing agent DTT (17Aizenman E. Lipton S.A. Loring R.H. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1257-1263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 18Tang L.H. Aizenman E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also monitored whole cell responses to brief (1–1.5 s) applications of either NMDA (30 μm) or KCN (2 mm) alone or both these drugs together (Fig. 1 B). Currents induced by NMDA + KCN were slightly (6.0 ± 5.3%; n = 6) but significantly (p < 0.001, paired t test) smaller than those induced by NMDA. Moreover, KCN alone was able to elicit inward currents but with maximal amplitudes that were only 8.0 ± 4.2% (n = 6) of the NMDA-elicited responses. These KCN-induced currents are thus likely responsible for the aforementioned transient increase in current during the first few seconds of the prolonged incubations with the toxin. The potentiating actions of KCN on the NMDA-induced currents thus required relatively longer incubation periods (>3 min) with the toxin, again reminiscent of the actions of DTT in this preparation (18Tang L.H. Aizenman E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To test whether DTT and KCN altered NMDA receptor-mediated currents via a similar mechanism, we obtained NMDA-induced responses during a prolonged treatment with DTT (4 mm, approximately 10 min) and following a subsequent exposure to DTT together with 2 mm KCN (6 min; Fig. 1 C). Currents were potentiated during both these treatments 2.6 ± 1.3- and 2.9 ± 1.6-fold, respectively (n = 9). The ratio of DTT + KCN to DTT potentiation for all cells tested was 1.1 ± 0.2. Therefore, KCN was unable to potentiate further NMDA responses after the DTT treatment, suggesting that both these agents act via a common site. To facilitate the examination of the putative actions of KCN on the redox-sensitive sites of the NMDA receptor, we first investigated the actions of DTT and DTNB on recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (33Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 173: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 279: 515-523PubMed Google Scholar, 35Brimecombe J.C. Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 11019-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute cysteine 744 of the NR1 subunit with a serine residue (NR1(C744S)). This mutation abolishes DTT sensitivity in recombinant NMDA receptors composed of NR1 together with either the NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D subunit but not NR2A (37Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 929-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), as this latter subunit may contain a separate DTT-sensitive site (38Köhr G. Eckardt S. Luddens H. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 39Paoletti P. Ascher P. Neyton J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5711-5725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NR1 or NR1(C744S) subunits were transiently transfected into CHO cells along with either NR2A or NR2B to yield four separate groups of cells, each expressing one of the following subunit combinations: NR1/NR2A, NR1(C744S)/NR2A, NR1/NR2B, and NR1(C744S)/NR2B. NMDA (30 μm)-induced responses were recorded from these cells (Fig. 2) during control conditions and following treatments with DTT (4 mm, 3 min) and DTNB (0.5 mm, 1 min). NMDA-evoked currents in NR1/NR2A-, NR1(C744S)/NR2A-, and NR1/NR2B-expressing cells were similarly potentiated by DTT (Table I). As expected, NMDA-induced responses in cells transfected with NR1(C744S)/NR2B were unaltered by the DTT treatment (Table I). In contrast, DTNB depressed the currents in all subunit configurations (Table I). Interestingly, the effects of DTNB on NR2B-containing receptors, but not on NR2A, were significantly greater for the mutated form of NR1, when compared with the wild-type (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney two sample test). In all cases, the inhibitory effects of DTNB were fully reversible by a subsequent incubation with 4 mm DTT. The depressive actions of DTNB on the NR1(C744S)/NR2B subunit configuration could thus be due to the formation of a mixed disulfide (between one-half of the DTNB molecule and a sulfhydryl group in the protein) with a second critical cysteine present on NR1. This amino acid, Cys-798, is also important for the formation of the redox-sensitive site on this subunit (37Sullivan J.M. Traynelis S.F. Chen H.S. Escobar W. Heinemann S.F. Lipton S.A.

A mixed disulfide should be subject to reduction by DTT, and this appears to be the case.Table IEffects of redox agents on recombinant NMDA receptor-mediated currentsNMDA receptor subunit compositionDTTDTNB-fold increase of control response amplitude% control response amplitudeNR1/NR2A2.1 ± 0.673 ± 15NR1(C744S)/NR2A2.3 ± 1.355 ± 13NR1/NR2B1.9 ± 0.578 ± 23NR1(C744S)/NR2B1.0 ± 0.347 ± 86Currents elicited by a 30 μm NMDA application to CHO cells transfected with the NMDA receptor subunits indicated were recorded under control conditions, following a 3-min incubation with 4 mm DTT and after a 1-min treatment with 0.5 mmDTNB. The values given are means ± S.D. from 4 to 7 experiments. Open table in a new tab Currents elicited by a 30 μm NMDA application to CHO cells transfected with the NMDA receptor subunits indicated were recorded under control conditions, following a 3-min incubation with 4 mm DTT and after a 1-min treatment with 0.5 mmDTNB. The values given are means ± S.D. from 4 to 7 experiments. A separate group of CHO cells transfected with the four aforementioned subunit configurations was also incubated with KCN (2 mm, 3–6 min). We observed that cyanide produced a 1.4 ± 0.1-fold potentiation of 30 μm NMDA-elicited responses in cells expressing NR1/NR2A receptors (n = 6), with DTNB (0.5 mm) rapidly (<1 min) reversing this effect (to 82.1 ± 14.1% of control, n = 5; Fig.3 A). Moreover, KCN had a very similar effect to 4 mm DTT in CHO cells transfected with NR1(C744S)/NR2A receptors (1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase,n = 4; Fig. 3 B). The potentiating action of KCN was spontaneously reversible upon washout, albeit slowly, similar to what has been observed following DTT treatment in native receptors (18Tang L.H. Aizenman E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 465: 303-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A concentration-response curve for the potentiating action of KCN on wild-type NR1/NR2A receptors after 3-min incubations was then generated (Fig. 4). The data were fitted to a logistic function; the calculated EC50 of KCN potentiating NMDA-induced responses in this preparation was 0.5 mm. Surprisingly, 2 mm KCN did not potentiate but, in fact, somewhat depressed NMDA-induced currents in cells transfected with NR1/NR2B (to 83.2 ± 14.4% of control; n = 4), even though 4 mm DTT produced its expected response augmentation in these cells (Fig.5 A). A more pronounced current depression by KCN was observed in cells expressing the DTT-insensitive NR1(C744S)/NR2B receptor configuration (to 49.3 ± 15% of control; n = 3; Fig. 5 B). The depressive actions of KCN on the mutant receptor were not reversible by a subsequent treatment with 4 mm DTT. Similar to the effects of DTNB on NR2B-containing receptors, KCN produced a significantly greater depression of the NMDA-induced currents in cells expressing NR1(C744S)/NR2B subunits, when compared with NR1/NR2B (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney two sample test).Figure 4Concentration-response curve for the potentiating actions of KCN on NR1/NR2A receptors. From data such as those shown in Fig. 3 A, the fold increase in 30 μm NMDA-mediated current amplitude was plottedversus the KCN concentration, after a 3-min incubation with the metabolic inhibitor. Symbols represent the mean ± S.E. for 3–6 cells tested at each concentration of KCN. The data were fitted to a logistic function; the calculated EC50 was 0.5 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Effects of KCN on NR2B-containing receptors. A, DTT (4 mm, 3 min) enhanced but KCN (2 mm, 3 min) depressed the NMDA responses in cells transfected with NR1/NR2B subunits. B, in cells expressing DTT-insensitive NR1(C744S)/NR2B receptors, KCN still depressed the NMDA-evoked currents.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The depressing actions of KCN on NR1/NR2B or NR1(C744A)/NR2B receptors could be due to reaction of these substances with either Cys-744 or Cys-798 in the wild-type subunit or with the remaining Cys-798 in the case of the mutant. These interactions would lead to the formation of a DTT-insensitive thiocyanate adduct. In order to test this hypothesis we obtained a series of recordings with a double NR1(C744A,C798A)/NR2B mutant. Interestingly, the inhibitory actions of 2 mm KCN (2 min) were significantly decreased but still present in the double mutant, when compared with the single mutant (p < 0.05, unpaired t test; Fig.6). This effect was not reversible by 4 mm DTT. Responses obtained from NR1(C744A,C798A)/NR2B receptors after cyanide treatment were 84.2 ± 19.9% (n = 6) of control currents, a value very similar to the inhibitory effect of KCN on wild-type NR1/NR2B receptors. Interestingly, 0.5 mm DTNB had a similar inhibitory effect on NR1(C744A,C798)/NR2B receptors (84.2 ± 6.9% of control,n = 5) as in the wild-type NR1/NR2B subunit configuration and significantly different from its effect on the single mutant NR1(C744S)/NR2B (p < 0.0001; unpairedt test). These results support the hypothesis that DTNB and KCN interact with Cys-798 in the single NR1 mutant and suggest a novel effect of these substances with a different site in either the wild-type or double mutant NR1/NR2B receptor. Comparative measurements were obtained on the NR1(C744A,C798A)/NR2A subunit combination. A 3-min incubation with either 2 mm KCN or 4 mm DTT produced a 1.7 ± 0.5-fold (n = 4) or a 2.2 ± 0.8-fold (n = 4) potentiation, respectively, of these receptors. Cortical neurons in culture have been shown to express primarily, but not solely, NR1 and NR2B early in development (42Zhong J. Russell S.L. Pritchett D.B. Molinoff P.B. Williams K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 846-853PubMed Google Scholar, 43Sinor J.D. Aizenman E. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 930Google Scholar). As neurons mature in vitro, expression of NR2A becomes more prominent. Hence, KCN was tested for its ability to alter NMDA (30 μm)-induced responses in young neurons (8 DIV). The metabolic inhibitor produced a modest potentiation of these responses after a 5-min incubation (to 1.2 ± 0.1-fold of control,n = 5). It is possible that the relatively small amounts of NR2A expression at this developmental stage are sufficient to prevent a current depression by KCN in these neurons, such as that seen for the NR1/NR2B combination. Nonetheless, the aforementioned potentiating"

We report here that c-Abl, and to a greater extent a c-Abl mutant defective for DNA-binding, can provoke programmed cell death in p53-deficient tumor cells. Tyrosine kinase mutant K290R is less cytotoxic. In contrast, a C-terminal deletion mutant that lacks the RNA polymerase 11 (PolII)/actin interaction domain, fails to mediate apoptosis unless expressed to very high levels. Cytotoxicity is overcome by coexpression of the apoptosis antagonist E1B 19K protein, and partially overcome by full-length retinoblastoma protein (Rb) or the C pocket fragment of Rb (SEA) that associates with c-Abl. c-Abl is also highly toxic to Saos-2 cells that are deficient for both Rb and p53, indicating that cell death is not the result of inhibition through c-Abl of the anti-apoptotic function of Rb. Finally, p53 and c-Abl combined induce apoptosis stronger than either protein alone. Unlike c-Abl-mediated cell death, apoptosis by p53 is antagonized efficiently only by full-length Rb with intact A/B pocket but not by SEA. Mutant p53 inhibits apoptosis by p53 but not c-Abl. Thus, c-Abl with intact kinase and PolII/ actin-binding domains can affect tumor cell survival independently of Rb and p53."
