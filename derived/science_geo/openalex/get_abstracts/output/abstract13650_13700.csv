https://openalex.org/W1520329190,"In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, the cell wall that contains both the outer membrane layer and the peptidoglycan layer acts as a barrier of the molecular sieve type for the penetration of uncharged saccharides (G. Decad, T. Nakae, and H. Nikaido (1974) Fed. Proc. 33, 1240). Here we examined which of the layers of the cell wall limited the size of the penetrating molecules, by studying the penetration of saccharides into (a) cells whose peptidoglycan layer had been destroyed by lysozyme treatment or growth in the presence of penicillin and (b) isolated outer membrane vesicles. We found that peptidoglycan-defective cells were similar to intact, plasmolyzed cells in that they allowed a partial penetration of stachyose (molecular weight 666), but essentially excluded saccharides with molecular weights higher than 900 to 1000. We also found that the isolated outer membrane acted as a penetration barrier for saccharides. These observations led us to conclude that the outer membrane, rather than peptidoglycan, sets the size limit for the penetration of uncharged, hydrophilic molecules through the E. coli or S. typhimurium cell wall. The isolated outer membrane, however, had an exclusion limit much higher than that found in intact cells. This leakiness could be decreased either by the use of mutants producing extremely deficient lipopolysaccharide, or by trypsin treatment of the isolated membrane followed by heating and slow cooling in the presence of Mg2+. We feel that these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the resealing of the ruptured outer membrane during the isolation procedure is often incomplete, and that cracks and holes thus generated are responsible for the leakiness of the isolated membrane vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W1504264471,"When Escherichia coli K-12 strain PC 0294, which is unable to synthesize adenine nucleotides, thereonine, proline, and leucine, was starved for adenine, the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and AMP fell rapidly. The adenylate energy charge was not affected until the adenine nucleotide pool fell to about 30% of its normal value. Similarly, cells in an adenine-limited chemostat grew at intracellular adenine nucleotide pool values as low as 30% of normal, but the energy charge in all cases was approximately 0.90. Incorporation of [14C]leucine into protein in adenine-starved cells continued rapidly as long as the energy charge was in or near its normal range, even when the concentration of ATP was 30% to 10% of its normal value. When glucose was added to cells that had been resuspended in medium lacking both glucose and adenine, the energy charge rose rapidly but the concentration of ATP fell, presumably because of nucleic acid synthesis. The rate of [14C]leucine incorporation into protein rose rapidly while adenine nucleotide concentrations fell, and then declined roughly in parallel with the energy charge. At a given value of energy and of total concentration of adenine nucleotides, the rate of protein synthesis may, of course, vary with the concentrations of precursors and modifiers; thus, the rate cannot be predicted from knowledge only of the energy charge. Our results suggest, however, that the rate of protein synthesis and the capacity for growth are much more sensitive to changes in the value of the energy charge than to changes in the concentration of ATP. Growth occurs when the ATP concentration is reduced to one-third of its normal value, but has not been observed when the energy charge has fallen by as much as 10%."
https://openalex.org/W2026267714,"The mouse mitochondrial DNA genome has been cloned in Escherichia coli by linking it to the pSC101 plasmid replicon at cohesive-ended cleavage sites generated by Eco Rl restriction endonuclease. The four possible configurations of chimeric molecules that contain the nucleotide sequences of mitochondrial DNA in their native relationship were distinguished by Hind III restriction endonuclease digestion and electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis. Chimeric molecules utilize the pSC101 replication origin and do not maintain the ""D-loop"" region or the low frequency of ribonucleotides found in native mitochondrial DNA. Hybridization of the RNA synthesized in E. coli minicells carrying the four types of chimeras indicates that transcription occurs predominately on the light strand of the mitochondrial DNA in all cases. This result implies that initiation of RNA synthesis occurs within the mitochondrial DNA segment. Although specific polypeptide synthetis is directed by the mitochondrial DNA segment of each of the chimeras in E. coli minicells, the molecular weight distribution of the polypeptides synthesized consists primarily of low molecular weight species and thus differs from that observed in mitochondria in mouse L cells."

https://openalex.org/W1504132303,"The endonuclease specific for apurinic sites in DNA has been isolated from Escherichia coli B41 as a pure monomeric protein of 32,000 daltons. The enzyme hydrolyzes a phosphodiester bond near the apurinic sites in double-stranded DNA; it does not hydrolyze untreated DNA and its action on alkylated DNA is restricted to the apurinic sites always present. This enzyme is not endonuclease II which is most probably a mixture of two enzymes, one a glycosidase (Kirtikar, D. M., and Goldthwait, D. A. (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 71, 2022-2026), the other an endonuclease for apurinic sites which is the enzyme isolated in this work."
https://openalex.org/W1531017504,"Starvation of strains of Escherichia coli which are glycerol auxotrophs and are also defective in beta oxidation results in the accumulation of large amounts of free fatty acid (Cronan, J. E., Jr., Weisberg, L. W., and Allen, R. G. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 5835-5840). We now report that the ratio of saturated to unsaturated species appearing in the free fatty acid fraction depends on the incubation temperature at the time of synthesis of these acids. This result indicates that fatty acid synthesis is one site of the thermal control of phospholipid fatty acid composition. We also report experiments on the incorporation of exogenously supplied fatty acids into membrane phospholipids. The effect of temperature on this incorporation supports the hypothesis that a second site of thermal regulation acts at the level of phosphatidic acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1561659773,"The proteins of the DNA-protein relaxation complex of plasmid ColE1 were labeled with [3H]leucine by growth of ColE1 containing Escherichia coli cells in the presence of this radioactive labeled amino acid. Three major [3H]leucine-labeled proteins are found associated with the supercoiled DNA in the ColE1 relaxation complex. The molecular weights of these proteins, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, are 60,000, 16,000, and 11,000, respectively. Induction of relaxation of the supercoiled DNA by treatment of the complex with sodium dodecyl sulfate results in a dissociation of the two smaller proteins from the DNA. The 60,000 protein, however, remains associated specifically with the nicked strand of the open circular DNA. The strand-specific association of this protein with the relaxed DNA resists heat denaturation of the DNA, sedimentation through an alkaline (pH 12.5) sucrose gradient, and centrifugation to equilibrium in an alkaline (pH 12.5) CsCl gradient."

https://openalex.org/W42809451,"The kinetic properties of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I were simplified to those of a 1 deoxynucleotide substrate reaction by the use of polynucleotide templates. With poly(dA)-oligo(dT) as the template-primer complex, Mg2+ decreases the Km of the substrate dTTP but has little or no effect on the Km of the substrate Mg-dTTP, suggesting that multiple pathways involving the binding of Mg2+, dTTP, and Mg-dTTP are operative in forming the active complex. The Km of free Mg2+, extrapolated to zero concentration of substrate (830 = 62 muM), agrees within a factor of 2 with the dissociation constant of magnesium from 4 +/- 1 sites on the enzyme determined previously by binding studies (Slater, J.P., Tamir, I., Loeb, L.A., and Mildvan, A.S. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 6784-6794). The maximal turnover number with poly(dA) as template is 5.7 +/- 0.7 s-1. Changing the nature of the base in the polydeoxynucleotide template alters the maximal rate of polydeoxynucleotide synthesis by an overall factor of 31 with poly(dC) is greater than poly(dT) is greater than poly(dA) is greater than poly(dG), indicating that pyrimidine templates are copied faster than purine templates. Changing the sugar structure from poly(dA) to poly(rA) causes a 3-fold increase in the rate of template copying. A study of the kinetic effects of all noncomplementary deoxynucleotides with all deoxynucleotide templates, as well as with poly(rA)-oligo(dT), yields complex patterns of activation and inhibition requiring from 1 to 2 additional binding sites for the noncomplementary nucleotides. The kinetically determined affinities of the active site of the enzyme-template-primer complex for the complementary free nucleotide (as measured by Km) generally exceed those for the noncomplementary neuclotides (as measured by KI slope) by 1 or more than 3 orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1497233681,"The location of the protein in the open circular DNA form of the ColE1 DNA-protein relaxation complex, induced by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, has been studied using several enzymes of DNA metabolism. Escherichia coli exonucleases I and III are able to degrade extensively the nicked strand of the relaxed complex from the 3' end. DNA polymerase I can initiate synthesis using the relaxed complex as template-primer and specifically extends the 3' end of the nicked strand. The 5' end of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-relaxed complex, however, is blocked to the 5'-3' hydrolitic action T7 exonuclease. This block remains after trypsin treatment of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-relaxed complex but is removed by Pronase treatment. T4 DNA ligase is unable to seal either the sodium dodecyl sulfate-relaxed complex or the Pronase-treated relaxed complex even after pretreatment of the relaxed complex with T4 DNA polymerase and polynucleotide kinase. However, pretreatment with DNA polymerase I and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates facilitates ligase closure of the Pronase-treated relaxed complex but not the sodium dodecyl sulfate-relaxed complex. These studies indicate that the protein in the relaxed ColE1 complex is located at or near the 5' end of the nicked strand."
https://openalex.org/W1546753073,"Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, Escheichia coli, was purified to near-homogeneity by the procedure of Dowhan, W., Wickner, W. T., and Kennedy, E. P. ((1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 3079-3084) and assayed by following the production of CO2 using gas chromatography. The purified enzyme has an absolute requirement for the surfactant Triton X-100. The function of Triton in the assay is evaluated and a kinetic scheme describing the action of this membrane-bound enzyme in the micellar system provided by the surfactant is presented. According to this scheme, the enzyme first binds to a mixed micelle, composed of phosphatidylserine and Triton, where the dissociation constant is KSA. The enzyme, now part of the mixed micelle, then binds the substrate phosphatidylserine in its active site and this binding is related to the Michaelis constant, KMB. KSA, expressed as the sum of the molar concentrations of Triton and phosphatidylserine, is about 0.04 M. KMB, expressed as the mole fraction of phosphatidylserine in the mixed micelles, is about 0.03. Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity toward phosphatidylserine in human erythrocyte ghosts was also determined. The amount of phsophatidylserine converted to phosphatidylethanolamine and CO2 was found to be related to the amount of phosphatidylserine solubilized from the membrane by Triton X-100. In the absence of Triton, no significant activity of the enzyme toward the ghosts was detected even after subjecting the ghosts to lyophilization, homogenization, or sonication."

https://openalex.org/W1532029911,"The freshly prepared crude cytoplasmic fraction of aqueously extracted KB cells contains a single major species of DNA polymerase activity (DNA polymerase C) that sediments homogeneously in low ionic strength sucrose gradients with a peak at 10.8 S. The enzyme activity from frozen crude extracts sediments heterogeneously under these conditions with peaks at 8.4 and 10 S. In 0.45 M salt-containing gradients all of the polymerase activity is recovered as a single 6.4 S species. When purified to a specific activity of 7,300, DNA polymerase C sediments in low ionic strength gradients as a single species of 6.5 S. From combined sedimentation and gel filtration analysis, we estimate the molecular weight of the active protomeric species of the polymerase to be about 170,000. Under no conditions of ionic strength does the enzyme disaggregate to active species smaller than 6.4 to 6.5 S. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis of the most highly purified enzyme fractions reveals two major protein bands of 87,000 and 175,000 daltons, respectively. These data suggest that DNA polymerase C contains an 87,000-dalton component and permit the interpretation that the active protomer of Mr equal 170,000 may be a dimer. The purified enzyme shows maximal activity with gapped duplex DNA and has an absolute requirement for 3'-hydroxyl termini. It utilizes initiated polydeoxynucleotide templates poorly and initiated polyribonucleotide templates not at all. Although the polymerase is inhibited by PPi it has only minimal ability to promote PPi exchange (0.8% of the polymerase activity). The purified enzyme is free of endonuclease and exonuclease activities (less than or equal to 0.003% of the polymerase activity) and demonstrates no primer-template-dependent conversion of substrate dNTP to free dNMP during the polymerization reaction. Finally, DNA polymerase C does not excise misparied primer termini from a synthetic homopolymer primer-template but can utilize such termini as initiation sites, although at a very slow rate."
https://openalex.org/W1550899964,"The interactions of several dicarboxylic acids and monoanions with Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase and with its catalytic subunit have been studied by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy and steady state kinetics, with the following major findings. 1. A variety of dicarboxylic acids compete with carbamyl-P for the active sites of unliganded catalytic subunit, with steric requirements very different from those important for competition with L-aspartate for the subunit/carbamyl-P complex. Competition with carbamyl-P is much reduced if the dicarboxylic acid has a positively charged amino group. Acetate and chloride also compete. 2. At pH 7, equal concentrations of lysine acetate and L-aspartate are equally effective in displacing the transition state analog N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) from the active sites of the concentrations of L-aspartate and lysine acetate is constant, increasing the concentration of L-aspartate does not relieve inhibition of the enzyme by PALA (Collins, K.C., and Stark, G. R. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6599-6605). Therefore, the L-aspartate/subunit complex, like the acetate/subunit complex, must be incapable of participating in the catalytic reaction. We conclude that the kinetic mechanism is ordered, in agreement with the recent findings of Wedler and Gasser (Wedler, F.C., and Gasser, F.J. (1974), Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 163, 57-68) and in disagreement with the interpretation of Heyde et al. (Heyde, E., Nagabhushanam, A., And Morrison, J.F. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 4718-4726)..."

https://openalex.org/W1527226051,"Two forms of native 40 S ribosomal subunits, distinguishable by their buoyant densities, are recovered from Ehrlich ascites cells. In this communication, we describe experiments designed to test whether Met-tRNAf is associated with either form. Our results indicate that (a) in the cell, Met-tRNAf is bound to the native 40 S subunit, and in particular, to the subunit of density 1.40 g x cm-3; (b) under the growth conditions used, less than 10% of the low density native subunits have bound Met-tRNAf; (c) the majority of the Met-tRNAf containing native 40 S subunits, isolated from sucrose gradient analyses of cell extracts, join with 60 S subunits in vitro to form 80 S monosomes only if additional ribosomal wash factors are provided; and (d) the 80 S monosomes so formed are completed initiation complexes that can form peptide bonds. These results support the hypothesis that various forms of the native 40 S subunit represent different stages in the formation of a complete initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1528032825,"A procedure has been developed to assess whether polymerization of nucleotides by DNA polymerases is processive, that is, whether a succession of polymerization steps occurs without release of the enzyme from the template. The method involves measurement of the ratio of deoxyguanylate to deocycytidylate incorporated in the course of replicating a segment of the right hand cohesive end of phage lambaDNA with the sequence 5'-G-G-G-C-G-G-C-G-3'. In the case of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, each enzyme molecule completes synthesis of the sequence before dissociation occurs. Furthermore, at both 6 and 22 degrees, the polymerase remains bound to the lambdaDNA template after synthesis has completed. Template challenge experiments, in which the polymerase is allowed to begin synthesis in the presence of a molar excess of lambdaDNA before addition of a very large excess of calf thymus DNA, show that under the conditions used, productive binding of polymerase to lambdaDNA is a slow process requiring 1 to 2 hours. After synthesis has been completed, polymerase remains bound to the lambdaDNA in spite of the availability of new primer termini. The association, polymerization, and dissociation rates measured in these experiments suggest that the polymerization reaction catalyzed by DNA polymerase I is processive, and that hundreds of nucleotides may be polymerized between each association and dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W1587442005,"The pyruvate oxidase system of Escherichia coli is composed of a soluble flavoprotein, pyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.2.2, pyruvate:ferricytochrome b1 oxidoreductase), and an electron transport system associated with the cell envelope-membrane fraction. The membrane particles contain 15% lipid by weight. Fractionation of the lipids revealed that abut one-third are neutral lipids and two-thirds are phospholipids. The relative ratio of ubiquinone to menaquinone within the neutral lipid fraction is 15:1 on a molar basis. Removal of the lipids from the membrane particles by extraction with aqueous acetone or hydrolysis of the phospholipids by treatment with Bacillus cereus phospholipase C results in a complete loss of electron transport activity. Analysis of the particles extracted with aqueous acetone revealed that practically all the neutral lipids and 65% of the phospholipids are removed by this treatment. Phospholipase treatment results in a loss of 75% of the membrane phospholipid phosphorus; however, the diglycerides and the neutral lipids produced by phospholipase hydrolysis remain associated with the particles. Addition of neutral lipid and a detergent, hepta-DL-alanyl dodecylamide to the acetone-extracted material results in a restoration of 37% of the original particle activity. Addition of neutral lipid and hepta-DL-alanyl dodecylamide to phospholipase-treated particles completely restores the original electron transport activity. Furthermore, addition of ubiquinone from either yeast (UQ6) or E. coli (UQ8) will restore pyruvate oxidase activity when the quinones are supplemented with photoinactivated neutral lipid. No restoration of activity to phospholipase-treated particles is noted upon the addition of either menaquinone 6 or menaquinone 8 to the reconstitution system. In fact, these compounds appear to suppress restoration of activity when they are added to reaction mixtures containing neutral lipid and phospholipase-treated particles."
https://openalex.org/W1521610969,"The inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium by 1,2,4-triazole appears to be mediated through an effect on L-cysteine biosynthesis. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, the final enzyme in the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway, was found to catalyze a reaction (triazolylase) between O-acetyl-L-serine and 1,2,4-triazole, giving 1,2,4-triazole-1-alanine as a product. In wild type S. typhimurium grown on 4 mM 1,2,4-triazole, 97% of the total O-acetyl-L-serine synthesized in vivo is incorporated into 1,2,4-triazole-1-alanine. 1,2,4-triazole also significantly lowers the levels of several of the enzymes necessary for sulfate reduction. This effect is presumably due to the ability of the inhibitor to lower intracellular concentrations of O-acetyl-L-serine, an inducer of these enzymes. Inhibition of growth is probably caused by L-cysteine starvation, arising from the decreased availability of the L-cysteine precursors, sulfide and O-acetyl-L-serine. Two 1,2,4-triazole-resistant strains bearing mutations in cysK, the structural gene for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, incorporate only small quantities of O-acetyl-L-serine into 1,2,4-triazole-1-alanine in vivo. In vitro studies, using purified preparations of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A, revealed greater losses of triazolylase activity than sulfhydrylase activity in the enzymes from both cysK mutants. Resistance to 1,2,4-triazole apparently can arise from mutations leading to a preferential loss of triazolylase activity or from mutations which diminish both activities to the extent that high concentrations of O-acetyl-L-serine and sulfide accumulate behind the sulfhydrylase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1539662630,"Rates of UMP-dependent reduction of the DPN+ associated with Escherichia coli UDP-galactose-4-epimerase at 27 degrees and 0.2 M ionic strength in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, are reported. The reaction exhibits excellent pseudo-first order behavior when D-glucose is at anomeric equilibrium. The effects of [UMP] and [glucose] on the observed first order rate constants are consistent with the following equation. The symbols phi are empirical parameters. (See article). The data indicate that the pathway involves random equilibrium binding of UMP and glucose followed by rate-limiting decomposition of the ternary complex to epimerase-DNPH. The binding parameters indicate that the principal activating effect of UMP is not simply to increase the affinity of the enzyme for glucose. UMP appears to increase the reactivity or availability of enzyme-bound DPN+. The kinetic isotope effect for the reaction of D-]1-2H]glucose (kH/kD) is 4.2, which confirms that C-1 is oxidized and that hydride transfer is rate limiting. Both of the purified anomers, alpha- and beta-D-glucose, reduce the enzyme-bound DPN+. As indicated by the deviations from pseudo-first order kinetics because of concurrent mutarotation, the beta anomer is the more reactive, reacting about 4 to 5 times faster than the alpha anomer at concentrations well below saturation. Is is suggested that the lack of stereo-specificity in this reaction may be attributed to the two anomers being productively bound with their opposite faces projecting toward C-4 of bound DPN+. Nonstereospecific oxidation of alpha- and beta-D-glucose may be a model for the mechanism of UDP-hexose epimerization, which also involves nonstereospecific hydride transfer."

https://openalex.org/W1598144697,"A series of positional isomers of trans-octadecenoic acid were tested for their ability to support growth of microbial mutants that could not synthesize unsaturated fatty acids. The bacterial strain used (a variant of Escherichia coli 30E) grew with supplements of the trans isomers only at high temperatures (38 degrees) and with acids containing the trans-ethylenic bond between carbon atoms 8 through 13. The yeast mutant (Saccharomyces cerevisiae KD46) grew only with the 9-trans-octadecenoate giving cell yields about one-fifth those obtained with oleate. Although the trans isomers had little effect on the growth of the bacteria in the presence of oleate, they inhibited the growth of yeast with oleate. Inhibition was strongest for the 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12 isomers, almost negligible for the 8 isomer and of differing intermediate degrees for the others. The inhibitory effects had no correlation with the melting points of the acids and appeared to reflect selective action(s) on the metabolism of the cell. When the net yield of the yeast cultures with oleate was lowered by the effect of added trans acids, there was a marked accumulation of triglycerides and nonesterified acids in the cells. The marked increase in triglyceride content while phospholipid per cell remained relatively constant suggest that trans acids, in addition to forming inadequate membrane lipids, may also interfere with a basic control point in lipid metabolism."

Either the f2 RNA and 70 S ribosome or both ribosomal subunits in this complex were differentially labeled with tritiated lysine or phosphorous 32 RNA. Incubation of this complex in a ribosome-free protein-synthesizing system lacking initiating factor and appreciable nuclease activities allowed the synthesis of coat protein and subsequent termination. Using this techique, it was found that termination resulted in the release of ribosome as subunits. Intermediate in this process is a transient 46 S complex composed of the f2 RNA and 30 S ribosomal subunit, presumably the result of the initial release of the 50 S ribosomal subunit. This 46 S complex subsequently breaks down to a free f2 RNA and 30 S ribosomal subunit. The rate of this latter process is faster in the presence of crude initiating factors. These results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of termination and reading of the intercistronic region."

Heavy labeling was found only in the presence of the second substrate, ATP, and this was shown to arise from tightly but noncovalently bound product.

Serum from patients with hereditary C3 deficiencies and specific antiserums to C3, C5, and C6 were utilized to demonstrate the absence of requirements for late-acting complement components in this unusual bactericidal system."
https://openalex.org/W1588090915,"A counterpart of the antibody-mediated activation of genetically defective enzymes is reported here. Antibodies elicited by certain mutant forms of beta-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) of Escherichia coli were found to inactivate the normal form of the enzyme. (Antibodies elicited by normal beta-D-galactosidase do not affect the enzyme's catalytic activity.) We present evidence that the inactivating antibodies are directed against one or a few determinants of the enzyme. The level of inactivation caused by the antibodies was independent of temperature below 25 degrees and increased with temperature above 25 degrees. The inactivation was proportional to the concentration of antiserum until a maximum level of 50% inactivation was reached. Antibodies capable of inactivating up to 87% of the activity were obtained after the antiserum was partially absorbed in an affinity column. This antibody preparation showed a 10-fold enrichment of inactivating antibodies over other antibodies direct against the enzyme. The antibody-mediated inactivation caused a reduction in the Vmax of beta-D-galactosidase without affecting the apparent Km of the enzyme. In contrast to antibodies to normal beta-D-galactosidase, inactivating antibodies changed the response of the enzyme to cations. To explain these results, we present a model in which there is a temperature-dependent equilibrium between two active forms of beta-D-galactosidase. Inactivation results from a conformational change induced by the binding of inactivating antibodies to only one of these two forms."
