https://openalex.org/W3162452407,"Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of biomedical images assists physicians for a fast facilitated tissue characterization. A scheme based on combining fuzzy logic (FL) and deep learning (DL) for automatic semantic segmentation (SS) of tumors in breast ultrasound (BUS) images is proposed. The proposed scheme consists of two steps: the first is a FL based preprocessing, and the second is a Convolutional neural network (CNN) based SS. Eight well-known CNN based SS models have been utilized in the study. Studying the scheme was by a dataset of 400 cancerous BUS images and their corresponding 400 ground truth images. SS process has been applied in two modes: batch and one by one image processing. Three quantitative performance evaluation metrics have been utilized: global accuracy (GA), mean Jaccard Index (mean intersection over union (IoU)), and mean BF (Boundary F1) Score. In the batch processing mode: quantitative metrics' average results over the eight utilized CNNs based SS models over the 400 cancerous BUS images were: 95.45% GA instead of 86.08% without applying fuzzy preprocessing step, 78.70% mean IoU instead of 49.61%, and 68.08% mean BF score instead of 42.63%. Moreover, the resulted segmented images could show tumors' regions more accurate than with only CNN based SS. While, in one by one image processing mode: there has been no enhancement neither qualitatively nor quantitatively. So, only when a batch processing is needed, utilizing the proposed scheme may be helpful in enhancing automatic ss of tumors in BUS images. Otherwise applying the proposed approach on a one-by-one image mode will disrupt segmentation's efficiency. The proposed batch processing scheme may be generalized for an enhanced CNN based SS of a targeted region of interest (ROI) in any batch of digital images.

https://openalex.org/W3160003244,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has emerged as one of the most dramatic health crises of recent decades. This paper treats mainstream news about the current pandemic as a valuable entry point for analyzing the relationship between science and politics in the public sphere, where the outbreak must be both understood and confronted through appropriate public-health policy decisions. In doing so, the paper aims to examine which actors, institutions, and experts dominate the SARS-CoV-2 media narratives, with particular attention to the roles of political, medical, and scientific actors and institutions within the pandemic crisis. The study relies on a large dataset consisting of all SARS-CoV-2 articles published by eight major Italian national newspapers between January 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. These articles underwent a quantitative analysis based on a topic modeling technique. The topic modeling outputs were further analyzed by innovatively combining ad-hoc metrics and a classifier based on the stacking ensemble method (combining regularized logistic regression and linear stochastic gradient descent) for quantifying scientific salience. This enabled the identification of relevant topics and the analysis of the roles that different actors and institutions engaged in making sense of the pandemic. The results show how the health emergency has been addressed primarily in terms of political regulation and concerns and only marginally as a scientific matter. Hence, science has been overwhelmed by politics, which, in media narratives, exerts a moral as well as regulatory authority. Media narratives exclude neither scientific issues nor scientific experts; rather, they configure them as a subsidiary body of knowledge and expertise to be mobilized as an ancillary, impersonal institution useful for legitimizing the expansion of political jurisdiction over the governance of the emergency."
https://openalex.org/W3163194201,"Objective The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limbs, using serial compression ultrasound (CUS) surveillance, in acutely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a non-ICU setting. Methods Multicenter, prospective study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Internal Medicine units. All patients were screened for DVT of the lower limbs with serial CUS. Anticoagulation was defined as: low dose (enoxaparin 20–40 mg/day or fondaparinux 1.5–2.5 mg/day); intermediate dose (enoxaparin 60–80 mg/day); high dose (enoxaparin 120–160 mg or fondaparinux 5–10 mg/day or oral anticoagulation). The primary end-point of the study was the diagnosis of DVT by CUS. Results Over a two-month period, 227 consecutive patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled. The incidence of DVT was 13.7% (6.2% proximal, 7.5% distal), mostly asymptomatic. All patients received anticoagulation (enoxaparin 95.6%) at the following doses: low 57.3%, intermediate 22.9%, high 19.8%. Patients with and without DVT had similar characteristics, and no difference in anticoagulant regimen was observed. DVT patients were older (mean 77±9.6 vs 71±13.1 years; p = 0.042) and had higher peak D-dimer levels (5403 vs 1723 ng/mL; p = 0.004). At ROC analysis peak D-dimer level &gt;2000 ng/mL (AUC 0.703; 95% CI 0.572–0.834; p = 0.004) was the most accurate cut-off value able to predict DVT (RR 3.74; 95%CI 1.27–10, p = 0.016). Conclusions The incidence of DVT in acutely ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia is relevant. A surveillance protocol by serial CUS of the lower limbs is useful to timely identify DVT that would go otherwise largely undetected."

Methods Observational analysis of the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey from 2005 to 2015. Primary outcomes were hospital-based ED closure and merger. Secondary outcomes were yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED and yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed. Results The total number of hospital-based EDs decreased from 4,500 in 2005 to 4,460 in 2015, with 200 closures, 138 mergers, and 160 new hospital-based EDs. While yearly ED visits per hospital-based ED exhibited a 28.6% relative increase (from 25,083 to 32,248), yearly hospital admissions per hospital bed had a 3.3% relative increase (from 45.4 to 43.9) from 2005 to 2015. The number of hospital admissions and hospital beds did not change significantly in urban areas and declined in rural areas. ED visits grew more uniformly across urban and rural areas. Conclusions The number of hospital-based ED closures is small when accounting for mergers, but occurs as many more patients are presenting to a stable number of EDs in larger health systems, though rural areas may differentially affected. EDs were managing accelerating patient volumes alongside stagnant inpatient bed capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3162280858,"Dengue is a re-emerging disease, currently considered the most important mosquito-borne arbovirus infection affecting humankind, taking into account both its morbidity and mortality. Brazil is considered an endemic country for dengue, such that more than 1,544,987 confirmed cases were notified in 2019, which means an incidence rate of 735 for every 100 thousand inhabitants. Climate is an important factor in the temporal and spatial distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as dengue. Thus, rainfall and temperature are considered macro-factors determinants for dengue, since they directly influence the population density of Aedes aegypti, which is subject to seasonal fluctuations, mainly due to these variables. This study examined the incidence of dengue fever related to the climate influence by using temperature and rainfall variables data obtained from remote sensing via artificial satellites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The mathematical model that best fits the data is based on an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX). It reproduced the values of incidence rates in the study period and managed to predict with good precision in a one-year horizon. The approach described in present work may be replicated in cities around the world by the public health managers, to build auxiliary operational tools for control and prevention tasks of dengue, as well of other arbovirus diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3162811037,"There is a debate concerning the definition and extent of tropical dry forest biome and vegetation type at a global spatial scale. We identify the potential extent of the tropical dry forest biome based on bioclimatic definitions and climatic data sets to improve global estimates of distribution, cover, and change. We compared four bioclimatic definitions of the tropical dry forest biome-Murphy and Lugo, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), DryFlor, aridity index-using two climatic data sets: WorldClim and Climatologies at High-resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA). We then compared each of the eight unique combinations of bioclimatic definitions and climatic data sets using 540 field plots identified as tropical dry forest from a literature search and evaluated the accuracy of World Wildlife Fund tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forest ecoregions. We used the definition and climate data that most closely matched field data to calculate forest cover in 2000 and change from 2001 to 2020. Globally, there was low agreement (< 58%) between bioclimatic definitions and WWF ecoregions and only 40% of field plots fell within these ecoregions. FAO using CHELSA had the highest agreement with field plots (81%) and was not correlated with the biome extent. Using the FAO definition with CHELSA climatic data set, we estimate 4,931,414 km2 of closed canopy (≥ 40% forest cover) tropical dry forest in 2000 and 4,369,695 km2 in 2020 with a gross loss of 561,719 km2 (11.4%) from 2001 to 2020. Tropical dry forest biome extent varies significantly based on bioclimatic definition used, with nearly half of all tropical dry forest vegetation missed when using ecoregion boundaries alone, especially in Africa. Using site-specific field validation, we find that the FAO definition using CHELSA provides an accurate, standard, and repeatable way to assess tropical dry forest cover and change at a global scale."
https://openalex.org/W3161686768,"An alternative strategy for men who have sex with men (MSM) experiencing challenges with daily HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) includes 2-1-1 dosing. Understanding 2-1-1 PrEP facilitators and barriers, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, may guide researchers and healthcare providers in future studies and clinical preparedness. We conducted a national cross-sectional study of MSM in the US who had taken 2-1-1 PrEP to examine facilitators and barriers of this on-demand PrEP dosing option. With the shelter-in-place orders in March 2020, this study was adapted to include questions on how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected participants’ PrEP use. A total of 140 individuals participated in the survey, 106 of which completed questions pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The most common reasons for switching from once-daily to 2-1-1 PrEP included having sex less frequently (63.6%) and wanting to take fewer pills (46.4%). Participants reported high medication adherence based on each component of 2-1-1 PrEP dosing (&gt;84%). The most common barriers with 2-1-1 PrEP dosing included unplanned sexual encounters resulting in missing the double-dose pre-sex (43.6%) and trouble remembering doses post-sex (29.3%). Facilitators of the 2-1-1 PrEP dosing strategy included reductions in sexual encounters (63.6%), preference to take fewer pills (46.4%), need to reduce cost (22.1%), and desire to reduce side effects (19.3%). Challenges to receiving PrEP services during the pandemic included obtaining laboratory testing (25.5%) and PrEP refills (either receipt of a refill authorization from a healthcare provider or processing of a refill from the pharmacy) (18.9%). 2-1-1 PrEP is an effective HIV prevention method; therefore, understanding facilitators and barriers of this dosing strategy can result in continuous provision of HIV prevention efforts, particularly during a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3162594505,"Spermatogenesis requires that a careful balance be maintained between the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and their commitment to the developmental pathway through which they will differentiate into spermatozoa. Recently, a series of studies employing various in vivo and in vitro models have suggested a role of the wingless-related MMTV integration site gene family/beta-catenin (WNT/CTNNB1) pathway in determining the fate of SSCs. However, conflicting data have suggested that CTNNB1 signaling may either promote SSC self-renewal or differentiation. Here, we studied the effects of sustained CTNNB1 signaling in SSCs using the Ctnnb1tm1Mmt/+; Ddx4-CreTr/+ (ΔCtnnb1) mouse model, in which a stabilized form of CTNNB1 is expressed in all germ cells. ΔCtnnb1 mice were found to have reduced testis weights and partial germ cell loss by 4 months of age. Germ cell transplantation assays showed a 49% reduction in total functional SSC numbers in 8 month-old transgenic mice. In vitro, Thy1-positive undifferentiated spermatogonia from ΔCtnnb1 mice formed 57% fewer clusters, which was associated with decreased cell proliferation. A reduction in mRNA levels of genes associated with SSC maintenance (Bcl6b, Gfra1, Plzf) and increased levels for markers associated with progenitor and differentiating spermatogonia (Kit, Rarg, Sohlh1) were detected in these cluster cells. Furthermore, RNAseq performed on these clusters revealed a network of more than 900 genes regulated by CTNNB1, indicating that CTNNB1 is an important regulator of spermatogonial fate. Together, our data support the notion that CTNNB1 signaling promotes the transition of SSCs to undifferentiated progenitor spermatogonia at the expense of their self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W3160188323,"A Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic mucin-degrading bacterium, which we designated strain E39T, was isolated from the rumen epithelium of Korean cattle. The cells were non-motile and had a coccus morphology. Growth of strain E39T was observed at 30-45°C (optimum, 39°C), pH 6.5-8.5 (optimum, pH 7.5), and in the presence of 0.0-1.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.0-0.5%). Strain E39T contained C16:0, C18:0, C18:1 ω9c, iso-C15:0, and anteiso-C15:0 as the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, unidentified aminophospholipid, and unidentified lipids. The major respiratory isoprenoid quinones were MK-8 and MK-9. The major fermented end-products of mucin were acetate and succinate. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 46.4 mol%. Strain E39T was most closely related to Alloprevotella rava 81/4-12T with an 87.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and molecular properties, strain E39T represents a novel genus of the family Prevotellaceae; as such, the name Pseudoprevotella muciniphila gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. A functional annotation of the whole genome sequences of P. muciniphila E39T revealed that this bacterium has a putative mucin-degrading pathway and biosynthetic pathways of extracellular polymeric substances and virulence factors which enable bacteria to adhere to the epithelial cells and avoid the host's immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W3162149061,"Introduction Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) is used to objectively assess the degree of parenchymal impairment in COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and methods Retrospective study on 61 COVID-19 patients (severe and non-severe; 33 men, age 63+/-15 years) who underwent a CT scan due to tachypnea, dyspnoea or desaturation. QCT was performed using VCAR software. Patients’ clinical data was collected, including laboratory results and oxygenation support. The optimal cut-off point for CT parameters for predicting death and respiratory support was performed by maximizing the Youden Index in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results The analysis revealed significantly greater progression of changes: ground-glass opacities (GGO) (31,42% v 13,89%, p&lt;0.001), consolidation (11,85% v 3,32%, p&lt;0.001) in patients with severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Five lobes were involved in all patients with severe disease. In non-severe patients, a positive correlation was found between severity of GGO, consolidation and emphysema and sex, tachypnea, chest x-ray (CXR) score on admission and laboratory parameters: CRP, D-dimer, ALT, lymphocyte count and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. In the group of severe patients, a correlation was found between sex, creatinine level and death. ROC analysis on death prediction was used to establish the cut-off point for GGO at 24.3% (AUC 0.8878, 95% CI 0.7889–0.9866; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 75.5%), 5.6% for consolidation (AUC 0.7466, 95% CI 0.6009–0.8923; sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 59.2%), and 37.8% for total (GGO+consolidation) (AUC 0.8622, 95% CI 0.7525–0.972; sensitivity 75%, specificity 83.7%). The cut-off point for predicting respiratory support was established for GGO at 18.7% (AUC 0.7611, 95% CI 0.6268–0.8954; sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 64.4%), consolidation at 3.88% (AUC 0.7438, 95% CI 0.6146–0.8729; sensitivity 100%, specificity 46.7%), and total at 23.5% (AUC 0.7931, 95% CI 0.673–0.9131; sensitivity 93.8%, specificity 57.8%). Conclusion QCT is a good diagnostic tool which facilitates decision-making regarding intensification of oxygen support and transfer to an intensive care unit in patients severely ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. QCT can make an independent and simple screening tool to assess the risk of death, regardless of clinical symptoms. Usefulness of QCT to predict the risk of death is higher than to assess the indications for respiratory support."
https://openalex.org/W3160385199,"The major sites for fast synaptic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS) are ion channels activated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These receptors are referred as GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). Recent evidence indicates a role of GABA(A)R in modulating the immune response. This work aimed to discern the role of GABA and GABA(A)Rs in human and mouse T cell activity.Mouse splenocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated with anti-CD3 antibodies and the proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells assessed through flow cytometry. Subsequently, the effects on T cell proliferation of either GABA(A)R modulation by diazepam that is also capable of activating mitochondrial based translocator protein (TSPO), alprazolam and allopregnanolone or inhibition by bicucculine methiodide (BMI) and (1,2,5,6-Tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) were assessed.Positive modulation of GABA(A)Rs either by benzodiazepines or the neurosteroid allopregnanolone inhibits both mouse and human T cell proliferation. GABAergic inhibition of T cell proliferation by benzodiazepines could be rescued by GABA(A)R blocking. Our data suggest that benzodiazepines influence T cell proliferation through both TSPO and GABA(A)Rs activation.We conclude that activation of GABA(A)Rs provides immunosuppression by inhibiting T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3160914744,"Angiosperm cell adhesion is dependent on interactions between pectin polysaccharides which make up a significant portion of the plant cell wall. Cell adhesion in Arabidopsis may also be regulated through a pectin-related signaling cascade mediated by a putative O-fucosyltransferase ESMERALDA1 (ESMD1), and the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) domains of the pectin binding Wall associated Kinases (WAKs) are a primary candidate substrate for ESMD1 activity. Genetic interactions between WAKs and ESMD1 were examined using a dominant hyperactive allele of WAK2, WAK2cTAP, and a mutant of the putative O-fucosyltransferase ESMD1. WAK2cTAP expression results in a dwarf phenotype and activation of the stress response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, while esmd1 is a suppressor of a pectin deficiency induced loss of adhesion. Here we find that esmd1 suppresses the WAK2cTAP dwarf and stress response phenotype, including ROS accumulation and gene expression. Additional analysis suggests that mutations of the potential WAK EGF O-fucosylation site also abate the WAK2cTAP phenotype, yet only evidence for an N-linked but not O-linked sugar addition can be found. Moreover, a WAK locus deletion allele has no effect on the ability of esmd1 to suppress an adhesion deficiency, indicating WAKs and their modification are not a required component of the potential ESMD1 signaling mechanism involved in the control of cell adhesion. The WAK locus deletion does however affect the induction of ROS but not the transcriptional response induced by the elicitors Flagellin, Chitin and oligogalacturonides (OGs)."
https://openalex.org/W3162487852,"We explore the use of implied volatility indices as a tool for estimate changes in the synchronization of stock markets. Specifically, we assess the implied stock market's volatility indices' predictive power on synchronizing global equity indices returns. We built the correlation network of 26 stock indices and implemented in-sample and out-of-sample tests to evaluate the predictive power of VIX, VSTOXX, and VXJ implied volatility indices. To measure markets' synchronization, we use the Minimum Spanning Tree length and the length of the Planar Maximally Filtered Graph. Our results indicate a high predictive power of all the volatility indices, both individually and together, though the VIX predominates over the evaluated options. We find that an increase in the markets' volatility expectations, captured by the implied volatility indices, is a good Granger predictor of an increase in the synchronization of returns in the following month. Estimating, monitoring, and predicting returns' synchronization is essential for investment decision-making, especially for diversification strategies and regulating financial systems."
https://openalex.org/W3162584621,"Bone mineral density (BMD) measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can be used to predict fractures, but its clinical utility has not been fully established in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Magnesium is an essential trace element. Although magnesium is associated with the risk of fractures in non-CKD populations, the relationship is unknown in CKD patients.BMD and serum magnesium levels were measured in 358 stable outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis therapy. The primary outcome was fragility fracture. Patients were divided into groups according to the median level of magnesium and the normal threshold value of lumbar spine BMD.During the median follow-up period of 36 months, 36 (10.0%) fractures occurred. The cumulative incidence rates of fractures were 17.6% and 5.2% [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-5.17, P = 0.030] in the lower (<2.6 mg/dL) and higher (≥2.6 mg/dL) magnesium (Mg) groups, respectively, and 21.2% and 7.3% (aHR 2.59, 95% CI 1.09-6.16, P = 0.027) in the low- and high-BMD groups, respectively. The lower-Mg and low-BMD group had a 9.21-fold higher risk of fractures (95% CI; 2.35-47.00; P = 0.0010) than the higher-Mg and high-BMD group. Furthermore, adding both magnesium levels and lumbar spine BMD levels to the established risk factors significantly improved the prediction of fractures (C-index: 0.784 to 0.830, p = 0.041).The combination of serum magnesium and lumbar spine BMD can be used for fracture risk stratification and synergistically improves the prediction of fractures in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3162785365,"Background This study provides detailed characteristics of vector populations in preparation for a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to compare the community impact of dual active-ingredient (AI) long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) that combine two novel insecticide classes–chlorfenapyr or pyriproxifen–with alpha-cypermethrin to improve the prevention of malaria transmitted by insecticide-resistant vectors compared to standard pyrethroid LLINs. Methods The study was carried out in 60 villages across Cove, Zangnanando and Ouinhi districts, southern Benin. Mosquito collections were performed using human landing catches (HLCs). After morphological identification, a sub-sample of Anopheles gambiae s.l. were dissected for parity, analyzed by PCR for species and presence of L1014F kdr mutation and by ELISA-CSP to identify Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection. WHO susceptibility tube tests were performed by exposing adult An . gambiae s.l., collected as larvae from each district, to 0.05% alphacypermethrin, 0.75% permethrin, 0.1% bendiocarb and 0.25% pirimiphos-methyl. Synergist assays were also conducted with exposure first to 4% PBO followed by alpha-cypermethrin. Results An . gambiae s.l. (n = 10807) was the main malaria vector complex found followed by Anopheles funestus s.l. (n = 397) and Anopheles nili (n = 82). An . gambiae s.l. was comprised of An . coluzzii (53.9%) and An . gambiae s.s. (46.1%), both displaying a frequency of the L1014F kdr mutation &gt;80%. Although more than 80% of people slept under standard LLIN, human biting rate (HBR) in An . gambiae s.l. was higher indoors [26.5 bite/person/night (95% CI: 25.2–27.9)] than outdoors [18.5 b/p/n (95% CI: 17.4–19.6)], as were the trends for sporozoite rate (SR) [2.9% (95% CI: 1.7–4.8) vs 1.8% (95% CI: 0.6–3.8)] and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) [21.6 infected bites/person/month (95% CI: 20.4–22.8) vs 5.4 (95% CI: 4.8–6.0)]. Parous rate was 81.6% (95%CI: 75.4–88.4). An . gambiae s.l. was resistant to alpha-cypermethrin and permethrin but, fully susceptible to bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl. PBO pre-exposure followed by alpha-cypermethrin treatment induced a higher 24 hours mortality compared to alphacypermethrin alone but not exceeding 40%. Conclusions Despite a high usage of standard pyrethroid LLINs, the study area is characterized by intense malaria transmission. The main vectors An . coluzzii and An . gambiae s.s. were both highly resistant to pyrethroids and displayed multiple resistance mechanisms, L1014F kdr mutation and mixed function oxidases. These conditions of the study area make it an appropriate site to conduct the trial that aims to assess the effect of novel dual-AI LLINs on malaria transmitted by insecticide-resistant vectors."

This study aims to evaluate the associations of nature relatedness with physical activity and sedentary behavior.A cross-sectional study involving 9-12 year old children living in Cuenca, Ecuador, was conducted between October 2018 and March 2019. Questionnaires were used to evaluate physical activity (PAQ-C), out-of-school sedentary behavior, nature relatedness and wellbeing. Associations of nature relatedness with physical activity, and sedentary behavior were evaluated using linear regression models or tobit regressions adjusted by age, sex, school type, wellbeing, and body mass index z-score.A total of 1028 children were surveyed (average age:10.4±1.22 years, 52% female.). Nature relatedness was positively associated with physical activity (β = 0.07; CI 95%: 0.05-0.09; p < 0.001) and non-screen-related sedentary leisure (β = 3.77 minutes; CI 95%: 0.76-6.68; p < 0.05); it was negatively associated with screen time (β = -5.59 minutes; CI 95%: -10.53-0.65; p < 0.05).Findings suggest that nature relatedness is associated with physical activity and some sedentary behaviors among Ecuadorian school-age children. The promotion of nature relatedness has the potential to improve health."

This study aimed at developing a predictor model to estimate time on a kidney transplant waiting list using a machine learning approach.A retrospective cohort study including data of patients registered, between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, in the waiting list of São Paulo State Organ Allocation System (SP-OAS) /Brazil. Data were randomly divided into two groups: 75% for training and 25% for testing. A Cox regression model was fitted with deceased donor transplant as the outcome. Sensitivity analyses were performed using different Cox models. Cox hazard ratios were used to develop the risk-prediction equations.Of 54,055 records retrieved, 48,153 registries were included in the final analysis. During the study period, approximately 1/3 of the patients were transplanted with a deceased donor. The major characteristics associated with changes in the likelihood of transplantation were age, subregion, cPRA, and frequency of HLA-DR, -B and -A. The model developed was able to predict waiting time with good agreement in internal validation (c-index = 0.70).The kidney transplant waiting time calculator developed shows good predictive performance and provides information that may be valuable in assisting candidates and their providers. Moreover, it can significantly improve the use of economic resources and the management of patient care before transplant."
https://openalex.org/W3161329421,"The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) can be reduced by preventing transmission with rapid and precise case detection and early treatment. The Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a useful tool for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) with rifampicin resistance within approximately two hours by using a nucleic acid amplification technique. This study was designed to reduce the underdiagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary TB and to assess the clinical and radiological characteristics of PTB patients. This cross-sectional study included 235 participants who went to the Luyang primary health care clinic from September 2016 to June 2017. The demographic data were analyzed to investigate the association of patient gender, age group, and ethnicity by chi-square test. To assess the efficacy of the diagnostic test, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated. The area under the curve for sputum for both AFB and gene-Xpert was analyzed to compare their accuracy in diagnosing TB. In this study, TB was more common in males than in females. The majority (50.71%) of the cases belonged to the 25–44-year-old age group and the Bajau ethnicity (57.74%). Out of 50 pulmonary TB cases (smear-positive with AFB staining), 49 samples were positive according to the Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay and was confirmed by MTB culture. However, out of 185 smear-negative presumptive cases, 21 cases were positive by Gene-Xpert MTB/RIF assay in that a sample showed drug resistance, and these results were confirmed by MTB culture, showing resistance to isoniazid. In comparison to sputum for AFB, Gene-Xpert showed more sensitivity and specificity with almost complete accuracy. The additional 21 PTB cases detection from the presumptive cases by GeneXpert had significant impact compared to initial observation by the routine tests which overcame the diagnostic challenges and ambiguities."
https://openalex.org/W3162367100,"Abattoir meat inspection has been proposed for the collection of welfare outcomes. The identification of suitable animal-based measures (ABM) is still a critical point that needs to be implemented to avoid collinearity among measures. The present study aims to benchmark the presence of ABM such as skin and tail lesions and ham defects in carcasses from 79 batches of Italian Heavy pigs and to identify possible relationships between the assessed ABM and pre-slaughter factors such as the season and the overnight lairage. Furthermore, the study also considers the effect of pre-slaughter conditions and ABM on carcass traits parameters (cold carcass weight and lean meat percentage). Skin and tail lesions were recorded at the slaughter line. The presence of abscesses, muscle tears and veining defects were assessed in the hams at trimming, according to the Parma Ham Consortium. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify relationships between ABM and pre-slaughter factor; therefore, a linear model was built to assess the effect on carcass weight and lean meat percentage. Main welfare issues were represented by skin and tail lesions and muscle tears (prevalence above 10%). Multivariate analysis evidenced that skin lesions and veining defects were mostly associated with the warm season. Abscesses and muscle tears in the hams were more likely related to overnight lairage, while tail lesions contributed equally to both season and lairage. Moreover, lairage related factors showed to affect lean meat percentage. The findings of the present study suggest that ham defects might be useful indicators of pre-slaughter stress. The validation of these findings with physiological parameters could be of interest for further studies."
https://openalex.org/W3162421117,"Background Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an incurable cancer without adequate tumor markers. Our previous study has showed a better diagnostic performance of Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence II (PIVKA-II) compared to currently used PDAC biomarkers. To corroborate our previous data with a larger sample size and to assess a possible role of PIVKA-II in predicting surgical success. Additionally, to further evaluate the hypothesis of a direct PIVKA-II production by PDAC cells, we examined PIVKA-II tissue expression in a case of PDAC using immunofluorescence. Methods We enrolled 76 newly diagnosed PDAC patients and selected 11 patients to determine PIVKA-II levels also after surgical resection. An immunofluorescence (IF) study of PIVKA-II tissue expression was carried out in one of them. PIVKA-II serum values were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay method (CLEIA) on LUMIPULSE G1200 (Fujirebio-Europe, Belgium). Results PIVKA-II serum levels were above the cut-off at baseline in 71 patients (94%) with a median value of 464 mAU/Ml (range 27–40783 mAU/mL); the sensitivity and specificity were 78.67% and 90.67% respectively. Patients with pre-operative PIVKA-II positivity showed a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.015) of median PIVKA-II serum concentrations after surgery: 820 (91–40783) mAU/mL at diagnosis vs 123 (31–4666) mAU/mL post-operatively. IF assay on PDAC sections demonstrated PIVKA-II expression in cancer cells. Conclusion These data are the first showing a decreased PIVKA-II serum levels after surgery in PDAC patients and reporting PIVKA-II expression in PDAC tissue. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine PIVKA-II usefulness in diagnosing and monitoring PDAC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3163077597,"Effects of different surface textures on the interface shear strength, interface slip, and failure modes of the concrete-to-concrete bond are examined through finite element numerical model and experimental methods in the presence of the horizontal load with 'push-off' technique under different normal stresses. Three different surface textures are considered; smooth, indented, and transversely roughened to finish the top surfaces of the concrete bases. In the three-dimensional modeling via the ABAQUS solver, the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) is used to simulate the interface shear failure. It is observed that the interface shear strength increases with the applied normal stress. The transversely roughened surface achieves the highest interface shear strength compared with those finished with the indented and smooth approaches. The smooth and indented surfaces are controlled by the adhesive failure mode while the transversely roughened surface is dominated by the cohesive failure mode. Also, it is observed that the CZM approach can accurately model the interface shear failure with 3-29% differences between the modeled and the experimental test findings."
https://openalex.org/W3163148237,"Background The smoking-paradox of a better outcome in ischemic stroke patients who smoke may be due to increased efficacy of thrombolysis. We investigated the effect of smoking on outcome following endovascular therapy (EVT) with mechanical thrombectomy alone versus in combination with intra-arterial (IA-) thrombolysis. Methods The primary endpoint was defined by three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We performed a generalized linear model and reported relative risks (RR) for smoking (adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke severity, time to EVT) in patient data stemming from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive—Endovascular database. Results Among 1,497 patients, 740(49.4%) were randomized to EVT; among EVT patients, 524(35.0%) received mechanical thrombectomy alone and 216(14.4%) received it in combination with IA-thrombolysis. Smokers (N = 396) had lower mRS scores (mean 2.9 vs. 3.2; p = 0.02) and mortality rates (10% vs. 17.3%; p&lt;0.001) in univariate analysis. In all patients and in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy alone, smoking had no effect on outcome in regression analyses. In patients who received IA-thrombolysis (N = 216;14%), smoking had an adjusted RR of 1.65 for an mRS≤1 (95%CI 0.77–3.55). Treatment with IA-thrombolysis itself led to reduced RR for favorable outcome (adjusted RR 0.30); interaction analysis of IA-thrombolysis and smoking revealed that non-smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS≤2 in 47 cases (30%, adjusted RR 0.53 [0.41–0.69]) while smokers with IA-thrombolysis had mRS≤2 in 23 cases (38%, adjusted RR 0.61 [0.42–0.87]). Conclusions Smokers had no clear clinical benefit from EVT that incorporates IA-thrombolysis."

However, little is known regarding self-medication practice and its contributors among pregnant women in our setting.The main aim of this study was to investigate the practice of self-medication and its contributing factors among pregnant women.A cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant women at antenatal care follow-up of Ayder comprehensive specialized hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before interview. Simple random sampling technique was employed to recruit participants in to the study. Data were collected by interviewing participants using the structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regressions analysis was performed to determine the contributing factors of self-medication practice during pregnancy. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant.A total of 250 pregnant women were included in the study. Of the total, 40.8% practiced self-medication during the current pregnancy. Morning sickness (39.2%), headache (34.3%), and upper respiratory tract infections (29.4%) were the leading indications for self-medication. According to participant report, ease of access to medicines (25.5%), feelings that the disease is minor (21.6%) and timesaving (19.6%) were the most commonly reported reasons for self-medication practice. Absence of health insurance (AOR: 2.75, 95%CI: 1.29-5.89) and being on first trimester of pregnancy (AOR: 2.44, 95%CI: 1.02-5.86) were significant contributors of self-medication practice among pregnant women.In our study, high prevalence of self-medication was reported among pregnant women. Self-medication practice during pregnancy was higher among pregnant women on first trimester and those who were not having health insurance. Therefore, intervention programs should be designed to minimize the practice of self-medication during pregnancy."

One of the main challenges that health system facing globally is the shortage of nursing workforce. Vanuatu as a Pacific county is also facing the shortage issue and the impact on the registered nurses' performance.A qualitative study was used to collect data from 25 registered nurses in three randomly selected hospitals in Vanuatu between 4th to 14th September, 2020. A semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data using face-to-face in-depth interviews. The data were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis process.Four themes were identified including; Difficult working conditions, Reinforcing factors and Perceived risks. Sub themes for difficult working condition were heavy workload, lack of workforce and unusual working hours. Sub themes for reinforcing factors were lack of support, lack of opportunities and advancement in nursing practice. Sub themes for perceived risks were stress, physical and mental risk, and social and family risks.This study has identify factors affected shortage of current nursing workforce and the impact it has on registered nurses. Broad themes and sub-themes were identified which highlighted the impact of nursing shortage to registered nurses and the effects on their performance which includes stress or moral distress from work overload and lengthy hours shift which impact the nurses' physical, psychological, social, and family relationship, and lack of leadership support. The findings can be helpful to policy makers at the decision-making level to resolve the nursing workforce shortage and its effects in the future by refining and developing relevant policies that will address and strengthen the nursing workforce to meet the demand and improve delivery of quality health services to all individual."
https://openalex.org/W3160648311,"Iron reduction and sulfate reduction are two of the major biogeochemical processes that occur in anoxic sediments. Microbes that catalyze these reactions are therefore some of the most abundant organisms in the subsurface, and some of the most important. Due to the variety of mechanisms that microbes employ to derive energy from these reactions, including the use of soluble electron shuttles, the dynamics between iron- and sulfate-reducing populations under changing biogeochemical conditions still elude complete characterization. Here, we amended experimental bioreactors comprised of freshwater aquifer sediment with ferric iron, sulfate, acetate, and the model electron shuttle AQDS (9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate) and monitored both the changing redox conditions as well as changes in the microbial community over time. The addition of the electron shuttle AQDS did increase the initial rate of FeIII reduction; however, it had little effect on the composition of the microbial community. Our results show that in both AQDS- and AQDS+ systems there was an initial dominance of organisms classified as Geobacter (a genus of dissimilatory FeIII-reducing bacteria), after which sequences classified as Desulfosporosinus (a genus of dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria) came to dominate both experimental systems. Furthermore, most of the ferric iron reduction occurred under this later, ostensibly ""sulfate-reducing"" phase of the experiment. This calls into question the usefulness of classifying subsurface sediments by the dominant microbial process alone because of their interrelated biogeochemical consequences. To better inform models of microbially-catalyzed subsurface processes, such interactions must be more thoroughly understood under a broad range of conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3161124966,"Neck shrivel is a quality disorder of European plum ( Prunus × domestica L.). It has been suggested that backflow in the xylem (from fruit to tree) could contribute to the incidence of neck shrivel in plum. The objective was to quantify rates of xylem, phloem and of transpiration flow in developing plum fruit. Using linear variable displacement transducers, changes in fruit volume were recorded 1) in un-treated control fruit, 2) in fruit that had their pedicels steam-girdled (phloem interrupted, xylem still functional) and 3) in detached fruit, left in the canopy (xylem and phloem interrupted). Xylem flow rates were occasionally negative in the early hours after sunrise, indicating xylem sap backflow from fruit to tree. Later in the day, xylem flows were positive and generally higher in daytime and lower at night. Significant phloem flow occurred in daytime, but ceased after sunset. During stage II (but not during stage III), the rates of xylem flow and transpiration were variable and closely related to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. The relative contribution of xylem inflow to total sap inflow averaged 79% during stage II, decreasing to 25% during stage III. In contrast, phloem sap inflow averaged 21% of total sap inflow during stage II, increasing to 75% in stage III. Our results indicate that xylem backflow occurs early in the day. However, xylem backflow rates are considered too low to significantly contribute to the incidence of neck shrivel."

Cardiac arrhythmia is an important safety issue with hydroxychloroquine. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine increases new-onset arrhythmia among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.This was a nested case-control study using data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan. A conditional logistic regression model was used to analyse differences in the risk of arrhythmia between systemic lupus erythematosus patients with and without hydroxychloroquine treatment after controlling for related variables.A total of 2499 patients with newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus were identified (81% females), of whom 251 were enrolled in the new-onset arrhythmia group (mean age 50.4 years) and 251 in the non-arrhythmia group (mean age 49.1 years). There was no significantly increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia (adjusted odds ratio = 1.49, 95% confidence interval: 0.98-2.25) or ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted odds ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.19-5.41) between the patients with and without hydroxychloroquine treatment. In addition, there were no significant differences in the risk of arrhythmia between those receiving hydroxychloroquine treatment for <180 days or ≥180 days, with a drug adherence rate of <50% or ≥50%, and receiving a daily dose of <400 mg or ≥400 mg.In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, hydroxychloroquine treatment did not significantly increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia regardless of the different hydroxychloroquine treatment duration, drug adherence rate, or daily dose."
https://openalex.org/W3162157832,"Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan demonstrated resilience at the initial stage of epidemic prevention, and effectively slowed down its spread. This study aims to document public epidemic awareness of COVID-19 in Taiwan through collecting social media- and Internet-based data, and provide valuable experience of Taiwan’s response to COVID-19, involving citizens, news media, and the government, to aid the public in overcoming COVID-19, or infectious diseases that may emerge in the future. The volume of Google searches related to COVID-19 and face masks was regarded as an indicator of public epidemic awareness in the study. A time-series analysis was used to explore the relationships among public epidemic awareness and other COVID-19 relevant variables, which were collected based on big data analysis. Additionally, the content analysis was adopted to analyze the transmission of different types of fear information related to COVID-19 and their effects on the public. Our results indicate that public epidemic awareness was significantly correlated with the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan and the number of news reports on COVID-19 (correlation coefficient: .33–.56). Additionally, the findings from the content analysis suggested that the fear of the loss of control best explains why panic behavior occurs among the public. When confronting the highly infectious COVID-19, public epidemic awareness is vital. While fear is an inevitable result when an emerging infectious disease occurs, the government can convert resistance into assistance by understanding why fear arises and which fear factors cause excessive public panic. Moreover, in the digitalization era, online and social media activities could reflect public epidemic awareness that can e harnessed for epidemic control."
https://openalex.org/W3163179632,"The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an ectoparasitic crustacean that annually inflicts substantial losses to the aquaculture industry in the northern hemisphere and poses a threat to the wild populations of salmonids. The salmon louse life cycle consists of eight developmental stages each separated by a molt. Fushi Tarazu Factor-1 (FTZ-F1) is an ecdysteroid-regulated gene that encodes a member of the NR5A family of nuclear receptors that is shown to play a crucial regulatory role in molting in insects and nematodes. Characterization of an FTZ-F1 orthologue in the salmon louse gave two isoforms named αFTZ-F1 and βFTZ-F1, which are identical except for the presence of a unique N-terminal domain (A/B domain). A comparison suggest conservation of the FTZ-F1 gene structure among ecdysozoans, with the exception of nematodes, to produce isoforms with unique N-terminal domains through alternative transcription start and splicing. The two isoforms of the salmon louse FTZ-F1 were expressed in different amounts in the same tissues and showed a distinct cyclical expression pattern through the molting cycle with βFTZ-F1 being the highest expressed isoform. While RNA interference knockdown of βFTZ-F1 in nauplius larvae and in pre-adult males lead to molting arrest, knockdown of βFTZ-F1 in pre-adult II female lice caused disruption of oocyte maturation at the vitellogenic stage. No apparent phenotype could be observed in αFTZ-F1 knockdown larvae, or in their development to adults, and no genes were found to be differentially expressed in the nauplii larvae following αFTZ-F1 knockdown. βFTZ-F1 knockdown in nauplii larvae caused both down and upregulation of genes associated with proteolysis and chitin binding and affected a large number of genes which are in normal salmon louse development expressed in a cyclical pattern. This is the first description of FTZ-F1 gene function in copepod crustaceans and provides a foundation to expand the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of molting in the salmon louse and other copepods."
https://openalex.org/W3117710481,"Phenotypic variability for productive and meat quality traits has been largely studied in Iberian pigs, especially in genetic selection and nutritional experiments. Complex interactions among genetic background, diet composition and gut microbiota hinder the correct assessment of each factor's contribution on phenotypes. In order to disentangle these interactions, we evaluated changes in gut microbiota composition comparing 48 Iberian and Duroc pigs fed diets with different energy source (standard diet with carbohydrates vs sunflower oil-enriched diet with high oleic acid content).A higher richness was observed for Iberian pigs (p < 0.05) and compositional analysis was applied for beta-diversity, differential abundance and pairwise log-ratio analyses. We found significant differences in overall microbiota composition between breeds, and also between diets inside breeds, to a lesser extent. Differential abundance analysis revealed that Duroc animals have more proportion of Actinobacteria and Prevotella, while Iberian replace those microorganisms with other more variable taxa. According to dietary differences, high-oleic fed animals were richer in Prevotella. We also found microbial ratios capable of separating animals by breeds and diets, mostly related to Actinobacteria.This study reveals that both genetic background and diet composition might have a relevant impact in gut microbiota composition. The application of compositional data analysis has facilitated the identification of microorganisms and ratios as possibly related to metabolic changes due to genetic background and, to a lower extent, to dietary changes. This may lead to a relevant progress in the knowledge of interactions between pig genetics, environment and gut microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3160030973,"To determine providers' perceived barriers to utilization of antenatal and delivery services in urban and rural communities of Ebonyi state, Nigeria.A descriptive exploratory study design was used. Qualitative data was collected through the use of a pre-tested interview guide. Twelve providers participated in the study in urban and rural communities of Ebonyi State, Nigeria. They included nine officers in charge of primary health centers, two Chief Nursing Officers of a tertiary health institution and mission hospital and one Medical Officer-in-charge of a General hospital. QDA Miner Lite v2.0.6 was used in the analysis of the data.Most providers in urban and rural communities attributed good utilization of maternal health services to delivery of quality care. Most providers in urban linked poor utilization to poor health seeking behavior of women. In rural, poor utilization was credited to poor attitude of health workers. Few of participants (urban and rural) pointed out the neglect of primary health centers resulting in poor utilization. Most participants (urban and rural) considered ignorance as the main barrier to using health facilities for antenatal and delivery services. Another constraint identified was cost of services. Most participants attested that good provider attitude and public enlightenment will improve utilization of health facilities for antenatal and delivery care. All participants agreed on the need to involve men in matters related to maternal healthcare.Participants were aware of values of good provider attitude and this is commendable. This combined with the finding of poor attitude of health workers necessitates that health workers should be trained on quality of care. There is need for public enlightenment on need to utilize health facilities for antenatal and delivery services. Community ownership of primary health centers especially in rural communities will enhance utilization of such facilities for maternal healthcare services and should be encouraged. Involvement of men in matters related to maternal healthcare may have a positive influence in improving maternal health in Nigeria."

A case-control study was conducted by including medical facilities with (Cases) and without (Control) community-acquired infection of COVID-19. Responses from 711 hospitals and 707 private clinics were assessed (72% of all hospital and 59% all private clinics provided maternity service in Japan). Seventy-five COVID-19-positive pregnant women were treated in 52 facilities. Community-acquired infection was reported in 4.1% of the facilities. Of these, 95% occurred in the hospital. Nine patients developed a community-acquired infection in the maternity ward or obstetric department. Variables that associated with community-acquired infection of COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) were found to be state of emergency prefecture (4.93 [2.17–11.16]), PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on admission (2.88 [1.59–5.24]), and facility that cannot treat COVID-19 positive patients (0.34 [0.14–0.82]). In conclusion, community-acquired infection is likely to occur in large hospitals that treat a higher number of patients than private clinics do, regardless of the preventive measures used."

In melanocytes, cAMP's corresponding elements bind to the Creb protein to autophosphorylation and activate MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor). MITF stimulates Tyrosine(tyr) to induce melanocytes to differentiate into eumelanin and pheomelanin. In this study, a HcCreb gene in Hyriopsis cumingii was cloned and its effects on melanin synthesis and nacre color were studied. HcCreb was expressed in both purple and white mussels, and there was a significant difference in expression between adductor muscle (p<0.01) and mantle tissue (p<0.05). Other tissues did not show significant differences (except for gill tissue), and in general, the level of mRNA expression was higher in purple mussels than in white mussels. In both white and purple mussels expression levels in gill tissue was the highest, followed by the mantle. Strong and specific mRNA signals were detected in the dorsal epithelial cells of the mantle pallial layer, indicating that HcCreb may be involved in nacre formation. After arbutin treatment, the expression of HcCreb decreased significantly. By further testing the changes in mantle melanin content it was found that the melanin content after arbutin treatment decreased significantly compared to the control group (p<0.05). It is speculated that the HcCreb gene plays a role in the process of melanin synthesis and nacre color formation in H. cumingii."
https://openalex.org/W3161326018,"Background The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of prophylactic thrombolytic locks in hemodialysis patients at high-risk of thrombotic dialysis catheter dysfunction is uncertain. We investigated this question in a double-blinded randomized controlled study. Methods Prevalent hemodialysis patients from 8 Belgian hemodialysis units, with ≥2 separate episodes of thrombotic dysfunction of their tunneled cuffed catheter during the 6 months before inclusion, were randomized to either: taurolidine heparin locks thrice weekly (control arm) or the same locks twice a week combined with taurolidine urokinase locks once a week before the longest interval without HD (TaurolockU arm). The primary efficacy outcome was the incidence rate of catheter thrombotic dysfunction requiring thrombolytic locks to restore function. Results 68 hemodialysis patients (32 controls, 36 urokinase) were followed during 9875 catheter days between May 2015 and June 2017. Incidence rate of thrombotic catheter dysfunction was 4.8 in TaurolockU vs 12.1/1000 catheter days in control group (rate ratio 0.39; 95%CI 0.23–0.64). 15/36 (42%) catheters in the treatment group required at least one therapeutic urokinase lock vs 23/32 (72%) in the control group (P = 0.012). The two groups did not differ significantly in catheter-related bloodstream infection and combined cost of prophylactic and therapeutic catheter locks. The TaurolockU group had a numerically higher number of episodes of refractory thrombosis. Conclusions Prophylactic use of urokinase locks is highly effective in reducing the number of thrombotic catheter dysfunctions in catheters with a history of recurring dysfunction. Prophylactic use of urokinase locks did not reduce the overall costs associated with catheter locks and was associated with a numerically higher number of episodes of refractory thrombosis.

However, their effects on sevoflurane kinetics remain unknown. We aimed to determine whether inhaled salbutamol affected the wash-in and wash-out kinetics of sevoflurane and the occurrence of early postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in patients with COPD undergoing elective surgery. This randomized, placebo-controlled study included 63 consecutive patients with COPD allocated to the salbutamol (n = 30) and control groups (n = 33). The salbutamol group received salbutamol aerosol (2 puffs of ~200 μg) 30 min before anesthesia induction and 30 min before surgery completion. The control group received a placebo. Sevoflurane kinetics were determined by collecting end-tidal samples from the first breaths at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 15 min before the surgery (wash-in) and after closing the vaporizer (wash-out). PPCs were recorded for 7 days. The salbutamol group had higher end-tidal to inhaled sevoflurane ratios (p<0.05, p<0.01) than the control group, from 3 to 10 min during the wash-in period, but no significant differences were observed during the wash-out period. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inhaled oxygen was significantly higher in the salbutamol group at 30 (320.3±17.6 vs. 291.5±29.6 mmHg; p = 0.033) and 60 min (327.8±32.3 vs. 309.2±30.5 mmHg; p = 0.003). The dead space to tidal volume ratios at 30 (20.5±6.4% vs. 26.3±6.0%, p = 0.042) and 60 min (19.6±5.1% vs. 24.8±5.5%, p = 0.007) and the incidence of bronchospasm (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.67, p = 0.023) and respiratory infiltration (OR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.40-0.65, p = 0.017) were lower in the salbutamol group. In patients with COPD, salbutamol accelerates the wash-in rate of sevoflurane and decreases the occurrence of postoperative bronchospasm and pulmonary infiltration within the first 7 days."
https://openalex.org/W3161768311,"Reducing the impacts of agriculture on the environment is one of the greatest challenges of this century. In Brazil, it is often argued that more land use change is needed to achieve food security. However, analyses seeking to understand the dynamics between agricultural production for exports and food intended for the Brazilian population have not approached the question if national agriculture is sufficient to provide Brazilians with the necessary nutrients, according to nutritional recommendations. In this sense, we sought to combine supply and dietary requirements for food (calories and nutrients) to assess trends in nutrient production and how future population projections and possible changes in diets would affect land necessity for nutritional security. We use sub-national data on agricultural production, population, Food Balance Sheets from FAO, and a compilation of nutritional information on the Brazilian agricultural production. Our results show that, in the last three decades, Brazil produced enough food calories to feed on average 115% of its population. We found that the agricultural land in 2017, without any expansion, is sufficient to feed, at least, 105% of projected population in 2060, considering the same productivity and dietary patterns. In a vegan diet scenario, less than 10% of the land dedicated to agricultural production in the past 30 years would be required. Despite limitations on supplying certain micro-nutrients, a vegan diet would require even less land in the future. We conclude that Brazilian agriculture could deliver enough food to meet Brazilians' nutritional needs without further land expansion. Food production is compatible with environmental conservation in Brazil, especially if meat consumption is reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3162691310,"The risk of sepsis through bacterial transmission is one of the most serious problems in platelet transfusion. In processing platelet concentrates (PCs), several methods have been put into practice to minimize the risk of bacterial transmission, such as stringent monitoring by cultivation assays and inactivation treatment by photoirradiation with or without chemical agents. As another potential option, we applied a light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak emission wavelength of 265 nm, which has been shown to be effective for water, to disinfect PCs. In a bench-scale UV-LED exposure setup, a 10-min irradiation, corresponding to an average fluence of 9.2 mJ/cm2, resulted in >2.0 log, 1.0 log, and 0.6 log inactivation (mean, n = 6) of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, respectively, in non-diluted plasma PCs. After a 30-min exposure, platelet counts decreased slightly (18 ± 7%: mean ± SD, n = 7); however, platelet surface expressions of CD42b, CD61, CD62P, and PAC-1 binding did not change significantly (P>0.005), and agonist-induced aggregation and adhesion/aggregation under flow conditions were well maintained. Our findings indicated that the 265 nm UV-LED has high potential as a novel disinfection method to ensure the microbial safety of platelet transfusion."

Female sex (AOR = 3.79, 95% CI: 1.66-8.62) (p-value = 0.001), average monthly income of less than 1200 birr (AOR = 6.05 95% CI: 2.26-16.22) (p-value = 0.001), poor level of social support (AOR = 17.39 95% CI: 7.79-38.82) (p-value = 0.001), moderate and high risk of alcohol use (AOR = 10.42 95%CI: 2.74-39.54) (p-value = 0.001), presence of chronic medical illness (AOR = 3.85 95% CI: 2.07-7.16) (p-value = 0.001), receiving both drug and surgical treatment (AOR = 2.50, 95%CI: 1.30-4.83) (p-value = 0.006) and presence of systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors use (AOR = 3.16, 95%CI: 1.65-6.06) (p-value = 0.001) were significantly associated with increased level of common mental disorders.Significant numbers of glaucoma patients have CMD and found significantly associated with socio-economic, ocular and systemic clinical factors. Therefore, the integration of psychosocial care into the current treatment of patients with glaucoma would have a significant advantage to help these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3163823256,"Tumor emergence and progression is a complex phenomenon that assumes special molecular and cellular interactions. The hierarchical structuring and communication via feedback signaling of different cell types, which are categorized as the stem, progenitor, and differentiated cells in dependence of their maturity level, plays an important role. Under healthy conditions, these cells build a dynamical system that is responsible for facilitating the homeostatic regulation of the tissue. Generally, in this hierarchical setting, stem and progenitor cells are yet likely to undergo a mutation, when a cell divides into two daughter cells. This may lead to the development of abnormal characteristics, i.e. mutation in the cell, yielding an unrestrained number of cells. Therefore, the regulation of a stem cell's proliferation and differentiation rate is crucial for maintaining the balance in the overall cell population. In this paper, a maturity based mathematical model with feedback regulation is formulated for healthy and mutated cell lineages. It is given in the form of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations. The focus is laid on the dynamical effects resulting from acquiring a mutation in the hierarchical structure of stem, progenitor and fully differentiated cells. Additionally, the effects of nonlinear feedback regulation from mature cells into both stem and progenitor cell populations have been inspected. The steady-state solutions of the model are derived analytically. Numerical simulations and results based on a finite volume scheme underpin various expected behavioral patterns of the homeostatic regulation and cancer evolution. For instance, it has been found that the mutated cells can experience significant growth even with a single somatic mutation, but under homeostatic regulation acquire a steady-state and thus, ensuing healthy cell population to either a steady-state or a lower cell concentration. Furthermore, the model behavior has been validated with different experimentally measured tumor values from the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3135272772,"Introduction There is evidence that SARS-CoV2 has a particular affinity for kidney tissue and is often associated with kidney failure. Methods We assessed whether proteinuria can be predictive of kidney failure, the development of chronic kidney disease, and mortality in 37 critically ill COVID-19 patients. We used machine learning (ML) methods as decision trees and cut-off points created by the OneR package to add new aspects, even in smaller cohorts. Results Among a total of 37 patients, 24 suffered higher-grade renal failure, 20 of whom required kidney replacement therapy. More than 40% of patients remained on hemodialysis after intensive care unit discharge or died (27%). Due to frequent anuria proteinuria measured in two-thirds of the patients, it was not predictive for the investigated endpoints; albuminuria was higher in patients with AKI 3, but the difference was not significant. ML found cut-off points of &gt;31.4 kg/m 2 for BMI and &gt;69 years for age, constructed decision trees with great accuracy, and identified highly predictive variables for outcome and remaining chronic kidney disease. Conclusions Different ML methods and their clinical application, especially decision trees, can provide valuable support for clinical decisions. Presence of proteinuria was not predictive of CKD or AKI and should be confirmed in a larger cohort."
https://openalex.org/W3160835348,"We and others previously reported that the direct-acting agents (DAA) NS5A inhibitors (NS5Ai) and the host-targeting agents cyclophilin inhibitors (CypIs) inhibit HCV replication in vitro. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of NS5Ai and CypI offers a potent anti-HCV effect in vivo. A single administration of NS5Ai or CypI alone to HCV-infected humanized-mice inhibits HCV replication. The combination of NS5Ai with CypI suppresses HCV (GT1a, GT2a, GT3a and GT4a) replication in an additive manner. NS5Ai/CypI combinations provide a statistically more profound anti-HCV inhibition for GT2a and GT3a than GT1a and GT4a, leading to a fastest and deepest inhibition of GT2a and GT3a replications. Combining CypI with NS5Ai prevents the viral rebound normally observed in mice treated with NS5Ai alone. Results were confirmed in mice implanted with human hepatocytes from different donors. Therefore, the combination of NS5Ai with CypI may serve as a regimen for the treatment of HCV patients with specific genotypes and disorder conditions, which diminish sustain viral response levels to DAA, such as GT3a infection, cirrhosis, and DAA resistance associated with the selection of resistance-associated substitutions present at baseline or are acquired during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3161625170,"Multiple psychological factors of suicidal behaviour have been identified so far; however, little is known about state-dependent alterations and the interplay of the most prominent components in a suicidal crisis. Thus, the combined effect of particular personality characteristics and decision-making performance was observed within individuals who recently attempted suicide during a major depressive episode.Fifty-nine medication-free major depressed patients with a recent suicide attempt (within 72 h) and forty-five healthy control individuals were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Temperament and character factors, impulsivity and decision-making performance were assessed. Statistical analyses aimed to explore between-group differences and the most powerful contributors to suicidal behaviour during a depressive episode.Decision-making and personality differences (i.e. impulsivity, harm avoidance, self-directedness, cooperativeness and transcendence) were observed between the patient and the control group. Among these variables, decision-making, harm avoidance and self-directedness were shown to have the strongest impact on a recent suicide attempt of individuals with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to the results of the binary logistic regression analysis. The model was significant, adequately fitted the data and correctly classified 79.8% of the cases.The relevance of deficient decision-making, high harm avoidance and low self-directedness was modelled in the case of major depressed participants with a recent suicide attempt; meaning that these individuals can be described with the myopia for future consequences, a pessimistic, anxious temperament; and a character component resulting in the experience of aimlessness and helplessness. Further studies that use a within-subject design should identify and confirm additional characteristics specific to the suicidal mind."
https://openalex.org/W3161946967,"A comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for the matchsticks industry in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan to quantify environmental footprint, water footprint, cumulative energy use, and to identify improvement opportunities in the matchsticks manufacturing process. One carton of matchsticks was used as reference unit for this study. Foreground data was collected from the matchsticks industry through questionnaire surveys, personal meetings, and field measurements. The collected data was transformed into potential environmental impacts through the Centre for Environment Studies (CML) 2000 v.2.05 method present by default in the SimaPro v.9.1 software. Water footprint was calculated using methodology developed by Hoekstra et al., 2012 (water scarcity index) V1.02 and cumulative energy demand by SimaPro v.9.1 software. The results showed that transport of primary material (wood logs), sawn wood for matchsticks, red phosphorous, acrylic varnish, and kerosene fuel oil contributed to the overall environmental impacts. Transport of primary materials and sawn timber for matchsticks contributed significantly to abiotic depletion, global warming, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion, corrosion, human toxicity, and aquatic ecotoxicity effects. The total water footprint for manufacturing one carton of matchsticks was 0.265332 m3, whereas the total cumulative energy demand was 715.860 Mega Joules (MJ), mainly sourced from non-renewable fossil fuels (708.979 MJ). Scenario analysis was also conducted for 20% and 30% reduction in the primary material distance covered by trucks and revealed that reducing direct material transport distances could diminish environmental impacts and energy consumption. Therefore, environmental footprint could be minimized through diverting matchsticks industries freight from indigenous routes to high mobility highways and by promoting industrial forestry close to industrial zones in Pakistan. Many industries did not have emissions control systems, exceeding the permissible limit for emissions established by the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan. Thus, installation of emissions control system could also diminish emissions from match industry in Pakistan."
https://openalex.org/W3161497762,"In newborn screening, samples suspected for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a potentially lethal inborn error of steroid biosynthesis, need to be confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Daily quality controls (QCs) for the 2nd-tier CAH assay are not commercially available and are therefore generally prepared within the laboratory. For the first time, we aimed to compare five different QC preparation approaches used in routine diagnostics for CAH on the concentrations of cortisol, 21-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, 4-androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in dried blood spots. The techniques from Prep1 to Prep5 were tested at two analyte concentrations by spiking aliquots of a steroid-depleted blood, derived from washed erythrocyte suspension and steroid-depleted serum. The preparation processes differed in the sequence of the preparation steps and whether freeze-thaw cycles were used to facilitate blood homogeneity. The five types of dried blood spot QCs were assayed and quantitated in duplicate on five different days using a single calibration row per day. Inter-assay variations less than 15% and concentrations within ±15% of the nominal values were considered acceptable. Results obtained by means of the four dried blood spot QC preparation techniques (Prep1, Prep2, Prep4 and Prep5) were statistically similar and remained within the ±15% ranges in terms of both reproducibility and nominal values. However, concentration results for Prep3 (spiking prior to three freeze-thaw cycles) were significantly lower than the nominal values in this setting, with differences exceeding the ±15% range in many cases despite acceptable inter-assay variations. These findings have implications for the in-house preparation of QC samples in laboratory developed tests for CAH, including 2nd-tier assays in newborn screening."
https://openalex.org/W3161981691,"The famous Bradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons is widely used for ranking objects and is often applied to sports data. In this paper we extend the Bradley-Terry model by allowing time-varying latent strengths of compared objects. The time component is modelled with barycentric rational interpolation and Gaussian processes. We also allow for the inclusion of additional information in the form of outcome probabilities. Our models are evaluated and compared on toy data set and real sports data from ATP tennis matches and NBA games. We demonstrated that using Gaussian processes is advantageous compared to barycentric rational interpolation as they are more flexible to model discontinuities and are less sensitive to initial parameters settings. However, all investigated models proved to be robust to over-fitting and perform well with situations of volatile and of constant latent strengths. When using barycentric rational interpolation it has turned out that applying Bayesian approach gives better results than by using MLE. Performance of the models is further improved by incorporating the outcome probabilities."
https://openalex.org/W3162163026,"Background Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes and its complications can be reduced by enhancing the attitude of the community. However, there is limited information regarding attitude towards diabetes in northwest Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the attitude and associated factors of diabetes mellitus among adult non-diabetic participants in Gondar city. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gondar city. Systematic random sampling was employed to select 626 non-diabetic participants. The data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, processing, and analysis were done using STATA version 14. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used to identify the associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to calculate a level of significance. Results Of 626 participants, 572 (91.37%) study subjects heard about diabetes mellitus. Three hundred and fifteen participants (55.07%) (95% CI: 50.9% - 59.1%) had a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Having good knowledge about diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.87), and higher educational status (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.78) were positively associated with a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.98), on the other hand, had poor attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Conclusion In this study, a favorable attitude towards diabetes was low among adult non-diabetic participants. Good knowledge, higher educational status, and being male were the factors associated with a favorable attitude towards diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3162778512,"Objectives To establish and validate an individualized nomogram to predict the probability of death within 30 days in patients with sepsis-induced blood pressure drop would help clinical physicians to pay attention to those with higher risk of death after admission to wards. Methods A total of 1023 patients who were admitted to the Dongyang People’s Hospital, China, enrolled in this study. They were divided into model group (717 patients) and validation group (306 patients). The study included 13 variables. The independent risk factors leading to death within 30 days were screened by univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses and used for Nomogram. The discrimination and correction of the prediction model were assessed by the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the calibration chart. The clinical effectiveness of the prediction model was assessed by the Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Results Seven variables were independent risk factors, included peritonitis, respiratory failure, cardiac insufficiency, consciousness disturbance, tumor history, albumin level, and creatinine level at the time of admission. The area under the ROC curve of the model group and validation group was 0.834 and 0.836. The P value of the two sets of calibration charts was 0.702 and 0.866. The DCA curves of the model group and validation group were above the two extreme (insignificant) curves. Conclusions The model described in this study could effectively predict the death of patients with sepsis-induced blood pressure drop."
https://openalex.org/W3161104787,"The Non-Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment (NASG) is a first aid tool that can halt and reverse hypovolemic shock secondary to obstetric hemorrhage. The World Health Organization recommended the NASG for use as a temporizing measure in 2012, but uptake of the recommendation has been slow, partially because operational experience is limited. The study is a process evaluation of the introduction of NASG in a public sector health facility network in rural Zimbabwe utilizing an adapted RE-AIM, categorizing observations into the domains of: reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance. The location of the study was Hurungwe district, where staff members of 34 health facilities at primary (31), secondary (2) and tertiary (1) levels of care participated. We found that all facilities became skilled in using the NASG, and that the NASG was used in 10 of 11 instances of severe hemorrhage. In the cases of hypovolemic shock where the NASG was used, there were no maternal deaths and no extreme adverse outcomes related to obstetric hemorrhage in the study period. Among the 10 NASG uses, the garment was used correctly in each case. Fidelity to processes was high, especially in regard to training and cascading skills, but revisions of the NASG rotation and replacement operating procedures were required to keep clean garments stocked. Clinical documentation was also a key challenge. NASG introduction dovetailed very well with pre-existing systems for obstetric emergency response, and improved clinical outcomes. Scale-up of the NASG in the Zimbabwean public health system can be undertaken with careful attention to mentorship, drills, documentation and logistics."
https://openalex.org/W3161872128,"This study investigates the extent to which individuals' perceptions and attitudes toward pesticides and pollinator related labeling influence their preferences for eco-labeled products. An incentive compatible second-price auction and a hypothetical discrete choice experiment were used to elicit individual preferences for ornamental plants grown with or without controversial (neonicotinoid) pesticides. Positive attitudes toward pollinators, neonicotinoid labeling regulations, and labeling of sustainable production methods were found to be significant predictors of individual choice behavior. Individuals with attitudes expressing concern for pollinators and agreement with mandatory labeling and disclosure of neonicotinoids, showed a stronger preference for neonicotinoid-free plants. Our results suggest that both hypothetical and non-hypothetical experiments are consistent in predicting the general direction of consumer preferences despite the elicitation mechanism. Implications for relevant stakeholders are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3163496268,"Community water fluoridation (CWF) is the most effective and equitable approach to preventing dental caries (tooth decay). Yet millions of Americans, especially those at highest risk of caries, do not know what CWF is or its preventive benefits. State health departments are responsible for educating their respective populations. Thus, this study assessed health department websites (N = 50) to determine if CWF content existed, the ease of finding it, and if it was written in plain language and for a consumer audience. We used the web component of the HLE2: The Health Literacy Environment of Hospitals and Health Centers (HLE2) to assess how easy or difficult it was to the navigate a website and find information. Forty-one websites had CWF information; 37 states had content written for a consumer audience. HLE2 scores ranged from 0 to 54 points (60 possible). Only five states had websites with a HLE2 score of 50 or higher. SHDs with higher HLE2 scores were easy to navigate and their content was written for a consumer audience. Study findings suggest most SHDs should improve their website’s CWF content and its accessibility to better promote the role of fluoridated water in preventing dental caries."
