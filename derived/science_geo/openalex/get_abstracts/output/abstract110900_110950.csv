https://openalex.org/W1481540262,"We recently reported that overexpression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in rodent fibroblasts increases the stability of stress fibers during hyperthermia and partially prevents actin depolymerization during exposure to cytochalasin D (Lavoie, J.N., Gingras-Breton, G., Tanguay, R. M., and Landry, J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3420-3429). Because HSP27 is a ubiquitous target of phosphorylation upon cell stimulation with a variety of growth factors and agents that affect cellular differentiation, we examined the role of HSP27 phosphorylation in regulating actin filament dynamics. Here we show that HSP27 is enriched at the leading edge of polarized fibroblasts. HSP27 is localized in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles where most actin polymerization occurs. We developed Chinese hamster cell lines that constitutively overexpressed either human HSP27 or a nonphosphorylatable mutant form of the protein. Overexpression of HSP27 caused an increased concentration of filamentous actin (F-actin) at the cell cortex and elevated pinocytotic activity. In contrast, overexpression of the non-phosphorylatable mutant form of HSP27 reduced cortical F-actin concentration and decreased pinocytosis activity relative to control cells. Mitogenic stimulation of fibroblasts resulted in a rapid polymerization of submembranous actin filaments. HSP27 enhanced growth factor-induced F-actin accumulation, whereas mutant HSP27 exerted a dominant negative effect and inhibited this response to growth factors. Thus, HSP27 is a component of a signal transduction pathway that can regulate microfilament dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1494551606,"Experiments based on interaction in free solution between basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and saccharides related to heparin/heparan sulfate showed that the growth factor binds to heparin and to selectively glucosaminyl 6-O-desulfated heparin but poorly to iduronosyl 2-O-desulfated heparin. 2-O-sulfate groups thus are essential to the interaction, whereas 6-O-sulfates are not required nor do they interfere with FGF-2 binding. Comparison of various bound/nonbound oligosaccharides implicated a minimal pentasaccharide sequence for FGF-2 binding, with the structure: -hexuronic acid-glucosamine N-sulfate-hexuronic acid-glucosamine N-sulfate-iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate- (reducing terminus to the right). Such (overlapping) sequences are abundant in heparin, albeit heavily obscured by irrelevant O-sulfate groups, and occur also in heparan sulfate, with or without additional O-sulfates."
https://openalex.org/W1517486366,"Mutations at the fad7 locus of Arabidopsis thaliana (previously called fadD) cause decreased desaturation of dienoic fatty acids in chloroplast lipids in plants grown at elevated temperatures. This suggested that the fad7 locus encodes a chloroplast omega-3 desaturase that catalyzes the desaturation of lipid-linked 18:2 and 16:2 fatty acids. In order to clone the fad7 gene, it was first genetically mapped relative to the flanking restriction fragment length polymorphism markers 4547 and 2488A on chromosome 3, and yeast artificial chromosomes covering the locus were identified. A putative desaturase cDNA clone that was isolated by low stringency heterologous probing with a cDNA for an endoplasmic reticulum-localized omega-3 desaturase (fad3) hybridized to the yeast artificial chromosomes and could not be resolved from the locus by restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping. Expression of the cDNA in transgenic fad7 mutant plants resulted in restoration of wild type fatty acid composition and suppression of a previously observed effect of the fad7 mutation on chloroplast number, indicating genetic complementation. The structural gene contained seven introns within a coding sequence of 1338 base pairs, which encodes a 446-amino acid polypeptide of 51,172 daltons. The amino-terminal region of the fad7 gene product contained a consensus chloroplast transit peptide. Except for the amino-terminal domain, the deduced amino acid sequence of the fad7 gene product had high homology to the fad3 gene product, indicating that fad7 encodes an omega-3 desaturase and that the two genes arose from a common ancestral gene. There was no apparent effect of growth temperature on the steady-state levels of fad7 mRNA in wild type plants."
https://openalex.org/W1519489545,"Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or mitogen-activated protein kinase by MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) is an essential event in the mitogenic growth factor signal transduction. We now demonstrate that three recombinant MEKs (MEK1, MEK2, MEK3) show remarkably different activity toward recombinant ERK1 and ERK2. MEK2 is the most active ERK activator. The recombinant MEK1 has an activity approximately seven times lower than that of MEK2. MEK3, which is identical to MEK1 except for missing an internal 26-amino acid residue and probably represents an alternative splicing product of MEK1, shows neither autophosphorylation nor ERK-activating activity. Recombinant MEK1 and MEK2 can be activated by epidermal growth factor-stimulated SWISS3T3 cell lysate. MEK1 and MEK2 can also be activated by autophosphorylation. Autophosphorylation of MEKs correlates with their ability to phosphorylate and activate ERKs. Phosphorylation of MEK is also stimulated by ERK. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that ERK1 preferentially phosphorylated threonine residue of MEKs. MEKs complex with ERKs in vitro. Interestingly, MEK3 also forms a complex with ERK1, although it is totally inactive as an ERK activator."
https://openalex.org/W1529402516,"In vitro studies have indicated that the enzymatic activity of myosin II from non-muscle cells is controlled by phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain (LC20). We have studied one likely functional consequence of phosphorylating LC20 in living chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) by measuring contractile force developed by these cells. Using a recently developed method, we recorded quantitative changes in isometric force generated by a population of cells following mitogenic stimulation. Fetal bovine serum, thrombin, and lysophosphatidic acid stimulate rapid isometric contraction of CEF. Cells stimulated with thrombin develop maximal force within 5-10 min. Force development correlates temporally with a 3-5-fold increase in the overall fraction of LC20 phosphorylated and with the fractions of LC20 in both the monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated states. Unloaded shortening velocity also increases after thrombin stimulation. Although both force and phosphorylation begin to decline 10 min after stimulation, the level of phosphorylation declined more rapidly than the force. These results suggest that the role of LC20 phosphorylation in regulating fibroblast contractility is analogous to its well established role in regulating smooth muscle contraction and that quantitative measurements of the force developed by populations of fibroblasts (or other cultured cells) can be used to study the regulation of non-sarcomeric myosin at the molecular level in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1551123135,"To investigate the structural requirements for recognition and response to ligands by the human estrogen receptor (hER), a series of point mutations were generated in the hormone binding domain (HBD) of the receptor using a limited formic acid treatment of its cDNA. Receptors having a reduced sensitivity to the estrogen, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), or to the antiestrogen, trans-hydroxytamoxifen, were selected from a library of intact hER cDNAs containing these mutant HBDs by expression and phenotypic screening in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Several were sequenced, and the encoded receptors were characterized in both yeast and mammalian (Chinese hamster ovary) cells using hormone-binding and transactivation assays. In general, parallel phenotypes were observed in yeast and in Chinese hamster ovary cells following estrogen exposure. We report on 15 receptors having point mutations located at various positions throughout the HBD. Four categories of mutants were identified: 1) those showing no change from wild type in their response to E2; 2) those showing a greatly reduced transactivation response over the range of ligand concentrations tested; 3) those requiring much higher concentrations of E2 for maximal transactivation, indicating a reduced sensitivity to ligand; and 4) those showing reduced response to E2, but little change in response to trans-hydroxytamoxifen in yeast. Two mutations in the carboxyl terminus of the HBD eliminated hormone-dependent transactivation despite the continued ability to bind E2 with high affinity. Therefore, our results show a separation of the transactivation and hormone-binding functions of the hER, and indicate that the integrity of many regions throughout the large, approximately 250-amino acid HBD is important for these functions. Our studies also demonstrate the advantages of using regional mutagenesis combined with phenotypic screening in yeast to complement site-directed mutagenesis when investigating a large, functionally complex region."
https://openalex.org/W1501279556,"To define the regulation of chemoattractant receptors, epitope-tagged human formyl peptide and C5a receptor cDNAs (ET-FR and ET-C5aR) were stably expressed in rat basophilic leukemia, RBL-2H3 cells. An antibody (12CA5) specific to ET was used to immunoprecipitate ET-FR and ET-C5aR. fMLP and C5a caused time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of their respective receptors. Phosphorylated ET-FR migrated as a single broad band between 50 and 70 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas ET-C5aR exhibited both fast (39-45 kDa) and broadly (39-52 kDa) migrating forms. Fast form phosphorylation alone was observed at low concentrations of C5a (0.001-0.01 microM), or at early times (5-30 s) with a higher concentration of C5a (0.1 microM). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, thrombin, or antigen caused no phosphorylation of ET-FR but stimulated exclusively fast form phosphorylation of ET-C5aR. The protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine did not inhibit phosphorylation of ET-FR but blocked the fast migrating component of phosphorylated ET-C5aR. Homologous desensitization correlated with ligand-induced phosphorylation of both receptors. Of note, ET-C5aR but not ET-FR underwent heterologous desensitization by antigen, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and thrombin. The data suggest that protein kinase C mediates heterologous phosphorylation and desensitization of C5aR but not FR, yet, both receptors are homologously desensitized by a staurosporine-resistant kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1527109045,"The insulinoma beta-cell line INS-1 expresses the L-type pyruvate kinase gene at high level and responds to a rise in extracellular glucose by strong induction of gene expression. Following the addition of glucose to the culture medium in the 3.5-33 mM concentration range, the cellular level of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA increases within 2 h and reaches a maximum 15-fold above basal in 8-12 h. By run-on nuclear assay, the relative transcription rate of the pyruvate kinase gene is shown to increase 4-fold at maximal stimulation, suggesting that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects contribute to mRNA accumulation. The glucose effect is totally suppressed by the hexokinase inhibitor mannoheptulose, indicating a requirement for glucose phosphorylation. The mRNA induction is not inhibited in glutamine-free culture medium or by azaserine, suggesting that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is not involved. Moreover, metabolism along the glycolytic pathway does not appear to be an absolute requisite, since 2-deoxyglucose partly mimics the inductive effect of glucose. The glucose effect on the pyruvate kinase gene is reversibly antagonized by agents increasing intracellular cAMP. In addition, the effect is highly specific to the pyruvate kinase gene. Neither proinsulin I mRNA nor glucokinase mRNA are increased in glucose-stimulated INS-1 cells. Short term transfection with CAT plasmids driven by the pyruvate kinase L promoter reveals specific glucose-inducible reporter activity with the 183-base pair promoter region upstream of the cap site. Within this region, the previously described L4 cis-acting element is crucial for glucose responsiveness, as demonstrated by the fact that a plasmid with a mutation in this element does not elicit glucose-inducible CAT activity. Induction of L-type pyruvate kinase mRNA occurs in the islets of rats subjected to fasting and carbohydrate refeeding. In conclusion, the L-type pyruvate kinase gene provides an interesting model of glucose-regulated gene in the endocrine beta-cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1544752101,"The expression of syndecan-1, the prototype member of the cell surface proteoglycan family, follows morphogenetic rather than histological boundaries during organ formation. As a heparan sulfate-containing cell surface molecule, syndecan-1 can simultaneously bind various components of the extracellular matrix and members of the heparin-binding growth factors. Indeed, syndecan-1 may act as a co-receptor for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Salmivirta, M., Heino, J., and Jalkanen, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 17606-17610), allowing the growth factor to bind the tyrosine kinase bFGF receptor. We have studied the role of syndecan-1 in growth factor response by growing 3T3 cells transfected with syndecan-1 in the presence of bFGF. The enhanced expression of syndecan-1 caused down-regulation of bFGF-induced cell proliferation and, at the same time, enhancement of cell matrix interactions. Thus, the induced expression of the heparan sulfate co-receptor (syndecan-1) may provide a mechanism to restrict FGF action and modulate cell-matrix interactions to maintain co-ordinated growth of cells during organ formation."
https://openalex.org/W1534194237,"GATA-1 is a lineage-restricted transcription factor. Virtually all erythroid-expressed genes contain GATA recognition sites in their regulatory elements. Cotransfection/transactivation assays have revealed that, although GATA-1 as the only cell-restricted transcription factor is sufficient to activate some of the erythroid-specific promoters, not all such promoters are responsive, suggesting a requirement for cooperation with other factors. To study the interaction of GATA-1 with other transactivators, we analyzed sequence motifs of the human gamma-globin promoter as response system by in vitro transcription and by transfections into erythroid K562 cells or into heterologous Drosophila SL2 cells. GATA-1 alone did not activate the promoter. However, GATA-1 exerted an effect in concert with the ubiquitous transactivator Sp1. Depending on the factor concentrations and the sequence context of the cognate binding sites, this interaction could result in synergistic transcriptional activation or in interference. GATA-1 and Sp1 did not cooperate in DNA binding when tested in vitro. This suggests that the functional cooperation is mediated by protein interactions with additional factor(s) which transmit the activator signal. The Sp1-binding CCACCC motif was found to be critical for high activity of the gamma-globin promoter. This site overlaps with a recognition sequence for members of the NFI/CTF family. NFI did not transactivate, but it interfered with Sp1-mediated stimulation and hence with Sp1/GATA-1 cooperation. These data, together with phylogenetic evidence, suggest that the CCACCC region is likely to represent a regulatory switch element."
https://openalex.org/W1514760659,"An Escherichia coli expression system was used to produce recombinant ricin A chain (RTA) and RTA modified either by the addition of a carboxyl-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retrieval sequence Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (RTAKDEL) or a nonfunctional analogue Lys-Asp-Glu-Ala (RTAKDEA). These RTA molecules can enter mammalian cells by fluid phase endocytosis. RTAKDEL was significantly more cytotoxic than either RTA or RTAKDEA to both Vero cells and HeLa cells (250- and 10-fold, respectively), despite the fact that all these RTA molecules had comparable enzymatic activities. This difference did not result from KDEL-mediated binding of RTAKDEL to the cell surface. Enhanced cytotoxicity could be correlated with an increased level of ribosome inactivation, measured as the RTA-catalyzed depurination of 28 S ribosomal RNA. These results indicate that the added KDEL sequence facilitated RTA entry into the cytosol. We propose that interaction with the intracellular KDEL receptor promotes retrograde transport of the toxin to the endoplasmic reticulum, where translocation of RTA into the cytosol occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1581694888,"Resting cells of Rhodotorula rubra converted transferulic acid (1) to vanillic acid (2), then to guaiacol (3) and protocatechuic acid (4), under aerobic conditions. In an argon atmosphere, R. rubra transformed ferulic acid to vanillic acid and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (5). Metabolites were isolated by solid-phase extraction and characterized by mass spectrometry, 1H, and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The biotransformation of ferulic acid to vanillic acid by R. rubra cell-free extracts required CoA, ATP, and NAD+. Mass spectrometry and 13C-NMR were used to demonstrate the incorporation of oxygen from H2(18)O during the conversion of ferulic acid to vanillic acid. The results suggest a parallel between this bioconversion reaction and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Proton-carbon correlation NMR spectroscopy was used to demonstrate the specific incorporation of deuterium from D2O into guaiacol obtained from vanillic acid. The incorporation of deuterium implicates the involvement of a quinoid vanillic acid tautomer as an intermediate in the decarboxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1505529270,"A membrane sensor protein, ArcB, recognizes anaerobic environments and signals the information to the cognate regulator, ArcA. This in vitro study presents the process and control of the signal-transduction phosphorylation. In the presence of ATP, the ArcB transmitter module undergoes autophosphorylation and then transfers the phosphoryl group to its own receiver module as well as to the ArcA receiver module. Results suggest that the phosphoryl group of the ArcB receiver module is released by an intrinsic phosphatase activity. D-Lactate inhibits the phosphatase activity that removes phosphoaspartate groups from the receiver module in ArcB, and the associated increase in phosphorylation of this module leads to an activation of transphosphorylation of subsequently added phosphohistidine groups on ArcB to the receiver module of ArcA. A similar effect was also observed in the presence of pyruvate, acetate, or NADH. Conversely, the non-phosphorylated ArcB receiver module completely inhibits the intermolecular transphosphorylation. Thus, the phosphorylation state of the ArcB receiver module controls signal transduction from ArcB to ArcA. Since the intrinsic phosphatase activity is inhibited by cellular metabolites that increasingly accumulate by anaerobiosis, the enzyme portion of ArcB may be involved in sensing anaerobic environments through cellular metabolites in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1505601192,"NADPH oxidase, the respiratory burst enzyme of human neutrophils, is a multi-component complex that is assembled and activated during stimulation of the cells by inflammatory or phagocytic stimuli. The signal mechanisms leading to activation of the enzyme are unclear, but it is likely that phospholipases are involved. Recent work has shown that phosphatidic acid, the initial product of phospholipase D activation, is a weak activator of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system. We now show that diacylglycerol enhances the cell-free activation of NADPH oxidase activation by phosphatidic acid. 1,2-Didecanoyl phosphatidic acid (10:0-PA) and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (8:0-DG) each increased levels of NADPH oxidase activity in mixtures of membrane and cytosolic fractions about 2-fold. The combination of both lipids increased NADPH oxidase activity approximately 12-fold, indicative of a synergistic response. Fatty acid and neutral lipid metabolites of 10:0-PA or 8:0-DG were ineffective, suggesting activation is directly mediated by phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol. Activation was time- and concentration-dependent with maximum activation at 30-60 min and a sharp peak of maximal activity at 10 microM 10:0-PA and 30 microM 8:0-DG. In lipid specificity studies, activity of PA or DG decreased with increasing acyl chain length but was restored by introducing unsaturation in the acyl chain. Natural forms of PA stimulated levels of activity comparable to that seen with 10:0-PA. Synthetic and natural phosphatidylserines, but not other phospholipids, could replace phosphatidic acid in the synergistic response. These studies provide direct evidence for a synergistic interaction between phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol in mediating a cellular function: the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase. Our results support the concept that the generation of second messenger lipids by phospholipase D is a key step in activation of the respiratory burst enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1537687433,"This study was undertaken to examine the regulation of renin release and gene expression in primary cultures of juxtaglomerular granular (JGG) cells. JGG cells, isolated from mouse kidney, demonstrated high purity and showed regulated renin release in vitro. Changes in steady-state renin mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques, with polymerase chain reaction amplification efficiency monitored by co-amplification of experimental samples with a dilution series of cDNA for a mutant template. When the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of forskolin, isoproterenol, or 8-bromo-cAMP plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 24 h or cholera toxin for 12 h, renin mRNA levels were increased 3.9-, 4.4-, 5.1-, and 3.3-fold, respectively (all, p < 0.05). A significant increase in renin mRNA levels was observed 8 h after treatment with forskolin, but no change was detectable at 4 h. Cycloheximide did not prevent the increase in renin mRNA by isoproterenol. When RNA synthesis was inhibited by incubation with actinomycin D (5 micrograms/ml), renin mRNA levels declined with a half-life of 3.0 +/- 0.8 h. Treatment with forskolin increased renin mRNA half-life to 10.8 +/- 2.7 h (p < 0.025). The half-life of beta-actin, endothelin-1, or the facilitative glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) mRNA expressed in the same cells was not altered, although the steady-state levels of GLUT-1 mRNA increased 2.2-fold after treatment with forskolin. These data demonstrate that cAMP increases renin release and mRNA levels in JGG cells in vitro, that the stimulatory effect of cAMP on renin mRNA is delayed but does not require new protein synthesis, and that the increased renin mRNA levels induced by cAMP are due in part to a selective increase in renin mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1603103450,"Short chain (SCAD), medium chain (MCAD), and long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (LCAD) catalyze the first step of fatty acid oxidation, while isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) is involved in leucine oxidation. They are homologous flavoproteins belonging to the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) family. Electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) serves as an obligatory electron acceptor for these reactions. We demonstrated that the expression of SCAD, MCAD, and LCAD and the alpha-subunit of ETF (alpha-ETF) showed a similar developmental pattern, while that of IVD was distinctly different from others. The ontogenic pattern of each enzyme in the liver differed distinctly from that in the heart. The degree of glucagon-enhanced ACD expression in vivo and in vitro in both the liver and heart was especially high in fasted rats. Dexamethasone induced all ACD mRNAs in the heart. In contrast, it strongly suppressed mRNAs of all ACDs and alpha-ETF mRNA in the liver, except IVD mRNA. Dexamethasone induced IVD mRNA in both the liver and heart. Starvation strongly stimulated expression of all five genes in various tissues, with the highest in the heart, except the IVD gene which was down-regulated. The degree of induction by 3-day starvation differed in different age groups of rats. Feeding the rats a fat-free diet for 7 days caused a marked increase of IVD mRNA in the heart, whereas the high fat diet for the same period resulted in a severe decrease of the same degree, suggesting a protein-sparing mechanism. However, these manipulations of dietary fat content had little effect on the expression of other ACD genes."
https://openalex.org/W1485670014,"rho GDI is an inhibitory GDP/GTP exchange protein for the rho family. Recently, rho GDI has been reported to interact with the GTP-bound form of G25K and rac1 p21 and to inhibit their basal and GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-stimulated GTPase activity. Here, we examined whether rho GDI interacts with the GTP-bound form of rho p21 and rac p21 and inhibits their basal and rho GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, rho GDI interacted with both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of rhoA p21 and rac1 p21 as estimated by measuring its ability to form a complex with both forms and to inhibit the membrane-binding activity of both forms. The efficiency of rho GDI for interaction with the GTP-bound form was, however, about 10% that for interaction with the GDP-bound form. Moreover, rho GDI inhibited both the basal and rho GAP-stimulated GTPase activity of rhoA p21 and rac1 p21 in a dose-dependent manner. The doses of rho GDI necessary for this action were, however, about 10-fold higher than those necessary for the action to inhibit their GDP/GTP exchange reaction. These results indicate that rho GDI interacts with the GTP-bound form of its substrate small G proteins, as well as with the GDP-bound form, but much less efficiently than with the GDP-bound form."
https://openalex.org/W126950376,"The activity of N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP-2) was characterized in control, ras-transformed, and tyrosine kinase-(fps) transformed rat fibroblasts. PAP-2 was assayed in two different ways: 1) within its natural membrane using liposomes of phosphatidate and 2) in the presence of sufficient Triton X-100 to solubilize PAP-2, and to form mixed micelles with the phosphatidate. Harvesting the fibroblasts in medium containing orthovanadate and Zn2+ gave up to 3-fold higher PAP-2 activities when measured in the absence, but not in the presence, of Triton X-100. PAP-2-specific activities from both assays increased in the control fibroblasts as the cells reached confluence. Both specific activities were lower in the oncogenically transformed fibroblasts than in controls at all cell densities tested. The specific activities of PAP-2 did not increase with time in culture in transformed cells which continued to divide. The relative increase in activity of phospholipase D after stimulation with serum or phorbol myristate acetate was lower in the transformed fibroblasts compared to control cells. This indicates a coordinated decrease in the phospholipase D/phosphatidate phosphohydrolase pathway at the level of both enzymes in ras and fps transformed fibroblasts. The ratio of the production of diacylglycerol relative to phosphatidate, after stimulation with serum, or phorbol ester, was lower in both transformed fibroblasts relative to the controls. This is compatible with the decreased specific activity of PAP-2 and indicates functional significance for the differences in PAP-2 activity in regulating the balance between the two mitogenic lipids, phosphatidate and diacylglycerol. Control of PAP-2 activity could be an important factor in regulating appropriate signals for cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1490908705,"Conserved site-directed mutations were introduced into the second most conserved amino acid region, region II, of the human DNA polymerase alpha catalytic subunit. These mutants were expressed in the baculovirus system and purified to near homogeneity. The mutants had polymerase activity ranging from 4 to 60% compared with the wild type polymerase alpha. Steady-state kinetic analysis of mutants G841A, D860A, D860S, D860N, Y865S, and Y865F demonstrated no significant difference in their Km values for primer-template compared with that of the wild type enzyme. In contrast, mutants D860A, Y865S, and Y865F showed a 5-10-fold increase in the Km for deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) compared with the wild type enzyme. DNA synthetic fidelity studies of these mutants showed that mutant Y865S but not Y865F had a greater than 10-fold higher misinsertion efficiency than the wild type enzyme in Mg(2+)-catalyzed reactions. However, with Mn2+ as the metal activator, Y865S and Y865F demonstrated a 2- and 9-fold higher misinsertion efficiency, respectively. These results indicate that Asp860 and Tyr865 in region II of human DNA polymerase alpha are involved in incoming dNTP substrate binding. Using three deoxynucleotide structural analogs as probes, we show that the nucleotide base is the structural requirement for dNTP binding with Tyr865. Furthermore, abolishing the hydrophobic phenyl ring side chain of Tyr865 by replacing tyrosine with serine rendered the enzyme resistant to aphidicolin. Results of these studies strongly suggest that the phenyl ring of Tyr865 directly interacts with the nucleotide base moiety of the dNTP and plays a critical role in the misinsertion fidelity of DNA synthesis. Although mutation of Gly841 to Ala did not affect the binding of primer-template, it had a significant decrease in kcat, an increase in Km for dNTP, a striking decrease of processivity, and also resistance to aphidicolin. Thus, mutation of this residue, Gly841, which is highly conserved among the alpha-like DNA polymerases, appears to affect both catalysis and substrate deoxynucleotide binding. This suggests that Gly841 is essential for the maintenance of the overall structure of the polymerase alpha catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1530259684,"The nucleotide sequence of two genes encoding fibronectin (Fn) receptors FnBA and FnBB of Streptococcus dysgalactiae S2 revealed the presence of repeated motifs (called RA1-A3 and RB1-B3, respectively) which encode Fn binding activity (Lindgren, P.-E., McGavin, M. J., Signas, C., Guss, B., Gurusiddappa, S., Hook, M., and Lindberg, M. (1993) Eur. J. Biochem. 214, 819-827). Synthetic peptides of 32-37 amino acids, corresponding to individual repeated motifs, were assayed for the ability to inhibit Fn binding to cells of S. dysgalactiae. Within the RA motifs, peptide A2 was 10-fold more active than either A1 or A3, while in the RB motifs, only B3 was active. The same level of activity is observed when these synthetic peptides were assayed for inhibition of Fn binding to cells of Staphylococcus aureus. Likewise, synthetic peptides corresponding to the RD1-D3 motifs, which comprise a ligand binding domain in a Fn receptor from S. aureus, inhibit binding of Fn to both S. aureus and S. dysgalactiae. Assays of chemically modified peptides and peptide fragments derived from chemical or proteolytic cleavage suggest that a conserved core sequence, defined as ED(T/S) (X9,10)GG(X3,4)(I/V)DF, within a 30-amino acid-long segment is present in the active RA and RD motifs. Analyses of the importance of individual residues of this core sequence indicate that the ED(T/S) motif is nonessential, whereas the GG and the (I/V)DF together with additional acidic residues in the C-terminal half of the peptide are required for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1504615345,"Adherence of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites to colonic mucins and resistance to lysis by the membrane attack complex of complement are mediated by a galactose- and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific cell-surface lectin. This lectin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein of heavy (170 kDa) and light (35/31 kDa) subunits. In this work, the amino acid sequence and membrane anchor of the light subunit were analyzed. The light subunit cDNA encoded a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32 kDa containing two potential sites for N-linked glycosylation and putative amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences characteristic of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. No classical carbohydrate-binding domains common to C- or S-type eukaryotic lectins were detected by sequence analysis of either the heavy or light subunits, leaving the location of the ligand-binding site of the lectin unknown. Analysis of restriction enzyme-digested E. histolytica DNA by Southern blotting was consistent with the presence of more than one light subunit gene. Two light subunit isoforms of 31 and 35 kDa were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of affinity-purified lectin, and the isoforms were shown on two-dimensional gel analysis to form distinct 170/35- and 170/31-kDa heterodimers. The amino acid compositions and cyanogen bromide peptide patterns of the two light subunit isoforms were nearly identical. The 35-kDa isoform labeled more efficiently than the 31-kDa isoform with [3H]glucosamine, while only the 31-kDa isoform labeled with [3H]myristate and [3H]palmitate. Nitrous acid deamination released lipid from the 31-kDa isoform, which co-migrated on thin layer chromatography with acylphosphatidylinositol, a component of some GPI anchors. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of the deamination product from the 31-kDa subunit identified both myo- and chiro-inositols, supporting the presence of a GPI membrane anchor. The covalent association of a transmembrane protein with a GPI-anchored protein, as suggested by the cDNA sequences of the lectin heavy and light subunits, is novel and suggests unique roles for the two subunits in the pathogenesis of amebiasis."

A recent report has suggested that mannosamine exerts these effects by becoming incorporated into glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor intermediates (Pan, Y-T., Kamitani, T., Bhuvaneswaran, C., Hallaq, Y., Warren, C. D., Yeh, E. T. H., and Elbein, A. D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21250-21255). In this paper we have analyzed the effects of mannosamine on glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and variant surface glycoprotein biosynthesis in the blood-stream form of T. brucei. Trypanosomes were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]mannosamine, and [3H]glucosamine in the presence of mannosamine, and the structures of the labeled glycolipids which accumulated were determined. The main glycolipid metabolite of mannosamine was shown to be ManN-Man-GlcN-PI. A trypanosome cell-free system preloaded with this compound was significantly impaired in its ability to synthesize glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor intermediates beyond Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN alpha 1-6PI. This compound is therefore proposed to be an inhibitor of the Dol-P-Man:Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcNa alpha 1-6PI alpha 1-2-mannosyltransferase of the GPI biosynthetic pathway. In living trypanosomes, 4 mM mannosamine had no effect on protein synthesis but reduced the rate of formation of mature glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor precursors by 80%. This reduction in anchor precursor synthesis was insufficient to prevent the attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors to newly synthesized variant surface glycoprotein molecules. These data suggest that the rate of anchor precursor synthesis in the bloodstream form of T. brucei, in contrast to mammalian cells and the procyclic form of T. brucei, is in large excess of the cellular requirements for protein anchorage."
https://openalex.org/W1555947589,"Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen biosynthesis, is regulated by multisite phosphorylation. The protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) phosphorylates 4 Ser residues (Ser-640, Ser-644, Ser-648, and Ser-652; also known as sites 3a, 3b, 3c, and 4, respectively) at the COOH terminus of the subunit. Phosphorylation of these sites by GSK-3 is sequential, from COOH- to NH2-terminal, and is wholly dependent on prior phosphorylation by casein kinase II at Ser-656 (site 5). Expression in Escherichia coli was used to generate mutant forms of glycogen synthase, S640A, S644A, and S648A, in which site 3a, site 3b, or site 3c was changed to Ala, respectively. The purified enzymes had -/+ glucose-6-P activity ratios in the range of 0.8-0.9. Phosphorylation by casein kinase II and GSK-3 gave results consistent with the model of obligate sequential action of GSK-3. Phosphorylation at site 5, sites 4 + 5, or sites 3c + 4 + 5 had no measurable effect on activity. When sites 3b + 3c + 4 + 5 were phosphorylated, modest inactivation resulted. Additional phosphorylation at site 3a, however, was potently inactivating, reducing the -/+ glucose-6-P activity ratio to 0.1 and increasing the glucose-6-P concentration needed for half-maximal activation by an order of magnitude. Introduction of each additional phosphate, in the order site 4, 3c, 3b, and 3a, caused an incremental reduction in the mobility of the subunit when analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The results of this study demonstrate that GSK-3 phosphorylation of site 3a (Ser-640), and to a lesser extent, site 3b, correlates with inactivation of glycogen synthase by GSK-3. Evidence is also presented for an allosteric mechanism of inactivation whereby modification of one subunit influences the activity state of adjacent subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1598940851,"A mutant cell line of Leishmania donovani (R2D2), previously selected for resistance to the cytotoxic lectin ricin agglutinin, was found to be totally deficient in the synthesis and expression of lipophosphoglycan, a dominant surface virulence factor. The metabolic defect in R2D2 parasites responsible for its lipophosphoglycan (LPG-) phenotype was investigated in this study. Following metabolic labeling of R2D2 parasites with either [3H]galactose or [3H]mannose, the main glycosylphosphatidylinositide product that accumulated was Glc-PO4-Man-Man-GlcN-lyso-1-O-alkylphosphatidylinositol (PI). The metabolic defect was further defined using a cell-free glycosylation system. When membrane preparations from wild-type cells were incubated with UDP-[3H]galactose and unlabeled GDP-mannose in the absence of exogenous acceptors, radiolabeled lipophosphoglycan was synthesized. The addition of exogenous Man-Man-GlcN-PI or Galf-Man-Man-GN-PI stimulated lipophosphoglycan synthesis in vitro. In contrast, when membrane preparations from R2D2 cells were incubated with exogenous Man-Man-GlcN-PI as an acceptor or in the absence of exogenous acceptor, the truncated glycosylphosphatidylinositide Glc-PO4-Man-Man-GlcN-PI was the main radioactive product synthesized. However, when exogenous Galf-Man-Man-GN-PI was added to the R2D2 in vitro system, radioactive lipophosphoglycan was synthesized. Collectively, these results indicate that the mutant R2D2 cells are unable to complete the assembly of the glycan core of LPG because of a defect in the synthesis of the activated galactofuranosyl donor or the lack of a functional galactofuranosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1548412131,"Wild type PC12 pheochromocytoma cells express a Na(+)-dependent norepinephrine transporter that operates in the uptake of catecholamines, including dopamine. This transporter is not expressed in two spontaneously occurring flat cell variants of PC12 or in two other flat cell variants whose phenotype was induced by expression of the Wnt-1 oncogene. However, each of the flat cell variants, including those that express Wnt-1, exhibit a Na(+)-dependent, Cl(-)-independent glutamate/aspartate transporter activity that is not present in wild type PC12 cells. The flat cell variants took up glycine by a Na(+)-dependent process as well as did wild type cells. All of the flat cell variants have decreased levels of norepinephrine transporter mRNA but normal levels of glycine transporter mRNA. Glutamate/aspartate transporter mRNA was detected only in the variants that exhibited glutamate/aspartate transporter activity, and the nucleotide sequence of a partial glutamate/aspartate transporter cDNA from these cells demonstrated that it was the glial form of the transporter that was expressed. These variants were more sensitive than was wild type PC12 to alanosine, a toxic aspartate analog that enters cells by a transporter-mediated system such as the glutamate/aspartate transporter; however, these variants were as sensitive as wild type cells to another toxic aspartate analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid, which is believed to enter cells by endocytosis. We suggest that the Wnt-1 gene product, or a homolog, may be involved in glial differentiation and that the mechanisms that alter the expression of the norepinephrine and glutamate/aspartate transporters in wild type and variant PC12 cells may also operate to regulate neurotransmitter transporter expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1521200617,"Transcriptional activation of interferon A (IFNA) gene in virus-infected cells is controlled by a 35-nucleotide inducible element that is cell type specific. Within this region, two elements, alpha F1 and IRF-1 binding sites, were shown by mutation analysis to play a crucial role in the expression of inducible element. In this study, we have analyzed the binding of nuclear proteins to the alpha F1 sequence and have shown that the induction is associated with the formation of a novel complex alpha F1/B, which contains at least two DNA binding proteins of 68 and 96 kDa. In contrast, no binding of the purified interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) either to the alpha F1 or IRF-1 binding sites could be detected in vitro. However, the oligonucleotides corresponding to alpha F1 or IRF-1 binding sites competed efficiently for the induction of IFNA4 promoter region in a transient transfection assay. We suggest that the induction of IFNA promoter region requires cooperation between alpha F1 binding proteins and IRF-1. Interestingly, our data also show that the inability of IFNA6 promoter to be expressed in infected L-cells may be a result of a viral-induced repressor, which could act by binding and inactivating alpha F1 or by competing for the IRF-1 binding site. These results suggest that cell-specific expression of IFNA genes results from core-cruitment of trans-acting factors that bind to alpha F1 and the IRF-1 binding site with the cell-specific virus-induced activator or repressor."

Fe2+ was efficiently removed from the enzyme with o-phenanthroline to yield an apoenzyme with less than 5% of the catalytic activity of native enzyme. The time courses for inactivation and for removal of Fe2+ from the enzyme by o-phenanthroline were similar. Apoenzyme reconstituted with Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, or Zn2+ (M2+CDase) had kcat values of 185, 88, 50, and 32 s-1, respectively. The Km values of these M2+CDases for cytosine were similar (0.22-0.39 mM). Cytosine potently inhibited reconstitution of the apoenzyme with Fe2+. Fe2+CDase was rapidly inactivated by 1 mM H2O2 (t1/2 < 1 s), whereas Mn2+CDase, Co2+CDase, and Zn2+CDase were not inactivated by H2O2. CDase was also inhibited by excess divalent cations. Cu2+ and Zn2+ reversibly inhibited Fe2+CDase activity with inhibition constants of 1.8 and 5.8 microM, respectively. Cu2+ dissociated slowly from the secondary binding on CDase with a rate constant of 2 x 10(-3) s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1483109934,"Yeast dolichyl-phosphate-mannose synthase was purified from cultures of Escherichia coli carrying the gene for this enzyme in a high expression vector. The synthase contains a highly conserved hydrophobic amino acid sequence proposed to be involved in the recognition of dolichols (Albright, C. F., Orlean, P., and Robbins, P. W. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7366-7369) and amino acid residues in this sequence were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Conservative substitutions had no effect on the affinity of the enzyme for dolichyl-P. The substitution of asparagine for isoleucine at position 253 resulted in higher values for the apparent Km for Dol-P when assayed in detergent solutions, but this substitution had no effect on Km when the enzyme was reconstituted with phosphatidylethanolamine. Enzyme containing a deletion of the entire putative dolichol recognition sequence retained catalytic activity. The apparent Km for Dol-P was increased when this enzyme was assayed in detergent solution but was the same as wild type enzyme when reconstituted in phosphatidylethanolamine. These results suggest that the amino acid composition and sequence of the conserved domain are not critically important for the recognition and binding of Dol-P when the synthase is present in a lipid matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1593216456,"Protein kinase C (PKC) down-regulation has been shown to correlate with the growth of murine melanocytic cells in culture (Brooks, G., Wilson, R. E., Dooley, T. P., Goss, M. W., and Hart, I. R. (1991) Cancer Res. 51, 3281-3288). We now show that PKC alpha, delta, epsilon, and zeta isoforms are present at the protein level in quiescent, non-transformed Mel-ab melanocytes, maintained in the absence of phorbol ester. Proliferation of Mel-ab cells, achieved by incubation in the continual presence of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, was associated with a down-regulation of the PKC alpha, delta, and epsilon isozymes. Examination of two transformed syngeneic lines (the B16 murine melanoma and the long terminal repeat Ras.2 line), that grew in the absence of exogenous phorbol esters, showed that PKC alpha protein levels were either partially down-regulated or unaffected, the PKC delta and epsilon isoforms were down-regulated completely, and the levels of PKC zeta protein remained unaltered relative to quiescent Mel-ab cells. Basal levels of total diacylglycerol were elevated 5-fold in B16 melanoma cells compared with levels found in quiescent or proliferating Mel-ab melanocytes and appear to arise largely from the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol phospholipids accompanied by a significant rise in phospholipase C activity. Hourly treatments of quiescent Mel-ab melanocytes with the synthetic diacylglycerol analogue, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, for 24 h, resulted in an induction of DNA synthesis which was associated with a significant down-regulation of PKC levels mediated largely via post-translational rather than transcriptional mechanisms. These results show for the first time that specific isoforms of PKC are down-regulated at the protein level during proliferation of murine melanocytic cells and suggest that the constitutive down-regulation of PKC in transformed melanoma cells may arise as a consequence of elevated endogenous phosphatidylinositol-derived diacylglycerol levels."
https://openalex.org/W1679306876,"phi 29 DNA polymerase shares with other alpha-like DNA polymerases several regions of amino acid sequence similarity and sensitivity to inhibitors of eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha. In this paper, site-directed mutants in the phi 29 DNA polymerase residues Asp249, Ser252, Leu253, and Pro255 of the conserved amino acid motif are described. Two mutants, D249E and S252R, were drastically affected in all the synthetic activities, whereas their 3' to 5' exonuclease activity and interaction with the TP primer was normal. Mutant D249E, slightly affected in template-primer binding, was completely inactive in all conditions tested, suggesting that Asp249 could be playing a direct role in catalysis. On the other hand, mutant S252R, strongly affected in template-primer binding, showed some DNA polymerization activity in the presence of Mn2+. Mutants S252G and P255S showed a reduced template-primer binding ability; these mutants, together with mutant L253V, showed metal ion-dependent phenotypes in their synthetic activities and altered sensitivities to the PPi analog phosphonoacetic acid. All these results support the hypothesis that the Dx2SLYP motif forms part of the polymerization active site of the phi 29 DNA polymerase, being the Asp249 residue critical both for protein-primed initiation and DNA polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2160939948,"We have recently shown that cell-free transcription of homologous templates from the archaeon Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus requires an archaeal transcription factor (aTFA) that separated from the RNA polymerase during phosphocellulose chromatography. We report here the identification and extensive purification of a second activity, aTFB, required for in vitro transcription. This activity copurified with RNA polymerase during initial chromatographic steps but was positively identified as a distinct transcription factor after Superdex 200 sizing chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the intensity of a M(r) = 28,000 polypeptide in silver-stained gels is correlated with transcription factor activity. The same polypeptide, when eluted from a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subsequently renatured, showed the functional properties of the transcription factor. In conjunction with gel filtration and sedimentation studies, which indicated a molecular mass of 54,000 Da for the native protein, these results suggested that aTFB is a dimer with polypeptide chains of identical molecular mass. Functional studies with highly purified aTFB demonstrated that it is a general factor required for transcription of genes encoding tRNA and proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1481585280,"Cyclic-AMP stabilizes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (PEPCK) mRNA against degradation. To investigate the mechanism of this effect, RNA mobility shift assays were used to determine the interaction of cellular proteins with specific domains from the mRNA. We report here the identification of a protein with an affinity for sequences of PEPCK mRNA with a predicted stem-loop structure. RNA-protein complex formation was significantly reduced if the double-stranded RNA probe was preheated to 90 degrees C. The RNA-binding protein did not bind to the hairpin structure of poly(rI)-poly (rC), indicating some degree of sequence specificity and that the RNA-binding protein is not the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. The binding activity was contained in the cytosolic fraction (100,000 x g) of rat hepatoma FTO-2B cells and was significantly enhanced by high concentrations of KCl. Chromatography on an anion exchanger separated the binding activity from a factor which, upon reconstitution, inhibited the interaction with the RNA probe. Incubation of cells with cAMP resulted in a 3-4-fold decrease in the activity of the RNA-binding protein. An inhibition in complex formation was observed with extracts as early as 60 min after exposure of cells to cAMP. Liver extracts from rats starved for 72 h also had reduced binding activity compared to extracts from fed animals. Cellular extracts treated with alkaline phosphatase exhibited an elevated level of complex formation. An analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the RNA-protein complex after ultraviolet light cross-linking demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein had a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa. On the basis of these results, we suggest that liver cells contain a protein whose interaction with PEPCK mRNA is regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation and which may be responsible for the cAMP-mediated control of PEPCK mRNA half-life."
https://openalex.org/W1541732942,"The second most conserved region of alpha-like DNA polymerases, region II, spans a block of 40 amino acid residues centered at the core sequence -DFNSLYPSII-. In the previous paper, we described mutational studies of 3 amino acid residues in region II which includes 2 amino acid residues in the core sequence. We showed that residues Asp860 and Tyr865 in the core sequence are involved in substrate deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) binding. We further showed that the phenyl moiety of the Tyr865 side chain interacts with the incoming dNTP and is responsible for the misinsertion fidelity of the enzyme. In this report, we investigated the function of 2 serine residues, Ser863 and Ser867, in this core sequence. Mutation of these 2 Ser residues to either Ala or Thr yielded mutant enzymes with similar Km for dNTPs, kcat, processivity, and misinsertion fidelity of DNA synthesis as the wild type enzyme. However, mutation of Ser867 to Ala demonstrated a 30-fold increase in Km for primer-template and a 5-fold higher KD for binding primer-template. DNA footprinting experiments of primer with the dideoxynucleotide terminus indicated that the structural feature of the primer recognized by Ser867 is the 3'-OH terminus. Single-stranded DNA inhibition data suggest that removal of the hydroxyl side chain of Ser867 affects the polymerase's interaction with primer and not with template. Mutation of Ser867 to Ala also decreases the mutant enzyme's Km for dNTP to extend a mispaired primer and thus enhances its capacity to extend a mispaired primer terminus. These data support the conclusion that the hydroxyl side chain of Ser867 of human DNA polymerase alpha is involved in primer interaction during DNA synthesis and plays an essential role in mispair extension fidelity of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2108407557,"A novel Drosophila receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase gene, DPTP4E, was isolated and characterized. DPTP4E, located at cytological position 4E1-2, is comprised of 10 exons; its RNA products are widely expressed during embryonic development, including the developing central nervous system. DPTP4E produces three major developmentally regulated transcripts of 6.5, 7.0, and 7.5 kilobases. The two major embryonic transcripts arise as the result of the alternative splicing of exon IX; as a consequence, two proteins (200 and 183 kDa) are produced which differ in their carboxyl-terminal sequences. The deduced extracellular domain, which lies between two putative hydrophobic transmembrane segments, contains 11 fibronectin type III-like repeats and 25 putative N-glycosylation sites. A single conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) catalytic domain, which shows a high level of amino acid identity to the Drosophila PTPase DPTP10D and human HPTP beta, is found in the predicted intracellular domain; this PTPase domain, when expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, exhibits PTPase activity. The possible implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1567797793,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a second messenger responsible for the rapid and discontinuous release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In this study, the effects of the sulfhydryl reagent thimerosal were investigated on Ca2+ mobilization and on InsP3 binding. Thimerosal was shown to release Ca2+, in a dose-dependent manner, with an EC50 of 135.8 +/- 5.2 microM, from bovine adrenal cortex microsomes. Thimerosal-induced Ca2+ release was not prevented by heparin (250 micrograms/ml), ruling out a participation of InsP3 receptor in that effect. The slow rate of thimerosal-induced Ca2+ release rather suggested an inhibition of microsomal Ca2+ ATPase. At submaximal concentration, thimerosal (100 microM) was also shown to potentiate the release of Ca2+ induced by InsP3. Dose-response experiments revealed that thimerosal enhanced the apparent affinity of InsP3 by a factor 2.21 +/- 0.28, without modifying the maximal amount of Ca2+ released by InsP3. Thimerosal also enhanced, in a dose-dependent manner, [3H]InsP3 binding to adrenal cortex microsomes (EC50 = 43.3 +/- 7.6 microM). A similar effect was also observed on [3H]InsP3 binding to solubilized receptors, suggesting a direct modification of the receptor protein by thimerosal. The effects of thimerosal on Ca2+ release and [3H]InsP3 binding were abolished in the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (1 mM), suggesting a modification by thimerosal of specific thiol groups on these microsomal proteins. Scatchard analysis revealed that thimerosal (100 microM) increased InsP3 receptor affinity by 1.87 +/- 0.26-fold. Kinetic analysis indicated that this increased affinity was due to an enhancement of InsP3 association rate constant. The concomitant increases of binding affinity and Ca2+ releasing potency suggest that the high affinity state of InsP3 receptor is a functional state."
https://openalex.org/W1542514184,"We demonstrate a selective release of peptides by lysosomes in vitro. A lysosomal fraction from human fibroblasts that had previously endocytosed [3H]ribonuclease A was incubated for 2 h, and radioactivity released into the medium and radioactivity retained within lysosomes were analyzed. A variety of radiolabeled molecules including peptides of an appropriate size to serve as antigens for T cell-mediated immunity were released. One small peptide was predominantly released, while others, as well as intact ribonuclease A, were predominantly retained. A 4-5-fold range was also evident in the relative release of three 3H-labeled tripeptide probes of similar charge derived from the sequence of ribonuclease A. This selectivity and the fact that similar peptide degradation fragments were also released and retained by intact cells after endocytosis of [3H]ribonuclease A argues strongly that the release observed in vitro is physiological and not due to damaged lysosomal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1588729104,"A decanucleotide tandem repeat (TR) sequence, between -162 and -140 base pairs (bp) of the minimal thyrotropin receptor promoter, decreases gene expression by repressing constitutive enhancer activity of its cAMP response element (CRE). Each decanucleotide acts additively. CRE-binding proteins and liver or thyroid nuclear extracts footprint a region including the CRE and the 3' decanucleotide, -148 to -124 bp; nuclear proteins interacting with the 3' decanucleotide protect a smaller region -148 to -135 bp. Separate groups of nuclear proteins interact with the CRE and the 3' decanucleotide; mutations of the CRE affect protein interactions with the 3' decanucleotide and the converse. Nuclear proteins bind to single- or double-stranded 3' decanucleotide DNA; those interacting with the CRE bind only double-stranded DNA. The repressor action of the 5' decanucleotide is associated with an interaction between the coding strand and a single-stranded binding protein in liver and thyroid nuclear extracts. The 5' decanucleotide is in a CT-rich region with S1 nuclease hypersensitivity, near perfect mirror images, and direct repeats. The data therefore indicate that each TR decanucleotide modulates CRE constitutive enhancer activity by different but additive mechanisms, competition versus interaction with a single-stranded binding protein, and each interacts with different nuclear proteins that are not thyroid-specific. The same region in the human thyrotropin receptor represses CRE constitutive enhancer activity by the same mechanisms, despite a nonidentical sequence and no overt TR."

The insert contained a 2757-base pair coding sequence for a whole human DNA ligase I and an extra ACC codon adjacent to the ATG initiation codon. This ACC codon was required for achieving high levels of expression of full-length DNA ligase I in Escherichia coli strain BL21. The recombinant plasmid, which was designed to exploit the T7 late promoter and the ATG initiation codon for beta-galactosidase was transfected into E. coli BL21 cells that express T7 RNA polymerase. The recombinant clone produced relatively high levels of DNA ligase I with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA ligase was purified to near-homogeneity by the two-step column chromatographic procedure from BLphLig-I cells that had been induced with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside. The specific activity, chromatographic behavior, kinetic properties, molecular mass, and antigenicity of the recombinant human DNA ligase I were indistinguishable from those of purified mammalian DNA ligase I. Metabolically labeling experiments with 32P(i) indicate that the recombinant DNA ligase I was present as an enzyme-AMP reaction intermediate, but not as a phosphoprotein, in the E. coli cells."
https://openalex.org/W1588575744,"We have examined the perturbation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-receptor interactions by a monoclonal antibody (13A9) that binds to the receptor extracellular domain. While 13A9 did not inhibit EGF binding, it inhibited energy transfer between fluorescent-labeled EGF molecules bound to receptors in membranes from human A431 cells by 70-100%. This antibody also inhibited EGF-stimulated receptor dimerization in membranes as assessed by chemical cross-linking and Fab fragments of the antibody strongly inhibited the EGF-stimulated dimerization of solubilized receptors when assessed by velocity sedimentation. However, under conditions where 13A9 inhibited receptor-receptor interactions within the plasma membranes, the antibody had no effect on EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation or tyrosine kinase activity toward an exogenous substrate. Moreover, although the antibody significantly inhibited receptor dimerization in A431 cells, it had no effect on EGF-stimulated changes in cytosolic free [Ca2+] or 125I-EGF uptake in these cells, or on EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in Swiss 3T3 cells. We conclude that the dimerization of the EGF receptors in a membrane environment is not required for full activation of tyrosine kinase activity and that inhibition of the dimerization of a large fraction of EGF receptors in cells does not necessarily inhibit several EGF-mediated cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W1584099507,"Previous studies showed that conversion of the first Ca2+ ligand in Ca(2+)-binding sites III and IV from Asp to Ala decreased the affinity of cardiac TnC (cTnC) for the thin filament. Here, the functional consequences of mutation of the second ligand in the Ca(2+)-binding sites of cTnC were determined. Equilibrium dialysis and Tyr fluorescence studies showed that conversion of the second Ca2+ ligand to Ala (Asp-67, site II; Asn-107, site III; and Asn-143, site IV) inactivated all three Ca(2+)-binding sites in the free protein. Ca2+ binding to the mutated site II was not recovered upon association with a troponin complex, and proteins with this mutation were unable to regulate Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity in TnC-extracted myofibrils. However, Ca2+ binding was recovered at the mutated sites III and IV under the same conditions. Sequential addition of active and inactive cTnC proteins in a myofibril ATPase assay suggested that that Mg2+ binding was not recovered and that the recovered Ca2+ affinity of the mutated sites III and IV was much lower than that of the wild type in that the Ca2+ concentrations required for apparent thin filament binding by proteins containing mutations at sites III and/or IV were significantly greater than that required for the wild-type protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576313610,"Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that aspartic acid 101 plays an important role in glutathione interaction to rat glutathione S-transferase YaYa, while tyrosine 9 is directly involved in catalysis. Based on the available structural information, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted to examine the function of arginine, lysine, glutamine, and proline residues surrounding the GSH binding pocket. Arginine mutants R13K, R15K, R20K, and R20I retained partial enzymatic activities, while R13I and R15I lost most of their activities. Kinetic studies showed a marked increase in Km toward GSH for R15I suggesting that arginine 15 contributes significantly to the binding of GSH in the active site of glutathione S-transferase YaYa. A drastic decrease in enzymatic activities for R13I suggested the importance of the charged group of arginine 13 either in maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme or in serving a vital role in enzymatic function. Replacement of glutamine 54 and 67 with glutamic acid or asparagine resulted in decreased enzymatic activities. Moreover, an 11-, 17-, and 9-fold increase in Km values toward GSH for mutant Q54E, Q54N, and Q67N was observed, respectively. These results suggested that glutamine 54 and 67 also contributed significantly to the binding of GSH. Proline at position 56 appears to be important for maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme since mutants P56A and P56F were much less active and extremely less stable than that of the wild type enzyme. Both lysine mutants, K45R and K45I, exhibited substantially higher catalytic efficiencies toward both 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and GSH than the wild type enzyme. Our data clearly show that lysine 45 is not an essential residue for catalysis nor for GSH binding in glutathione S-transferase YaYa."
https://openalex.org/W1555862743,"Hemophilia B Fukuoka, a moderately severe bleeding disorder, is a naturally occurring mutant of factor IX. Plasma from our patient had 3% clotting activity even though 64% of factor IX antigen was present. The purified mutant protein was cleaved normally by factor Xla, factor VIIa-tissue factor complex, or RVV-X (factor X-activating enzyme from Russell's viper venom), yielding a two-chain factor IXa. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of one of the lysyl endopeptidase peptides derived from factor IX Fukuoka revealed that Asn92 in the second epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain had been replaced by His. The active site of the factor IXa Fukuoka was normally competent for the incorporation of p-aminobenzamidine and for the hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, N alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-arginine p-nitrobenzyl ester. Factor Xa formation by factor IXa Fukuoka was only 8% of the normal factor IXa, even in the presence of polylysine, and only 0.2% of the normal in the system containing phospholipids, Ca2+, and factor VIIIa, thereby indicating a functional defect in interaction of the mutant with factors VIIIa/X. Furthermore, catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of factor IXa Fukuoka toward factor X in the presence of Ca2+, phospholipids, and factor VIIIa was only 2.3% of the normal factor IXa. These results suggest that an Asn-to-His substitution at position 92 in the second EGF-like domain of factor IX Fukuoka would have an untoward effect on the specific conformational state of factor IX for binding with factors VIIIa/X."
https://openalex.org/W1585330804,"DARPP-32 is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when it is phosphorylated on Thr34 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. DARPP-32 is also phosphorylated on Ser45 and Ser102 by casein kinase II, resulting in a facilitation of phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. We have studied the conformation of recombinant rat DARPP-32 by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence. The steady-state emission spectra and quenching of the intrinsic (Trp163) and extrinsic fluorescence (acrylodan or lucifer yellow linked to Cys72) were consistent with a complete exposure of these residues to the aqueous environment. The intrinsic fluorescence of DARPP-32 was resolved into three decay components with lifetimes of 1, 3.4, and 7 ns, with the intermediate lifetime component giving the major contribution. The ratio between the amplitudes associated with the short and long decay constants was decreased upon denaturation. The rotational behavior of DARPP-32 measured by anisotropy decay revealed that Trp163 is located in a highly flexible peptide chain, whereas Cys72 is embedded in a more rigid environment. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase did not alter any of the fluorescence parameters, whereas only minor effects were associated with casein kinase II phosphorylation. These findings indicate that DARPP-32 contains at least two distinct domains and that phosphorylation has no dramatic effects on its conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1566967482,"Abstract In 38C B lymphocytes the membrane form of IgM is displayed on the cell surface whereas the secretory form of IgM is degraded. In the EH cell line, a light chain-deficient variant of 38C cells, the mu heavy chains are partially assembled with surrogate light chains characteristic of pre-B cells. In these cells neither the membrane (microns) nor the secretory (microsecond) forms of the mu heavy chain reach their final destination, and both are rapidly degraded. The degradation of mu chains in EH cells, like that of microsecond in 38C cells, is nonlysosomal and occurs prior to the trans-Golgi. However, while microsecond degradation in 38C cells is inhibited by brefeldin A, in EH cells microsecond and micron are retained and degraded by a brefeldin A-insensitive mechanism. These results indicate that degradation in EH cells occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas degradation in 38C cells requires exit from this compartment. Thus, mu heavy chains can be degraded in multiple sites along the secretory pathway. The location of the degradation process is determined by the developmentally regulated assembly species of the mu chains with either classical or surrogate light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1495507584,"Cisplatin (CDDP) is an effective cancer chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of several human malignancies. The effectiveness of cisplatin therapy is limited by intrinsic resistance of tumors to this drug as well as the development of secondary tumors, which are also drug resistant. A potential mechanism influencing the sensitivity of cells to CDDP may result from the interaction of specific proteins with CDDP-damaged DNA (CDDP-DNA). In an earlier report, we demonstrated that high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 bind with high affinity to CDDP-DNA. In the present study partial proteolytic digestion was used to localize the binding region of HMG2. A proteolytic fragment of approximately 20 kDa, containing the amino-terminal region of the protein, maintains the ability to bind with high affinity to CDDP-DNA, while an amino-terminal fragment of 14 kDa binds with slightly reduced affinity. In contrast, a peptide fragment lacking 51 NH2-terminal amino acids from HMG2 has greatly reduced affinity for damaged DNA. Recombinant peptide fragments containing HMG box 1 or HMG box 2 bind weakly to damaged DNA, while a recombinant fragment containing HMG boxes 1 and 2 binds with high affinity. Hence, our results indicate that the amino-terminal region of HMG2 contains the damaged DNA binding recognition site and that both HMG boxes 1 and 2, present in the parental molecule, are required for high affinity binding of this protein to CDDP-DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1526887832,"Bacterial adherence to tissues is a necessary step in infection and results from interactions between surface molecules on the bacteria (adhesins) and plasma membrane receptors on host cells. Using a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have examined the receptors required for adherence to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In mutant CHO cell lines and mucin-producing lung epithelial cell lines, adherence did not depend on glycoproteins, glycolipids, or proteoglycans. Treating cells with glutaraldehyde and proteases also did not affect adherence. However, treating cells with ethanol diminished adherence and resulted in removal of factors that would facilitate binding of bacteria when coated on plastic culture plates. These factors were purified by solvent extraction and silica gel chromatography and were identified as cholesterol and cholesterol esters by coelution with authentic standards, gas chromatography, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry. Bacterial adherence was reduced to wild-type CHO cells treated with Lovastatin and to cholesterol-requiring insect cells grown in cholesterol-deficient medium, suggesting that the bacteria bound to plasma membrane cholesterol. Thus, this clinical isolate of Pseudomonas uses cholesterol and cholesterol esters for adherence. We propose that binding to cholesterol and cholesterol esters may affect the pathogenicity of similar Pseudomonas strains."
https://openalex.org/W1628579658,"Abstract The molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamics, dynamics, and mechanism of interconversion of the pH-modulated reversible equilibria of Aplysia limacina metmyoglobin, (metMb), have been investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The four identified species which interconvert slowly on the NMR time scale (lifetime > 1 ms) are metMbOH (B) at alkaline pH, five coordinate metMb (N) at acidic to neutral pH, an acidic form, A, near pH approximately 4 and an extremely low pH form, D, attributed to an equilibrium unfolded species. The presence of strong distal hydrogen bonding by Arg (E10) to bound hydroxide is detected via a significant solvent isotope effect on the metMbOH (B) hyperfine shifts. Integration of the peak intensities yields pK values of 7.7 and approximately 4 for the B N and N A equilibria, respectively. Saturation transfer via chemical exchange is observed for B N and N A, where the rates for forming metMbOH (B) and the acidic form A from N are base- and acid-catalyzed, respectively, while the reverse rates are first-order. The much slower interconversion rate for N B in A. limacina metMb than His(E7) containing mammalian metMb is attributed to the fact that a ligand bond is broken rather than just proton transferred and that the equilibrium involves a major rearrangement of the orientation of Arg(E10). This conclusion is supported by 1H NMR data for the sperm whale double mutant His(E7)-->Val/Thr(E10)-->Arg metMb, which exhibits a pK approximately 8.7 for the equilibrium between five-coordinate metMb (N) and metMbOH (B) with an even slower interconversion rate than in A. limacina metMb. This double mutant metMbOH (B) exhibits hydrogen bonding by Arg (E10) with coordinated hydroxide similar to that in A. limacina metMbOH. The slow but acid-catalyzed rates of conversion of A. limacina metMb (N) to the acid species A with significantly weakened bonding of the heme iron to the axial His(F8) residue is consistent with protonation of an inaccessible residue and/or a structural change accompanying the protonation equilibrium. It is concluded that metMb will coordinate water strongly only when there is a distal hydrogen bond acceptor residue, while the hydroxide ion is coordinated strongly only if there is a distal hydrogen bond donor residue."
https://openalex.org/W1573126964,"When mini-Mu DNA was allowed to transpose and replicate in vitro over a prolonged period, the products consisted not only of simple inserts and cointegrates but also high molecular weight DNA many times the unit length of mini-Mu. This high molecular weight product contained predominantly full-length mini-Mu DNA and relatively little non-Mu DNA (the vector harboring the mini-Mu element and the target for transposition in the reaction system). It arose from rolling circle DNA replication of templates created by intramolecular strand transfer, which is catalyzed by Mu transposition proteins. A donor substrate, which is a supercoiled plasmid bearing a mini-Mu element, gave rise to large amounts of the high molecular weight product provided that the vector segment outside the mini-Mu element was 2 kilobase pairs or more. When a donor substrate had a vector segment of only 600 base pairs, the mini-Mu element first had to transpose to a larger circular target before giving rise to the high molecular weight product. These results suggest a mechanism by which Mu DNA can be amplified for lytic development without transposing multiple times. By establishing a circular template, multiple copies of Mu can be processively generated from a single initiation event."
https://openalex.org/W1586684206,"We recently described two mutant recA proteins, (G160N)recA and (H163A)recA, which have full single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity but which are unable to promote the ATP-dependent strand exchange reaction under standard reaction conditions (pH 7.5). These mutant proteins, however, are able to promote strand exchange at pH 6.0 to 6.8. Here we show that this activation correlates with a pH-dependent decrease in the S0.5 value for ATP, with the (H163A)recA protein becoming active in strand exchange at pH values where the S0.5(ATP) decreases below 100 microM. We also show that the (H163A)recA protein is active in strand exchange over the range of pH 6.0-8.2 if dATP (or ddATP) is used in place of ATP as a cofactor; dATP is hydrolyzed by (H163A)recA protein at the same rate as ATP but has an S0.5 value lower than 100 microM across this pH range. These results are discussed with regard to the general significance of the S0.5 value in determining whether a nucleoside triphosphate will be able to stabilize the recA-single-stranded DNA filament in the strand exchange active conformational state."
https://openalex.org/W1573935390,"The membrane-associated 45- and 55-kDa forms of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase (ATP:phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.67) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are inhibited by ADP by a competitive mechanism with respect to ATP. We initiated studies toward defining the ATP and ADP sites on the PI 4-kinases using azidonucleotide photoaffinity labeling probes. The photoprobe 8-azido-ATP fulfilled the criteria of a specific photoaffinity label for the 45- and 55-kDa PI 4-kinases. 8-Azido-ATP was a substrate and a competitive inhibitor of the PI 4-kinases with Ki values similar to the Km for ATP. 8-Azido-ATP photoinactivated the enzymes and was photoincorporated into the enzymes in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations similar to the Ki values for the photoprobe. ATP, the true substrate, provided specific protection against photoinactivation and photoincorporation of the PI 4-kinases with 8-azido-ATP, whereas GTP, a nonspecific nucleotide, provided no protection against photoinactivation and photoincorporation. Photoaffinity labeling of the PI 4-kinases with 8-azido-ATP was specifically prevented with ADP. The photoprobe 8-azido-ADP also fulfilled the criteria needed to validate its use as a specific photoprobe for the PI 4-kinases. Photoinactivation of the PI 4-kinases with 8-azido-ADP was prevented specifically with ATP. Taken together, these data supported the conclusion that the ATP and ADP sites on the membrane-associated 45- and 55-kDa PI 4-kinases from S. cerevisiae were the same."
