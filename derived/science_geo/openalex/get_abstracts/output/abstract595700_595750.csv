https://openalex.org/W2754021327,"A triple threat for HIV The HIV virus continually evolves tricks to evade elimination by the host. Prevention and a cure will likely rely on broadly neutralizing antibodies that can recognize and conquer multiple viral strains or subtypes. Xu et al. engineered a single antibody molecule to recognize three highly conserved proteins needed for HIV infection (see the Perspective by Cohen and Corey). This “trispecific” antibody uses two sites (V1V2 and MPER) to bind HIV-infected cells, while the third site (CD4bs) recruits killer T lymphocytes that can eliminate the virus. When tested against &gt;200 different HIV strains, trispecific antibodies were highly potent and broadly neutralized ∼99% of HIV viruses. This approach could potentially simplify HIV treatment regimens and improve therapy response. Science , this issue p. 85 ; see also p. 46"
https://openalex.org/W2759281036,"Nonabelian anyons offer the prospect of storing quantum information in a topological qubit protected from decoherence, with the degree of protection determined by the energy gap separating the topological vacuum from its low lying excitations. Originally proposed to occur in quantum wells in high magnetic fields, experimental systems thought to harbor nonabelian anyons range from p-wave superfluids to superconducting systems with strong spin orbit coupling. However, all of these systems are characterized by small energy gaps, and despite several decades of experimental work, definitive evidence for nonabelian anyons remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of arobust, incompressible even-denominator fractional quantum Hall phase in a new generation of dual-gated, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated bilayer graphene samples. Numerical simulations suggest that this state is in the Pfaffian phase and hosts nonabelian anyons, and the measured energy gaps are several times larger than those observed in other systems. Moreover, the unique electronic structure of bilayer graphene endows the electron system with two new control parameters. Magnetic field continuously tunes the effective electron interactions, changing the even-denominator gap non-monotonically and consistent with predictions that a transition between the Pfaffian phase and the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) occurs just beyond the experimentally explored magnetic field range. Electric field, meanwhile, tunes crossings between levels from different valleys. By directly measuring the valley polarization, we observe a continuous transition from an incompressible to a compressible phase at half-filling mediated by an unexpected incompressible, yet polarizable, intermediate phase. Valley conservation implies this phase is an electrical insulator with gapless neutral excitations."
https://openalex.org/W2758144562,"A molecular machine that can be programmed to position a substrate at one of two directing sites on a molecule, which control the stereochemistry of addition to the substrate, demonstrates complexity, precision and function previously only observed in nature. It has been debated whether synthetic molecular machines could ever rival the complexity, precision and function of evolved biological machinery, with questions arising over whether atom-by-atom construction of molecules is possible, practicable or scalable. Key to the function of a hypothetical 'molecular assembler' is the ability of the machinery to position reactants. David Leigh and colleagues now use a molecular machine that can 'pick up' a substrate and position it at one of the two directing sites on the machine that control the stereochemistry of addition to the substrate. For two sequential chemical reactions, and depending on how the machine is programmed to move the substrate in between reactions, the molecular robot could make any one of four possible diastereoisomers, including one that cannot be made through conventional organocatalytic reactions. It has been convincingly argued1,2,3 that molecular machines that manipulate individual atoms, or highly reactive clusters of atoms, with Ångström precision are unlikely to be realized. However, biological molecular machines routinely position rather less reactive substrates in order to direct chemical reaction sequences, from sequence-specific synthesis by the ribosome4 to polyketide synthases5,6,7, where tethered molecules are passed from active site to active site in multi-enzyme complexes. Artificial molecular machines8,9,10,11,12 have been developed for tasks that include sequence-specific oligomer synthesis13,14,15 and the switching of product chirality16,17,18,19, a photo-responsive host molecule has been described that is able to mechanically twist a bound molecular guest20, and molecular fragments have been selectively transported in either direction between sites on a molecular platform through a ratchet mechanism21. Here we detail an artificial molecular machine that moves a substrate between different activating sites to achieve different product outcomes from chemical synthesis. This molecular robot can be programmed to stereoselectively produce, in a sequential one-pot operation, an excess of any one of four possible diastereoisomers from the addition of a thiol and an alkene to an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde in a tandem reaction process. The stereodivergent synthesis includes diastereoisomers that cannot be selectively synthesized22 through conventional iminium–enamine organocatalysis. We anticipate that future generations of programmable molecular machines may have significant roles in chemical synthesis and molecular manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2757342873,"Consistent pixel sizes are of fundamental importance for assessing texture features that relate intensity and spatial information in radiomics studies. To correct for the effects of variable pixel sizes, we combined image resampling with Butterworth filtering in the frequency domain and tested the correction on computed tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer patients reconstructed 5 times with pixel sizes varying from 0.59 to 0.98 mm. One hundred fifty radiomics features were calculated for each preprocessing and field-of-view combination. Intra-patient agreement and inter-patient agreement were compared using the overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC). To further evaluate the corrections, hierarchical clustering was used to identify patient scans before and after correction. To assess the general applicability of the corrections, they were applied to 17 CT scans of a radiomics phantom. The reduction in the inter-scanner variability relative to non-small cell lung cancer patient scans was quantified. The variation in pixel sizes caused the intra-patient variability to be large (OCCC <95%) relative to the inter-patient variability in 79% of the features. However, with the resampling and filtering corrections, the intra-patient variability was relatively large in only 10% of the features. With the filtering correction, 8 of 8 patients were correctly clustered, in contrast to only 2 of 8 without the correction. In the phantom study, resampling and filtering the images of a rubber particle cartridge substantially reduced variability in 61% of the radiomics features and substantially increased variability in only 6% of the features. Surprisingly, resampling without filtering tended to increase the variability. In conclusion, applying a correction based on resampling and Butterworth low-pass filtering in the frequency domain effectively reduced variability in CT radiomics features caused by variations in pixel size. This correction may also reduce the variability introduced by other CT scan acquisition parameters."

https://openalex.org/W2756540989,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) initiates the innate immune system in response to cytosolic dsDNA. After binding and activation from dsDNA, cGAS uses ATP and GTP to synthesize 2′, 3′ -cGAMP (cGAMP), a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with mixed 2′-5′ and 3′-5′ phosphodiester bonds. Inappropriate stimulation of cGAS has been implicated in autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, thus inhibition of cGAS may be of therapeutic benefit in some diseases; however, the size and polarity of the cGAS active site makes it a challenging target for the development of conventional substrate-competitive inhibitors. We report here the development of a high affinity (KD = 200 nM) inhibitor from a low affinity fragment hit with supporting biochemical and structural data showing these molecules bind to the cGAS active site. We also report a new high throughput cGAS fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay to enable the rapid identification and optimization of cGAS inhibitors. This FP assay uses Cy5-labelled cGAMP in combination with a novel high affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes cGAMP with no cross reactivity to cAMP, cGMP, ATP, or GTP. Given its role in the innate immune response, cGAS is a promising therapeutic target for autoinflammatory disease. Our results demonstrate its druggability, provide a high affinity tool compound, and establish a high throughput assay for the identification of next generation cGAS inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2760360868,"Background 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among older postmenopausal women. The impact of postmenopausal breast cancer on CVD for older women is uncertain. We hypothesized that older postmenopausal women with breast cancer would be at a higher risk of CVD than similar aged women without breast cancer and that CVD would be a major contributor to the subsequent morbidity and mortality.


Methods 
In a prospective Women’s Health Initiative study, incident CVD events and total and cause-specific death rates were compared between postmenopausal women with (n = 4,340) and without (n = 97,576) incident invasive breast cancer over 10 years post-diagnosis, stratified by 3 age groups (50–59, 60–69, and 70–79).


Results 
Postmenopausal women, regardless of breast cancer diagnosis, had similar and high levels of CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking and hypertension) at baseline prior to breast cancer, which were strong predictors of CVD and total mortality over time. CVD affected mostly women age 70–79 with localized breast cancer (79% of breast cancer cases in 70–79 age group): only 17% died from breast cancer and CVD was the leading cause of death (22%) over the average 10 years follow up. Compared to age-matched women without breast cancer, women age 70–79 at diagnosis of localized breast cancer had a similar multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76–1.33) for coronary heart disease, a lower risk of composite CVD (HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.70–1.00), and a higher risk of total mortality (HR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04–1.39).


Conclusion 
CVD was a major contributor to mortality in women with localized breast cancer at age 70–79. Further studies are needed to evaluate both screening and treatment of localized breast cancer tailored to the specific health issues of older women."

https://openalex.org/W2757348926,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth cancer death cause in women worldwide. The malignant nature of this disease stems from its unique dissemination pattern. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been reported in OC and downregulation of Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) is a hallmark of this process. However, findings on the relationship between E-cadherin levels and OC progression, dissemination and aggressiveness are controversial. In this study, the evaluation of E-cadherin expression in an OC tissue microarray revealed its prognostic value to discriminate between advanced- and early-stage tumors, as well as serous tumors from other histologies. Moreover, E-cadherin, Neural cadherin (N-cadherin), cytokeratins and vimentin expression was assessed in TOV-112, SKOV-3, OAW-42 and OV-90 OC cell lines grown in monolayers and under anchorage-independent conditions to mimic ovarian tumor cell dissemination, and results were associated with cell aggressiveness. According to these EMT-related markers, cell lines were classified as mesenchymal (M; TOV-112), intermediate mesenchymal (IM; SKOV-3), intermediate epithelial (IE; OAW-42) and epithelial (E; OV-90). M- and IM-cells depicted the highest migration capacity when grown in monolayers, and aggregates derived from M- and IM-cell lines showed lower cell death, higher adhesion to extracellular matrices and higher invasion capacity than E- and IE-aggregates. The analysis of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, cytokeratin 19 and vimentin mRNA levels in 20 advanced-stage high-grade serous human OC ascites showed an IM phenotype in all cases, characterized by higher proportions of N- to E-cadherin and vimentin to cytokeratin 19. In particular, higher E-cadherin mRNA levels were associated with cancer antigen 125 levels more than 500 U/mL and platinum-free intervals less than 6 months. Altogether, E-cadherin expression levels were found relevant for the assessment of OC progression and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2757241773,"In the present paper, we address by means of mathematical modeling the following main question: How can oncolytic virus infection of some normal cells in the vicinity of tumor cells enhance oncolytic virotherapy? We formulate a mathematical model describing the interactions between the oncolytic virus, the tumor cells, the normal cells, and the antitumoral and antiviral immune responses. The model consists of a system of delay differential equations with one (discrete) delay. We derive the model’s basic reproductive number within tumor and normal cell populations and use their ratio as a metric for virus tumor-specificity. Numerical simulations are performed for different values of the basic reproduction numbers and their ratios to investigate potential trade-offs between tumor reduction and normal cells losses. A fundamental feature unravelled by the model simulations is its great sensitivity to parameters that account for most variation in the early or late stages of oncolytic virotherapy. From a clinical point of view, our findings indicate that designing an oncolytic virus that is not 100% tumor-specific can increase virus particles, which in turn, can further infect tumor cells. Moreover, our findings indicate that when infected tissues can be regenerated, oncolytic viral infection of normal cells could improve cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2757384990,"Proteomic analysis of cancers' stages has provided new opportunities for the development of novel, highly sensitive diagnostic tools which helps early detection of cancer. This paper introduces a new feature ranking approach called FRMT. FRMT is based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method (TOPSIS) which select the most discriminative proteins from proteomics data for cancer staging. In this approach, outcomes of 10 feature selection techniques were combined by TOPSIS method, to select the final discriminative proteins from seven different proteomic databases of protein expression profiles. In the proposed workflow, feature selection methods and protein expressions have been considered as criteria and alternatives in TOPSIS, respectively. The proposed method is tested on seven various classifier models in a 10-fold cross validation procedure that repeated 30 times on the seven cancer datasets. The obtained results proved the higher stability and superior classification performance of method in comparison with other methods, and it is less sensitive to the applied classifier. Moreover, the final introduced proteins are informative and have the potential for application in the real medical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2758440798,"Extension of known ecological niches of Brucella has included the description of two novel species from marine mammals. Brucella pinnipedialis is associated predominantly with seals, while two major Brucella ceti clades, most commonly associated with porpoises or dolphins respectively, have been identified. To date there has been limited characterisation of Brucella isolates obtained from marine mammals outside Northern European waters, including North American waters. To address this gap, and extend knowledge of the global population structure and host associations of these Brucella species, 61 isolates from marine mammals inhabiting North American waters were subject to molecular and phenotypic characterisation enabling comparison with existing European isolates. The majority of isolates represent genotypes previously described in Europe although novel genotypes were identified in both B. ceti clades. Harp seals were found to carry B. pinnipedialis genotypes previously confined to hooded seals among a diverse repertoire of sequence types (STs) associated with this species. For the first time Brucella isolates were characterised from beluga whales and found to represent a number of distinct B. pinnipedialis genotypes. In addition the known host range of ST27 was extended with the identification of this ST from California sea lion samples. Finally the performance of the frequently used diagnostic tool Bruce-ladder, in differentiating B. ceti and B. pinnipedialis, was critically assessed based on improved knowledge of the global population structure of Brucella associated with marine mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2756894615,"The asteroids are primitive solar system bodies which evolve both collisionally and through disruptions due to rapid rotation [1]. These processes can lead to the formation of binary asteroids [2-4] and to the release of dust [5], both directly and, in some cases, through uncovering frozen volatiles. In a sub-set of the asteroids called main-belt comets (MBCs), the sublimation of excavated volatiles causes transient comet-like activity [6-8]. Torques exerted by sublimation measurably influence the spin rates of active comets [9] and might lead to the splitting of bilobate comet nuclei [10]. The kilometer-sized main-belt asteroid 288P (300163) showed activity for several months around its perihelion 2011 [11], suspected to be sustained by the sublimation of water ice [12] and supported by rapid rotation [13], while at least one component rotates slowly with a period of 16 hours [14]. 288P is part of a young family of at least 11 asteroids that formed from a ~10km diameter precursor during a shattering collision 7.5 million years ago [15]. Here we report that 288P is a binary main-belt comet. It is different from the known asteroid binaries for its combination of wide separation, near-equal component size, high eccentricity, and comet-like activity. The observations also provide strong support for sublimation as the driver of activity in 288P and show that sublimation torques may play a significant role in binary orbit evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2760644190,"Flower pollen is collected by honeybee foragers, adhered on their rear legs and transported into the hives in the form of pellets. Once in the hives, bee pollen is moisturised with nectar and bee mouth secretions and due to enzymatically modifications it becomes the so-called bee-bread, the protein reservoir of young bees. Bee pollen can be artificially removed from bee legs and collected by using specific systems, the bee pollen traps. Bee pollen is commercialized for human consumption as fresh product and after freezing or drying. Although bee pollen is nowadays largely consumed in developed countries, as food or food supplement according to local legislation, little is known on its safety related to microbiological hazards. In this work, we aimed to characterize for the first time the microbiological profile of Italian bee pollen in fresh, frozen and dried form collected along an entire harvesting season. Moreover, monthly microbiological analyses were performed on frozen (storage at -18°C) and dried (storage at room temperature) bee pollen over a 4 months period. Further aim of this work was the evaluation of the possible impact on production level of three different traps used for pollen collection. Our results on microbial contamination of fresh and frozen bee pollen show that a more comprehensive microbiological risk assessment of bee pollen is required. On the other side, dried pollen showed very low microbial contamination and no pathogen survived after the drying process and during storage."
https://openalex.org/W2758348451,"Hemorrhage following whole-body γ-irradiation in a combined injury (CI) model increases mortality compared to whole-body γ-irradiation alone (RI). The decreased survival in CI is accompanied by increased bone marrow injury, decreased hematocrit, and alterations of miRNA in the kidney. In this study, our aim was to examine cytokine homeostasis, susceptibility to systemic bacterial infection, and intestinal injury. More specifically, we evaluated the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced stress proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP), complement 3 (C3), Flt-3 ligand, and corticosterone. CD2F1 male mice received 8.75 Gy 60Co gamma photons (0.6 Gy/min, bilateral) which was followed by a hemorrhage of 20% of the blood volume. In serum, RI caused an increase of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-18, G-CSF, CM-CSF, eotaxin, IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP, RANTES, and TNF-α, which were all increased by hemorrhage alone, except IL-9, IL-17A, and MCP-1. Nevertheless, CI further elevated RI-induced increases of these cytokines except for G-CSF, IFN- γ and RANTES in serum. In the ileum, hemorrhage in the CI model significantly enhanced RI-induced IL-1β, IL-3, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-18, and TNF-α concentrations. In addition, Proteus mirabilis Gram(-) was found in only 1 of 6 surviving RI mice on Day 15, whereas Streptococcus sanguinis Gram(+) and Sphingomonas paucimobilis Gram(-) were detected in 2 of 3 surviving CI mice (with 3 CI mice diseased due to inflammation and infection before day 15) at the same time point. Hemorrhage in the CI model enhanced the RI-induced increases in C3 and decreases in CRP concentrations. However, hemorrhage alone did not alter the basal levels, but hemorrhage in the CI model displayed similar increases in Flt-3 ligand levels as RI did. Hemorrhage alone altered the basal levels of corticosterone early after injury, which then returned to the baseline, but in RI mice and CI mice the increased corticosterone concentration remained elevated throughout the 15 day study. CI increased 8 miRNAs and decreased 10 miRNAs in serum, and increased 16 miRNA and decreased 6 miRNAs in ileum tissue. Among the altered miRNAs, CI increased miR-34 in the serum and ileum which targeted an increased phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and increased NF-κB, thereby leading to increased iNOS expression and activation of caspase-3 in the ileum. Further, let-7g/miR-98 targeted the increased phosphorylation of STAT3 in the ileum, which is known to bind to the iNOS gene. These changes may correlate with cell death in the ileum of CI mice. The histopathology displayed blunted villi and villus edema in RI and CI mice. Based on the in silico analysis, miR-15, miR-99, and miR-100 were predicted to regulate IL-6 and TNF. These results suggest that CI-induced alterations of cytokines/chemokines, CRP, and C3 cause a homeostatic imbalance and may contribute to the pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal injury. Inhibitory intervention in these responses may prove therapeutic for CI and improve recovery of the ileal morphologic damage."

The objective of this study is to assess the economic cost and health-related quality of life associated with HFMD in China.A telephone survey of caregivers were conducted in 31 provinces across China. Caregivers of laboratory-confirmed HFMD patients who were registered in the national HFMD enhanced surveillance database during 2012-2013 were invited to participate in the survey. Total costs included direct medical costs (outpatient care, inpatient care and self-medication), direct non-medical costs (transportation, nutrition, accommodation and nursery), and indirect costs for lost income associated with caregiving. Health utility weights elicited using EuroQol EQ-5D-3L and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used to calculate associated loss in quality adjusted life years (QALYs).The subjects comprised 1136 mild outpatients, 1124 mild inpatients, 1170 severe cases and 61 fatal cases. The mean total costs for mild outpatients, mild inpatients, severe cases and fatal cases were $201 (95%CI $187, $215), $1072 (95%CI $999, $1144), $3051 (95%CI $2905, $3197) and $2819 (95%CI $2068, $3571) respectively. The mean QALY losses per HFMD episode for mild outpatients, mild inpatients and severe cases were 3.6 (95%CI 3.4, 3,9), 6.9 (95%CI 6.4, 7.4) and 13.7 (95%CI 12.9, 14.5) per 1000 persons. Cases who were diagnosed with EV-A71 infection and had longer duration of illness were associated with higher total cost and QALY loss.HFMD poses a high economic and health burden in China. Our results provide economic and health utility data for cost-effectiveness analysis for HFMD vaccination in China."
https://openalex.org/W2760529479,"Background Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common physical pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder and spastic diplegic injury is its most frequent subtype. CP results in substantial neuromotor and cognitive impairments that have significant socioeconomic impact. Despite this, its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and etiology remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, there is a need for clinically relevant injury models, which a) reflect the heterogeneity of the condition and b) can be used to evaluate new translational therapies. To address these key knowledge gaps, we characterized a chronic placental insufficiency (PI) model, using bilateral uterine artery ligation (BUAL) of dams. This injury model results in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in pups, and animals recapitulate the human phenotype both in terms of neurobehavioural and anatomical deficits. Methods Effects of BUAL were studied using luxol fast blue (LFB)/hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Catwalk neurobehavioural tests. Results Neuroanatomical analysis revealed regional ventricular enlargement and corpus callosum thinning in IUGR animals, which was correlated with the extent of growth restriction. Olig2 staining revealed reductions in oligodendrocyte density in white and grey matter structures, including the corpus callosum, optic chiasm, and nucleus accumbens. The caudate nucleus, along with other brain structures such as the optic chiasm, internal capsule, septofimbrial and lateral septal nuclei, exhibited reduced size in animals with IUGR. The size of the pretectal nucleus was reduced only in moderately injured animals. MAG/NF200 staining demonstrated reduced myelination and axonal counts in the corpus callosum of IUGR animals. NeuN staining revealed changes in neuronal density in the hippocampus and in the thickness of hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) revealed regional white and grey matter changes at 3 weeks of age. Furthermore, neurobehavioural testing demonstrated neuromotor impairments in animals with IUGR in paw intensities, swing speed, relative print positions, and phase dispersions. Conclusions We have characterized a rodent model of IUGR and have demonstrated that the neuroanatomical and neurobehavioural deficits mirror the severity of the IUGR injury. This model has the potential to be applied to examine the pathobiology of and potential therapeutic strategies for IUGR-related brain injury. Thus, this work has potential translational relevance for the study of CP."

However, there is little information on the effects of lncRNAs on ovulation and lambing rates. In the present study, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed lncRNAs between the ovaries of multiparous (Mul) and uniparous (Uni) Anhui White goats. Among the 107,255,422 clean reads, 183,754 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the Uni and Mul. Among them, 455 lncRNAs were co-expressed between the two samples, whereas, 157,523 lncRNAs were uniquely expressed in the Uni, and 25,776 uniquely lncRNAs were expressed in the Mul. Through Cis role analysis, 24 lncRNAs were predicted to overlap with cis-regulatory elements, which involved in Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, Steroid biosynthesis, Oocyte meiosis, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway. These 4 pathways were related to ovulation, and the KEGG pathway analysis on target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs confirmed this results. In addition, 10 lncRNAs harbored precursors of 40 miRNAs, such as TCONS_00320849 related to a mature miRNA sequence, miR-365a, which was reported to be related to proliferation, were annotated in the precursor analysis of miRNAs. The present expand the understanding of lncRNA biology and contribute to the annotation of the goat genome. The study will provide a resource for lncRNA studies of ovulation and lambing."

It is produced in infiltrating immune cells or resident cells, such as adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and tumor cells. We hypothesized that ANGPTL2 might play an important role as a unique mediator in both systemic and periodontal disease. We demonstrated an increased ANGPTL2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid from chronic periodontitis patients. Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment strongly induced ANGPTL2 mRNA and protein levels in Ca9-22 human gingival epithelial cells. Recombinant human ANGPTL2 increased interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA and protein levels in Ca9-22 cells. Small-interfering (si)RNA-mediated ANGPTL2 knockdown in Ca9-22 cells reduced IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α mRNA and protein levels compared with control siRNA (p<0.01) in P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated Ca9-22 cells. Antibodies against integrin α5β1, an ANGPTL receptor, blocked induction of these inflammatory cytokines in P. gingivalis LPS-treated Ca9-22 cells, suggesting that secreted ANGPTL induces inflammatory cytokines in gingival epithelial cells via an autocrine loop. The classic sequential cascade of P. gingivalis LPS → inflammatory cytokine induction is well established. However, in the current study, we reveal a novel cascade comprising sequential P. gingivalis LPS → ANGPTL2 → integrin α5β1 → inflammatory cytokine induction, which might be responsible for inducing potent periodontal disorganization activity in gingival epithelial cells. Via this pathway, ANGPTL2 functions in the pathogenesis of periodontitis and contributes to prolonging chronic inflammation in patients with systemic disease."

However, many losses occur in the different steps of the contacts' cascade of care. Reasons for this are poorly understood.To describe the different steps where losses in the contact cascade occur and to explore knowledge and attitudes regarding tuberculosis transmission/prevention and perceptions about tuberculosis services in order to understand the reasons for losses from the tuberculosis service users' perspective.We collected routine data from the index case and contact registry books and from patients' records to build the cascade of care of contacts in 12 health facilities in three Brazilian cities with high tuberculosis incidence rates. During a knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) survey, trained interviewers administered a semi-structured questionnaire to 138 index cases and 98 contacts.Most of the losses in the cascade occurred in the first two steps (contact identification, 43% and tuberculin skin testing placement, 91% of the identified contacts). Among KAP-interviewed contacts, 67% knew how tuberculosis is transmitted, 87% knew its key symptoms and 81% declared they would take preventive therapy if prescribed. Among KAP-interviewed index cases, 67% knew they could spread tuberculosis, 70% feared for the health of their families and 88% would like their family to be evaluated in the same services.Only a small proportion of contacts are evaluated for active and latent tuberculosis, despite their-and their index cases'-reasonable knowledge, positive attitudes towards prevention and satisfaction with tuberculosis services. In these services, education of service users would not be a sufficient solution. Healthcare workers' and managers' perspective, not explored in this study, may bring more light to this subject."

Correct timing and level of Pdgfra expression is crucial for embryo development, and deletion of Pdgfra caused developmental defects of multiple endoderm and mesoderm derived structures, resulting in a complex phenotypes including orofacial cleft, spina bifida, rib deformities, and omphalocele in mice. However, it is not clear if deletion of Pdgfra at different embryonic stages differentially affects these structures. Purpose To address the temporal requirement of Pdgfra in embryonic development. Methods We have deleted the Pdgfra in Pdgfra-expressing tissues at different embryonic stages in mice, examined and quantified the developmental anomalies. Results Current study showed that (i) conditional deletion of Pdgfra at different embryonic days (between E7.5 and E10.5) resulted in orofacial cleft, spina bifida, rib cage deformities, and omphalocele, and (ii) the day of Pdgfra deletion influenced the combinations, incidence and severities of these anomalies. Deletion of Pdgfra caused apoptosis of Pdgfra-expressing tissues, and developmental defects of their derivatives. Conclusion Orofacial cleft, spina bifida and omphalocele are among the commonest skeletal and abdominal wall defects of newborns, but their genetic etiologies are largely unknown. The remarkable resemblance of our conditional Pdgfra knockout embryos to theses human congenital anomalies, suggesting that dysregulated PDGFRA expression could cause these anomalies in human. Future work should aim at defining (a) the regulatory elements for the expression of the human PDGFRA during embryonic development, and (b) if mutations / sequence variations of these regulatory elements cause these anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2759561703,"Background Very little is known about the proportion of oncology trials that get published, the time it takes to publish them, or the reasons why oncology trials do not get published. Methods We analyzed all clinical trials that closed to accrual at our cancer center between 2009–2013. Trials were categorized by study purpose (therapeutic vs. diagnostic), phase (pilot, phase I, II, or III), and sponsor (industrial, cooperative group, institutional, or peer-reviewed). Final publications were identified in MEDLINE and EMBASE by NCT numbers, or by querying the principal investigator. For trials not published, we surveyed the principal investigators to identify the reason for non-publication. Findings 469 of 809 protocols (58%) had been published by November 2016. The calculated probability of publication 7 years after completing accrual was 70.4%; the calculated median time to publication was 47 months. Only 18.8% of protocols overall were estimated to be published within 2 years from completing accrual. The calculated probability of publication was higher for therapeutic trials than non-therapeutic trials, but there was no difference based on phase or sponsor. Among protocols not published, 45.3% had completed accrual, and among these, a majority had a manuscript in preparation or review, or the trial was still collecting data. Failure to publish due to a pharmaceutical sponsor was rare. 30.6% of unpublished trials had closed for various reasons before completing accrual, usually due to poor accrual or pharmaceutical sponsor issues. Interpretation Almost 30% of trials were calculated to be unpublished by 7 years after closing to accrual at our institution. Failure to reach accrual goals was an important factor in non-publication. We have devised new institutional policies that identify trials likely not to meet accrual goals and require early closure. We should be able to shorten the time from accrual completion to publication, especially for pilot and phase I trials for which long follow up is not needed."
https://openalex.org/W2760512724,"Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is one of the CYP450 mixed-function oxidase system that is of clinical importance due to the large number of drug interactions associated with its induction and inhibition. In addition, significant inter-individual differences in the elimination of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 enzyme have been observed which are largely due to the highly polymorphic nature of CYP1A2 gene. However, there are limited studies on CYP1A2 phenotypes and CYP1A2 genotypes among Emiratis and thus this study was carried out to fill this gap. Five hundred and seventy six non-smoker Emirati subjects were asked to consume a soft drink containing caffeine (a non-toxic and reliable probe for predicting CYP1A2 phenotype) and then provide a buccal swab along with a spot urine sample. Taq-Man Real Time PCR was used to determine the CYP1A2 genotype of each individual. Phenotyping was carried out by analyzing the caffeine metabolites using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. We found that 1.4%, 16.3% and 82.3% of the Emirati subjects were slow, intermediate and rapid CYP1A2 metabolizers, respectively. In addition, we found that 1.4% of the subjects were homozygote for derived alleles while 16.1% were heterozygote and 82.5% were homozygote for the ancestral allele. The genotype frequency of the ancestral allele, CYP1A2*1A/*1A, is the highest in this population, followed by CYP1A2 *1A/*1C and CYP1A2 *1A/*1K genotypes, with frequencies of 0.825, 0.102 and 0.058, respectively. The degree of phenotype/genotype concordance was equal to 81.6%. The CYP1A2*1C/*1C and CYP1A2*3/*3 genotypes showed significantly the lowest enzyme phenotypic activity. The frequency of slow activity CYP1A2 enzyme alleles is very low among Emiratis which correlates with the presence of low frequencies of derived alleles in CYP1A2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2756621870,"Background Intestinal parasitic infections constitute a public health issue in developing countries, with prevalence rates as high as 90%, a figure set to escalate as the socioeconomic status of affected populations deteriorates. Investigating the occurrence of these infections among inmates is critical, since this group is more vulnerable to the spread of a number of infectious illnesses. Methods This cross-sectional, analytical, quantitative study was conducted in July 2015 at prison facilities located in Midwest Brazil to estimate the prevalence of parasitic infection among inmates. For detection of parasites, 510 stool samples were examined by ether centrifugation and spontaneous sedimentation. Results Eight parasitic species were detected, with an overall prevalence of 20.2% (103/510). Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar were the most frequent pathogenic parasites. Endolimax nana was the predominant non-pathogenic species. Nearly half of the subjects (53/103; 51.4%) were positive for mixed infection. Logistic regression revealed that inmates held in closed conditions were more likely to contract parasitic infections than those held in a semi-open regime (OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.19–3.25; p = 0.0085). A higher prevalence of parasitic infections was observed among individuals who had received no prophylactic antiparasitic treatment in previous years (OR = 10.2; 95% CI = 5.86–17.66; p < 0.001). The other factors investigated had no direct association with the presence of intestinal parasites. Conclusion Infections caused by directly transmissible parasites were detected. Without adequate treatment and prophylactic guidance, inmates tend to remain indefinitely infected with intestinal parasites, whether while serving time in prison or after release."
https://openalex.org/W2760009845,"Heart failure has emerged as a disease with significant public health implications. Following progression of heart failure, heart and liver dysfunction are frequently combined in hospitalized patients leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Here, we investigated the underlying pathological alterations in liver injury following heart failure. Heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. Sham operated and ACF rats were compared for their morphometric and hemodynamic data, for histopathological and ultrastructural changes in the liver as well as differences in the expression of apoptotic factors. ACF-induced heart failure is associated with light microscopic signs of apparent congestion of blood vessels, increased apoptosis and breakdown of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell inifltration were observed. The glycogen content depletion associated with the increased hepatic fibrosis, lipid globule formation was observed in ACF rats. Moreover, cytoplasmic organelles are no longer distinguishable in many ACF hepatocytes with degenerated fragmented rough endoplasmic reticulum, shrunken mitochondria and heavy cytoplasm vacuolization. ACF is associated with the upregulation of the hepatic TUNEL-positive cells and proapoptotic factor Bax protein concomitant with the mitochondrial leakage of cytochrome C into the cell cytoplasm and the transfer of activated caspase 3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus indicating intrinsic apoptotic events. Taken together, the results demonstrate that ACF-induced congestive heart failure causes liver injury which results in hepatocellular apoptotic cell death mediated by the intrinsic pathway of mitochondrial cytochrome C leakage and subsequent transfer of activated caspase 3 into to the nucleus to initiate overt DNA fragmentation and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2760410221,"Some HIV-infected c-ART-suppressed individuals show incomplete CD4+ T-cell recovery, abnormal T-cell activation and higher mortality. One potential source of immune activation could be coinfection with cytomegalovirus (CMV). IgG and IgM levels, immune activation, inflammation and T-cell death in c-ART-suppressed individuals with CD4+ T-cell counts >350 cells/μL (immunoconcordant, n = 133) or <350 cells/μL (immunodiscordant, n = 95) were analyzed to evaluate the effect of CMV humoral response on immune recovery. In total, 27 HIV-uninfected individuals were included as controls. In addition, the presence of CMV IgM antibodies was retrospectively analyzed in 58 immunoconcordant individuals and 66 immunodiscordant individuals. Increased CMV IgG levels were observed in individuals with poor immune reconstitution (p = 0.0002). Increased CMV IgG responses were significantly correlated with lower nadir and absolute CD4+ T-cell counts. In contrast, CMV IgG responses were positively correlated with activation (HLA-DR+) and death markers in CD4+ T-cells and activated memory CD8+ T-cells (CD45RA-CD38+). Longitudinal subanalysis revealed an increased frequency of IgM+ samples in individuals with poor CD4+ T-cell recovery, and an association was observed between retrospective IgM positivity and the current level of IgG. The magnitude of the humoral immune response to CMV is associated with nadir CD4+ T-cell counts, inflammation, immune activation and CD4+ T-cell death, thus suggesting that CMV infection may be a relevant driving force in the increased morbidity/mortality observed in HIV+ individuals with poor CD4+ T-cell recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2756613564,"Increased maternal serum bile acid concentrations in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) are associated with fetal cardiac arrhythmias. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been shown to demonstrate anti-arrhythmic properties via preventing ICP-associated cardiac conduction slowing and development of reentrant arrhythmias, although the cellular mechanism is still being elucidated.High-resolution fluorescent optical mapping of electrical activity and electrocardiogram measurements were used to characterize effects of UDCA on one-day-old neonatal and adult female Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. ICP was modelled by perfusion of taurocholic acid (TC, 400μM). Whole-cell calcium currents were recorded from neonatal rat and human fetal cardiomyocytes.TC significantly prolonged the PR interval by 11.0±3.5% (P<0.05) and slowed ventricular conduction velocity (CV) by 38.9±5.1% (P<0.05) exclusively in neonatal and not in maternal hearts. A similar CV decline was observed with the selective T-type calcium current (ICa,T) blocker mibefradil 1μM (23.0±6.2%, P<0.05), but not with the L-type calcium current (ICa,L) blocker nifedipine 1μM (6.9±6.6%, NS). The sodium channel blocker lidocaine (30μM) reduced CV by 60.4±4.5% (P<0.05). UDCA co-treatment was protective against CV slowing induced by TC and mibefradil, but not against lidocaine. UDCA prevented the TC-induced reduction in the ICa,T density in both isolated human fetal (-10.2±1.5 versus -5.5±0.9 pA/pF, P<0.05) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (-22.3±1.1 versus -9.6±0.8 pA/pF, P<0.0001), whereas UDCA had limited efficacy on the ICa,L.Our findings demonstrate that ICa,T plays a significant role in ICP-associated fetal cardiac conduction slowing and arrhythmogenesis, and is an important component of the fetus-specific anti-arrhythmic activity of UDCA."
https://openalex.org/W2757185472,"The oral thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran was withdrawn in the late clinical trial phase because it adversely affected the liver. In approximately 8% of treated patients, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was expressed as transient alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. No evidence of DILI had been revealed in the pre-clinical in vivo studies. A whole genome scan study performed on the clinical study material identified a strong genetic association between the major histocompatibility complex alleles for human leucocyte antigens (HLA) (HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ2) and elevated ALT levels in treated patients. An immune-mediated pathogenesis was suggested. Here, we evaluated whether HLA transgenic mice models could be used to investigate whether the expression of relevant HLA molecules was enough to reproduce the DILI effects in humans. In silico modelling performed in this study revealed association of both ximelagatran (pro-drug) and melagatran (active drug) to the antigen-presenting groove of the homology modelled HLA-DR7 molecule suggesting “altered repertoire” as a key initiating event driving development of DILI in humans. Transgenic mouse strains (tgms) expressing HLA of serotype HLA-DR7 (HLA-DRB1*0701, -DRA*0102), and HLA-DQ2 (HLA-DQB1*0202,–DQA1*0201) were created. These two lines were crossed with a human (h)CD4 transgenic line, generating the two tgms DR7xhCD4 and DQ2xhCD4. To investigate whether the DILI effects observed in humans could be reproduced in tgms, the mice were treated for 28 days with ximelagatran. Results revealed no signs of DILI when biomarkers for liver toxicity were measured and histopathology was evaluated. In the ximelagatran case, presence of relevant HLA-expression in a pre-clinical model did not fulfil the prerequisite for reproducing DILI observed in patients. Nonetheless, for the first time an HLA-transgenic mouse model has been investigated for use in HLA-associated DILI induced by a low molecular weight compound. This study shows that mimicking of genetic susceptibility, expressed as DILI-associated HLA-types in mice, is not sufficient for reproducing the complex pathogenesis leading to DILI in man."

The structural complexity and hierarchical branching scheme of the lung at this level of details, however, renders the extraction of biologically relevant quantities particularly challenging. We have developed a methodology for a detailed description of lung inflation patterns by measuring the size and the local curvature of the parenchymal airspaces. These quantitative tools for morphological and topological analyses were applied to high-resolution murine 3D lung image data, inflated at different pressure levels under immediate post mortem conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2759357790,"Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that integrates G protein and H-Ras/MAPkinase signaling pathways to regulate synaptic plasticity important for hippocampal learning and memory. However, to date, little is known about the subcellular distribution and roles of endogenous RGS14 in a neuronal cell line. Most of what is known about RGS14 cellular behavior is based on studies of tagged, recombinant RGS14 ectopically overexpressed in unnatural host cells. Here, we report for the first time a comprehensive assessment of the subcellular distribution and dynamic localization of endogenous RGS14 in rat B35 neuroblastoma cells. Using confocal imaging and 3D-structured illumination microscopy, we find that endogenous RGS14 localizes to subcellular compartments not previously recognized in studies of recombinant RGS14. RGS14 localization was observed most notably at juxtanuclear membranes encircling the nucleus, at nuclear pore complexes (NPC) on both sides of the nuclear envelope and within intranuclear membrane channels, and within both chromatin-poor and chromatin-rich regions of the nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In addition, a subset of nuclear RGS14 localized adjacent to active RNA polymerase II. Endogenous RGS14 was absent from the plasma membrane in resting cells; however, the protein could be trafficked to the plasma membrane from juxtanuclear membranes in endosomes derived from ER/Golgi, following constitutive activation of endogenous RGS14 G protein binding partners using AlF4¯. Finally, our findings show that endogenous RGS14 behaves as a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein confirming what has been shown previously for recombinant RGS14. Taken together, the findings highlight possible cellular roles for RGS14 not previously recognized that are distinct from the regulation of conventional GPCR-G protein signaling, in particular undefined roles for RGS14 in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2756779968,"Background/Purpose Radiation treatment (RT) stimulates the release of many immunohumoral factors, complicating the identification of clinically significant cytokine expression patterns. This study used principal component analysis (PCA) to analyze cytokines in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing RT and explore differences in changes after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and conventionally fractionated RT (CFRT) without or with chemotherapy. Methods The dataset included 141 NSCLC patients treated on prospective clinical protocols; PCA was based on the 128 patients who had complete CK values at baseline and during treatment. Patients underwent SBRT (n = 16), CFRT (n = 18), or CFRT (n = 107) with concurrent chemotherapy (ChRT). Levels of 30 cytokines were measured from prospectively collected platelet-poor plasma samples at baseline, during RT, and after RT. PCA was used to study variations in cytokine levels in patients at each time point. Results Median patient age was 66, and 22.7% of patients were female. PCA showed that sCD40l, fractalkine/C3, IP10, VEGF, IL-1a, IL-10, and GMCSF were responsible for most variability in baseline cytokine levels. During treatment, sCD40l, IP10, MIP-1b, fractalkine, IFN-r, and VEGF accounted for most changes in cytokine levels. In SBRT patients, the most important players were sCD40l, IP10, and MIP-1b, whereas fractalkine exhibited greater variability in CFRT alone patients. ChRT patients exhibited variability in IFN-γ and VEGF in addition to IP10, MIP-1b, and sCD40l. Conclusions PCA can identify potentially significant patterns of cytokine expression after fractionated RT. Our PCA showed that inflammatory cytokines dominate post-treatment cytokine profiles, and the changes differ after SBRT versus CFRT, with vs without chemotherapy. Further studies are planned to validate these findings and determine the clinical significance of the cytokine profiles identified by PCA."
https://openalex.org/W2757278663,"Microbial translocation (MT) is characterized by bacterial products passing into the blood through the gut barrier and is a key phenomenon in the pathophysiology of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. MT is also associated with liver damage in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) patients. The aim of the study was to assess MT in plasma of HIV-HCV co-infected patients. 16S rDNA (16 S Ribosomal DNA subunit) marker and other markers of MT such as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP), soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) were used. Clinical, biological and immunological characteristics of the population were studied in order to correlate them with the intensity of the MT. We demonstrate that indirect markers of MT, LBP and CD14s, and a marker of intestinal permeability (I-FABP) are significantly higher in HIV-HCV co-infected patients than in healthy controls (17.0 vs 2.6 μg/mL, p < 0.001; 1901.7 vs 1255.0 ng/mL, p = 0.018); 478.3 vs 248.1 pg/mL, p < 0.001, respectively), while a direct marker of MT (16S rDNA copies) is not different between these two populations. However, plasma 16S rDNA was significantly higher in co-infected patients with long-standing HIV infections (RGM = 1.47 per 10 years, CI95% = [1.04:2.06], p = 0.03). Our findings show that in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, plasma 16S rDNA levels, directly reflecting MT, seem to be linked to the duration of HIV infection, while elevated levels of LBP and sCD14 reflect only a persistence of immune activation. The levels of these markers were not correlated with HCV evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2754515811,"Although X-ray crystallography is the most commonly used technique for studying the molecular structure of proteins, it is not generally able to monitor the dynamic changes or global domain motions that often underlie allostery. These motions often prevent crystal growth or reduce crystal order. We have recently discovered a crystal form of human hemoglobin that contains three protein molecules allowed to express a full range of quaternary structures, whereas maintaining strong X-ray diffraction. Here we use this crystal form to investigate the effects of two allosteric effectors, phosphate and bezafibrate, by tracking the structures and functions of the three hemoglobin molecules following the addition of each effector. The X-ray analysis shows that the addition of either phosphate or bezafibrate not only induces conformational changes in a direction from a relaxed-state to a tense-state, but also within relaxed-state populations. The microspectrophotometric O2 equilibrium measurements on the crystals demonstrate that the binding of each effector energetically stabilizes the lowest affinity conformer more strongly than the intermediate affinity one, thereby reducing the O2 affinity of tense-state populations, and that the addition of bezafibrate causes an ∼5-fold decrease in the O2 affinity of relaxed-state populations. These results show that the allosteric pathway of hemoglobin involves shifts of populations rather than a unidirectional conversion of one quaternary structure to another, and that minor conformers of hemoglobin may have a disproportionate effect on the overall O2 affinity.

However, it has become increasingly apparent that Hb exists in an ensemble of multiple quaternary conformations. This complexity was first realized when the crystal structure of a second relaxed-state, R2, was solved nearly 25 years ago (4Silva M.M. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. A third quaternary structure of human hemoglobin A at 1.7-Å resolution.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17248-17256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important fact is that in the T to R2 transition the two αβ dimers rotate relative to each other by about 10° beyond R, implying that R2 has a substantially different quaternary conformation from R (Fig. 1a). Subsequent crystallographic studies have revealed that a number of quaternary structures lying between R and R2 can be obtained under different crystallization conditions (5Biswal B.K. Vijayan M.

Saigo S. Direct observation of two distinct affinity conformations in the T state human deoxyhemoglobin.FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with the view that Hb is in motion, fluctuating among many conformations that include the crystallographically observed structures, T, R, and R2. Although X-ray crystallography has provided atomic details of the structures of particular conformers of Hb, it does not give direct information about molecular motions between them, limiting the understanding of the pathway of the conformational transition. Also, no static structure can reveal an allosteric mechanism in which conformational ensembles shift in response to external influences. Recently, we discovered a novel C2 crystal form of Hb, which not only contains three independent Hb tetramers with different structures, but also allows those molecules to adopt a variety of conformations, depending on the conditions (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have shown that α1β2 CO-liganded, cross-linked Fe(II)-Ni(II) hybrid Hb (i.e. XL[α(Fe-CO)β(Ni)][α(Ni)β(Fe-CO)]) with and without 10 mm Pi (referred to as HL+ and HL−, respectively) and uncross-linked fully water-liganded met-Hb with 10 mm Pi all crystallize in this C2 form. The nine tetramer models in the three crystal structures cover the complete conformational space of Hb, spanning from T to R2 via R, with various intermediate forms (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the usage of this crystal form would give the unique opportunity to perform a crystallographic tracking of how Hb molecules in crystals undergoing structural and functional changes in response to environmental changes. In this study, we chose HL− (see Fig. 1b) as the starting sample for the following reasons. First, in the HL− crystal the three tetramers, termed molecules A, B, and C, assume R2, RR2 (an intermediate between R and R2), and TR (an intermediate between T and R), respectively (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), that are expected to move toward a more tense conformation upon adding an allosteric effector (see Fig. 1, b and c). Second, in solution a half-liganded species may be in an equilibrium among energetically comparable, but structurally distinct conformers (14Shibayama N.

In addition, the cross-linked Fe(II)-Ni(II) hybrid Hb is a good and stable model for partially liganded Fe(II)-Hb, because Ni(II)-heme is an ideal surrogate for deoxy Fe(II)-heme (15Shibayama N.

Using this model system, we visualize how the conformational ensembles of tetrameric Hb respond to the addition of allosteric effectors. We investigated the effects of two allosteric effectors, Pi and bezafibrate (BZF, see Fig. 2a), on the conformational ensembles of XL[α(Fe-CO)β(Ni)][α(Ni)β(Fe-CO)]. In this study, we did not investigate the effects of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), because the binding site for these effectors is blocked by the fumaryl cross-link (17Shibayama N.

Before X-ray analysis, we need to know the kinetics of structural changes that occur in the crystals. Previous studies showed that upon the quaternary conformational change of the Fe(II)-Ni(II) hybrid, quite large spectrophotometric changes in the Ni(II) subunits can be detected in relationship to the change in the strength of the proximal Ni-His bond (15Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Miyazaki G. Oxygen equilibrium study and light absorption spectra of Ni(II)-Fe(II) hybrid hemoglobins.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Kitagawa T.

Taking this advantage, the kinetics can be determined by measuring the absorbance changes of the crystals following the addition of Pi or BZF. As shown in Fig. 3, c and d, the time courses of the absorbance changes are dependent on the crystal thickness, indicating that the kinetics are limited by diffusion of solutes, at least in the case of the thick crystals. However, our diffusion simulation shows that this is not the case for the thin crystals in which the diffusion kinetics are much faster than the observed absorption change, suggesting that the kinetics are limited by conformational transition rates. It is likely that BZF binding requires a larger (slower) conformational change to fit into its binding cavity than Pi, which binds more toward the surface.Figure 3Spectrophotometric monitoring of crystals upon the addition of either Pi or BZF. a, absorption spectra of a HL− crystal (red line; initial conditions without anions at pH 7.7) after a 14-min exposure to 10 mm Pi-K buffer (pH 6.9) (blue line), followed by a 16-min exposure to 80 mm Pi-K buffer (pH 6.7) (green line). b, absorption spectra of a HL− crystal (red line; initial conditions) after a 8-min exposure to 4 mm BZF and 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) (blue line), followed by a 10-min exposure to 4 mm BZF and 20 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) (green line). c and d, time courses of absorbance changes for thin (red) and thick (blue; 2.5–3.0 times thicker) crystals, observed at 558 and 516 nm, respectively, after transferring the HL− crystals to an 80 mm Pi-K buffer (pH 6.7) (shown in c) or to a 4 mm BZF and 20 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) (shown in d).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on these data, the conformational ensembles under four sets of perturbed conditions examined in Fig. 3, a and b, were determined by X-ray crystallography after soaking intermediate-size HL− crystals (between those studied in Fig. 3, c and d) in each buffer for a sufficient time period. These crystals diffracted to better than a previously achieved 2.8-Å resolution for the original HL− crystal (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table 1. Electron density maps around the α1β2 interfaces of all 12 conformers (3 tetramers × 4 conditions) illustrate the quality of the data collected (Fig. 4). Among them, we observed the weak electron density for BZF located at the central cavities of molecules C in 4BZF65 and 4BZF72 (Fig. 2b). In other tetramer models, there is little or no electron density for bound BZF or Pi. We note that, although the weak electron density and high temperature factors of the BZF molecule in our structural models (see Fig. 2b) do not permit us to define its occupancy precisely, the kinetics data in Fig. 3d ensure that the binding equilibrium is attained in the crystal. Perutz et al. (19Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. Hemoglobin as a receptor of drugs and peptides: x-ray studies of the stereochemistry of binding.J. Am. Chem.

They found that the isobutyl group of BZF appears in the electron density map as a single unresolved sphere as we observed (see Fig. 2b), suggesting free rotation about the O–C bond.Table 1Crystal parameters, data collection, and structure refinementData set+10 mm Pi (pH 6.9)+80 mm Pi (pH 6.7)+4 mm BZF (pH 7.2)+4 mm BZF (pH 6.5)10Pi6980Pi674BZF724BZF65Data collection statistics Resolution range (Å)50.0–2.750.0–2.5350.0–2.6550.0–2.4 Space groupC2C2C2C2 Unit cell dimensions (Å)a = 228.77, b = 55.02,a = 228.89, b = 55.81,a = 228.49, b = 55.02,a = 228.60, b = 54.60, c = 138.43, β = 103.28° c = 139.93, β = 102.39° c = 138.50, β = 103.34° c = 138.44, β = 103.18° Reflections (measured/unique)195,617/44,657264,161/57,084221,033/48,972305,141/65,188 Completeness (%)96.5 (83.5)aValues in parentheses for the highest shell with a resolution of 2.75–2.70, 2.59–2.53, 2.70–2.65, and, 2.44–2.40 Å, respectively, from left to right.98.4 (87.6)aValues in parentheses for the highest shell with a resolution of 2.75–2.70, 2.59–2.53, 2.70–2.65, and, 2.44–2.40 Å, respectively, from left to right.98.1 (83.9)aValues in parentheses for the highest shell with a resolution of 2.75–2.70, 2.59–2.53, 2.70–2.65, and, 2.44–2.40 Å, respectively, from left to right.98.5 (97.4)aValues in parentheses for the highest shell with a resolution of 2.75–2.70, 2.59–2.53, 2.70–2.65, and, 2.44–2.40 Å, respectively, from left to right.

Open table in a new tab Examples of quaternary conformational changes associated with effector binding are presented in Fig. 2c, including the structures of molecules A, B, and C before and after adding 4 mm BZF at pH 6.5. We should note that the resolutions of the current crystal structures (2.4–2.7-Å resolution) are high enough to discuss the quaternary states of the conformers (Fig. 4), but not high enough to allow for model construction of the CO molecules on the basis of the electron density maps. Moreover, as noted in our previous study (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), crystal lattices appear not to discriminate between two inequivalent dimers within the asymmetric tetramer (i.e. α1(Fe-CO)β1(Ni) and α2(Ni)β2(Fe-CO)). For these reasons, we do not model the CO molecules in the present structural models. The heme environmental structures cannot be discussed in detail either. Conformational population shifts in response to adding Pi or BZF are quantified by difference distance matrix plots that depict the changes in pairwise distances between all Cα atoms, with respect to the initial structures (without anions) as a function of solution conditions (Fig. 5a). Significantly, during the solution changes, most conformers have experienced structural rearrangements at the quaternary level, as evidenced by the colors in the inter-dimer regions in Fig. 5a. The quaternary states of the 12 conformers can also be characterized based on the relative orientation of the two αβ dimers (Fig. 1a), which is quantified by dimer–dimer rotation angle and rotation translation from T (Fig. 5, b and c). To relate the obtained crystal structures to their O2 affinities, we carried out O2 equilibrium measurements on the single crystals under the same conditions as used for X-ray studies except for the absence of glycerol. The crystals were first converted to the oxy form and then equilibrated with different O2 pressures. The optical absorption spectra of the crystals were measured by microspectrophotometry with light incident on the (010) crystal face. The fractional saturation of the ferrous hemes with O2 (Y) was calculated by a least squares fit of the spectra to a linear combination of the reference spectra of the oxy-, deoxy-, and met-forms of the same crystal (Fig. 6). The Hill plots of the O2 equilibrium curves of the 10Pi69 (the final structural model of our C2 crystal after adding 10 mm Pi-K buffer, pH 6.9), 80Pi67 (the final structural model of our C2 crystal after adding 80 mm Pi-K buffer, pH 6.7), 4BZF72 (the final structural model of our C2 crystal after adding 4 mm BZF and 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2), and 4BZF65 (the final structural model of our C2 crystal after adding 4 mm BZF and 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5) crystals are shown in Fig. 7a, which for comparison includes the O2 equilibrium curve of the initial HL− crystal without effector (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 7b, all the deoxygenation data obtained by the decreasing O2 pressure (open circles) agree well with the oxygenation data obtained by increasing the O2 pressure (closed squares), confirming that true equilibrium binding curves were being measured. Also, because the HL+ crystal is a crystal grown under the conditions similar to the perturbed conditions of 10Pi69 (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the agreement between the O2 equilibrium curves of the 10Pi69 and HL+ crystals ensures that a conformational equilibrium is reached in the crystal (Fig. 7a, inset). We find that all the current crystals exhibit a biphasic curve with two distinct affinity components: one shows a sample-independent very low-affinity with no cooperativity (the right half of the Hill plot), and the other shows a sample-dependent high-affinity and a varied degree of cooperativity (the left half of the Hill plot). According to the previous assignment made on a similar biphasic curve of the HL+ crystal (see Fig. 7a, inset), we can reasonably assign the low-affinity component as arising from molecule C, and the high-affinity component from molecules A and B. Because the current crystals contain three independent hybrid Hb tetramers (see Fig. 1b), each with the O2 binding equilibrium constants of the first and second oxygenation steps (i.e. K1 and K2), the number of parameters is too large to be evaluated with confidence from the experimental data. Thus, we must make some assumptions to limit their number. The first assumption is that K1 and K2 of molecules C (referred to as K1C and K2C) in all the current crystals are the same as those of the HL+ crystal previously determined (13Shibayama N. Sugiyama K. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Capturing the hemoglobin allosteric transition in a single crystal form.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2014; 136: 5097-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This assumption is reasonable for the following reasons. (i) As shown in Fig. 7a, all the current crystals show a similar low-affinity component (the right half of the Hill plot), which agrees well with that of the HL+ crystal (Fig. 7a, inset), (ii) molecules C in the HL+ and current crystals all adopt a similar T structure (Fig. 5), and (iii) it is shown that allosteric effectors (e.g. H+, Cl−, IHP, and BZF) do not alter the O2 affinity of T-state Hb crystals (20Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E.R. Eaton W.A. Crystals of haemoglobin with the T quaternary structure bind oxygen noncooperatively with no Bohr effect.Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Rivetti C.

Rossi G.L. Eaton W.A. Henry E.R. Allosteric effectors do not alter the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin crystals.Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Then we assume that the remaining part of the data (the high-affinity component corresponding to molecules A and B) can be approximated by a simple two-step oxygenation scheme represented by the O2 binding constants K1AB and K2AB. Although this assumption is too simple to discriminate molecules A and B, in practice the K2AB value gives a good approximation to the overall O2 affinity of relaxed-state populations. According to this biphasic model, all the curves could be well fitted (solid lines in Fig. 7) and the determined O2 affinities listed in Table 2.Table 2O2 affinity and cooperativity of crystalsConditionsMoleculesO2 affinity (K2AB or K2C)Cooperativity, Hill coefficientTorr−1n10Pi69: +10 mm Pi (pH 6.9)A+B4.2 ± 0.50.81 ± 0.08C0.00646aIn the current analytical model, the K1C and K2C values of molecules C in the presence of effector are fixed to be 0.0132 torr−1 and 0.00646 torr−1, respectively (see text).0.82aIn the current analytical model, the K1C and K2C values of molecules C in the presence of effector are fixed to be 0.0132 torr−1 and 0.00646 torr−1, respectively (see text).80Pi67: +80 mm Pi (pH 6.7)A+B3.4 ± 2.71.7 ± 0.3C0.00646aIn the current analytical model, the K1C and K2C values of molecules C in the presence of effector are fixed to be 0.0132 torr−1 and 0.00646 torr−1, respectively (see text).0.82aIn the current analytical model, the K1C and K2C values of molecules C in the presence of effect"

Dwell positions and dwell times of the radiation source are established, relative to the patient's anatomy, from an initial X-ray-CT-image. During the irradiation treatment, catheter displacements can occur due to patient movements. The current study develops an automatic analysis tool of EMT data sets recorded with a solenoid sensor to assure concordance of the source movement with the treatment plan. The tool combines machine learning techniques such as multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and particle filter (PF) to precisely detect and quantify any mismatch between the treatment plan and actual EMT measurements. We demonstrate that movement artifacts as well as technical signal distortions can be removed automatically and reliably, resulting in artifact-free reconstructed signals. This is a prerequisite for a highly accurate determination of any deviations of dwell positions from the treatment plan."

In this paper, we extend the original Cayley-Klein metric to the multiple Cayley-Klein metric, which is defined as a linear combination of several Cayley-Klein metrics. Since Cayley-Klein is a kind of non-linear metric, its combination could model the data space better, thus lead to an improved performance. We show how to learn a multiple Cayley-Klein metric by iterative optimization over single Cayley-Klein metric and their combination coefficients under the objective to maximize the performance on separating inter-class instances and gathering intra-class instances.

https://openalex.org/W2758990248,"Vps35 (vacuolar protein sorting 35) is a major component of retromer that selectively promotes endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of transmembrane proteins. Dysfunction of retromer is a risk factor for the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, Vps35/retromer’s function in the eye or the contribution of Vps35-deficiency to eye degenerative disorders remains to be explored. Here we provide evidence for a critical role of Vps35 in mouse corneal dystrophy. Vps35 is expressed in mouse and human cornea. Mouse cornea from Vps35 heterozygotes (Vps35+/-) show features of dystrophy, such as loss of both endothelial and epithelial cell densities, disorganizations of endothelial, stroma, and epithelial cells, excrescences in the Descemet membrane, and corneal edema. Additionally, corneal epithelial cell proliferation was reduced in Vps35-deficient mice. Intriguingly, cell surface targeting of SLC4A11, a membrane transport protein (OH- /H+ /NH3 /H2O) of corneal endothelium, whose mutations have been identified in patients with corneal dystrophy, was impaired in Vps35-deficient cells and cornea. Taken together, these results suggest that SLC4A11 appears to be a Vps35/retromer cargo, and Vps35-regulation of SLC4A11 trafficking may underlie Vps35/retromer regulation of corneal dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2759219157,"The Qiongdongnan Basin is a strongly overpressured basin with the maximum pressure coefficient (the ratio of the actual pore pressure versus hydrostatic pressure at the same depth) over 2.27. However, there exists a widespread low-overpressure interval between the strong overpressure intervals in the Yanan Sag of western basin. The mechanisms of the low-overpressure interval are not well understood. Three main approaches, pore pressure test data and well-log analysis, pressure prediction based on the relationship between the deviation of the velocity and the pressure coefficients, and numerical modeling, were employed to illustrate the distribution and evolution of the low-overpressure interval. And we analyzed and explained the phenomenon of the low-overpressure interval that is both underlain and overlain by high overpressure internal. The low-overpressure interval between the strong overpressure intervals can be identified and modelled by drilling data of P-wave sonic and the mud weight, and the numerical modeling using the PetroMod software. Results show that the low-overpressure interval is mainly composed of sandstone sediments. The porosities of sandstone in the low-overpressure interval primarily range from 15%-20%, and the permeabilities range from 10-100 md. Analysis of the geochemical parameters of C1, iC4/nC4, ΔR3, and numerical modeling shows that oil and gas migrated upward into the sandstone in the low-overpressure interval, and then migrated along the sandstone of low-overpressure interval into the Yacheng uplift. The low-overpressure both underlain and overlain by overpressure resulted from the fluids migrating along the sandstones in the low-overpressure interval into the Yacheng uplift since 1.9Ma. The mudstone in the strong overpressure interval is good cap overlain the sandstone of low-overpressure interval, therefore up-dip pinchouts or isolated sandstone in the low-overpressure interval locating the migration path of oil and gas are good plays for hydrocarbon exploration."

We assessed the association between sports engagement and age at first myocardial infarction (MI) in a cohort of men under 55 years of age.The Bern percutaneous coronary intervention Registry (NCT 02241291) was analyzed from March 2009 until January 2012. Male patients with first MI, age 18 to 54 years and body mass index ≤25kg/m2 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups based on their starting age with organized sports ≥1 h/week outside school (EARLY: <18, CONTROL: ≥18 years or never). We assessed age at time of first MI, CVRF, and volume of sports training.Of 4,394 consecutive patients, 123 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (EARLY n = 81, CONTROL n = 42). Age at the time of first MI was 3 years younger in the EARLY compared to the CONTROL group (46.8±6.0 vs. 49.8±4.6 years, p = 0.006). Total lifetime training hours, and average yearly training hours, both, before and after age 18, were significantly greater in the EARLY group. Years of training <18 years were weakly inversely correlated with age at first MI (r2 = 0.075, p = 0.002). The proportion of sports-related MI was not different between EARLY and CONTROL (13.6% vs. 11.9%). Patients in the EARLY group had fewer CVRF (2 vs. 3; p = 0.001). Prevalence of smoking was equally high in both groups (63.0% and 64.3%).In our patients aged 54 and younger, the first MI occurred 3 years earlier in those who started regular sports activity before age 18, despite a more active lifestyle and favorable CVRF profile."
