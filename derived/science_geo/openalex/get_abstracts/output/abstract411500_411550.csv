https://openalex.org/W2028574594,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside and self-renew in the bone marrow (BM) niche. Overall, the signaling that regulates stem cell dormancy in the HSC niche remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β type II receptor-deficient HSCs show low-level Smad activation and impaired long-term repopulating activity, underlining the critical role of TGF-β/Smad signaling in HSC maintenance. TGF-β is produced as a latent form by a variety of cells, so we searched for those that express activator molecules for latent TGF-β. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells in BM proved responsible for activation. These glial cells ensheathed autonomic nerves, expressed HSC niche factor genes, and were in contact with a substantial proportion of HSCs. Autonomic nerve denervation reduced the number of these active TGF-β-producing cells and led to rapid loss of HSCs from BM. We propose that glial cells are components of a BM niche and maintain HSC hibernation by regulating activation of latent TGF-β."
https://openalex.org/W1984562049,Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within the nucleus.

As a consequence of both incomplete erasure of tissue-specific methylation and aberrant de novo methylation, CB-iPSCs and K-iPSCs were distinct in genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and differentiation potential. Extended passage of some iPSC clones in culture did not improve their epigenetic resemblance to embryonic stem cells, implying that some human iPSCs retain a residual 'epigenetic memory' of their tissue of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2033877733,"Monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders provide key insights into the pathogenesis of disease and help us understand how specific genes control the development of the human brain. Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1.2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism. We generated cortical neuronal precursor cells and neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome. Cells from these individuals have defects in calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling and activity-dependent gene expression. They also show abnormalities in differentiation, including decreased expression of genes that are expressed in lower cortical layers and in callosal projection neurons. In addition, neurons derived from individuals with Timothy syndrome show abnormal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased production of norepinephrine and dopamine. This phenotype can be reversed by treatment with roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and atypical L-type-channel blocker. These findings provide strong evidence that Ca(v)1.2 regulates the differentiation of cortical neurons in humans and offer new insights into the causes of autism in individuals with Timothy syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2034806022,"Lin28A and Lin28B selectively block the expression of let-7 microRNAs and function as oncogenes in a variety of human cancers. Lin28A recruits a TUTase (Zcchc11/TUT4) to let-7 precursors to block processing by Dicer in the cell cytoplasm. Here we find that unlike Lin28A, Lin28B represses let-7 processing through a Zcchc11-independent mechanism. Lin28B functions in the nucleus by sequestering primary let-7 transcripts and inhibiting their processing by the Microprocessor. The inhibitory effects of Zcchc11 depletion on the tumorigenic capacity and metastatic potential of human cancer cells and xenografts are restricted to Lin28A-expressing tumors. Furthermore, the majority of human colon and breast tumors analyzed exclusively express either Lin28A or Lin28B. Lin28A is expressed in HER2-overexpressing breast tumors, whereas Lin28B expression characterizes triple-negative breast tumors. Overall our results illuminate the distinct mechanisms by which Lin28A and Lin28B function and have implications for the development of new strategies for cancer therapy. Lin28A and Lin28B selectively block the expression of let-7 microRNAs and function as oncogenes in a variety of human cancers.

Overall our results illuminate the distinct mechanisms by which Lin28A and Lin28B function and have implications for the development of new strategies for cancer therapy. The TUTase Zcchc11 represses expression of the miRNA let-7 via Lin28A but not Lin28B Lin28B localizes to the cell nucleus and blocks pri-let-7 processing Zcchc11 depletion selectively inhibits the tumorigenicity of Lin28A-expressing cancer The majority of human colon and breast tumors express either Lin28A or Lin28B Control of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) is important for normal development. Altered miRNA expression is linked with various diseases including cancer (Small and Olson, 2011Small E.M. Olson E.N. Pervasive roles of microRNAs in cardiovascular biology.Nature. 2011; 469: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). miRNA biogenesis begins with transcription of primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that contain a stem-loop structure. In the cell nucleus, pri-miRNAs are processed by the Microprocessor, containing the ribonuclease Drosha and its essential cofactor DGCR8 (Denli et al., 2004Denli A.M. Tops B.B. Plasterk R.H.

The Microprocessor complex mediates the genesis of microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 432: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar). The Microprocessor cleaves the double-stranded RNA toward the base of the stem loop to release a 60–80 nucleotide (nt) precursor (pre-miRNA) that is exported to the cell cytoplasm and cleaved by Dicer to generate a 22 nt duplex (Hutvágner et al., 2001Hutvágner G.

One RNA strand is bound by Argonaute and incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Gregory et al., 2005Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R.

Argonaute2 is the catalytic engine of mammalian RNAi.Science. 2004; 305: 1437-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Basepairing between the miRNA and target mRNA guides RISC to complementary transcripts, leading to gene repression through mRNA degradation and/or translational repression (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Altered miRNA expression is directly associated with cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis and is observed in a wide variety of human malignancies (Di Leva and Croce, 2010Di Leva G. Croce C.M. Roles of small RNAs in tumor formation.Trends Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The let-7 miRNA family members act as tumor suppressors by inhibiting expression of oncogenes and key regulators of mitogenic pathways including RAS, MYC, and HMGA2 (Büssing et al., 2008Büssing I.

Restoration of let-7 expression effectively inhibits cancer growth in mouse models of lung and breast cancers (Barh et al., 2010Barh D. Malhotra R. Ravi B. Sindhurani P.

In humans, there are 12 let-7 family members (let-7a-1, -2, -3; let-7b; let-7c; let-7d; let-7e; let-7f-1, -2; let-7g; let-7i; miR-98) located at eight different chromosomal loci. Of note, many tumors are characterized by the coordinate downregulation of multiple let-7 miRNAs (Shell et al., 2007Shell S. Park S.M. Radjabi A.R. Schickel R. Kistner E.O. Jewell D.A. Feig C. Lengyel E. Peter M.E. Let-7 expression defines two differentiation stages of cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 11400-11405Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein Lin28 was found to selectively repress expression of let-7 miRNAs (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N.

Selective blockade of microRNA processing by Lin28.Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). This posttranscriptional regulation of let-7 by Lin28 is required for normal development and contributes to the pluripotent state by preventing let-7-mediated differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Lin28 overexpression or let-7 inhibition with antisense RNAs promotes reprogramming of human and mouse fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Martinez and Gregory, 2010Martinez N.J.

Unlike in C. elegans where a single Lin28 gene is responsible for repression of let-7 expression and control of developmental timing, the mammalian genome encodes two Lin28 paralogs, Lin28 (hereafter Lin28A) and Lin28B (Guo et al., 2006Guo Y. Chen Y. Ito H. Watanabe A. Ge X. Kodama T. Aburatani H.

Lin28B also represses expression of multiple let-7 members, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked Lin28B with the determination of human height and control of the age of onset of puberty and menopause, phenotypes that are recapitulated in a mouse model (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu H. Shah S. Shyh-Chang N. Shinoda G. Einhorn W.S. Viswanathan S.R. Takeuchi A. Grasemann C. Rinn J.L. Lopez M.F. et al.Lin28a transgenic mice manifest size and puberty phenotypes identified in human genetic association studies.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Activation of Lin28A/Lin28B occurs in several different primary human tumors, and these tumors display low levels of let-7 expression (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. An epigenetic switch involving NF-kappaB, Lin28, Let-7 MicroRNA, and IL6 links inflammation to cell transformation.Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R.

Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Indeed, Lin28A/Lin28B function as oncogenes that promote cellular transformation when ectopically expressed (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K.

Frazier A.L. et al.A role for Lin28 in primordial germ-cell development and germ-cell malignancy.Nature. 2009; 460: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Importantly, this effect is abrogated when let-7 is reintroduced into these cells (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. An epigenetic switch involving NF-kappaB, Lin28, Let-7 MicroRNA, and IL6 links inflammation to cell transformation.Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar, Viswanathan et al., 2009Viswanathan S.R.

Genet. 2009; 41: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, Lin28-mediated cellular transformation is directly dependent on let-7 levels. Conversely, depletion of Lin28A or Lin28B in human cancer cells results in decreased cell proliferation (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M.

Lin28A/Lin28B may contribute to the development of aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors because their expression is associated with advanced disease in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Wilms' tumor, ovarian carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and germ cell tumors (Dangi-Garimella et al., 2009Dangi-Garimella S.

For example, c-Myc binds to both Lin28A and Lin28B loci and activates expression of these genes (Chang et al., 2009Chang T.C. Zeitels L.R. Hwang H.W. Chivukula R.R. Wentzel E.A. Dews M. Jung J. Gao P. Dang C.V. Beer M.A. et al.Lin-28B transactivation is necessary for Myc-mediated let-7 repression and proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 3384-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In a breast cancer model, transient expression of Src oncoprotein results in a transformed cell line that forms self-renewing mammospheres harboring tumor-initiating cells (Iliopoulos et al., 2009Iliopoulos D. Hirsch H.A. Struhl K. An epigenetic switch involving NF-kappaB, Lin28, Let-7 MicroRNA, and IL6 links inflammation to cell transformation.Cell. 2009; 139: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The transformation process involves NF-κB activation leading to direct transcriptional upregulation of Lin28B, consequent let-7 loss, and derepression of the let-7 target gene IL-6. Because IL-6 activates NF-κB, this regulatory circuit represents a positive feedback loop, providing a molecular link between inflammation and cancer. Selective regulation of let-7 expression involves Lin28A binding to the terminal loop of let-7 precursors, a molecular recognition that requires both the cold shock domain (CSD) and CCHC-type zinc finger RNA-binding domains of the Lin28A protein (Piskounova et al., 2008Piskounova E. Viswanathan S.R. Janas M. LaPierre R.J. Daley G.Q. Sliz P. Gregory R.I. Determinants of microRNA processing inhibition by the developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein Lin28.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21310-21314Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Lin28A recruits the activity of a terminal uridylyltransferase (TUTase), Zcchc11 (also known as TUTase4 or TUT4), that inhibits pre-let-7 processing by Dicer and leads to the rapid decay of oligouridylated pre-let-7 RNAs (Hagan et al., 2009Hagan J.P. Piskounova E. Gregory R.I. Lin28 recruits the TUTase Zcchc11 to inhibit let-7 maturation in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Although both Lin28A and Lin28B can recruit Zcchc11/TUT4 to uridylate pre-let-7 in vitro, the molecular mechanism of the Lin28B-mediated blockade of let-7 expression has yet to be determined (Heo et al., 2008Heo I.

Cell. 2008; 32: 276-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the regulation of let-7 expression by Lin28B. Surprisingly, we find that despite their high degree of homology, Lin28A and Lin28B function through distinct mechanisms. Depletion of Zcchc11 affects let-7 expression only in Lin28A-expressing cancer cells, whereas Lin28B functions through a Zcchc11-independent mechanism. We find that Lin28A and Lin28B are differentially localized in cells with predominantly cytoplasmic Lin28A, whereas due to its functional nuclear localization signals, Lin28B accumulates in the nucleus, where it binds pri-let-7 miRNAs to block processing by the Microprocessor. In contrast, Lin28A functions in the cytoplasm by blocking at the Dicer step and recruiting the TUTase to uridylate pre-let-7. Our findings identify Zcchc11 as a possible therapeutic target in Lin28A-expressing cancers. Accordingly, we demonstrate that Zcchc11 depletion selectively inhibits the tumorigenic capacity and metastatic potential of Lin28A- but not Lin28B-expresing human cancer cells and xenografts. Our results illuminate the distinct mechanisms by which Lin28A and Lin28B function and have broad implications for the development of new strategies for cancer therapy. The paralogous RNA-binding proteins Lin28A and Lin28B have a high degree of sequence identity and conserved domain organization (Figure 1A ), and both proteins selectively block let-7 expression (Newman et al., 2008Newman M.A. Thomson J.M. Hammond S.M. Lin-28 interaction with the Let-7 precursor loop mediates regulated microRNA processing.RNA. 2008; 14: 1539-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, Viswanathan et al., 2008Viswanathan S.R. Daley G.Q. Gregory R.I. Selective blockade of microRNA processing by Lin28.Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). We screened several human cancer cell lines and found that some express Lin28A, whereas others express Lin28B (Figure 1B). We did not observe coexpression of both Lin28A and Lin28B in any cell line, suggesting that their expression may be mutually exclusive. We found ubiquitous Zcchc11 expression. HeLa cells express Zcchc11 but neither Lin28A nor Lin28B. Because Lin28A-mediated repression of let-7 in mouse ESCs (mESCs) involves the TUTase Zcchc11, we next asked whether Lin28A and Lin28B function through the same mechanism to block let-7 processing. Previous reports have used recombinant Lin28A and Lin28B interchangeably in biochemical assays, demonstrating that Lin28B is capable of enhancing Zcchc11 activity in vitro; however, the physiological relevance of these observations remains unknown (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate whether both Lin28A and Lin28B function through a Zcchc11 TUTase-dependent mechanism, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. Myc-tagged Lin28A, Lin28B, or Ago2 were coexpressed with either Flag-tagged Zcchc11 or Flag-EIF6 control (Figure 1C). Because the Lin28A-Zcchc11 interaction has been shown to be RNA dependent, we also coexpressed pri-let-7g (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier reports, myc-Lin28A was found to be associated with affinity-purified Flag-Zcchc11 (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect a physical interaction between myc-Lin28B and Flag-Zcchc11. We performed additional co-IP experiments in which we titrated the amount of exogenously expressed Flag-Zcchc11. These experiments confirmed the specific physical interaction of Zcchc11 and Lin28A, whereas myc-Lin28B was not detected in any of the Flag-Zcchc11 IPs (Figure S1A available online). This was additionally confirmed by the co-IP of endogenous Lin28A in Igrov1 cells (Figure S1B). Together, these results indicate that unlike for Lin28A, we could not detect any physical interaction between Lin28B and Zcchc11. Next, to address the functional requirement of Zcchc11 in the Lin28A- and Lin28B-mediated repression of let-7 expression, we performed a series of knockdown experiments to deplete Zcchc11 in a panel of human cancer cell lines. We used shRNAs to deplete Lin28A or Zcchc11 expression in Igrov1 cells and measured the effect on let-7 expression by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (q.RT-PCR). As expected, depletion of Lin28A led to an ∼10-fold increase in let-7 levels. Knockdown of Zcchc11 with three independent shRNAs also led to elevated mature let-7 levels (Figure 1D). Therefore, Zcchc11 is involved in the repression of let-7 expression in this Lin28A-expressing human cancer cell line"

J. Zool. 1978; 56: 1759-1764Crossref Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). Migratory monarchs are in reproductive diapause. Migrants also have a striking increase in longevity, increased abdominal fat stores and cold tolerance, and an overpowering drive to fly south. Diapause persists at the overwintering sites until spring, when the migrants reproduce and then fly northward to oviposit fertile eggs on newly emerged milkweed plants in the southern United States (Figure 1B). Monarchs are milkweed specialists (Figure 1C), and their evolved chemical defense mechanism has contributed to the monarch's widely known involvement in a mimicry complex with the viceroy butterfly (Limenitis archippus) (Ritland and Brower, 1991Ritland D.B. Brower L.P. The viceroy butterfly is not a batesian mimic.Nature. 1991; 350: 497-498Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A major compass system that monarchs use for directional information for the migration is a time-compensated sun compass (Froy et al., 2003Froy O. Gotter A.L. Casselman A.L. Reppert S.M.

A sun compass in monarch butterflies.Nature. 1997; 387: 29Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sun compass components involve the eye's sensing of skylight cues for direction and the brain integration of skylight-stimulated neural responses in the central complex, the presumed site of the sun compass (Heinze and Reppert, 2011Heinze S. Reppert S.M. Sun compass integration of skylight cues in migratory monarch butterflies.Neuron. 2011; 69: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sun compass output in brain is time compensated by the circadian clock that allows flight direction to be constantly adjusted to maintain a southerly flight direction. The genome of the commercial silkmoth Bombyx mori represents a publicly available lepidopteran genome (ISGC (International Silkworm Genome Consortium), 2008ISGC (International Silkworm Genome Consortium)The genome of a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Because moths are usually olfactory-centric and butterflies vision-centric, due in part to their respective nocturnal and diurnal behaviors, comparison of the genes involved in these sensory modalities may be informative. Here, we present the draft 273 Mb genome of the migratory monarch butterfly, including its assembly, a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes, and evolutionary analyses. We focus our gene annotation on gene families likely involved in major aspects of the seasonal migration. The biological interpretation of the monarch genome advances our understanding of the genes and regulatory elements important for the remarkable fall migration. We used a whole-genome shotgun approach with next-generation sequencing platforms to generate the draft genome of the monarch butterfly (Table 1 and Table S1 available online). The combined assembly of 14.7 Gb pairs of Illumina reads (equal to 53.3× coverage of the whole genome) and 6.2 Gb Roche 454 reads (22.3×) resulted in 273 megabases (Mb) of genomic sequence (combined total coverage of 74.7×) (Table S1A). This was termed the v1 assembly and was used for all subsequent analyses (Table S1B).

In comparison with the 432 Mb Bombyx genome (ISGC (International Silkworm Genome Consortium), 2008ISGC (International Silkworm Genome Consortium)The genome of a lepidopteran model insect, the silkworm Bombyx mori.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the monarch genome had much less repeat content (13.1% of the whole-genome versus 43.6% in Bombyx; Table S1E) and GC content (31.6% in the monarch versus 37.7% in Bombyx; Table S1F; Table 1). Like Bombyx and the beetle Tribolium castaneum, but unlike the honeybee Apis mellifera, GC content distribution was uniform but showed a bias of occurrence in coding regions (Figures S1A and S1B ). In addition, the distribution plots of CpG ratios (observed/expected CpG dinucleotide density) of the monarch, Bombyx, and Tribolium genomes clustered together, leaving Drosophila and A. mellifera with two different patterns (Figures S1C and S1D). These features are consistent with the fact that the monarch, Bombyx, and Tribolium each encode two types of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1 and Dnmt2), whereas Drosophila only has Dnmt2 and A. mellifera has Dnmt1-3 (Figure S1D). The monarch may thus have a Bombyx-like epigenetic system, with a predicted low methylation level (Xiang et al., 2010Xiang H. Zhu J. Chen Q. Dai F. Li X. Li M. Zhang H. Zhang G. Li D. Dong Y. et al.Single base-resolution methylome of the silkworm reveals a sparse epigenomic map.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We estimated 16,866 protein-coding genes (Table 1) by combining both homology-based and ab initio methods (Table S1G), along with ∼228× coverage of the monarch transcriptome. The gene model accounted for the full complement of conserved cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins genes (Marygold et al., 2007Marygold S.J. Roote J. Reuter G. Lambertsson A. Ashburner M. Millburn G.H. Harrison P.M. Yu Z. Kenmochi N. Kaufman T.C. et al.The ribosomal protein genes and Minute loci of Drosophila melanogaster.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R216Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), with only one pseudogene and two incomplete predictions (Table S1H), and matched 89.1% of 5,415 manually annotated exons (Table S1G). Nearly 85% of the predicted genes detected homology in the public databases (Table S1I). Moreover, more than 93% of the monarch genes were supported by our transcriptome sequence. These attributes show that the gene models were predicted with accuracy and completeness (Table 1). To understand the lepidopteran proteomes of the monarch and Bombyx in the context of other insect species, we compared the reported gene sets of twelve insects and two mammalian species (Figure 2A ). Orthology was then assigned according to the predicted evolutionary relationships. The monarch gene set contained 3,138 (18.6%) single-copy genes and 2,514 (14.9%) many-to-many universal genes, compared to 20.4% and 15.9%, respectively, for Bombyx. We found significant coverage bias of the transcriptome sequence for the monarch universal orthologs (Table S1J), indicating that they constitute a core set of proteins with conserved functions. Transcriptome coverage also showed a higher distribution of many-to-many universal orthologs than single-copy genes, indicating that the universal orthologs with duplication contributed greatly to basic biological processes compared to the contribution from duplication of recently evolved insect genes. To address lepidopteran-specific evolution, we identified 1,962 lepidopteran-specific orthologs, which was about twice the number of hymenopteran-specific orthologs and five times the number of dipteran-specific orthologs. In addition, the lepidopteran lineage lacked 223 orthologs that exist widely in other insects and in mammals. In comparison, there were 167 and 103 orthologs missing in the Diptera and Hymenoptera, respectively, suggesting that the Lepidoptera are more derived than the other insect orders. The Lepidoptera have rapidly evolved. The monarch and Bombyx shared 70.8% average amino acid identity between 8,221 1:1 orthologs (Figure 2B), comparable to two mosquitoes (69.4% for 6,875 Anopheles gambiae/Aedes aegypti orthologs) or bee-wasp identity (67.2% for 6,520 A. mellifera/Nasonia vitripennis orthologs) but significantly lower than such comparison between two ants (82.2% for 8,897 orthologs between Linepithema humile and Pogonomyrmex barbatus). Because all three of these genome pairs diverged at least 100 million years ago (Krzywinski et al., 2006Krzywinski J. Grushko O.G. Besansky N.J.

Engel M.S. Evolution of the Insects. Cambridge University Press, New York2005Google Scholar), the Lepidoptera appear to be the fastest evolving insect order sequenced to date. The monarch and Bombyx genomes exhibited a surprisingly high degree of microsynteny (Figure 2C). Approximately 80% of the monarch genes have identifiable Bombyx homologs, whereas less than 5% of the coexisting orthologs are duplicated in the monarch or Bombyx. According to the consensus gene order shared between the monarch and Bombyx, we successfully mapped 1,802 > 10 kb monarch scaffolds spanning 142.7 Mb of the genome to the corresponding Bombyx scaffolds. We found strong colinearity in most of the putative chromosomes except for the sex chromosome Z (Chr. 1 in Figure 2C). A total of 8,290 monarch genes (75% of 11,017 genes located in mapped scaffolds with Bombyx homology) were found in microsynteny blocks, versus 75% for A. gambiae and A. aegypti (Zdobnov and Bork, 2007Zdobnov E.M. Bork P. Quantification of insect genome divergence.Trends Genet. 2007; 23: 16-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and 63% for A. mellifera and N. vitripennis single-copy orthologs (Werren et al., 2010Werren J.H. Richards S. Desjardins C.A. Niehuis O. Gadau J. Colbourne J.K. Werren J.H. Richards S. Desjardins C.A. Niehuis O. et al.Nasonia Genome Working GroupFunctional and evolutionary insights from the genomes of three parasitoid Nasonia species.Science. 2010; 327: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude large-scale chromosomal rearrangements because of the lack of a monarch linkage map, the existent extensive microsynteny reveals that most regions of conserved gene neighborhood were retained after divergence. Comparison of protein family sizes also showed prominent similarities between the monarch and Bombyx, from the global view of proteome domain content (Figure S2). Only 17 InterPro (IPR)-defined families had significant size differences between the two Lepidoptera (Figure S2A), most of which were related to proteinase activity (Figure S2B). Interesting IPR expansions included insect pheromone-binding proteins in the monarch and insulin-like peptides in Bombyx (Figure S2B). The major contribution to the lepidopteran phenotypic changes was also apparent by comparing the IPR family size of the Lepidoptera with Drosophila or Tribolium (Figure S2C). Overall, most IPR families that exhibited variation have general functions involved in transcriptional regulation, protein interactions, and cell-cell communication. We also compared the evolutionary rate between the monarch and Bombyx based on amino acid substitutions, using Drosophila as a common outgroup. The results showed that the monarch shares similar sequence identity with Bombyx in 1:1 orthologs (50.4% versus 50.7%). This analysis suggests that the ∼5,000 year of human domestication of the silkworm (Xiang, 1995Xiang Z. Genetics And Breeding Of The Silkworm. Chinese Agriculture Press, Beijing, PR China1995Google Scholar) has not had a strong influence on the overall evolutionary rate of nonselected traits in Bombyx. We began our manual annotation by focusing on genes involved in the formation and function of visual input into the sun compass system (Figure 3A ). In migrating monarchs, the horizontal position of the sun (solar azimuth) and the derived polarized skylight pattern provide directional cues for the sun compass (Heinze and Reppert, 2011Heinze S. Reppert S.M. Sun compass integration of skylight cues in migratory monarch butterflies.Neuron. 2011; 69: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The solar azimuth is likely sensed by the main retina, whereas polarized light is sensed by the specialized dorsal rim area, a small region of the compound eye anatomically specialized for sensing the angle of plane-polarized skylight (Labhart and Meyer, 1999Labhart T. Meyer E.P. Detectors for polarized skylight in insects: a survey of ommatidial specializations in the dorsal rim area of the compound eye.Microsc. Res.

In the monarch butterfly genome, we identified orthologs of most genes involved in eye development in Drosophila (Table S2A) with some notable differences. For development of the main retina, only two genes were not detected in either the monarch or Bombyx. The lens crystalline protein Drosocrystallin, which is restricted to the Diptera, was predictably missing from the two Lepidoptera. The other missing gene was phyllopod, which is involved in photoreceptor cell fate commitment. Of the 53 genes examined, seven are duplicated in Drosophila and none in either the monarch or Bombyx, supporting less genetic complexity in the Lepidoptera eye. Many of the genes necessary for the formation of the dorsal rim area in Drosophila are present in the monarch butterfly genome, including two counterparts of homothorax (both also present in Bombyx), a transcription factor that is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the fly dorsal rim (Table S2A) (Wernet et al., 2003Wernet M.F. Labhart T. Baumann F. Mazzoni E.O. Pichaud F. Desplan C. Homothorax switches function of Drosophila photoreceptors from color to polarized light sensors.Cell. 2003; 115: 267-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, members of the spalt-related and the iroC gene families that are involved in Drosophila dorsal rim formation were not found in either the monarch or Bombyx. The one duplication and two gene contractions in the two Lepidoptera genomes suggest a modified pattern of dorsal rim development from that in Drosophila. In contrast to eye development, there were interesting differences in the genes involved in phototransduction between the monarch and Bombyx (Table S2B). The majority of the genes involved in phototransduction in Drosophila were present in the monarch butterfly genome (Table S2B). However, there were duplications of five genes in the monarch only. Most paralogs exhibited lower expression than their counterpart (Table S2B), suggesting that these duplications are relatively recent. Because these duplications were not found in either Bombyx or Drosophila, the monarch-specific expansions may be involved in the phototransduction mechanisms for sensing skylight cues. In addition to the monarch butterfly genes encoding each of the three major opsin subfamilies (ultraviolet, blue, and long-wavelength) previously identified (Sauman et al., 2005Sauman I. Briscoe A.D. Zhu H. Shi D. Froy O. Stalleicken J. Yuan Q. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. Connecting the navigational clock to sun compass input in monarch butterfly brain.Neuron. 2005; 46: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found a monarch gene encoding a vertebrate-like opsin called pteropsin in A. mellifera (Velarde et al., 2005Velarde R.A. Sauer C.D. Walden K.K. Fahrbach S.E. Robertson H.M. Pteropsin: a vertebrate-like non-visual opsin expressed in the honey bee brain.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Figure 3B and Table S2B). Further examination of other insect genomes revealed its presence in Bombyx, mosquitoes, Tribolium, and several Hymenoptera (but not all) beyond A. mellifera (Figure 3B), suggesting that this putative light-detecting system is widespread in insects. Interestingly, a sea urchin ortholog was recently shown to play a role in photosensitive larval swimming vertical migration (Ooka et al., 2010Ooka S. Katow T. Yaguchi S. Yaguchi J. Katow H. Spatiotemporal expression pattern of an encephalopsin orthologue of the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus during early development, and its potential role in larval vertical migration.Dev. Growth Differ. 2010; 52: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The central neuronal processing of skylight cues in the monarch occurs in the central complex, the sun compass structure in central brain (Heinze and Reppert, 2011Heinze S. Reppert S.M. Sun compass integration of skylight cues in migratory monarch butterflies.Neuron. 2011; 69: 345-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). With some exceptions, most of the proteins encoding Drosophila genes in which mutations lead to altered structure of the central complex and/or locomotion defects were present in the monarch genome (Table S3). There were no lepidopteran homologs of tay bridge, whose loss causes defects in the protocerebral bridge, and polyhomeotic, a complex locus encoding two transcription factors that are part of the Polycomb group involved in segment identity. There were lepidopteran expansions in fused lobes, which encodes a hexosaminidase involved in N-glycan processing, and SNF4, which encodes an AMP-activated protein kinase gamma subunit. Many of the Drosophila genes whose mutations cause central complex defects have broad developmental defects. Nonetheless, the identified set of monarch orthologs and paralogs provides a starting point for more extensive analyses of the sun compass complex network and its development. Several peptides (including tachykinins, allostatins, pyrokinin, and neuropeptide F) and neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin and GABA) have been identified by immunocytochemistry in the central complex of locusts (Homberg, 2002Homberg U. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the brain of the locust.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 56: 189-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), grasshoppers (Herbert et al., 2010Herbert Z.

Neurol. 2011; 519: 290-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that are likely to be important for neural function and circuitry. We annotated monarch genes that encode orthologs of the vast majority of neuropeptides, polypeptides (Table S4A), and the enzymes involved in biogenic amine synthesis (Table S4B) that are collectively used for neural signaling. There was good agreement between these neural signaling molecules and their corresponding G protein-coupled receptors (Tables S4C and S4D). Specific antibodies can now be developed to map the molecular substrates for central complex neural signaling. Circadian clocks and their output pathways play an essential role in migratory processes (Figure 3A). Circadian clocks located in the antennae provide time compensation for the sun compass system (Merlin et al., 2009Merlin C. Gegear R.J. Reppert S.M. Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies.Science. 2009; 325: 1700-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, brain clocks located in the pars lateralis of central brain are likely involved in initiating the migratory generation by sensing decreasing day length in the fall (Goehring and Oberhauser, 2002Goehring L. Oberhauser K.S. Effects of photoperiod, temperature, and host plant age on induction of reproductive diapause and development time in Danaus plexippus.Ecol.

Navigational mechanisms of migrating monarch butterflies.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In Drosophila and mammals, the clock mechanism is comprised of a core negative transcriptional feedback loop, which drives self-sustaining rhythms of essential clock components, and a modulatory, interlocking second feedback loop (Allada and Chung, 2010Allada R. Chung B.Y. Circadian organization of behavior and physiology in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Reppert and Weaver, 2002Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). The monarch genome contained the components of both loops (Figure 3C and Table S5). The monarch core feedback loop possesses all the critical clock genes found in Drosophila—clock (clk), cycle (cyc), period (per), timeless (tim), and type-1 cryptochrome (designated cry1) —but differs in that it also possesses a type-2 vertebrate-like cry (cry2), previously shown to encode the main transcriptional repressor in the monarch clock (Zhu et al., 2008bZhu H. Sauman I. Yuan Q. Casselman A. Emery-Le M. Emery P. Reppert S.M. Cryptochromes define a novel circadian clock mechanism in monarch butterflies that may underlie sun compass navigation.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), a function fulfilled by per in Drosophila (Allada and Chung, 2010Allada R. Chung B.Y. Circadian organization of behavior and physiology in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 605-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), which does not possess cry2. We also identified genes encoding orthologs of all of the major proteins involved in posttranslational modifications of the core clock proteins (PER and TIM) (Figure 3C). We further identified the major components of a Drosophila-like secondary clock feedback loop in the monarch. This included genes encoding orthologs of VRILLE and PDP1, the major regulators of CLK transcription in Drosophila (Cyran et al., 2003Cyran S.A. Buchsbaum A.M. Reddy K.L. Lin M.C. Glossop N.R.

Most lines were analyzed at an early and late passage. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed that they included representatives of most major ethnic groups. Most lines remained karyotypically normal, but there was a progressive tendency to acquire changes on prolonged culture, commonly affecting chromosomes 1, 12, 17 and 20. DNA methylation patterns changed haphazardly with no link to time in culture. Structural variants, determined from the SNP arrays, also appeared sporadically. No common variants related to culture were observed on chromosomes 1, 12 and 17, but a minimal amplicon in chromosome 20q11.21, including three genes expressed in human ES cells, ID1, BCL2L1 and HM13, occurred in >20% of the lines. Of these genes, BCL2L1 is a strong candidate for driving culture adaptation of ES cells."

Among the key players, Hoxd genes are coordinately regulated in developing digits, where they help organize growth and patterns. We identified the distal regulatory sites associated with these genes by probing the three-dimensional architecture of this regulatory unit in developing limbs. This approach, combined with in vivo deletions of distinct regulatory regions, revealed that the active part of the gene cluster contacts several enhancer-like sequences. These elements are dispersed throughout the nearby gene desert, and each contributes either quantitatively or qualitatively to Hox gene transcription in presumptive digits. We propose that this genetic system, which we call a “regulatory archipelago,” provides an inherent flexibility that may partly underlie the diversity in number and morphology of digits across tetrapods, as well as their resilience to drastic variations.PaperFlickhttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/b21b45e2-71ea-4ac1-9aaf-a446fa2b48e0/mmc2.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 11.59 MB) Download video"

We have investigated the functional organization of the mammalian ERAD system using a systems-level strategy that integrates proteomics, functional genomics and the transcriptional response to ER stress. This analysis supports an adaptive organization for the mammalian ERAD machinery and reveals a number of metazoan-specific genes not previously linked to ERAD."

https://openalex.org/W2120269671,"DNA polymerases contain two cysteine-rich metal binding motifs (CysA and CysB), which have been assigned as zinc-ion binding sites by structural studies. A combination of biochemical and spectroscopic techniques reveal that the CysB site of yeast B-family polymerases binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is essential for polymerase function. The eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases (Pol α, δ and ɛ) and the major DNA mutagenesis enzyme Pol ζ contain two conserved cysteine-rich metal-binding motifs (CysA and CysB) in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of their catalytic subunits. Here we demonstrate by in vivo and in vitro approaches the presence of an essential [4Fe-4S] cluster in the CysB motif of all four yeast B-family DNA polymerases. Loss of the [4Fe-4S] cofactor by cysteine ligand mutagenesis in Pol3 destabilized the CTD and abrogated interaction with the Pol31 and Pol32 subunits. Reciprocally, overexpression of accessory subunits increased the amount of the CTD-bound Fe-S cluster. This implies an important physiological role of the Fe-S cluster in polymerase complex stabilization. Further, we demonstrate that the Zn-binding CysA motif is required for PCNA-mediated Pol δ processivity. Together, our findings show that the function of eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerases crucially depends on different metallocenters for accessory subunit recruitment and replisome stability."

In mouse intestinal crypts, lineage-tracing studies indicated that different genes uniquely mark spatially distinct stem-cell populations, residing either at crypt bases or at position +4, but a detailed analysis of their spatial co-expression has not been feasible. Here we apply three-colour single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization to study a comprehensive panel of intestinal stem-cell markers during homeostasis, ageing and regeneration. We find that the expression of all markers overlaps at crypt-base cells. This co-expression includes Lgr5, Bmi1 and mTert, genes previously suggested to mark distinct stem cells. Strikingly, Dcamkl1 tuft cells, distributed throughout the crypt axis, co-express Lgr5 and other stem-cell markers that are otherwise confined to crypt bases. We also detect significant changes in the expression of some of the markers following irradiation, indicating their potential role in the regeneration process. Our approach can enable the sensitive detection of putative stem cells in other tissues and in tumours, guiding complementary functional studies to evaluate their stem-cell properties."

We show that the viral silencing agents, viRNAs, are transgenerationally transmitted in a template-independent manner and work in trans to silence viral genomes present in animals that are deficient in producing their own viRNAs. These results provide evidence for the transgenerational inheritance of an acquired trait, induced by the exposure of animals to a specific, biologically relevant physiological challenge.

https://openalex.org/W1997853510,"Chromatin reorganization is governed by multiple post-translational modifications of chromosomal proteins and DNA. These histone modifications are reversible, dynamic events that can regulate DNA-driven cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate histone modification patterns remain largely unknown. In metazoans, reversible protein modification by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is catalysed by two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). However, the significance of GlcNAcylation in chromatin reorganization remains elusive. Here we report that histone H2B is GlcNAcylated at residue S112 by OGT in vitro and in living cells. Histone GlcNAcylation fluctuated in response to extracellular glucose through the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP). H2B S112 GlcNAcylation promotes K120 monoubiquitination, in which the GlcNAc moiety can serve as an anchor for a histone H2B ubiquitin ligase. H2B S112 GlcNAc was localized to euchromatic areas on fly polytene chromosomes. In a genome-wide analysis, H2B S112 GlcNAcylation sites were observed widely distributed over chromosomes including transcribed gene loci, with some sites co-localizing with H2B K120 monoubiquitination. These findings suggest that H2B S112 GlcNAcylation is a histone modification that facilitates H2BK120 monoubiquitination, presumably for transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077490433,"Immune homeostasis in tissues is achieved through a delicate balance between pathogenic T-cell responses directed at tissue-specific antigens and the ability of the tissue to inhibit these responses. The mechanisms by which tissues and the immune system communicate to establish and maintain immune homeostasis are currently unknown. Clinical evidence suggests that chronic or repeated exposure to self antigen within tissues leads to an attenuation of pathological autoimmune responses, possibly as a means to mitigate inflammatory damage and preserve function. Many human organ-specific autoimmune diseases are characterized by the initial presentation of the disease being the most severe, with subsequent flares being of lesser severity and duration. In fact, these diseases often spontaneously resolve, despite persistent tissue autoantigen expression. In the practice of antigen-specific immunotherapy, allergens or self antigens are repeatedly injected in the skin, with a diminution of the inflammatory response occurring after each successive exposure. Although these findings indicate that tissues acquire the ability to attenuate autoimmune reactions upon repeated responses to antigens, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here we show that upon expression of self antigen in a peripheral tissue, thymus-derived regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) become activated, proliferate and differentiate into more potent suppressors, which mediate resolution of organ-specific autoimmunity in mice. After resolution of the inflammatory response, activated T(reg) cells are maintained in the target tissue and are primed to attenuate subsequent autoimmune reactions when antigen is re-expressed. Thus, T(reg) cells function to confer 'regulatory memory' to the target tissue. These findings provide a framework for understanding how T(reg) cells respond when exposed to self antigen in peripheral tissues and offer mechanistic insight into how tissues regulate autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2134443458,"Microtubules are dynamic filaments whose ends alternate between periods of slow growth and rapid shortening as they explore intracellular space and move organelles. A key question is how regulatory proteins modulate catastrophe, the conversion from growth to shortening. To study this process, we reconstituted microtubule dynamics in the absence and presence of the kinesin-8 Kip3 and the kinesin-13 MCAK. Surprisingly, we found that, even in the absence of the kinesins, the microtubule catastrophe frequency depends on the age of the microtubule, indicating that catastrophe is a multistep process. Kip3 slowed microtubule growth in a length-dependent manner and increased the rate of aging. In contrast, MCAK eliminated the aging process. Thus, both kinesins are catastrophe factors; Kip3 mediates fine control of microtubule length by narrowing the distribution of maximum lengths prior to catastrophe, whereas MCAK promotes rapid restructuring of the microtubule cytoskeleton by making catastrophe a first-order random process."

One of the most common MeCP2 mutations associated with RTT occurs at threonine 158, converting it to methionine (T158M) or alanine (T158A). To understand the role of T158 mutations in the pathogenesis of RTT, we generated knockin mice that recapitulate the MeCP2 T158A mutation. We found a causal role for T158A mutation in the development of RTT-like phenotypes, including developmental regression, motor dysfunction, and learning and memory deficits. These phenotypes resemble those present in Mecp2 null mice and manifest through a reduction in MeCP2 binding to methylated DNA and a decrease in MeCP2 protein stability. The age-dependent development of event-related neuronal responses was disrupted by MeCP2 mutation, suggesting that impaired neuronal circuitry underlies the pathogenesis of RTT and that assessment of event-related potentials (ERPs) may serve as a biomarker for RTT and treatment evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2029269187,"The TORC1 kinase signaling complex is a key determinant of cell growth that senses nutritional status and responds by coordinating diverse cellular processes including transcription, translation, and autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that TORC1 modulates the composition of plasma membrane (PM) proteins by regulating ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis. The mechanism involves the Npr1 kinase, a negative regulator of endocytosis that is itself negatively regulated by TORC1. We show that Npr1 inhibits the activity of Art1, an arrestin-like adaptor protein that promotes endocytosis by targeting the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase to specific PM cargoes. Npr1 antagonizes Art1-mediated endocytosis via N-terminal phosphorylation, a modification that prevents Art1 association with the PM. Thus, our study adds ubiquitin ligase targeting and control of endocytosis to the known effector mechanisms of TORC1, underscoring how TORC1 coordinates ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis with protein synthesis and autophagy in order to regulate cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2065840120,"Wound healing involves a transient regeneration of tissue, but, if this process continues unabated, pathology occurs in the form of fibrosis, which can prevent normal organ function and even death. Derek Mann and his colleagues have found that serotonin-responsive profibrogenic hepatic stellate cells inhibit the growth of neighboring liver cells during the termination phase of liver injury. They also found that inhibiting serotonin signaling during established disease improved liver fibrosis in various mouse models of liver injury. Tissue homeostasis requires an effective, limited wound-healing response to injury. In chronic disease, failure to regenerate parenchymal tissue leads to the replacement of lost cellular mass with a fibrotic matrix. The mechanisms that dictate the balance of cell regeneration and fibrogenesis are not well understood1. Here we report that fibrogenic hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the liver are negative regulators of hepatocyte regeneration. This negative regulatory function requires stimulation of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B receptor (5-HT2B) on HSCs by serotonin, which activates expression of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), a powerful suppressor of hepatocyte proliferation, through signaling by mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK) and the transcription factor JunD. Selective antagonism of 5-HT2B enhanced hepatocyte growth in models of acute and chronic liver injury. We also observed similar effects in mice lacking 5-HT2B or JunD or upon selective depletion of HSCs in wild-type mice. Antagonism of 5-HT2B attenuated fibrogenesis and improved liver function in disease models in which fibrosis was pre-established and progressive. Pharmacological targeting of 5-HT2B is clinically safe in humans and may be therapeutic in chronic liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2153685501,"SNAREs provide a large part of the specificity and energy needed for membrane fusion and, to do so, must be localized to their correct membranes.

X-ray crystallography shows that the N-terminal halves of their SNARE motifs bind the CALM(ANTH) domain as helices in a manner that mimics SNARE complex formation. Mutation of residues in the CALM:SNARE interface inhibits binding in vitro and prevents R-SNARE endocytosis in vivo. Thus, CALM:R-SNARE interactions ensure that R-SNAREs, required for the fusion of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles with endosomes and also for subsequent postendosomal trafficking, are sorted into endocytic vesicles. CALM's role in directing the endocytosis of small R-SNAREs may provide insight into the association of CALM/PICALM mutations with growth retardation, cognitive defects, and Alzheimer's disease."

Because of the difficulty in following EMT processes in human tumors, we have developed and characterized an animal model with transplantable human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-468) uniquely showing spontaneous EMT events to occur. Using vimentin as a marker of EMT, heterogeneity was revealed in the primary MDA-MB-468 xenografts with vimentin-negative and vimentin-positive areas, as also observed on clinical human invasive breast tumor specimens. Reverse transcriptase–PCR after microdissection of these populations from the xenografts revealed EMT traits in the vimentin-positive zones characterized by enhanced ‘mesenchymal gene’ expression (Snail, Slug and fibroblast-specific protein-1) and diminished expression of epithelial molecules (E-cadherin, ZO-3 and JAM-A). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were detected in the blood as soon as 8 days after s.c. injection, and lung metastases developed in all animals injected as examined by in vivo imaging analyses and histology. High levels of vimentin RNA were detected in CTCs by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR as well as, to a lesser extent, Snail and Slug RNA. Von Willebrand Factor/vimentin double immunostainings further showed that tumor cells in vascular tumoral emboli all expressed vimentin. Tumoral emboli in the lungs also expressed vimentin whereas macrometastases displayed heterogenous vimentin expression, as seen in the primary xenografts. In conclusion, our data uniquely demonstrate in an in vivo context that EMT occurs in the primary tumors, and associates with an enhanced ability to intravasate and generate CTCs. They further suggest that mesenchymal-to-epithelial phenomena occur in secondary organs, facilitating the metastatic growth."
https://openalex.org/W1995799489,"The authors show that the transcription factor UNC-3 acts via a common cis element to regulate the battery of genes that confer cholinergic identity on a subset of motor neurons in the nematode. This study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which the coordination of genetic programs acts to specify neuronal subtypes. Cholinergic motor neurons are defined by the coexpression of a battery of genes encoding proteins that act sequentially to synthesize, package and degrade acetylcholine and reuptake its breakdown product, choline. How expression of these critical motor neuron identity determinants is controlled and coordinated is not understood. We show here that, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, all members of the cholinergic gene battery, as well as many other markers of terminal motor neuron fate, are co-regulated by a shared cis-regulatory signature and a common trans-acting factor, the phylogenetically conserved COE (Collier, Olf, EBF)-type transcription factor UNC-3. UNC-3 initiated and maintained expression of cholinergic fate markers and was sufficient to induce cholinergic fate in other neuron types. UNC-3 furthermore operated in negative feedforward loops to induce the expression of transcription factors that repress individual UNC-3-induced terminal fate markers, resulting in diversification of motor neuron differentiation programs in specific motor neuron subtypes. A chordate ortholog of UNC-3, Ciona intestinalis COE, was also both required and sufficient for inducing a cholinergic fate. Thus, UNC-3 is a terminal selector for cholinergic motor neuron differentiation whose function is conserved across phylogeny."

https://openalex.org/W2086564940,"The peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)γ pathway is involved in cancer, but it appears to have both tumor suppressor and oncogenic functions. In neuroblastoma cells, miR-27b targets the 3' untranslated region of PPARγ and inhibits its mRNA and protein expression. miR-27b overexpression or PPARγ inhibition blocks cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in mouse xenografts. PPARγ activates expression of the pH regulator NHE1, which is associated with tumor progression. Lastly, miR-27b through PPARγ regulates nuclear factor-κB activity and transcription of inflammatory target genes. Thus, in neuroblastoma, miR-27b functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the tumor-promoting function of PPARγ, which triggers an increased inflammatory response. In contrast, in breast cancer cells, PPARγ inhibits NHE1 expression and the inflammatory response, and it functions as a tumor suppressor. We suggest that the ability of PPARγ to promote or suppress tumor formation is linked to cell type-specific differences in regulation of NHE1 and other target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2159006092,"The NMR structure of the murine leukaemia virus recoding translational signal is determined, giving insight into the mechanism of read-through in retroviruses. Retroviruses express their polymerase (Pol) and structural (Gag) proteins from a single Gag–Pol transcript during virus assembly. Although Gag can be translated on its own, Pol is produced only as a Gag–Pol fusion through recoding, a tightly controlled process involving bypass of the Gag stop codon. Victoria D'Souza and colleagues have now determined the NMR structure of the murine leukaemia virus recoding signal, a cis-acting 63-nucleotide pseudoknotted RNA, with a view to understanding how this readthrough occurs. The structure and functional data show that the RNA signal is maintained in two conformations at a ratio that correlates with the readthrough frequency. The RNA forms an equilibrium-based, protonation-dependent switch that toggles between the two conformations to maintain the required ratio. Most retroviruses require translational recoding of a viral messenger RNA stop codon to maintain a precise ratio of structural (Gag) and enzymatic (Pol) proteins during virus assembly1,2. Pol is expressed exclusively as a Gag–Pol fusion either by ribosomal frameshifting or by read-through of the gag stop codon3. Both of these mechanisms occur infrequently and only affect 5–10% of translating ribosomes, allowing the virus to maintain the critical Gag to Gag–Pol ratio4,5,6,7,8. Although it is understood that the frequency of the recoding event is regulated by cis RNA motifs, no mechanistic explanation is currently available for how the critical protein ratio is maintained. Here we present the NMR structure of the murine leukaemia virus recoding signal and show that a protonation-dependent switch occurs to induce the active conformation. The equilibrium is such that at physiological pH the active, read-through permissive conformation is populated at approximately 6%: a level that correlates with in vivo protein quantities.

It is thought that protein aggregates are cleared from the bud via actin cable-based retrograde transport toward the mother and that Bni1p formin regulates this transport. Here, we examined the dynamics of Hsp104-associated protein aggregates by video microscopy, particle tracking, and image correlation analysis. We show that protein aggregates undergo random walk without directional bias. Clearance of heat-induced aggregates from the bud does not depend on formin proteins but occurs mostly through dissolution via Hsp104p chaperon. Aggregates formed naturally in aged cells also exhibit random walk but do not dissolve during observation. Although our data do not disagree with a role for actin or cell polarity in aggregate segregation, modeling suggests that their asymmetric inheritance can be a predictable outcome of aggregates' slow diffusion and the geometry of yeast cells.

Heat-induced aggregates undergo random motion, not actin-based retrograde flow Hsp104p chaperon clears heat aggregates in the bud through dissolution Actin, not formin, contributes to dissolution and motion of heat aggregates Aggregates may be retained in aged mothers due to slow diffusion and cell geometry. Budding yeast cells divide asymmetrically to generate a new cell with full proliferative potential and an aging mother cell that can be anywhere along a finite replicative life span (20–30 cell divisions under standard laboratory conditions) (Mortimer and Johnston, 1959Mortimer R.K. Johnston J.R. Life span of individual yeast cells.Nature. 1959; 183: 1751-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This asymmetry in replicative age is correlated with an unequal segregation of aging determinants along the axis of cell polarity in a dividing yeast cell (Egilmez and Jazwinski, 1989Egilmez N.K.

One class of such aging determinants is aggregates formed by damaged proteins. A seminal study demonstrated that aggregates containing carbonylated proteins, which result from oxidative damage in aging cells, are preferentially retained by the mother during bud formation and cell division (Aguilaniu et al., 2003Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T. Asymmetric inheritance of oxidatively damaged proteins during cytokinesis.Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Such asymmetric segregation of damaged proteins appears to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton (Aguilaniu et al., 2003Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nyström T.

In a recent study (Liu et al., 2010Liu B. Larsson L. Caballero A. Hao X. Oling D. Grantham J. Nyström T. The polarisome is required for segregation and retrograde transport of protein aggregates.Cell. 2010; 140: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), segregation of protein aggregates was studied using a model system in which heat-induced protein aggregates were labeled with GFP-tagged Hsp104p, a hexameric AAA ATPase-based chaperon known to play a major role in the modification and dissolution of heat-denatured protein aggregates (Parsell et al., 1994Parsell D.A.

This study implicated several proteins that control the assembly of actin cables, most notably the formin family actin-nucleating protein Bni1p, in the segregation of Hsp104-containing protein aggregates. Actin cables are parallel bundles of actin filaments (F-actin), best known for their role in polarized trafficking of membrane and cell wall materials and organelles during polarized growth (Pruyne et al., 2004Pruyne D. Legesse-Miller A. Gao L. Dong Y. Bretscher A. Mechanisms of polarized growth and organelle segregation in yeast.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 559-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). During the early stage of bud growth, actin cables are nucleated from Bni1p localized at the tip of the nascent bud (Evangelista et al., 2002Evangelista M. Pruyne D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Formins direct Arp2/3-independent actin filament assembly to polarize cell growth in yeast.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, Sagot et al., 2002Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. An actin nucleation mechanism mediated by Bni1 and profilin.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Elongation of actin filaments at their barbed ends generates a retrograde flow of actin subunits in the mother-bound direction (Yang and Pon, 2002Yang H.C. Pon L.A. Actin cable dynamics in budding yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the Hsp104p-containing protein aggregates associate with actin cables, possibly through a direct interaction of Hsp104p with actin, and ride along the retrograde flow to clear from the bud prior to cell division (Liu et al., 2010Liu B. Larsson L. Caballero A. Hao X. Oling D. Grantham J. Nyström T. The polarisome is required for segregation and retrograde transport of protein aggregates.Cell. 2010; 140: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Supporting this model, time-lapse movies were presented showing movement of single aggregates in the bud across the bud neck into the mother compartment. A polarized array of actin cables exists during the part of the cell cycle when the cell undergoes rapid polarized growth, but after mitotic entry, the actin organization becomes isotropic (Adams and Pringle, 1984Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. Relationship of actin and tubulin distribution to bud growth in wild-type and morphogenetic-mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, Lew and Reed, 1995Lew D.J. Reed S.I. Cell cycle control of morphogenesis in budding yeast.Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an initial question motivating our study was how mitotic cells might rely on the actin retrograde flow to clear protein aggregates from the bud prior to cytokinesis. We used live imaging to observe the dynamics and movement of Hsp104p-containing protein aggregates. Surprisingly, we found a lack of defined directionality in aggregate movement during budding or other cell-cycle stages. Instead, heat-induced aggregates exhibit random walk and are largely cleared from the bud via Hsp104p ATPase-dependent dissolution. Interestingly, whereas actin depolymerization reduced aggregate random movement and the rate of dissolution, formin proteins do not play any detectable positive role in these events. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative model to explain the asymmetric inheritance of protein aggregates during yeast asymmetric cell division. We used the same approach as described (Liu et al., 2010Liu B. Larsson L. Caballero A. Hao X. Oling D. Grantham J. Nyström T. The polarisome is required for segregation and retrograde transport of protein aggregates.Cell. 2010; 140: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to observe the dynamics of protein aggregates in live yeast cells. In brief, protein aggregates were induced with a short (30 min) heat shock at 42°C and visualized with Hsp104-GFP. As in Liu et al., we used the HSP104-GFP strain from the yeast genome-wide GFP-tagged strain collection (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar), in which GFP was introduced at the 3′ end of the HSP104 open reading frame in the genome of the S288c strain BY4741. After a brief recovery at 30°C following the heat shock, the cells were imaged by acquiring three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse confocal movies (see Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figure 1A and Movie S1 available online, the majority of protein aggregates were motile in both the mother and the bud at all cell-cycle stages. Most aggregate movements were confined within the bud or the mother, but bud-to-mother (B > M) or mother-to-bud (M > B) translocation of the aggregates could be observed at low frequencies with a slight bias in the M > B direction (Figures 1B–1E and Movies S2A and S2B). Quantification of B > M and M > B movements in small-budded cells (bud diameter equal to or less than 1/3 of that of mother, indicating the stage of polarized growth) revealed no directional bias in aggregate motility (Figures 1F and 1G). To quantitatively characterize aggregate movement, we performed automated tracking of individual aggregates (Experimental Procedures) (Figure 2A , left, and Movie S3). The mean square displacement (MSD) averaged from 1,068 traces showed that the aggregate movement can be approximated as random walk with a small amount of confinement (Figure 2B). For pure random walk (diffusion), one expects a linear relationship between MSD and time shift (MSD(τ) = 4Dτα, wherein α = 1), whereas confinement (subdiffusion) results in a downward trending relationship (α < 1) and transport (superdiffusion) results in an upward trending relationship (α > 1). Simulations of random walk based on the observed trajectory lengths showed overall similar trajectory profiles as those observed experimentally, including the occasional more linear trajectories (Figure 2A, right, compared to left). As it is possible that a small fraction of transport (or superdiffusion) may be obscured by averaging, we performed 5,000 simulations of aggregate movement, with the diffusion coefficient and trajectory length distribution similar to those observed in yeast cells for three scenarios: (1) pure random walk; (2) random walk with 10% superdiffusion; and (3) random walk with 30% subdiffusion. The distribution of α values for each population was compared to the experimentally observed distributions (Figure 2C). This analysis found that the experimentally observed distribution matches the shape of the predicted distribution from scenario (3), indicating that the experimental data are consistent with a model that does not include transport. Quantification of α values in small-budded cells showed that the mode of aggregate motility at this cell-cycle stage is indistinguishable from that of the entire population (Figure 2D). To ensure that the Hsp104-GFP-expressing strain in our collection had not accumulated random mutations that might disrupt the normal behavior of protein aggregates, we obtained and tested the Hsp104-GFP strain used in the previous work (Liu et al., 2010Liu B. Larsson L. Caballero A. Hao X. Oling D. Grantham J. Nyström T. The polarisome is required for segregation and retrograde transport of protein aggregates.Cell. 2010; 140: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This strain showed the same aggregate behavior as our Hsp104-GFP strain (Movie S4 and Figures 3A and 3B ). We also reconstructed a new Hsp104-GFP strain by genomic tagging of HSP104 in the BY4741 parental wild-type strain. Observation of protein aggregate movement using this strain was again consistent with the above two strains (data not shown). Aside from the random motion of the protein aggregates described above, another apparent behavior of the aggregates is their dissolution: during the initial segment of the movies (up to ∼20 min), the aggregates grew slightly brighter but then underwent gradual reduction in brightness and number during the rest of the 1–1.5 hr movies (Figure 4A , arrow, and Movie S5). Near the end of the movies, most buds, which had fewer aggregates initially, were cleared of aggregates by this means, whereas the mothers had drastically reduced number of aggregates compared to the initial amounts. By acquiring serial confocal slices spanning the entire Z dimension of cells in these movies, we could rule out the possibility that aggregate disappearance was due to movement out of the focal plane. Concomitant with aggregate dissolution, the diffuse cytosolic GFP level rose likely as a result of release of free Hsp104-GFP (Figure 4A). This observation is consistent with the previously reported role for Hsp104 in dissolving heat-induced aggregates (Parsell et al., 1994Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Protein disaggregation mediated by heat-shock protein Hsp104.Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, Glover and Lindquist, 1998Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Sci. 2009; 34: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of dissolution to aggregate clearance from the bud relative to that from B > M movement, we quantified the likelihood of these events from the time-lapse movies. As shown in Figure 4B, in ∼96% of the cells observed, aggregate clearance (defined as disappearance of the last aggregate) from the bud occurred via dissolution (white bar), whereas only ∼4% of cells lost their last aggregate by B > M movement (gray bar). Furthermore, in nearly all cases of the latter, the observed B > M movement was a single such event per cell, before which most of the aggregates in the bud were cleared already via dissolution. As previously reported (Liu et al., 2010Liu B. Larsson L. Caballero A. Hao X. Oling D. Grantham J. Nyström T. The polarisome is required for segregation and retrograde transport of protein aggregates.Cell. 2010; 140: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we also observed fusion of colliding aggregates in both mother and the bud (Figure 4A, arrowhead, and Movie S5), and large aggregates could sometimes be observed to split into smaller aggregates (data not shown). We next tested the possibility that the observed aggregate dissolution is a result of the Hsp104p chaperon activity by using a mutation, hsp104Y662A, that does not affect Hsp104p binding to protein aggregates but disrupts the refolding activity of Hsp104p (Lum et al., 2004Lum R. Tkach J.M. Vierling E. Glover J.R. Evidence for an unfolding/threading mechanism for protein disaggregation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp104.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29139-29146Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A strain was constructed in which the genomic copy of HSP104 was replaced with hsp104Y662A-GFP. This mutant strain exhibited more aggregates than the wild-type immediately after heat shock, and the aggregates in the mutant did not show any dissolution throughout the 3 hr time-lapse movie (Figure 4C and Movie S6A). In fact, quantification showed that the aggregates in hsp104Y662A-GFP strain continued to increase in their intensity (Figure 3C). This observation is consistent with the notion that the Hsp104p chaperon activity plays a major role in protein disaggregation in yeast (Parsell et al., 1994Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Protein disaggregation mediated by heat-shock protein Hsp104.Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, Glover and Lindquist, 1998Glover J.R.

Sci. 2009; 34: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We observed that, in addition to a lack of dissolution, the movement of protein aggregates was largely abolished in hsp104Y662A-GFP cells (Movie S6A). As this reduced movement could possibly be due to overcrowding of the aggregates in the mutant cells, we performed another experiment by subjecting the mutant cells to a much shorter (3.5 min) heat shock, which results in an aggregate density similar to that in wild-type cells. In these cells, the aggregates still did not dissolve but did exhibit some motility (Movie S6B). Quantification from particle tracking data confirmed that the diffusion coefficient (D) for aggregates in the hsp104Y662A mutant was reduced compared to the wild-type (Figure 3D). This observation suggests that the Hsp104p ATPase activity plays a role in the movement of the aggregates. We next examined the involvement of F-actin in aggregate movement and dissolution by treating cells with latrunculin A (LatA), an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Cells were first subjected to the aforementioned protocol of 30 min heat shock and a brief recovery and then incubated with 100 μM LatA. Time-lapse imaging started 10 min after LatA addition, at which time most of the cellular actin filaments were undetectable by fluorescent phalloidin staining (Figure S1), and the drug was present throughout the subsequent time-lapse imaging. LatA treatment significantly reduced, though did not completely abolish, the diffusion coefficient (D) of protein aggregates (Figure 3D and Movie S7). Interestingly, the rate of aggregate dissolution was also visibly reduced (Figure 3E), suggesting that actin contributes to but is not absolutely required for the movement and dissolution of heat-induced aggregates. To examine whether formin proteins are involved in the dissolution and movement of protein aggregates, we tagged Hsp104 with GFP in the bni1Δ and bnr1Δ strains (BY4741 background) and performed 3D time-lapse imaging of heat-induced aggregates (Movies S8A and S8B). Neither mutant showed reduced frequency of B > M movement of aggregates (Figure 1D). In fact, we observed a slightly higher frequency of B > M movement in bni1Δ compared to that in wild-type (Figure 1D). Quantification of the rates of aggregate movement and dissolution showed that neither mutant is defective in these processes (Figures 3D and 3F). The aggregates showed slightly faster movement in bnr1Δ cells and faster dissolution in bni1Δ than those processes in wild-type cells (Figures 3D and 3F), suggesting that Bni1 and Bnr1 may contribute slightly negatively to aggregate dissolution or movement, respectively. Thus, the roles of F-actin in aggregate movement and dissolution appear to be largely independent of the formin proteins. We note that the calculation of aggregate diffusion coefficients in various strains or under the specified conditions was confirmed by the method of spatial temporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) analysis (Berland et al., 1995Berland K.M.

The rates calculated using both methods were consistent. During our time-lapse confocal movies, new buds could be observed to form from a number of mother cells in each experiment. In the majority (68%) of such wild-type cells observed, the aggregates were successfully retained in the mother while the bud grew, and the new bud was devoid of aggregates throughout the movies (Figure 5A and Movie S10A). In the remainder of the population, one (two in rare cases) aggregate moved into the bud from the mother (Figure 5B and Movie S10B). In the majority of these cases, the aggregate dissolved after entry into the bud (Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S10B, yellow arrow), whereas in a small fraction, the aggregate moved back to the mother (Figures 5B and 5C and Movie S10B, red arrow). Formin mutant (bniΔ and bnrΔ) cells undergoing budding during the time-lapse imaging essentially showed similar behavior, that is, the majority of aggregates were retained in the mother (Figure 5C and Movie S9), and those occasionally entering the bud most often dissolved (Figure 5C). We next performed time-lapse movies to observe the dynamics and distribution of naturally accumulated Hsp104-positive protein aggregates. Previous work showed that Hsp104p associates with protein aggregates containing carbonylated proteins resulting from oxidative damage in cells of older replicative age (Erjavec et al., 2007Erjavec N. Larsson L. Grantham J. Nyström T. Accelerated aging and failure to segregate damaged proteins in Sir2 mutants can be suppressed by overproducing the protein aggregation-remodeling factor Hsp104p.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2410-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In an exponentially growing population, in which most cells are young, Hsp104p-containing aggregates were rarely observed (data not shown). We hence used a magnetic beads-based sorting protocol (Chen et al., 2003Chen C. Dewaele S. Braeckman B. Desmyter L. Verstraelen J. Borgonie G. Vanfleteren J. Contreras R. A high-throughput screening system for genes extending life-span.Exp. Gerontol. 2003; 38: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) to obtain populations of wild-type enriched for older cells (see bud scar staining in Figure 6A ). The naturally formed aggregates (Figure 6B) do not dissolve during the duration of our observation by time-lapse movies, allowing long tracking of aggregate movement (Figure 6C and Movie S11). The individual long traces show nearly linear fitting of MSD with time, with a slight downward trend, suggesting that this movement can be described as random walk with slight confinement (Figure 6C, as an example). The distributions of α values from tracking many aggregates in older wild-type cells were similar to those of heat-induced aggregates (Figure 6D, compared to Figure 2C). These observations suggest that the dynamics of the Hsp104-associated protein aggregates formed in different ways exhibit the same type of movement. A recent study investigating the mechanism of asymmetric partitioning of episomal DNA circles reported free diffusive motion of episomes in the nucleoplasm (Gehlen et al., 2011Gehlen L.R. Nagai S. Shimada K. Meister P. Taddei A. Gasser S.M. Nuclear geometry and rapid mitosis ensure asymmetric episome segregation in yeast.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using a numerical simulation, they demonstrated that the retention of episomes in the mother can be explained simply by the geometry of the dividing nucleus and the brief window of time in the cell cycle when nuclear division occurs. As the protein aggregates also undergo random motion, a similar explanation may be applied to the preferential retention of aggregates in the mother during cell division. To test this idea, we performed a 3D numerical simulation of pure random walk, with the diffusion rate D = 1.0 × 10−3 μm2/s computed from particle tracking of natural Hsp104-GFP-containing aggregates in older cells. A yeast cell was represented as two spheres with radius of R1 = 2.5 μm (mother) and R2 = 0.85 × R1 (bud) connected by a narrow neck with width d = 1.25 μm. Starting from an initial distribution of aggregates entirely in the mother, the probability density map after 90 min (a cell cycle) showed maintenance of a biased distribution of aggregates in the mother (Figure 7A , top). To evaluate the impact of the geometry of yeast cells on this partitioning, the bud neck size was varied in the simulations. Figure 7A (bottom) shows that increasing bud neck size reduces the asymmetry in aggregate partitioning. Addition of confinement (α = 0.50, approximating the average value in Figure 6D) also enhanced the segregation asymmetry as expected (Figure 7A). Aggregate asymmetric segregation can also be described using a 1D (equivalent to wide open neck) analytical model, which again shows preferential retention of aggregates in the mother even with no confinement (α = 1) (Figures 7B and 7C). Based on the analyses described above, we conclude that the clearance of protein aggregates from the bud does not depend on actin cable-mediated retrograde transport. Our conclusion is based on quantification of aggregates movement from time-lapse recording of a large number of cells. Although linear bud-to-mother movement was observed occasionally, mother-to-bud movement of aggregates was observed at a similar frequency, and thus there was no net directionality in aggregate movement along the mother-bud axis. Particle tracking and trajectory analysis showed that the movement of protein aggregates can be described as random walk with a small amount of confinement. Even though some apparently linear trajectories can be observed, these can be recapitulated by random walk simulations using the same diffusion coefficient and trajectory length. We emphasize that, although our data does not support a direct role for actin-based retrograde transport in aggregate segregation, the data do not necessarily argue against an involvement for actin cytoskeleton or cell polarity proteins in this process. It is conceivable, for example, that the abnormally wide bud neck in some of the cell polarity mutants could increase the leaking of protein aggregates into the bud, although such an effect is likely to be too subtle to observe reliably in our experiments. Disassembly of actin filaments following LatA treatment partially abrogated aggregates movement and slowed their dissolution. Although it is possible that residual actin filaments remained and were below detection in LatA-treated cells, this observation suggests that actin cables,"

Inositol pyrophosphates have 'high-energy' phosphoanhydride bonds, so their enzymatic synthesis requires that a substantial energy barrier to the transition state be overcome. Additionally, inositol pyrophosphate kinases can show stringent ligand specificity, despite the need to accommodate the steric bulk and intense electronegativity of nature's most concentrated three-dimensional array of phosphate groups. Here we examine how these catalytic challenges are met by describing the structure and reaction cycle of an inositol pyrophosphate kinase at the atomic level.

Our study highlights subsets of epigenetic enzymes influencing different cancer cell phenotypes. Plant homeo domain (PHD) finger proteins have a key role in cell survival and histone methylation, whereas histone deacetylases were primarily involved in regulating AR expression. In contrast, JumonjiC-domain (JmjC) containing histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) mainly had an impact on cell proliferation. Our results show that the KDMs JARID1B, PHF8, KDM3A, KDM3B and KDM4A were highly expressed in clinical PrCa samples. The PHD-finger protein 8 (PHF8), a transcriptional coactivator with both PHD- and JmjC-domains, was moderately to strongly expressed in 80% of clinical PrCa samples, whereas 76% of normal and benign samples were negative or only showed weak PHF8 expression. Strong PHF8 expression correlated significantly with high Gleason grade and was borderline significant for poor prognosis. The results of functional PHF8 knockdown implicate a role in cell migration and invasion, as shown by cell motility and 3-D invasion assays. Our study suggests that various cellular phenotypes are regulated by distinct subsets of epigenetic enzymes. Proteins interpreting and modifying histone methylation, such as JmjC-domain and particularly PHD-finger proteins like PHF8, are activated in subsets of PrCa's and promote cancer relevant phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2102005789,"Somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinases, occur frequently in human cancers. Activating mutations spread across multiple domains, some of which are located at inhibitory contact sites formed with the regulatory subunit p85α. PIK3R1, which encodes p85α, also has activating somatic mutations. We find a strong correlation between lipid kinase and lipid-binding activities for both wild-type (WT) and a representative set of oncogenic mutant complexes of p110α/p85α. Lipid binding involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Activation caused by a phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) peptide binding to the p85α N-terminal SH2 domain (nSH2) induces lipid binding. This depends on the polybasic activation loop as well as a conserved hydrophobic motif in the C-terminal region of the kinase domain. The hotspot E545K mutant largely mimics the activated WT p110α. It shows the highest basal activity and lipid binding, and is not significantly activated by an RTK phosphopeptide. Both the hotspot H1047R mutant and rare mutations (C420R, M1043I, H1047L, G1049R and p85α-N564D) also show increased basal kinase activities and lipid binding. However, their activities are further enhanced by an RTK phosphopeptide to levels markedly exceeding that of activated WT p110α. Phosphopeptide binding to p110β/p85α and p110δ/p85α complexes also induces their lipid binding. We present a crystal structure of WT p110α complexed with the p85α inter-SH2 domain and the inhibitor PIK-108. Additional to the ATP-binding pocket, an unexpected, second PIK-108 binding site is observed in the kinase C-lobe. We show a global conformational change in p110α consistent with allosteric regulation of the kinase domain by nSH2. These findings broaden our understanding of the differential biological outputs exhibited by distinct types of mutations regarding growth factor dependence, and suggest a two-tier classification scheme relating p110α and p85α mutations with signalling potential."

Here we examined the relationship between membrane fusion and PA phosphatase activity. Pah1p is the single yeast homologue of the Lipin family of PA phosphatases. Deletion of PAH1 was sufficient to cause marked vacuole fragmentation and abolish vacuole fusion. The function of Pah1p solely depended on its phosphatase activity as complementation studies showed that wild type Pah1p restored fusion, whereas the phosphatase dead mutant Pah1pD398E had no effect. We discovered that the lack of PA phosphatase activity blocked fusion by inhibiting the binding of SNAREs to Sec18p, an N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor homologue responsible for priming inactive cis-SNARE complexes. In addition, pah1Δ vacuoles were devoid of the late endosome/vacuolar Rab Ypt7p, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34p, and Vps39p, a subunit of the HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) tethering complex, all of which are required for vacuole fusion.

Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized by membrane-bound organelles that communicate through the trafficking of transport vesicles. The transport of cargo between organelles as well as between the plasma membrane and organelles requires a series of trafficking events that culminates in the fusion of membranes and mixture of lumenal contents. The mechanisms and machinery that drive membrane fusion are conserved from single cell eukaryotes to metazoans (1Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Membrane fusion and exocytosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). We use vacuolar lysosomes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine the regulation of vesicle fusion.

During the tethering/docking stages vacuoles form three distinct morphological features. Vacuoles become tightly associated and form two flattened membrane discs termed the “boundary membrane.” Proteins and lipids that mediate fusion become enriched at the boundary perimeter, termed the “vertex ring” (2Fratti R.A.

However, little has been reported on the role of individual metabolic reactions during fusion. Here we examined the role of phosphatidic acid (PA) dephosphorylation to form DAG. The importance of DAG and PA has been recently highlighted in several trafficking pathways. DAG is important for the formation of COP-I vesicles in retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (16Fernández-Ulibarri I. Vilella M. Lázaro-Diéguez F. Sarri E. Martínez S.E. Jiménez N. Claro E. Mérida I. Burger K.N. Egea G. Diacylglycerol is required for the formation of COPI vesicles in the Golgi-to-ER transport pathway.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3250-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as tubulation within the Golgi apparatus (17Asp L. Kartberg F. Fernandez-Rodriguez J. Smedh M. Elsner M. Laporte F. Bárcena M. Jansen K.A. Valentijn J.A. Koster A.J. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. Early stages of Golgi vesicle and tubule formation require diacylglycerol.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 780-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PA also plays an important role in SNARE activation during sporulation (18Coluccio A. Malzone M. Neiman A.M. Genetic evidence of a role for membrane lipid composition in the regulation of soluble NEM-sensitive factor receptor function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2004; 166: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Liu S.

In vitro fusion catalyzed by the sporulation-specific t-SNARE light-chain Spo20p is stimulated by phosphatidic acid.Traffic. 2007; 8: 1630-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), mitochondrial fusion (20Choi S.Y. Huang P. Jenkins G.M. Chan D.C. Schiller J. Frohman M.A. A common lipid links Mfn-mediated mitochondrial fusion and SNARE-regulated exocytosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and exocytosis (21Humeau Y. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Dupont J.L. Du G. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. Poulain B. A role for phospholipase D1 in neurotransmitter release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 15300-15305Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Formation of both PA and DAG occurs through multiple metabolic pathways. In many studies the generation of PA and DAG is studied in the context of phospholipase activities. PA is the product of phospholipase D activity on phosphatidylcholine, whereas phospholipase C variants hydrolyze either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce DAG. Furthermore, PA and DAG can be interconverted by DAG kinase and PA phosphatases. Although many studies have focused on phospholipase C and phospholipase D activity in the context of membrane trafficking, little is known about the importance of interconverting DAG and PA during membrane fusion. For this reason in this study we examined the role of PA phosphatase activity in vacuole fusion. The importance of PA phosphatase (PAP) activity in vacuole homeostasis had not been thoroughly explored. S. cerevisiae contains three PAPs. Lpp1p is a polytopic PAP localized to Golgi puncta and dephosphorylates PA, lysophosphatidic acid, and DAG pyrophosphate via a Mg2+-independent mechanism (22Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. Isolation and characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LPP1 gene encoding a Mg2+-independent phosphatidate phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14331-14338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Dpp1p is a Zn2+-regulated seven-transmembrane domain PAP localized to the vacuole and acts on DAG pyrophosphate and PA (23Han G.S. Johnston C.N. Chen X. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Carman G.M. Regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DPP1-encoded diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase by zinc.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10126-10133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The soluble PAP Pah1p only hydrolyzes PA in a Mg2+-dependent manner (24Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae lipin homolog is a Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although all three PAPs can hydrolyze PA, Pah1p is the principal producer of DAG from PA (24Han G.S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 9210-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PAH1 homologue LPIN1 have been identified as the cause of fatty liver dystrophy and termed an “obesity” gene (25Péterfy M. Phan J. Xu P. Reue K.

Furthermore, mutations in Lipin 1 have been shown to lead to obesity by reducing fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure (28Phan J. Reue K. Lipin, a lipodystrophy and obesity gene.Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and may lead to severe consequences such as the onset of insulin resistance, a hallmark of adult obesity and type 2 diabetes. Pah1p is a Mg2+-dependent soluble 95-kDa protein with a central catalytic motif and an N-terminal amphipathic helix (29Carman G.M. Han G.S. Phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in the regulation of lipid synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 2593-2597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The PA phosphatase activity of Pah1p is constitutive; however, its association with membranes and subsequent enzymatic activity is controlled through its state of phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Pah1p is soluble and present in the cytoplasm, whereas dephosphorylated Pah1p localizes to membranes and functions as a PA phosphatase (30Choi H.S. Su W.M. Morgan J.M. Han G.S. Xu Z.

Pah1p is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28p and dephosphorylated by the membrane-anchored Nem1p-Spo7p phosphatase complex (31Santos-Rosa H. Leung J. Grimsey N. Peak-Chew S.

The association of Pah1p with membranes is mediated by an N-terminal amphipathic helix (33Karanasios E. Han G.S. Xu Z. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S.

Although most of the membrane-bound Pah1p is found on the endoplasmic reticulum, active Pah1p can bind to other membranes, including lipid droplets, or artificial liposomes (30Choi H.S. Su W.M.

The yeast lipin orthologue Pah1p is important for biogenesis of lipid droplets.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Pah1p plays a critical role in regulating the overall synthesis of lipids. When Pah1p is phosphorylated it indirectly regulates the expression of phospholipid synthesis genes (35O'Hara L. Han G.S.

Phosphorylated Pah1p translocates to the nucleus where it regulates INO1 for the production of lipids. This is critical during mitosis when the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum have to expand to replicate the organelles for daughter cells. Unphosphorylated Pah1p generates DAG, which can feed into the synthesis of triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (24Han G.S. Wu W.I. Carman G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2044381107,"In this study we describe a novel interaction between the breast/ovarian tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and the transcription factor GATA3, an interaction, which is important for normal breast differentiation. We show that the BRCA1-GATA3 interaction is important for the repression of genes associated with triple-negative and basal-like breast cancer (BLBCs) including FOXC1, and that GATA3 interacts with a C-terminal region of BRCA1. We demonstrate that FOXC1 is an essential survival factor maintaining the proliferation of BLBCs cell lines. We define the mechanistic basis of this corepression and identify the GATA3-binding site within the FOXC1 distal promoter region. We show that BRCA1 and GATA3 interact on the FOXC1 promoter and that BRCA1 requires GATA3 for recruitment to this region. This interaction requires fully functional BRCA1 as a mutant BRCA1 protein is unable to localize to the FOXC1 promoter or repress FOXC1 expression. We demonstrate that this BRCA1-GATA3 repression complex is not a FOXC1-specific phenomenon as a number of other genes associated with BLBCs such as FOXC2, CXCL1 and p-cadherin were also repressed in a similar manner. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of our findings by showing that loss of GATA3 expression or aberrant FOXC1 expression contributes to the drug resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenotypes associated with aggressive BLBCs."
https://openalex.org/W2082959665,"P53 has an important role in the processing of starvation signals. P53-dependent molecular mediators of the Warburg effect reduce glucose consumption and promote mitochondrial function. We therefore hypothesized that the retention of wild-type p53 characteristic of primary glioblastomas limits metabolic demands induced by deregulated signal transduction in the presence of hypoxia and nutrient depletion. Here we report that short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression of wild-type p53 or ectopic expression of mutant temperature-sensitive dominant-negative p53V135A increased glucose consumption and lactate production, decreased oxygen consumption and enhanced hypoxia-induced cell death in p53 wild-type human glioblastoma cells. Similarly, genetic knockout of p53 in HCT116 colon carcinoma cells resulted in reduced respiration and hypersensitivity towards hypoxia-induced cell death. Further, wild-type p53 gene silencing reduced the expression of synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), an effector necessary for respiratory chain function. An SCO2 transgene reverted the metabolic phenotype and restored resistance towards hypoxia in p53-depleted and p53 mutant glioma cells in a rotenone-sensitive manner, demonstrating that this effect was dependent on intact oxidative phosphorylation. Supplementation with methyl-pyruvate, a mitochondrial substrate, rescued p53 wild-type but not p53 mutant cells from hypoxic cell death, demonstrating a p53-mediated selective aptitude to metabolize mitochondrial substrates. Further, SCO2 gene silencing in p53 wild-type glioma cells sensitized these cells towards hypoxia. Finally, lentiviral gene suppression of SCO2 significantly enhanced tumor necrosis in a subcutaneous HCT116 xenograft tumor model, compatible with impaired energy metabolism in these cells. These findings demonstrate that glioma and colon cancer cells with p53 wild-type status can skew the Warburg effect and thereby reduce their vulnerability towards tumor hypoxia in an SCO2-dependent manner. Targeting SCO2 may therefore represent a valuable strategy to enhance sensitivity towards hypoxia and may complement strategies targeting glucose metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2022496524,"Aneuploidy is frequently detected in solid tumors but the mechanisms regulating the generation of aneuploidy and their relevance in cancer initiation remain under debate and are incompletely characterized. Spatial and temporal regulation of integrin traffic is critical for cell migration and cytokinesis. Impaired integrin endocytosis, because of the loss of Rab21 small GTPase or mutations in the integrin β-subunit cytoplasmic tail, induces failure of cytokinesis in vitro. Here, we describe that repeatedly failed cytokinesis, because of impaired traffic, is sufficient to trigger the generation of aneuploid cells, which display characteristics of oncogenic transformation in vitro and are tumorigenic in vivo. Furthermore, in an in vivo mouse xenograft model, non-transformed cells with impaired integrin traffic formed tumors with a long latency. More detailed investigation of these tumors revealed that the tumor cells were aneuploid. Therefore, abnormal integrin traffic was linked with generation of aneuploidy and cell transformation also in vivo. In human prostate and ovarian cancer samples, downregulation of Rab21 correlates with increased malignancy. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that long-term depletion of Rab21 is sufficient to induce chromosome number aberrations in normal human epithelial cells. These data are the first to demonstrate that impaired integrin traffic is sufficient to induce conversion of non-transformed cells to tumorigenic cells in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2066921724,"Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the primary cause of upper respiratory tract infections, generally known as the common cold. Moreover, RV infections can trigger severe exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We expressed the 4 major RV capsid proteins, VP1-VP4, in Escherichia coli and used these proteins as well as recombinant and synthetic VP1 fragments to study and map antibody responses in RV-infected humans. VP1, which on infection binds to ICAM 1, was identified as a major target for the memory immune response, residing in the IgG1 subclass and IgA class. Interestingly, this response was mainly directed against an N-terminal 20mer peptide in VP1, P1a, which becomes exposed on intact RV only when it docks to its receptor ICAM 1. Molecular modeling using the 3-dimensional RV capsid structures revealed that P1a was localized inside the capsid and outside the areas involved in receptor binding or RV neutralization. Our results suggest misdirection of antibody responses against a nonprotective epitope as a mechanism how RV escapes immunity and causes recurrent infections. Based on these findings, it may be possible to design vaccines against RV infections and RV-induced respiratory diseases.—Niespodziana, K., Napora, K., Cabauatan, C., Focke-Tejkl, M., Keller, W., Niederberger, V., Tsolia, M., Christodoulou, I., Papadopoulos, N.

https://openalex.org/W2006819060,"The Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) is expressed in most vertebrate cells and is crucial in the regulation of cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration. To study the structure and function of NKCC1, we tagged the transporter with cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) fluorescent proteins at two sites within the C terminus and measured fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in stably expressing human embryonic kidney cell lines. Both singly and doubly tagged NKCC1s were appropriately produced, trafficked to the plasma membrane, and exhibited (86)Rb transport activity. When both fluorescent probes were placed within the same C terminus of an NKCC1 transporter, we recorded an 11% FRET decrease upon activation of the transporter. This result clearly demonstrates movement of the C terminus during the regulatory response to phosphorylation of the N terminus. When we introduced CFP and YFP separately in different NKCC1 constructs and cotransfected these in HEK cells, we observed FRET between dimer pairs, and the fractional FRET decrease upon transporter activation was 46%. Quantitatively, this indicates that the largest FRET-signaled movement is between dimer pairs, an observation supported by further experiments in which the doubly tagged construct was cotransfectionally diluted with untagged NKCC1. Our results demonstrate that regulation of NKCC1 is accompanied by a large movement between two positions in the C termini of a dimeric cotransporter. We suggest that the NKCC1 C terminus is involved in transport regulation and that dimerization may play a key structural role in the regulatory process. It is anticipated that when combined with structural information, our findings will provide a model for understanding the conformational changes that bring about NKCC1 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2069187984,"Here, we report unbiased screens for genes expressed in metastatic tumor cells that are associated with cell motility. These screens identified Ier2, an immediate early gene of unknown function, as potentially having a role in tumor cell motility and metastasis. Knockdown of Ier2 in 3T3 fibroblasts inhibited their motility upon relief of contact inhibition in monolayer wounding assays. Furthermore, ectopic Ier2 expression promoted the motility and invasiveness of poorly metastatic 1AS pancreatic tumor cells in vitro. Relief of contact inhibition was associated with translocation of the Ier2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in both 3T3 fibroblasts and 1AS tumor cells. Importantly, ectopic Ier2 expression in 1AS cells stimulated metastasis formation when cells were implanted into experimental animals. Furthermore, we found elevated Ier2 expression in a wide variety of human tumor types. This correlated with poor metastasis-free and overall survival in patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas. Together, these data reveal Ier2 as a new player in the regulation of tumor progression and metastasis, and suggest that Ier2 may be useful prognostically and therapeutically in the management of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2001861759,"A large number of tropomyosin (Tm) isoforms function as gatekeepers of the actin filament, controlling the spatiotemporal access of actin-binding proteins to specialized actin networks. Residues ∼40-80 vary significantly among Tm isoforms, but the impact of sequence variation on Tm structure and interactions with actin is poorly understood, because structural studies have focused on skeletal muscle Tmα. We describe structures of N-terminal fragments of smooth muscle Tmα and Tmβ (sm-Tmα and sm-Tmβ). The 2.0-Å structure of sm-Tmα81 (81-aa) resembles that of skeletal Tmα, displaying a similar super-helical twist matching the contours of the actin filament. The 1.8-Å structure of sm-Tmα98 (98-aa) unexpectedly reveals an antiparallel coiled coil, with the two chains staggered by only 4 amino acids and displaying hydrophobic core interactions similar to those of the parallel dimer. In contrast, the 2.5-Å structure of sm-Tmβ98, containing Gly-Ala-Ser at the N terminus to mimic acetylation, reveals a parallel coiled coil. None of the structures contains coiled-coil stabilizing elements, favoring the formation of head-to-tail overlap complexes in four of five crystallographically independent parallel dimers. These complexes show similarly arranged 4-helix bundles stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, but the extent of the overlap varies between sm-Tmβ98 and sm-Tmα81 from 2 to 3 helical turns. The formation of overlap complexes thus appears to be an intrinsic property of the Tm coiled coil, with the specific nature of hydrophobic contacts determining the extent of the overlap. Overall, the results suggest that sequence variation among Tm isoforms has a limited effect on actin binding but could determine its gatekeeper function."
https://openalex.org/W2057923521,"MDMX is a heterodimeric partner of MDM2 and a critical regulator of p53. The MDMX level is generally elevated in tumors with wild-type p53 and contributes to p53 inactivation. MDMX degradation is controlled in part by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. Here, we show that MDMX turnover is highly responsive to changes in MDM2 level in non-transformed cells, but not in tumor cells. We found that loss of alternate reading frame (ARF) expression, which occurs in most tumors with wild-type p53, significantly reduces MDMX sensitivity to MDM2. Restoration of ARF expression in tumor cells enables MDM2 to degrade MDMX in a dose-dependent manner. ARF binds to MDM2 and stimulates a second-site interaction between the central region of MDM2 and MDMX, and thus increases MDMX–MDM2 binding and MDMX ubiquitination. These results reveal an important abnormality in the p53-regulatory pathway as a consequence of ARF deficiency. Loss of ARF during tumor development not only prevents p53 stabilization by proliferative stress but also causes accumulation of MDMX that compromises p53 activity. This phenomenon may reduce the clinical efficacy of MDM2-specific inhibitors by preventing MDMX downregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1501211852,"Senescence is an irreversible growth arrest phenotype adopted by cells that has a key role in protecting organisms from cancer. There is now considerable interest in therapeutic strategies that reactivate this process to control the growth of cancer cells. Protein kinase-Cι (PKCι) is a member of the atypical PKC family and an important downstream mediator in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3-kinase) pathway. PKCι expression was found to be upregulated in a subset of breast cancers and breast cancer cell lines. Activation of the PI-3-kinase pathway by introduction of mutant, oncogenic PIK3CA into breast mammary epithelial cells increased both the expression and activation of PKCι. In breast cancer cells lines overexpressing PKCι, depletion of PKCι increased the number of senescent cells, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase, morphology and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. This phenomenon was not restricted to breast cancer cells, as it was also seen in glioblastoma cells in which PKCι is activated by loss of PTEN. Senescence occurred in the absence of a detectable DNA-damage response, was dependent on p21 and was enhanced by the aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680, suggesting that senescence is triggered by defects in mitosis. Depletion of PKCι had no effect on senescence in normal mammary epithelial cell lines. We conclude that PKCι is overexpressed in a subset of cancers where it functions to suppress premature senescence. This function appears to be restricted to cancer cells and inhibition of PKCι may therefore be an effective way to selectively activate premature senescence in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964242602,"The tumour suppressor PTEN is a key negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway, and is frequently either reduced or lost in human tumours. Murine genetic studies have confirmed that reduction of Pten promotes tumourigenesis in multiple organs, and demonstrated dependency of tumour development on the activation of downstream components such as Akt. Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) act via IGF1R to activate the PI3K-Akt pathway, and are commonly upregulated in cancer. A context-dependent interplay between IGFs and PTEN exists in normal tissue and tumours; increased IGF2 ligand supply induces Pten expression creating an autoregulatory negative feedback loop, whereas complete loss of PTEN may either cooperate with IGF overexpression in tumour promotion, or result in desensitisation to IGF ligand. However, it remains unknown whether neoplasia associated with Pten loss is dependent on upstream IGF ligand supply in vivo. We evaluated this by generation of Pten(+/-) mice with differing allelic dosage of Igf2, an imprinted gene encoding the potent embryonic and tumour growth factor Igf2. We show that biallelic Igf2 supply potentiates a previously unreported Pten(+/-) placental phenotype and results in strain-dependent cardiac hyperplasia and neonatal lethality. Importantly, we also show that the effects of Pten loss in vivo are modified by Igf2 supply, as lack of Igf2 results in extended survival and delayed tumour development while biallelic supply is associated with reduced lifespan and accelerated neoplasia in females. Furthermore, we demonstrate that reduction of PTEN protein to heterozygote levels in human MCF7 cells is associated with increased proliferation in response to IGF2, and does not result in desensitisation to IGF2 signalling. These data indicate that the effects of Pten loss at heterozygote levels commonly observed in human tumours are modified by Igf2 ligand, and emphasise the importance of the evaluation of upstream pathways in tumours with Pten loss."
https://openalex.org/W2058363615,"The Polycomb transcription repressor BMI1 is highly expressed in human neuroblastomas and is required for the clonogenic self-renewal and tumorigenicity of human neuroblastoma cell lines. The molecular basis of BMI1 action in neuroblastoma cells is not well understood. Here we report that BMI1 has a critical role in stabilizing cyclin E1 by repressing the expression of FBXW7, a substrate-recognition subunit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets cyclin E1 for degradation. BMI1 binds to the FBXW7 locus in vivo and represses its mRNA expression. Overexpression of cyclin E1 or abrogation of FBXW7 induction rescues the cell-death phenotype of BMI1 knockdown. Moreover, MYCN, an oncoprotein in the pathogenesis of high-risk neuroblastomas, is able to counteract the death-inducing effect of BMI1 knockdown by activating CCNE1 transcription. We further show that high cyclin E1 expression is associated with Stage 4 neuroblastomas and poor prognosis in patients. These findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the oncogenic activity of BMI1 and MYCN in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and progression by maintaining cyclin E1 levels."

https://openalex.org/W2027406874,"Transcript initiation by RNA polymerase II (pol II) requires a helicase within TFIIH to generate the unpaired template strand. However, pol II preinitiation complexes (PICs) lose the ability to synthesize RNA very rapidly upon exposure to ATP alone in the absence of other NTPs. This inactivation is not caused by the TFIIH kinase activity, the loss of transcription factors or pol II from the PIC, or the collapse of the initially formed transcription bubble. TFIIE is necessary for PIC formation, but TFIIE is not retained as a stable component in PICs prepared by our protocol. Nevertheless, activity can be at least partially restored to ATP-treated PICs by the readdition of TFIIE. PICs formed on premelted (bubble) templates require TFIIH for effective transcript elongation to +20. Incubation of bubble template PICs with ATP caused reduced yields of 20-mers, but this effect was partially reversed by the addition of TFIIE. Our results suggest that once the open complex is formed, TFIIH decays into an inactive configuration in the absence of nucleotides for transcription. Although TFIIE does not play a role in transcript initiation itself, inactivation resulting from ATP preincubation can be reversed by a remodeling process mediated by TFIIE. Finally, we have also uncovered a major role for TFIIF in the earliest stages of transcript elongation that is unique to bubble templates."

https://openalex.org/W2140328116,"GbpC is a multidomain Roco protein in Dictyostelium, involved in transduction of intracellular cGMP that is produced by chemotactic signals. We have shown previously that cGMP binding to GbpC induces an intramolecular signaling cascade by activating subsequently the GEF, Ras, and kinase domains. In this study, we report on the cellular localization of GbpC. In resting cells, the protein is present in the cytoplasm, but GbpC rapidly translocates to the cell boundary upon stimulation with the chemoattractant cAMP. Also, during the formation of cell-cell streams and osmotic shock, the protein localizes toward the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. The translocation upon cAMP stimulation occurs downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins but is independent of guanylyl cyclases and the previously identified cGMP-induced intramolecular signaling cascade in GbpC. Mutations in the GRAM domain of GbpC lead to disturbed membrane association and inactivation of GbpC function during chemotaxis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the GRAM domain itself associates with cellular membranes and binds various phospholipids in vitro. Together, the results show that GbpC receives multiple input signals that are both required for functional activity in vivo. cAMP-stimulation induces a cGMP-dependent signaling cascade, leading to activation of kinase activity, and, independently, cAMP induces a GRAM-dependent translocation of GbpC toward the plasma membrane and cell cortex, where it may locally phosphorylate effector proteins, which are needed for proper biological activity."
