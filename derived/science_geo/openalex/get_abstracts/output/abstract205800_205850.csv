https://openalex.org/W1967158533,"Two common marine animals of the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Sicyonia brevirostris, a penaeid shrimp, and Opsanus beta, a toadfish, may be induced to go into cataleptic states in the laboratory when they are threatened or molested. The behaviors of these two animals as they go into catalepsy are described. There is considerable paling in the fish but none in the shrimp."

A synthetic diet has been prepared, which includes milk, eggs, and lard, which may cause fourfold increase in serum cholesterol levels. This species is proposed as an experimental subject for the study of aging and age-associated diseases."

The technique for measuring the eye movements consists of detecting and amplifying by photomultiplication the total amount of light passing through a small slit upon which is imaged a small portion of the light-dark field represented by the iris and sclera of the eye. This total amount of light varies directly with the angular position of the eye."

Kinetin is particularly effective when culture conditions are suboptimal, perhaps because it substitutes for or supplies some factor which becomes limiting after transfer."

https://openalex.org/W2089392828,"A conditioned rise in blood sugar occurs in rats during a 10-mirational and provide an waiting period prior to nociceptive stimulation. This conditioned ""preparatory hyperglycemia"" is abolished after a bilateral lesion is produced in the mid-line thalamic nuclei; the experiments point to the importance of the thalamic reticular formation in adaptative metabolic reactions."

https://openalex.org/W2026332292,"Although the rate of hydrolysis by mammalian beta-glucuronidase appears to be inhibited by methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride with the standard technique (phenolphthalein glucuronide as a substrate), the release of steroidal conjugates under conditions generally employed does not appear to be affected."
https://openalex.org/W2027363786,"THE detection of metabolic differences between nucleated and enucleated fragments of Amoeba proteus suffers from the fact that the amounts involved are often minute1. In a search for the effect of enucleation upon cellular metabolism, the sensitivity of nucleated and enucleated fragments, respectively, towards selected metabolites may serve as a guide."
https://openalex.org/W2049893352,AS early as 1926 Dohrn et al. 1 discovered the œstrogenic activity of plant material. It was only in 1944 that Bennets2 described disorders in sheep originating from œstrogens in pasture with a high content of subterranean clover (var. Dwalganup). Bartlett et al. 3 suggested that in Britain œstrogens in pasture might raise milk yield and non-fatty solids in the milk of cows.
https://openalex.org/W2054461596,"When smooth muscle of Mytilus is treated with relatively weak solutions of sodium cyanide, a transitory hyperpolarization or no change in polarization precedes final depolarization. Thresholds for thermal, chemical, and electrical stimulation are all decreased during this period. Strength-duration curves indicate a reversible decrease in threshold of about 50 percent during this period."

https://openalex.org/W2021073495,"THE enzyme 5-carboxymethylhydantoinase, which reversibly cyclized carbamylaspartate to 5-carboxymethylhydantoin, was demonstrated in Zymobacterium oroticum by Lieberman and Kornberg1. No enzymatic activity was found in rat liver or in two corynebacterium strains2. In recent studies on pyrimidine metabolism in man this enzyme was found to be absent in erythrocytes and normal or leukaemic leukocytes3,4. The absence of this enzyme in mammalian cells and its presence in bacteria suggested the possibility that chemotherapeutic agents might be developed as competitive inhibitors of 5-carboxy-methylhydahtoinase. Inhibition of the growth of Lactobacillus casei by thiohydantoin-5-acetic acid has been reported5. A survey of the distribution of the enzyme in micro-organisms was therefore undertaken."
