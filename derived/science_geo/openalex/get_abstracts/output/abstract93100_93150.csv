https://openalex.org/W2059775037,"Cells of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant that is temperature-sensitive for secretion and cell surface growth become dense during incubation at the non-permissive temperature (37 degrees C). This property allows the selection of additional secretory mutants by sedimentation of mutagenized cells on a Ludox density gradient. Colonies derived from dense cells are screened for conditional growth and secretion of invertase and acid phosphatase. The sec mutant strains that accumulate an abnormally large intracellular pool of invertase at 37 degrees C (188 mutant clones) fall into 23 complementation groups, and the distribution of mutant alleles suggests that more complementation groups could be found. Bud emergence and incorporation of a plasma membrane sulfate permease activity stop quickly after a shift to 37 degrees C. Many of the mutants are thermoreversible; upon return to the permissive temperature (25 degrees C) the accumulated invertase is secreted. Electron microscopy of sec mutant cells reveals, with one exception, the temperature-dependent accumulation of membrane-enclosed secretory organelles. We suggest that these structures represent intermediates in a pathway in which secretion and plasma membrane assembly are colinear."

The activity was independent of the xerographic hardware and process and was traced to nitropyrenes present as impurities in the carbon black, the toner colorant. Manufacturing process changes resulted in a substantial reduction of the nitropyrene content of the carbon black and thus in the mutagenicity of the corresponding toners. Nitropyrenes are potent frameshift mutagens, and possible mechanisms for their biological action are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1557272981,"Prolactin (Prl), growth hormone (GH), and chorionic somatomammotropin (CS) form a set (the ‘Trl set”) of mammalian hormones which is thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene. Until now this assumption was based on similarities in their amino acid sequences, on their often overlapping biological and immunological properties, and on nucleic acid sequence data for two members of the set (GH and CS). In the current study, we report the amplification in bacteria and the sequence analysis of DNA complementary to rat Prl mRNA. Two independent clones were obtained, one of which contained 823 bases including the entire sequence coding for rat prolactin and its signal peptide and parts of the 5‘- and 3”untranslated regions of the mRNA. The nucleotide sequences of the two cloned DNAs differ by three nucleotides. In addition, both predicted amino acid sequences also differ by about 14% from the published amino acid sequence of the protein. Although technical problems cannot be excluded for each of these discrepancies, the data suggest a revised structure for the protein and the possible existence of distinct nonallelic Prl genes. The results of this study have allowed us to compare the nucleotide sequences of the structural genes coding for each of the hormones of the Prl set. The codons for rPrl mRNA do not show the marked preference for GMP and CMP in the third position observed in rGH, hGH, and hCS mRNAs. rGH and rPrl mRNAs show 39% nucleic acid homology in the coding portion, but little homology in the untranslated regions. This differs from the comparison between hGH and hCS where the same degree of homology (about 93%) was found in both the coding and noncoding regions. Ten per cent of the codons of rPrl and rGH are identical, and 26% differ by only one base. Of the latter, only 58% result in amino acid changes, which most often are conservative. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the Prl and GH genes derive from a common precursor. The data allow us to suggest a date for this gene duplication event at around 380 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W175935117,"Abstract Many membrane proteins and secreted proteins are synthesized in precursor form with 15 to 30 additional NH2-terminal residues. These peptides (pre-pieces, signal peptides) are removed as these proteins cross or insert into cellular membranes. Leader activities which catalyze this cleavage have been detected in crude extracts and found to be dependent on membrane fractions. We now describe a 6,000-fold purification of a leader peptidase from the membranes of uninfected Escherichia coli. This leader peptidase was assayed by its ability to cleave the 23-residue leader peptide from procoat, the precursor to bacteriophage M13 coat protein. Immunoprecipitation and amino acid sequencing showed that this enzyme cleaved procoat to produce authentic coat protein. No factors other than the leader peptidase were found to be required for the conversion of procoat protein to coat protein."

The presence of platelet factor 4 antigen in the vessel wall after removal of the endothelium was shown by immunofluorescence 10 and 30 minutes after injury but not 240 minutes afterward. This study demonstrates that factors carried by platelets can enter the vessel wall and that the movement of these platelet products into the vasculature is a short-lived, self-limiting process."
https://openalex.org/W1561797960,"Three lines of evidence are presented which support the hypothesis that the binding of insulin to rat adipocyte plasma membranes activates a membrane protease which results in the production of a soluble factor that stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase activity when added to mitochondria. First, low concentrations of trypsin (0.01 to 0.1 microgram/ml) mimic the action of insulin on plasma membranes in this system. Second, inhibitors of trypsin-like proteases (soy trypsin inhibitor, ovomucoid) block insulin action on the plasma membrane, as do exogenous protease substrates which are esters of arginine, presumably by preventing the normal interaction of the protease and its endogenous membrane substrate. Third, digestion by proteases (0.1 mg/ml of trypsin, chymotrypsin, or papain) of the soluble material released from plasma membranes after insulin treatment blocks the stimulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, suggesting that the mediator may be a peptide released by a proteolytic reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1975454462,"It has previously been shown by immunofluorescence experiments that the cross-linking of HLA antigens into patches (by antibody reagents directed to human beta 2--microglobulin) on the surfaces of cultured human fibroblasts leads to the lining up of the patches over the actomyosin-containing stress fibers lying immediately under the surface membrane. These experiments have now been extended to the resolution of the electron microscope by the use of ferritin-conjugated antibody. The results show that a substantial part of the HLA surface clusters that form by 5 min after the addition of the antibody reagents is found in small uncoated surface invaginations which are subsequently endocytosed and ultimately fuse with lysosomal bodies. At no stage in this process is there any indication that coated pits or coated vesicles participate. These and other results suggest, therefore, that there are at least two distinct mechanisms for the ligand-induced endocytosis and lysosomal processing of membrane components, one involving coated pits and the other the noncoated invaginations described in this paper. Transmembrane associations of clusters with intracellular actomyosin-containing structures may have a role in the endocytosis of these noncoated invaginations."

The mutagenic behavior was similar for extracts from copies and corresponding toners indicating that toners are directly responsible for the mutagenicity. The mutagenicity is caused by at least two classes of compounds which may be present either alone or in combination in any toner.

Addition of ribosomal protein L4 (1 microM) to in vitro protein synthesis reactions caused selective inhibition of synthesis of the promoter-proximal proteins of the S10 operon, S10, L3, L4, L23 and possibly L2. Proteins of the S10 operon other than L4 did not cause selective inhibition of protein synthesis. Autoregulatory ribosomal proteins previously identified from other operons, L1, S4 and S8, did not inhibit protein synthesis from the S10 operon; nor did L4 cause significant inhibition of protein synthesis from operons other than the S10 operon. As with L1, S4 and S8, L4 inhibits gene expression at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W1987673990,"The growth of the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line is unresponsive to the presence of estrogen in culture media. Paradoxically, in nude mice, growth of these cells and formation of solid tumors are dependent on estrogen. Tumors fail to develop in ovariectomized mice, but do develop in intact mice and in ovariectomized mice given estrogen. Primary cultures derived from MCF-7 tumors revert to unresponsiveness to estrogen. However, when these cultures are again transplanted into nude mice, estrogen is required for tumor formation. The continuous culture, the solid tumor, and the primary cultures therefrom have similar estrogen-binding capacities and affinities. These results indicate that mammary carcinoma cell growth in vivo is subject to inhibition that can be overcome by estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2062247065,"Prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis seems to be one of the major physiological mechanisms involved in regulating platelet and vessel wall interactions1. PGI2 is produced in large amounts by vascular endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) also produce significant quantities2. The capacity of SMC to produce PGI2, especially after endothelial injury, seems to be of importance. It is probably this type of situation that is involved in the atherosclerotic process3: experimental atherosclerosis in rabbits has been associated with a severe decrease in PGI2 synthesis by arteries4. Lipid peroxide accumulation within the arterial wall or in the plasma may also be involved in this process5. Using arterial SMC in culture, we demonstrate here that, in comparison with healthy cultured cells, cells originating from atherosclerotic aorta have a decreased capacity to produce PGI2. The results were obtained using biological and radiochemical techniques and were confirmed by GC-MS. They suggest a potential role for PGI2 in inhibiting the atherosclerotic process."
https://openalex.org/W1526049569,"Abstract DNA complementary to three androgen-dependent mRNAs from rat ventral prostate has been cloned in the bacterial plasmid pAT 153. DNA sequences coding for 20,000, 10,000, and 9,000 translation products, the precursors of polypeptides secreted in vivo (Parker, M. G., and Scrace, G.T. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76, 1580--1584) were identified in recombinant plasmids. The levels of mRNA coding for the 20,000 and 10,000 translation products were quantitated using cDNA probes and also by hybridization in situ with RNA that had been covalently bound to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper. Both mRNAs responded with similar kinetics to androgen withdrawal and testosterone stimulation. The sequences declined with nonlinear kinetics by at least 3 orders of magnitude after androgen withdrawal and are induced by testosterone without an appreciable lag, a 3-fold increase being detectable within 2 h. Analysis of the RNA bound to diazobenzyloxymethyl paper indicates that the mRNAs coding for the 20,000, 10,000, and 9,000 translation products contain 930, 640, and 550 nucleotides, respectively."

Mating [KIL-k1] haploids with [KIL-k2] haploids yields only [KIL-k1] diploids, that is, [KIL-k1] excludes [KIL-k2]. [EXL], a new non-Mendelian genetic element from a nonkiller strain, excludes [KIL-k2] but does not exclude [KIL-k1]. A second new non-Mendelian genetic element, called [NEX], when present prevents [EXL] from excluding [KIL-k2]. [NEX] does not prevent [KIL-k1] or [KIL-s1] (a suppressive mutant of [KIL-k1]) from excluding [KIL-k2]. A chromosomal gene, called MKT1, is needed for maintenance of [KIL-k2] if [NEX] is present. In the absence of [NEX], [KIL-k2] does not need MKT1. [KIL-k1] does not need MKT1 even if [NEX] is present. [EXL] replication depends on at least the products of MAK1, MAK3, MAK10 and PET18.

https://openalex.org/W2145229074,"The amino acid sequence of rabbit cardiac tropomyosin has been investigated by the isolation of peptides derives from cyanogen bromide and proteolytic degradations. Based on identical amino acid compositions, electrophoretic mobilities, and in some cases, NH2-terminal analyses, all peptides were shown to be the same as peptides in the amino acid sequence of rabbit skeletal alpha-tropomyosin. The apparent heterogeneity of the cardiac protein previously observed on alkaline-urea polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels is attributable to a phosphorylated species. We conclude that the primary structures of the cardiac and skeletal alpha component are identical. Differences in actin-linked calcium regulation in skeletal and cardiac muscle must reside largely in the troponin components."
https://openalex.org/W1578572594,"The binding of insulin to cultured human lymphocytes of the IM-9 line was investigated at near-physiological conditions, i.e. 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, using a monoiodinated insulin exclusively labeled in tyrosyl residue 14 of the A chain. Although the apparent dissociation constant did not differ much from that found in rat adipocytes, the rate constants were about 1 order of magnitude greater. The rate of dissociation of 60 pM of labeled insulin was accelerated more in the lymphocytes than in adipocytes by the addition of 50 nM insulin to the wash-out medium. In rat adipocytes insulin is degraded both by receptor-independent and receptor-mediated processes (Gliemann, J., and Sonne, O. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7857-7863). Lymphocytes possessed a receptor-independent insulin-degrading system with the same properties as that of adipocytes. However, receptor-mediated degradation was absent and insulin binding is therefore a true reversible process. The following is concluded: 1) The binding sites of the receptors in IM-9 lymphocytes are different from those of the insulin-responsive adipocytes and hepatocytes. 2) The lymphocytes lack the enzyme responsible for the receptor-mediated degradation or a coupling factor between the receptor and the enzyme."

It selectively inactivates the glutamine-dependent activities of two bacterial glutamine amidotransferases, anthranilate synthase and glutamate synthase. A reversible noncovalent complex is formed prior to irreversible enzyme modification. Inactivation of anthranilate synthase results from incorporation of approximately 1 eq of AT-125/enzyme protomer. Active site cysteine-83 in Serratia marcescens anthranilate synthase Component II is the residue alkylated by AT-125. Anthranilate synthase is rapidly inactivated by AT-125 IN S. marcescens cells. In vivo inactivation is by the same mechanism as in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2121468708,"Insulin release evoked by 2-ketoisocaproate from isolated rat pancreatic islets was inhibited by L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-norvaline, and L-norleucine. The stereo-specificity of the inhibition and the finding that the decrease in secretory rate was correlated to the capacity of these amino acids to undergo transamination with the keto acid secretagogue suggested that a branched chain amino acid aminotransferase enzyme was the site of interaction of these substrates. The stimulation of transamination by these amino acids was accompanied by a decrease in the primary decarboxylation and oxidation of 2-ketoisocaproate in the tissue and a reduction in islet acetoacetate production. The oxidation of the amino acid substrate was slightly increased in the presence of 2-ketoisocaproate. Nevertheless, the oxidation rate of exogenous substrates and respiration were higher in the presence of 2-ketoisocaproate than when this substrate was combined with an amino acid. The action of 2-ketoisocaproate to increase the ratios of NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+, to enhance the uptake of 45Ca by islet tissue, and to promote proinsulin biosynthesis was also suppressed by the addition of branched chain amino acids to the incubation media. Radioisotopic uptake measurements suggested that many of these observations could be related to changes in the intracellular concentration of 2-ketoisocaproate in islet tissue."

The RNAs were translated in the cell-free protein synthesis system from wheat germ, and the catalase T synthesized was isolated by immunoadsorption and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. Little or no catalase T product was detected with RNA from mutant cells grown in the absence of a heme precursor. As judged from in vitro translational capacity, RNA fractions from mutant cells grown in the presence of delta-aminolevulinate contained at least 10 times more catalase T mRNA than RNA from unsupplemented cells."
https://openalex.org/W33673584,"Abstract We have studied RNA synthesis in homogenates of nuclei manually isolated from mature oocytes of Xenopus laevis. Transcription of the endogenous template is completely resistant to alpha-amanitin and represents primarily transcription of the amplified ribosomal genes. Three lines of evidence demonstrate that RNA polymerase I is reinitiating RNA chains in this system. First, transcription continues in the homogenates for at least 8 h. During this time, 50 to 100 RNA copies are synthesized per gene. Second, inhibitors of initiation, such as heparin and sodium dodecyl sarcosinate, cause synthesis to plateau within 60 min with less than 15 RNA copies synthesized per gene. Third, incorporation of gamma-thio nucleoside triphosphates demonstrates that reinitiation is occurring. When RNA is synthesized in the presence of adenosine-5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) and guanosine-5'-O-(gamma-thiotriphosphate), 3 to 10% of the newly made RNA binds to a Hg-agarose affinity column. After 7.5 min of synthesis the gamma-thio-initiated RNA binding to Hg-agarose hybridizes exclusively to a restriction fragment contining the first 2250 base pairs of the gene. At longer times of synthesis, the gamma-thio-initiated RNA hybridizes more and more to a restriction fragment located further down the gene. The length distribution of this RNA on gels is consistent with its hybridizaton behavior and these data suggest an in vitro chain growth rate of 2 to 5 nucleotides/s. All of the gamma-thio-initiated RNA hybridizes to the H or coding strand of rDNA. The results are consistent with initiation in vitro occurring at the same site used in vivo. Addition of cloned ribosomal genes to the system causes no stimulation of transcription until it is added in a 4000-fold excess over the endogenous ribosomal genes. At that excess it is symmetrically transcribed by RNA polymerase III."

Commun. 86, 667-673) demonstrated that Proteinase I from the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, was conjugated with phosphoryl moieties. This report describes a characterization of the covalent structure of these moieties. Essentially all of the phosphate associated with purified enzyme was released as a sugar-phosphate during mild alkaline hydrolysis. The sugar-phosphate was isolated from alkaline hydrolysates of Proteinase I by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and identified as the alpha-anomer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate. In separate experiments, involving acid hydrolysis of Proteinase I, it was shown that enzyme-phosphate could also be isolated as O-phosphorylserine. Based on the recovery of O-phosphorylserine from acid hydrolysates, it was concluded that the majority of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate residues in the proteinase were esterified to peptidyl serines through phosphoester bonds."

This paper describes improved methodology for isolation of this aggregate, and we present three lines of evidence supporting a role for ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase in functioning of the presumed complex. 1) Ribonucleoside diphosphates are readily incorporated into DNA as deoxyribonucleotides in an in situ DNA-synthesizing system from T4 phage-infected cells. 2)Ribonucleotide reductase is associated with the complex, as shown by co-sedimentation of reductase activity with other activities in the multienzyme aggregate we have described. 3)Ribonucleotide reductase is kinetically coupled to at least four other enzymes involved in a sequential pathway. The aggregated enzymes catalyze the five-step conversion of uridine diphosphate to deoxythymidine triphosphate with but a brief lag before dTTP production reaches its maximal rate. These studies have also confirmed the existence of dCTPase-dUTPase and dCMP deaminase activities in the putative complex."

https://openalex.org/W1520491803,"The enzyme which oxidizes alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate to 14CO2 is activated by incubation of adipose tissue segments with insulin. A 3-fold reduction in the apparent Km of the enzyme for alpha-ketoisocaproate was observed when homogenates of adipose tissue segments treated with insulin were compared to homogenates of control tissues. The enzyme was assayed at various times after homogenization of adipose tissue segments. Relatively small changes were observed in the activity from control or insulin-treated tissues for 30 min after homogenization. The persistence of the insulin effect after homogenization suggests that insulin may cause a covalent modification of the enzyme. The possibility that alpha-ketoisocaproate is oxidized by pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is also stimulated by insulin, is unlikely since the enzyme responsible for oxidation of 14C-labeled branched chain alpha-keto acids can be inactivated by heat at a rate distinct from that of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Moreover, unlabeled branched chain alpha-keto acids inhibit the oxidation of alpha-keto[1-14C]isocaproate but not that of [1-14C]pyruvate. Branched chain alpha-keto acid hydrogenase can be activated by incubation of adipose tissue homogenates in the presence of magnesium chloride and in the absence of ATP. The addition of ATP plus an ATP-regenerating system reverses the activation of the enzyme. The apparent Km of the enzyme is reduced and the Vmax is increased by incubation of tissue extracts under appropriate conditions."

S-Adenosyl(5')-3-methylthiopropylamine exerts a competitive substrate inhibition by combining with the improper stable enzyme form, while putrescine does not show any inhibitory effect. In order to investigate the substrate binding sites, new sulfonium-deaminated analogs of S-adenosyl(5')-3-methylthiopropylamine have been synthesized and assayed as substrates and as inhibitors of the reaction. The replacement of the amino group of adenine, or propylamine moiety of the sulfonium compound by the hydroxyl group, or both, resulted in a complete loss of activity as substrate. On the other hand, the deaminated analogs exert a competitive inhibition with respect to putrescine. On the basis of these results and in analogy with methyltransfer reactions, three recognition sites for S-adenosyl(5')-3-methylthiopropylamine on propylamine transfer enzymes are proposed."

The number of initiated (active) ribosomes is limiting in a cell-free protein synthesis assay derived from the frozen preparation that measures completion of nascent polypeptide chains. When starved rats are killed 30 min after a single injection of insulin (0.8 unit, subcutaneously) there is a shift in the ribosomal distribution pattern (on sucrose density gradients) in the direction of larger polyribosomes. This is accompanied by a 2-fold increase in protein synthetic activity of fat cell ribosomes as measured in vitro. When isolated epididymal fat cells are treated with insulin, with or without added glucose, a 2-fold increase in the rate of incorporation of [3H]leucine into [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble protein is noted within 40 min. The parallel increases in the number of initiated ribosomes, in their synthetic activity in vitro, and in the apparent protein synthetic activity of the whole cell indicate a rapidly evolving action of insulin at the level of peptide chain initiation."

The different forms of S6 were purified and a new procedure capable of electrophoretically separating the five forms of S6 from total ribosomal protein was developed. The results from these experiments show for the first time that there are two copies of protein S6 per ribosome.
