https://openalex.org/W2031032073,"Microorganisms of lake sediment and sewage sludge anaerobically metabolized halobenzoates by a novel pathway. The primary degradative event was loss of the aryl halide without the alteration of the aromatic ring. Dehalogenation required strict anaerobic conditions and depended on the halogen and position, but not the number of halogen substituents. A stable methanogenic bacterial consortium was enriched from sludge and found capable of dehalogenating and often mineralizing a variety of halobenzoates to CH(4) and CO(2). The results suggest that reductive dehalogenation of aromatics could be important in removal of some chlorinated xenobiotics from the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1993433047,"Air pollutant emissions from portable convective and radiant kerosene space heaters were measured in an environmental chamber. Emission factors for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and oxygen depletion are presented. The data suggest that the use of such heaters in residences can result in exposures to air pollutants in excess of ambient air quality standards and in some cases in excess of occupational health standards."
https://openalex.org/W2031322567,"The rapid closure of leaves in the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) involves irreversible cell enlargement, which can be initiated by acidifying the cell walls to pH 4.50 and below. Leaves infiltrated with neutral buffers that keep the pH above 4.50 to 4.75 will not close in response to stimulation of their trigger hairs even though the action potentials that ordinarily cause closure are produced. During the 1 to 3 seconds required for closure about 29 percent of the cellular adenosine triphosphate is lost. It is likely that this adenosine triphosphate is used in very rapid transport of hydrogen ions from the motor cells and that the movement is due to a mechanism of ""acid growth."""
https://openalex.org/W2070054191,"Cellulose produced by Acetobacter xylinum was experimentally modified during its biosynthesis. In the presence of fluorescent brightening agents, such as Calcofluor White M2R or Tinopal LPW, nonmicrofibrillar sheets of cellulose were synthesized by the bacteria. These sheets could then be converted to fibrils by washing with distilled water. Possible mechanisms for these modifications of cellulose assembly are disscussed."

https://openalex.org/W2051754681,"Response is given to questions raised by L.E. LaChance, et al., regarding the types of screwworm that occur in Mexico and anatomical differences in male genitalia among types. Errors in chromosome length and arm ratios are discussed. Results of testing the V-81 strain (sterile males) indicate that mating barriers exist even at high release rates. Mating discrimination must be high for a population to withstand an excess of sterile flies. The relevance of this to eradication programs is discussed. (RJC)"

The attractant has been isolated and its structure identified as 1(3E, 5Z, 8Z)-undecatetraene (finavarrene). The relation of finavarrene to sex hormones in other brown algae is discussed."
