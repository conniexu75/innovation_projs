https://openalex.org/W4220668127,"Routine haplotype-resolved genome assembly from single samples remains an unresolved problem. Here we describe an algorithm that combines PacBio HiFi reads and Hi-C chromatin interaction data to produce a haplotype-resolved assembly without the sequencing of parents. Applied to human and other vertebrate samples, our algorithm consistently outperforms existing single-sample assembly pipelines and generates assemblies of similar quality to the best pedigree-based assemblies. Haplotype-resolved genome assemblies are generated by combining HiFi reads with Hi-C long-range interactions."

https://openalex.org/W4220802200,"Despite their clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for B cell malignancies are limited by lengthy, costly and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that might lead to cell products with heterogeneous composition. Here we describe an implantable Multifunctional Alginate Scaffold for T Cell Engineering and Release (MASTER) that streamlines in vivo CAR-T cell manufacturing and reduces processing time to a single day. When seeded with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD19-encoding retroviral particles, MASTER provides the appropriate interface for viral vector-mediated gene transfer and, after subcutaneous implantation, mediates the release of functional CAR-T cells in mice. We further demonstrate that in vivo-generated CAR-T cells enter the bloodstream and control distal tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of lymphoma, showing greater persistence than conventional CAR-T cells. MASTER promises to transform CAR-T cell therapy by fast-tracking manufacture and potentially reducing the complexity and resources needed for provision of this type of therapy. Implantable scaffolds rapidly generate and release anti-tumor CAR-T cells in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4221029336,"Technologies that profile chromatin modifications at single-cell resolution offer enormous promise for functional genomic characterization, but the sparsity of the measurements and integrating multiple binding maps represent substantial challenges. Here we introduce single-cell (sc)CUT&Tag-pro, a multimodal assay for profiling protein-DNA interactions coupled with the abundance of surface proteins in single cells. In addition, we introduce single-cell ChromHMM, which integrates data from multiple experiments to infer and annotate chromatin states based on combinatorial histone modification patterns. We apply these tools to perform an integrated analysis across nine different molecular modalities in circulating human immune cells. We demonstrate how these two approaches can characterize dynamic changes in the function of individual genomic elements across both discrete cell states and continuous developmental trajectories, nominate associated motifs and regulators that establish chromatin states and identify extensive and cell-type-specific regulatory priming. Finally, we demonstrate how our integrated reference can serve as a scaffold to map and improve the interpretation of additional scCUT&Tag datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4220937768,"The microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid butyrate is a central inhibitor of inflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses. Emerging evidence suggests that butyrate induces differentiation of IL-10-producing (IL-10 + ) regulatory B cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of butyrate-driven modulation of B cell differentiation are not fully defined. Given the dominant role of regulatory plasma cells (PCs) as the main source of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10 and the observation that butyrate also induces the differentiation of PCs, we here investigated the effect of the microbial metabolite butyrate on the induction of regulatory IL-10 + PCs and underlying mechanisms. Here we show that butyrate induces the differentiation of IL-10 + IgM + PCs. Ex vivo , butyrate, but hardly propionate, another microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid, induced the differentiation of IL-10 + IgM + CD138 high PCs from isolated splenic murine B cells. In vivo , administration of butyrate via drinking water or by daily intraperitoneal injection increased the number of IL-10 + IgM + CD138 high PCs in the spleens of Ovalbumin (Ova)/complete Freund’s adjuvant-immunized mice. The induction of these regulatory PCs was associated with an increase of anti-Ova IgM, but a reduction of anti-Ova class-switched pathogenic IgG2b serum antibodies. Based on the knowledge that butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs) thereby increasing histone acetylation, we identified here that HDAC3 inhibition was sufficient to induce PC differentiation and IL-10 + expression. Furthermore, reduced mitochondrial superoxide levels following butyrate treatment and HDAC3 inhibition were necessary for PC differentiation, but not IL-10 expression. In summary, the microbial metabolite butyrate promotes the differentiation of IgM + PCs and their expression of IL-10. HDAC3 inhibition may be involved as an underlying pathway for both PC differentiation and IL-10 expression, while reduced mitochondrial superoxide levels are crucial only for PC differentiation. The induction of regulatory IL-10 + IgM + PCs and the inhibition of class switching to antigen-specific pathogenic IgG subclasses might represent important pathways of butyrate to limit inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220928822,"The gender gap is a well-known problem in academia and, despite its gradual narrowing, recent estimations indicate that it will persist for decades. Short-term descriptive studies suggest that this gap may have actually worsened during the months of confinement following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on female and male academics' research productivity using preprint drop-off data. We examine a total of 307,902 unique research articles deposited in 5 major preprint repositories during the period between January and May each year from 2017 to 2020. We find that the proportion of female authors in online repositories steadily increased over time; however, the trend reversed during the confinement and gender parity worsened in two respects. First, the proportion of male authors in preprints increased significantly during lockdown. Second, the proportion of male authors in COVID-19-related articles was significantly higher than that of women. Overall, our results imply that the gender gap in academia suffered an approximately 1-year setback during the strict lockdown months of 2020, and COVID-related research areas suffered an additional 1.5-year setback."

https://openalex.org/W4220826664,"Oxidative stress is a defining feature of most cancers, including those that stem from carcinogenic infections. Reactive oxygen species can drive tumor formation, yet the molecular oxidation events that contribute to tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Here we show that inactivation of a single, redox-sensitive cysteine in the host protease legumain, which is oxidized during infection with the gastric cancer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori, accelerates tumor growth. By using chemical proteomics to map cysteine reactivity in human gastric cells, we determined that H. pylori infection induces oxidation of legumain at Cys219. Legumain oxidation dysregulates intracellular legumain processing and decreases the activity of the enzyme in H. pylori-infected cells. We further show that the site-specific loss of Cys219 reactivity increases tumor growth and mortality in a xenograft model. Our findings establish a link between an infection-induced oxidation site and tumorigenesis while underscoring the importance of cysteine reactivity in tumor growth﻿. Chemical proteomics analysis of human gastric cells revealed that infection with the stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori decreases reactivity of legumain Cys219, which alters legumain processing and promotes xenograft tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W4226358799,"Heat stress causes many pathophysiological responses in the brain, including neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. β-Hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of BHBA on neuroinflammation induced by heat stress, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Mice were pretreated with vehicle, BHBA or minocycline (positive control group) and followed by heat exposure (43°C) for 15 min for 14 days. In mice subjected to heat stress, we found that treatment with BHBA or minocycline significantly decreased the level of serum cortisol, the expressions of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and the density of c-Fos+ cells in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, the ethological tests revealed that heat stress led to cognitive dysfunctions and could be alleviated by BHBA and minocycline administration. Further investigation showed that BHBA and minocycline significantly attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocyte induced by heat stress. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated in the hippocampus by BHBA and minocycline treatment. Importantly, compared with the heat stress group, mice in the BHBA treatment group and positive control group experienced a decrease in the expressions of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phospho-p38 (p-p38), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). Our results elucidated that BHBA inhibits neuroinflammation induced by heat stress by suppressing the activation of microglia and astrocyte, and modulating TLR4/p38 MAPK and NF-κB pathways. This study provides new evidence that BHBA is a potential strategy for protecting animals from heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W4225372947,"Alpinetin is a plant flavonoid isolated from Alpinia katsumadai Hayata with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Monocyte infiltration into the intima promotes atherosclerotic development and causes plaque instability at the later stage, which is profoundly influenced by various oxidants. In this study, we investigated whether alpinetin restores the redox state to inhibit monocyte infiltration and ameliorates atherosclerosis. ApoE-deficient (ApoE-/- ) mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with alpinetin. We found that alpinetin significantly attenuated atherosclerotic lesions and reduced necrotic core size associated with the reduction in infiltrated macrophages within the plaques. Alpinetin inhibited macrophage adhesion and migration, and the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules, such as MCP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Intraplaque MMP2 and MMP9 were reduced, while collagen contents were increased and elastin fiber was prevented from degradation in the alpinetin-treated mice. Data further showed that alpinetin reduced reactive oxygen species generation and promoted thiol-dependent glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant systems in macrophages. Alpinetin activated Nfr2, an upstream activator of the thiol-dependent redox signaling by increasing the nuclear translocation. The nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 was enhanced by reducing nuclear export, which was achieved through the regulation of the GSk3β/Fyn pathway. Finally, inhibition of Nrf2 in HFD-apoE-/- mice blockaded the effect of alpinetin, which increased aortic macrophage recruitment and aggravated atherosclerosis concurrently with elevating the expression of MCP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Altogether, these findings indicated that alpinetin improved Nrf2-mediated redox homeostasis, which consequently inhibited macrophage infiltration and atherosclerosis, suggesting a useful compound for treating atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W4220701045,"Several SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged that harbor mutations in the surface unit of the viral spike (S) protein that enhance infectivity and transmissibility. Here, we analyzed whether ten naturally-occurring mutations found within the extended loop harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site of the S protein, a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism and pathogenicity, impact S protein processing and function. None of the mutations increased but several decreased S protein cleavage at the S1/S2 site, including S686G and P681H, the latter of which is found in variants of concern B.1.1.7 (Alpha variant) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron variant). None of the mutations reduced ACE2 binding and cell-cell fusion although several modulated the efficiency of host cell entry. The effects of mutation S686G on viral entry were cell-type dependent and could be linked to the availability of cathepsin L for S protein activation. These results show that polymorphisms at the S1/S2 site can modulate S protein processing and host cell entry."
https://openalex.org/W4225497234,"Proanthocyanidins (PAC) are dietary polyphenols with putative anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, whether dietary PAC can regulate type-2 immune function and inflammation at mucosal surfaces remains unclear. Here, we investigated if diets supplemented with purified PAC modulated pulmonary and intestinal mucosal immune responses during infection with the helminth parasite Ascaris suum in pigs. A. suum infection induced a type-2 biased immune response in lung and intestinal tissues, characterized by pulmonary granulocytosis, increased Th2/Th1 T cell ratios in tracheal-bronchial lymph nodes, intestinal eosinophilia, and modulation of genes involved in mucosal barrier function and immunity. Whilst PAC had only minor effects on pulmonary immune responses, RNA-sequencing of intestinal tissues revealed that dietary PAC significantly enhanced transcriptional responses related to immune function and antioxidant responses in the gut of both naïve and A. suum-infected animals. A. suum infection and dietary PAC induced distinct changes in gut microbiota composition, primarily in the jejunum and colon, respectively. Notably, PAC consumption substantially increased the abundance of Limosilactobacillus reuteri. In vitro experiments with porcine macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells supported a role for both PAC polymers and PAC-derived microbial metabolites in regulating oxidative stress responses in host tissues. Thus, dietary PAC may have distinct beneficial effects on intestinal health during infection with mucosal pathogens, while having a limited activity to modulate naturally-induced type-2 pulmonary inflammation. Our results shed further light on the mechanisms underlying the health-promoting properties of PAC-rich foods, and may aid in the design of novel dietary supplements to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses in the gastrointestinal tract."
https://openalex.org/W4220657621,"Anthropogenic changes can have dramatic effects on wild populations. Moreover, by promoting the emergence of vector-borne diseases in many ecosystems, those changes can lead to local extinction of native wildlife. One of those diseases, avian malaria, has been shown to be on the rise in New Zealand, threatening native bird species that are among the most extinction-prone in the world. It is thus of prime importance to better understand the potential cascading effects that anthropogenic modifications have on those fragile species. Here, we aim to test how long-lasting modification to regional environmental filters can subsequently alter local biotic filters, in turn promoting the emergence of avian malaria in New Zealand avian communities. To this end, we used Bayesian structural equation modelling to unravel the drivers of disease emergence within the complex interplay between landscape and local species pools. We show that altered landscape, quantified through a lower enhanced vegetation index, leads to more infections in Turdus spp. and modification in avian community composition, potentially raising the probability of infection for other species in the community. In addition, we show that climatic variables associated with the presence of vectors play a predominant role in shaping the regional pattern of avian malaria occurrence. Our results suggest long-lasting impacts of anthropogenic changes on regional environmental filters and demonstrate that conservation efforts should align toward restoring the landscape to prevent further emergence of infectious diseases in wild ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4220758643,"The prevalence of both obesity and myopia are increasing in Korean children and adolescents. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of obesity on the prevalence of myopia in Korean children and adolescents.This study used the data of a nationally representative cross-sectional survey, the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) VII conducted from 2016 to 2018. Of the 1237 children and adolescents aged 5-18 years who participated in the KNHANES VII and underwent ophthalmologic examinations for the survey, 1114 were selected for review, excluding those whose data on refractive error, family history of myopia, or waist circumference were missing. Body mass index (BMI) was classified into four groups: underweight (< 5th percentile), normal weight (≥ 5th percentile, < 85th percentile), overweight (≥ 85th percentile, < 95th percentile), and obese (≥ 95th percentile). Myopia was defined by the level of refractive error ≤ -0.5 diopters (D) and classified as mild (≤ -0.5 D, > -3.0 D), moderate (≤ -3.0 D, > -6.0 D), or high (≤ -6.0 D) myopia. The relationship between BMI and myopia was analyzed using complex sample logistic regression. Age and family history were corrected followed by an analysis of the odds ratios.Compared to those with normal weights (controls), being underweight, overweight, or obese showed no significant odds of developing mild and moderate myopia. Conversely, when compared with that of controls, the odds ratio of developing high myopia in the underweight, overweight, and obese groups was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.22-2.65), 1.37 (95% CI, 0.51-3.66), and 3.77 (95% CI, 1.98-7.16), respectively. Furthermore, in a separate analysis by sex and BMI, the odds ratio of developing high myopia was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.10-7.35) in boys with obesity and 4.23 (95% CI,1.19-15.09) and 5.04 (95% CI,1.77-14.34) in overweight and obese girls, respectively.An association exists between obesity in childhood and adolescence and high myopia. Being overweight in girls was also found to be associated with high myopia. Thus, efforts to maintain a healthy weight during childhood and adolescence are of great importance."
https://openalex.org/W4220849133,"The axial force of steel bracing is one of the essential indexes to measure the stability of the bracing system of a foundation pit. The steel bracing system of a foundation pit in Ningbo City, China was taken as the research object to guarantee the stability of the steel bracing system of the foundation pit. Besides, the change of axial force between the two steel bracing structures was analyzed to predict the axial force data of the steel bracing and perform the safety forewarning of the steel bracing system. Firstly, GM (1,1) and Verhulst models in the gray model were selected for prediction based on the characteristics of poor information and the small sample size of original monitoring data of the steel bracing. Secondly, the precision of the GM (1,1) model and Verhulst model was compared to determine a more accurate prediction method. Finally, the safety forewarning model of the confidence interval estimation method was established based on the data obtained from the prediction model and the deformation characteristics and indexes of the steel bracing. With the significance levels α = 5% and α = 2% as the demarcating points, the forewarning grades of the steel bracing system of the deep foundation pit were divided, and then the operating state of the current steel bracing system was determined. The results demonstrated that the Verhulst model had better prediction precision compared with the ordinary GM (1, 1) model. Besides, the steel bracing system was in the safe operation range, and the judgment results of the model were consistent with the actual situation of the foundation pit of the steel bracing system. Thus, the Verhulst prediction model and the confidence interval security early forewarning model could be used to judge the stability of the steel bracing system."
https://openalex.org/W4220872566,"In annual plants, tight coordination of successive developmental events is of primary importance to optimize performance under fluctuating environmental conditions. The recent finding of the genetic interaction of WRKY53, a key senescence-related gene with REVOLUTA, a master regulator of early leaf patterning, raises the question of how early and late developmental events are connected. Here, we investigated the developmental and metabolic consequences of an alteration of the REVOLUTA and WRKY53 gene expression, from seedling to fruiting. Our results show that REVOLUTA critically controls late developmental phases and reproduction while inversely WRKY53 determines vegetative growth at early developmental stages. We further show that these regulators of distinct developmental phases frequently, but not continuously, interact throughout ontogeny and demonstrated that their genetic interaction is mediated by the salicylic acid (SA). Moreover, we showed that REVOLUTA and WRKY53 are keys regulatory nodes of development and plant immunity thought their role in SA metabolic pathways, which also highlights the role of REV in pathogen defence. Together, our findings demonstrate how late and early developmental events are tightly intertwined by molecular hubs. These hubs interact with each other throughout ontogeny, and participate in the interplay between plant development and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4220904653,"Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a histopathologically-defined, potentially premalignant condition of the oral cavity. The rate of transformation to frank carcinoma is relatively low (12% within 2 years) and prediction based on histopathological grade is unreliable, leading to both over- and under-treatment. Alternative approaches include infrared (IR) spectroscopy, which is able to classify cancerous and non-cancerous tissue in a number of cancers, including oral. The aim of this study was to explore the capability of FTIR (Fourier-transform IR) microscopy and machine learning as a means of predicting malignant transformation of OED. Supervised, retrospective analysis of longitudinally-collected OED biopsy samples from 17 patients with high risk OED lesions: 10 lesions transformed and 7 did not over a follow-up period of more than 3 years. FTIR spectra were collected from routine, unstained histopathological sections and machine learning used to predict malignant transformation, irrespective of OED classification. PCA-LDA (principal component analysis followed by linear discriminant analysis) provided evidence that the subsequent transforming status of these 17 lesions could be predicted from FTIR data with a sensitivity of 79 ± 5% and a specificity of 76 ± 5%. Six key wavenumbers were identified as most important in this classification. Although this pilot study used a small cohort, the strict inclusion criteria and classification based on known outcome, rather than OED grade, make this a novel study in the field of FTIR in oral cancer and support the clinical potential of this technology in the surveillance of OED."
https://openalex.org/W4220948002,"Adults with intellectual disability have high health care needs. Despite frequent contact with health services, they often receive inadequate health care. One method to improve health care delivery is reasonable adjustments, that is, the adaptation of health care delivery such that barriers to participation are removed for the person with disability. A starting point for the provision of reasonable adjustments is recognition of intellectual disability during the health care contact. To determine rates and predictors of the recognition of intellectual disability during hospital admissions, and its impact on admission metrics, we examined a population of adults with intellectual disability identified from disability services datasets from New South Wales, Australia between 2005 and 2014. Recognition of intellectual disability was determined by the recording of an International Classification of Diseases 10 th revision (ICD-10) diagnostic code for intellectual disability during a given hospital admission. We examined how recognition of intellectual disability related to length of hospital episodes. We found an overall low rate of recognition of intellectual disability (23.79%) across all hospital episodes, with the proportion of hospital episodes recognising intellectual disability decreasing from 2005–2015. Admissions for adults with complex health profiles (e.g., those with many comorbidities, those with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and those admitted for urgent treatment) were more likely to recognise intellectual disability, but admissions for adults with complexity in other domains (i.e., for those in custody, or those with drug and alcohol disorders) were less likely to recognise intellectual disability. Recognition of intellectual disability was associated with longer episodes of care, possibly indicating the greater provision of reasonable adjustments. To improve the recognition of intellectual disability for adults during health service contacts, we advocate for the implementation of targeted initiatives (such as a nationwide disability flag to be included in health service records) to improve the provision of reasonable adjustments."
https://openalex.org/W4221090125,"CRISPR/LbCas12a system (LbCpf1) has been widely used for genome modification including plant species. However, the efficiency of CRISPR/LbCas12a varied considerably in different plant species and tissues, and the editing efficiency needs to be further improved. In this study, we tried to improve the editing efficiency of CRISPR/LbCas12a in Arabidopsis by optimizing the crRNA expression strategies and Pol II promoters. Notably, the combination of tRNA-crRNA fusion strategy and RPS5A promoter in CRISPR/LbCas12a system has highest editing efficiency, while CRISPR/LbCas12a driven by EC1f-in(crR)p had the highest ratio of homozygous &amp; bi‐allelic mutants. In addition, all homozygous &amp; bi‐allelic mutants can be stably inherited to the next generation and have no phenotypic separation. In this study, the editing efficiency of the CRISPR/LbCas12a system was improved by selecting the optimal crRNA expression strategies and promoter of LbCas12a in Arabidopsis , which will prove useful for optimization of CRISPR/LbCas12a methods in other plants."
https://openalex.org/W4220670592,"Although pentoxifylline (PTX) was identified as a competitive non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, its pharmacological effect has not been clearly elucidated. The present study explored the effect of low dose 10 μg/mL PTX (therapeutic dose) compared to high dose 300 μg/mL PTX (experimental dose) in RAW 264.7 cells through immunoprecipitation-based high performance liquid chromatography (IP-HPLC), immunohistochemistry, and western blot. 10 μg/mL PTX increased the expression of proliferation (Ki-67, PCNA, cyclin D2, cdc25A), epigenetic modification (KDM4D, PCAF, HMGB1), protein translation (DOHH, DHPS, eIF5A1), RAS signaling (KRAS, pAKT1/2/3, PI3K), NFkB signaling (NFkB, GADD45, p38), protection (HSP70, SOD1, GSTO1/2), survival (pAKT1/2/3, SP1, sirtuin 6), neuromuscular differentiation (NSEγ, myosin-1a, desmin), osteoblastic differentiation (BMP2, RUNX2, osterix), acute inflammation (TNFα, IL-1, CXCR4), innate immunity (β-defensin 1, lactoferrin, TLR-3, -4), cell-mediated immunity (CD4, CD8, CD80), while decreased the expression of ER stress (eIF2α, eIF2AK3, ATF6α), fibrosis (FGF2, CTGF, collagen 3A1), and chronic inflammation (CD68, MMP-2, -3, COX2) versus the untreated controls. The activation of proliferation by 10 μg/mL PTX was also supported by the increase of cMyc-MAX heterodimer and β-catenin-TCF1 complex in double IP-HPLC. 10 μg/mL PTX enhanced FAS-mediated apoptosis but diminished p53-mediated apoptosis, and downregulated many angiogenesis proteins (angiogenin, VEGF-A, and FLT4), but upregulated HIF1α, VEGFR2, and CMG2 reactively. Whereas, 300 μg/mL PTX consistently decreased proliferation, epigenetic modification, RAS and NFkB signaling, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, but increased apoptosis, ER stress, and fibrosis compared to 10 μg/mL PTX. These data suggest PTX has different biological effect on RWA 264.7 cells depending on the concentration of 10 μg/mL and 300 μg/mL PTX. The low dose 10 μg/mL PTX enhanced RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, particularly, it stimulated neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, innate immunity, and cell-mediated immunity, but attenuated ER stress, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation, while the high dose 300 μg/mL PTX was found to alleviate the 10 μg/mL PTX-induced biological effects, resulted in the suppression of RAS/NFkB signaling, proliferation, neuromuscular and osteoblastic differentiation, and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220706028,"Flow is a highly focussed state of consciousness that is rewarding, fulfilling, and sought after by many, especially musicians. It is characterised by exceptional levels of concentration, loss of self-consciousness, and competent control over one's actions. Several personality and non-cognitive traits have been positively linked with flow proneness, such as emotional intelligence; however, anxiety is thought to be the antithesis of flow, yet the relationship between trait anxiety and flow proneness in musicians is not adequately characterised. This study investigated the individual differences in flow proneness in contemporary musicians (N = 664), focusing on the interaction of trait anxiety and emotional intelligence. We identified a significant negative correlation between trait anxiety and flow. Emotional intelligence was positively correlated with flow proneness and negatively with trait anxiety. Moderation analysis revealed a difference in the relationship between trait anxiety and flow depending on the level of emotional intelligence; there was no correlation in those with low emotional intelligence, whereas a strong negative relationship was found in those with high emotional intelligence. Finally, hierarchical regression indicated that musical training was the most substantial predictor of all the tested variables and that trait anxiety did not add any predictive power on top of the known predictors. Altogether, this study provided new insights into the possible disruption of flow proneness linked to high anxiety and low emotional intelligence in contemporary musicians."
https://openalex.org/W4220730299,"We aimed to evaluate the incidence rates between 2010 and 2015 for invasive cervical cancer (ICC), breast cancer (BC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) in people living with HIV (PLWH) in France, and to compare them with those in the French general population. These cancers are targeted by the national cancer-screening program.This is a retrospective study based on the longitudinal data of the French Dat'AIDS cohort.Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for ICC and BC, and incidence rates for all three cancers were calculated overall and for specific sub-populations according to nadir CD4 cell count, HIV transmission category, HIV diagnosis period, and HCV coinfection.The 2010-2015 CRC incidence rate was 25.0 [95% confidence interval (CI): 18.6-33.4] per 100,000 person-years, in 44,642 PLWH (both men and women). Compared with the general population, the ICC incidence rate was significantly higher in HIV-infected women both overall (SIR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.18-3.14) and in the following sub-populations: nadir CD4 ≤ 200 cells/mm3 (SIR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.45-4.74), HIV transmission through intravenous drug use (SIR = 5.14, 95% CI: 1.93-13.70), HCV coinfection (SIR = 3.52, 95% CI: 1.47-8.47) and HIV diagnosis before 2000 (SIR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.07-3.97). Conversely, the BC incidence rate was significantly lower in the study sample than in the general population (SIR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.73).The present study showed no significant linear trend between 2010 and 2015 in the incidence rates of the three cancers explored in the PLWH study sample. Specific recommendations for ICC screening are still required for HIV-infected women and should focus on sub-populations at greatest risk."
https://openalex.org/W4220762279,"Women wearing makeup are perceived by others as more attractive, competent, dominant, and more socially prestigious. Individuals differ in how much and how frequently they use makeup. Some studies show that women with lower self-esteem use more makeup, probably to hide imperfections. However, women with higher self-esteem can also use makeup to attract attention. This study verified whether social and general self-esteem and body image are associated with makeup usage in Brazilian women. We collected data from 1,483 women (Mage = 31.08; SD = 11.15) about body image (appearance orientation and appearance evaluation), social self-esteem, general self-esteem, and makeup usage (frequency of makeup usage, time spent applying makeup per day, and money spent on makeup per month). Appearance orientation positively predicted frequency of makeup usage, time spent applying makeup, and money spent on makeup, whereas appearance evaluation inversely predicted money spent on makeup per month. Social self-esteem and general self-esteem also positively predicted money spent on makeup, but in different directions. The results suggest that the significance given to appearance and social interactions are importantly associated with makeup usage in women."
https://openalex.org/W4220824429,"We examine the association between on-farm production diversity on household dietary diversity in Malawi using microdata collected as part of an environmentally sustainable agricultural intensification program. The program primarily focuses on the integration of legumes into the cropping system through maize-legume intercropping and legume-legume intercropping. Relative to staple cereals such as maize, legumes are rich in micronutrients, contain better-quality protein, and lead to nitrogen fixation. Given the systematic difference we document between program beneficiaries and randomly sampled non-beneficiary (control) households, we employ causal instrumental variables mediation analysis to account for non-random selection and possible simultaneity between production and consumption decisions. We find a significant positive treatment effect on dietary diversity, led by an increase in production diversity. Analysis of potential pathways show that effects on dietary diversity stem mostly from consumption of diverse food items purchased from the market made possible through higher agricultural income. These findings highlight that, while increasing production for markets can enhance dietary diversity through higher income that would make affordable an expanded set of food items, the production of more nutritious crops such as pulses may not necessarily translate into greater own consumption. This may be due to the persistence of dietary habits, tastes, or other local factors that favor consumption of staples such as maize and encourage sales of more profitable and nutritious food items such as pulses. Pulses are a more affordable and environmentally sustainable source of protein than animal source food, and efforts should be made to enhance their nutritional awareness and contribution to sustainable food systems and healthier diets."

Retinal and choroidal blood flow (RBF and ChBF, respectively) were measured at 4, 6, and 9 months of age by MRI. Blood flow was additionally measured under hypercapnia challenge (5% CO2 inhalation) to assess vascular reactivity. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a rebound tonometer at the same time points. Scotopic flash electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded at 9 months of age.Both ChBF and RBF were reduced and significantly affected by age (p < 0.01), but neither were significantly affected by O2-treatment (p > 0.05). ChBF significantly increased in response to hypercapnia (p < 0.01), which was also unaffected by O2-treatment. Significant effects of age (p < 0.001) and of the interaction of age with treatment (p = 0.028) were found on IOP. IOP significantly decreased in O2-treated mice at 6 months compared to 4 months of age (p < 0.001), while IOP trended to increase with age in untreated mice. The amplitude of the b-wave from ERG was significantly increased in O2-treated DBA/2J compared to the untreated mice (p = 0.012), while the a-wave and oscillatory potentials were not significantly affected (p > 0.05).This study investigated the effects of chronic mild hyperoxia on retinal function and on retinal and choroidal blood flow in a mouse model of glaucoma. Retinal function was improved in the O2-treated mice at late stage, despite a progressive decline of RBF and ChBF with age that was comparable to untreated mice."
https://openalex.org/W4220834637,"Primary antibody deficiencies (PADs) without an identified monogenetic origin form the largest and most heterogeneous group of primary immunodeficiencies. These patients often remain undiagnosed for years and many present to medical attention in adulthood after several infections risking structural complications. Not much is known about their treatment, comorbidities, or prognosis, nor whether the various immunological forms (decreased total IgG, IgG subclass(es), IgM, IgA, specific antibody responses, alone or in combination(s)) should be considered as separate, clearly definable subgroups. The unclassified primary antibody deficiency (unPAD) study aims to describe in detail all PAD patients without an identified specific monogenetic defect regarding their demographical, clinical, and immunological characteristics at presentation and during follow-up. In constructing these patterns, the unPAD study aims to reduce the number of missed and unidentified PAD patients in the future. In addition, this study will focus on subclassifying unPAD to support the identification of patients at higher risk for infection or immune dysregulation related complications, enabling the development of personalized follow-up and treatment plans.We present a protocol for a multicenter observational cohort study using the ESID online Registry. Patients of all ages who have given informed consent for participation in the ESID online Registry and fulfill the ESID Clinical Working Definitions for 'unclassified antibody deficiency', 'deficiency of specific IgG', 'IgA with IgG subclass deficiency', 'isolated IgG subclass deficiency', 'selective IgM deficiency', 'selective IgA deficiency' or 'common variable immunodeficiency' will be included. For all patients, basic characteristics can be registered at first registration and yearly thereafter in level 1 forms. Detailed characteristics of the patients can be registered in level 2 forms. Consecutive follow-up forms can be added indefinitely. To ensure the quality of the collected data, all data will be fully monitored before they are exported from the ESID online Registry for analysis. Outcomes will be the clinical and immunological characteristics of unPAD at presentation and during follow-up. Subgroup analyses will be made based on demographical, clinical and immunological characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4220836337,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which makes up the majority of lung cancers, remains one of the deadliest malignancies in the world. It has a poor prognosis due to its late detection and lack of response to chemoradiaiton. Therefore, it is urgent to find a new prognostic marker.We evaluated biological function and immune cell infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients from TCGA and GEO databases between different clusters based on autophagy related hub genes. Autophagy scores were used to assess the degree of autophagy in each individual by using component analysis.Three different clusters were obtained. Gene set variation analysis, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis and survive analysis showed differences among these three clusters. We demonstrated that the autophagy score of each patient could predict tumor stage and prognosis. Patients with a high autophagy score had a better prognosis, higher immune infiltration, and were more sensitive to immunotherapy and conventional chemotherapy.It was uncovered that autophagy played an irreplaceable role in NSCLC. Quantified autophagy scores for each NSCLC patient would help guide effective treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220881977,"Although antiretroviral therapy has significantly altered the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus infection and improved the quality of life of patients, there are conflicting reports regarding its impact on hematological outcomes. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the prevalence and predictors of anemia among adults on antiretroviral therapy in Northeast Ethiopia.A retrospective cohort study was carried out among adults who began antiretroviral treatment between September 2005 and January 2019 at two governmental hospitals in Dessie town. Data were collected from patients' medical records using a pretested data extraction instrument. Anemia was the primary outcome variable of the study. It was defined based on WHO criteria after adjustment for altitude and smoking status of measured values. Data were entered and validated using EpiData Version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS Version 20.0 for analysis. Descriptive analysis was done for prevalence and binary logistic regression was carried out to assess whether covariates were associated with experiencing anemia. Statistical significance has been considered at p-value <0.05.Medical records of 392 patients (mean age: 35.58 ± 9.46 years) were reviewed. Of the total 392 patients, 218 (55.6%) were females, 261 (66.6%) were categorized under WHO clinical stage III/IV and 134 (34.2%) had a baseline CD4 cell count of <100 cells/mm3. The mean baseline CD4 cell count was 179 cells/mm3 (range: 2 to 853 cells) and 230 (58.7%) of the participants were on zidovudine-based regimen. Anemia was diagnosed among 162 (41.3%) patients. After adjustment for other confounding factors, risk of anemia was significantly associated with low baseline CD4 cell count (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.05-3.06) and tenofovir based regimen (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21). On the other hand, being educated was found to be protective (AOR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.78).In this research, the prevalence of anemia was relatively high. Low baseline CD4 cell count and tenofovir based regimen were independent predictors of anemia; while being educated was protective. Treatment programs should focus on early diagnosis and treatment of HIV as well as routine screening and proper treatment of anemia."
https://openalex.org/W4220940495,"Decreased serum sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has been reported in severe malaria patients, but the expression of receptors and enzymes associated with S1P has not been investigated in the liver of malaria patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the expression of sphingosine kinase (SphK) and S1P receptors (S1PRs) in the liver of malaria-infected mice. C57BL/6 male mice were divided into a control group (n = 10) and a Plasmodium berghei (PbA)-infected group (n = 10). Mice in the malaria group were intraperitoneally injected with 1×10 6 P . berghei ANKA-infected red blood cells, whereas control mice were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline. Liver tissues were collected on Day 13 of the experiment to evaluate histopathological changes by hematoxylin and eosin staining and to investigate SphK and S1PR expression by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Histological examination of liver tissues from the PbA-infected group revealed sinusoidal dilatation, hemozoin deposition, portal tract inflammation and apoptotic hepatocytes, which were absent in the control group. Immunohistochemical staining showed significant increases in the expression of SphK1 and SphK2 and significant decreases in the expression of S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 in the endothelium, hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells in liver tissue from the PbA-infected group compared with the control group. Real-time PCR analysis showed the upregulation of SphK1 and the downregulation of S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 in the liver in the PbA-infected group compared with the control group. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that SphK1 mRNA expression is upregulated and that S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 expression is decreased in the liver tissue of PbA-infected mice. Our findings suggest that the decreased levels of S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 might play an important role in liver injury during malaria infection."

In this paper, we alternatively consider all individual preferences among these three sub-indices, the performance results of which are obtained by means of a sophisticated manner. The entropy values of these performance results are derived to reduce the information redundancy.

https://openalex.org/W4220697046,"Small RHO-type G-proteins act as signaling hubs and master regulators of polarity in eukaryotic cells. Their activity is tightly controlled, as defective RHO signaling leads to aberrant growth and developmental defects. Two major processes regulate G-protein activity: canonical shuttling between different nucleotide bound states and posttranslational modification (PTM), of which the latter can support or suppress RHO signaling, depending on the individual PTM. In plants, regulation of Rho of plants (ROPs) signaling activity has been shown to act through nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis, as well as through lipid modification, but there is little data available on phosphorylation or ubiquitination of ROPs. Hence, we applied proteomic analyses to identify PTMs of the barley ROP RACB. We observed in vitro phosphorylation by barley ROP binding kinase 1 and in vivo ubiquitination of RACB. Comparative analyses of the newly identified RACB phosphosites and human RHO protein phosphosites revealed conservation of modified amino acid residues, but no overlap of actual phosphorylation patterns. However, the identified RACB ubiquitination site is conserved in all ROPs from Hordeum vulgare, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa and in mammalian Rac1 and Rac3. Point mutation of this ubiquitination site leads to stabilization of RACB. Hence, this highly conserved lysine residue may regulate protein stability across different kingdoms."
https://openalex.org/W4220733738,"The countermovement jump (CMJ) has been suggested to be an important test of neuromuscular performance for rugby league (RL) players. Identifying force platform-derived CMJ variables that may be more applicable to RL positions (e.g., forwards and backs) has yet to be fully explored in the scientific literature. The aim of this study was to identify RL position-specific CMJ force-time variables. Specifically, we aimed to compare select force-time variables from the countermovement (i.e., the combination of unweighting and braking) and propulsion phases of the CMJ between the global forwards and backs positional groups. We also aimed to compare typical (i.e., jump height) and alternative (i.e., take-off momentum) outcome CMJ variables between positional groups. Finally, we sought to visually present each individual player's CMJ performance alongside the average data to facilitate the interpretation and reporting of the CMJ performances of RL athletes. Twenty-seven forwards and twenty-seven backs who competed in the senior men's English RL Championship, performed three CMJs on a force platform at the beginning of the pre-season training period. There were no significant differences in any countermovement or propulsion phase variable between positions with just small effect sizes noted (P ≥0.09, d ≤0.46). Jump height (and so take-off velocity) was significantly greater for backs with moderate effects displayed (P = 0.03, d = 0.60). Take-off momentum (take-off velocity × body mass) was largely and significantly greater for forwards (P<0.01, d = 1.01). There was considerable overlap of individual player's body mass and CMJ outcome variables across positions, despite significant differences in the mean values attained by each positional group. The results suggest that it may be beneficial for RL practitioners to identify player-specific, or at least position-specific, variables. As a minimum, it may be worthwhile selecting CMJ force-time variables based on what is considered important to individual player's or small clusters of similar players' projected successes during RL competition."
https://openalex.org/W4220742365,"Human hair absorbs numerous biomolecules from the body during its growth. This can act as a fingerprint to determine substance intake of an individual, which can be useful in forensic studies. The cocaine concentration profile along the growth axis of hair indicates the time evolution of the metabolic incorporation of cocaine usage. It could be either assessed by chemical extraction and further analysis of hair bundels, or by direct single hair fibre analysis with mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI). Within this work, we analyzed the cocaine distribution in individual hair samples using MeV-SIMS. Unlike conventional surface analysis methods, we demonstrate high yields of nonfragmented molecular ions from the surface of biological materials, resulting in high chemical sensitivity and non-destructive characterisation. Hair samples were prepared by longitudinally cutting along the axis of growth, leaving half-cylindrical shape to access the interior structure of the hair by the probing ion beam, and attached to the silicon wafer. A focused 5.8 MeV 35 Cl 6+ beam was scanned across the intact, chemically pristine hair structure. A non-fragmented protonated [M+ H] + cocaine molecular peak at m / z = 304 was detected and localized along the cross-section of the hair. Its intensity exhibits strong fluctuations along the direction of the hair’s growth, with pronounced peaks as narrow as 50 micrometres, corresponding to a metabolic incorporation time of approx. three hours."

https://openalex.org/W4220934193,"In November 2018, the Camp Fire devastated the mountain community of Paradise, CA. The burning of plastic pipes, wiring, construction materials, paint, and car batteries released toxic chemicals into the environment, contaminating the air, soil, and local waterways. Examples of toxins that were identified in the creeks and waterways in and around Paradise included pentachlorophenol (PCP), chrysene, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The effects of some of these chemicals on embryonic development, hematopoiesis (blood formation), and the immune system have not been thoroughly studied. Defining safe levels and the long-term effects of exposure is imperative to understanding and mitigating potential negative future outcomes. To perform these studies, we utilized zebrafish (Danio rerio), a commonly used vertebrate model system to study development. We observed the adverse effects of PCP on the development of zebrafish by using fluorescence microscopy, and saw that increased concentrations of PCP decreased the numbers of normal red blood cells and myeloid cells. Additionally, we observed that animal survival decreased in response to increasing concentrations of PCP. Furthermore, the prevalence of characteristic physical deformities such as tail curvature were greater in the treatment groups. Lastly, runx1, cmyb, and cd41 expression was reduced in fish treated with PCP. These results suggest that PCP has a previously underappreciated effect on blood and immune cell development and future studies should be performed to determine the molecular mechanisms involved."

Methods Automated analysis of pathology reports from a regional laboratory (accessioned 2011–2019) using validated computer code. Results The study set contained 574,099 pathology reports, reported by 63 pathologists. The average yearly L4E workload units/full-time equivalent for three hospital groups were 8,101.6, 6,906.5 and 4,215.8. The average Gini coefficient for full-time pathologists in the three hospital groups were respectively 0.05, 0.16 and 0.23. The average yearly SADs rates were respectively 13%, 16% and 9%. The group with the highest SADs rate had the intermediate Gini coefficient and intermediate workload. Conclusions High individual workload and work maldistribution appear to be associated with SADs. Individual workload maximums and greater transparency may be essential for limiting staff turnover, maintaining high morale, and efficient laboratory function with a high quality of care."
https://openalex.org/W4220994120,"Propagation of small amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregates (or seeds) has been suggested as a potential mechanism of Alzheimer's disease progression. Monitoring the propagation of Aβ seeds in an organism would enable testing of this hypothesis and, if confirmed, provide mechanistic insights. This requires a contrast agent for long-term tracking of the seeds. Gold nanorods combine several attractive features for this challenging task, in particular, their strong absorbance in the infrared (enabling optoacoustic imaging) and the availability of several established protocols for surface functionalisation. In this work, polymer-coated gold nanorods were conjugated with anti-Aβ antibodies and attached to pre-formed Aβ seeds. The resulting complexes were characterised for their optical properties by UV/Vis spectroscopy and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. The complexes retained their biophysical properties, i.e. their ability to seed Aβ fibril formation. They remained stable in biological media for at least 2 days and showed no toxicity to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells up to 1.5 nM and 6 μM of gold nanorods and Aβ seeds, respectively. Taken together, this study describes the first steps in the development of probes for monitoring the spread of Aβ seeds in animal models."

High, moderate and low penetrance variants have been identified with inter-ethnic variability in mutation frequency and spectrum. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify disease-associated SNPs. Understanding the functional impact of these risk-SNPs will help the translation of GWAS findings into clinical interventions. Here we aim to characterize the genetic patterns of high and moderate penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes and to assess the functional impact of non-coding SNPs. We analyzed BRCA1/2 , PTEN , STK11 , TP53 , ATM , BRIP1 , CHEK2 and PALB2 genotype data obtained from 135 healthy participants genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP-Array 6.0. Haplotype analysis was performed using Haploview.V4.2 and PHASE.V2.1. Population structure and genetic differentiation were assessed using principal component analysis (PCA) and fixation index (FST). Functional annotation was performed using In Silico web-based tools including RegulomeDB and VARAdb. Haplotype analysis showed distinct LD patterns with high levels of recombination and haplotype blocks of moderate to small size. Our findings revealed also that the Tunisian population tends to have a mixed origin with European, South Asian and Mexican footprints. Functional annotation allowed the selection of 28 putative regulatory variants. Of special interest were BRCA1_ rs8176318 predicted to alter the binding sites of a tumor suppressor miRNA hsa-miR-149 and PALB2_ rs120963 located in tumorigenesis-associated enhancer and predicted to strongly affect the binding of P53. Significant differences in allele frequencies were observed with populations of African and European ancestries for rs8176318 and rs120963 respectively. Our findings will help to better understand the genetic basis of breast cancer by guiding upcoming genome wide studies in the Tunisian population. Putative functional SNPs may be used to develop an efficient polygenic risk score to predict breast cancer risk leading to better disease prevention and management."
https://openalex.org/W4221103489,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most deadliest malignancies worldwide. Due to the dearth of appropriate biomarkers, the diagnosis of this mortal disease is usually deferred, in its turn, culminating in the failure of prevention. By the same token, proper biomarkers are at play in determining the quality of prognosis. In other words, the survival rate is contingent upon the regulation of such biomarkers.The information regarding expression (GSE41258, and GSE31905), methylation (GSE101764), and miRNA (dbDEMC) were downloaded. MEXPRESS and GEPIA confirmed the validated differentially expressed/methylated genes using TCGA data. Taking advantage of the correlation plots and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, expression and methylation profiles were compared. The interactions between validated differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNA were recognized and visualized by miRTarBase and Cytoscape, respectively. Then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub genes were established via STRING and Cytohubba plugin. Utilizing R packages (DOSE, Enrichplot, and clusterProfiler) and DAVID database, the Functional Enrichment analysis and the detection of KEGG pathways were performed. Ultimately, in order to recognize the prognostic value of found biomarkers, they were evaluated through drawing survival plots for CRC patients.In this research, we found an expression profile (with 13 novel genes), a methylation profile (with two novel genes), and a miRNA profile with diagnostic value. Concerning diagnosis, the expression profile was evaluated more powerful in comparison with the methylation profile. Furthermore, a prognosis-related expression profile was detected.In addition to diagnostic- and prognostic-applicability, the discerned profiles can assist in targeted therapy and current therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4220668659,"Transgenic proteins can be routinely expressed in various mammalian cell types via different transgenic systems, but the efficiency of transgene expression is constrained by the complex interplay among factors such as the temporal consistency of expression and compatibility with specific cell types, including ocular cells. Here, we report a more efficient way to express an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in human corneal fibroblasts, corneal epithelial cells, and conjunctival epithelial cells through a lentiviral expression system. The relative transducing unit criterion for EGFP-expressing pseudovirions was first determined in HEK-293T cells. Homogeneous populations of EGFP-positive and EGFP-negative cells could be isolated by cell sorting. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for puromycin was calculated according to viability curves for each cell type. The results revealed that cell types differed with respect to EGFP expression efficiency after transduction with the same amount of EGFP-encoding pseudovirions. Using a cell sorter, the homogeneity of EGFP-positive cells reached >95%. In the initial sorting stage, however, the efficiency of EGFP expression in the sorted cells was noticeably reduced after two rounds of sequential culture, but repeated sorting for up to four rounds yielded homogeneous EGFP-positive human corneal fibroblasts that could be maintained in continuous culture in vitro. The sorted EGFP-positive cells retained their proper morphology and cell type-specific protein expression patterns. Puromycin resistance was found to depend on cell type, indicating that the IC50 for puromycin must be determined for each cell type to ensure the isolation of homogeneous EGFP-positive cells. Taken together, repeated cell sorting is an efficient means of obtaining homogeneous populations of ocular cells expressing a transgenic protein during continuous culture without the potential confounding effects of antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4220722004,"Background Recent studies have suggested that chronic kidney disease is associated with cardiovascular disease, dementia, and frailty, all of which cause disability and early death. We investigated whether increased activity of urinary N -acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG), a marker of kidney injury, is associated with risk of disability or all-cause mortality in a general population. Methods Follow-up data from the Hidaka Cohort Study, a population-based cohort study of members of a Japanese rural community, were obtained via questionnaires completed by participants or their relatives. Multivariable analyses were used to investigate relations between urinary NAG activity–urinary creatinine concentration ratio and risk of disability or all-cause mortality. Results A total of 1182 participants were followed up for a median of 12.4 years. The endpoints were receipt of support under the public long-term care insurance program, and all-cause mortality. A total of 122 participants (10.3%) were reported to be receiving long-term care and 230 (19.5%) had died. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors along with physical activity, and using the quartile 1 results as a reference, the odds ratio (OR) for disability was 2.12 [95% confidence interval (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.04–4.33; p = 0.038) and the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.05–2.62; p = 0.031) in participants with urinary NAG/creatinine ratio in quartile 4. Similar results were obtained in participants without proteinuria: OR for disability, 2.46 (95% CI, 1.18–5.16; p = 0.017); and HR for all-cause mortality, 1.62 (95% CI, 1.00–2.63; p = 0.049).

https://openalex.org/W4220736247,"In the context of wildlife population declines, increasing computer power over the last 20 years allowed wildlife managers to apply advanced statistical techniques that has improved population size estimates. However, respecting the assumptions of the models that consider the probability of detection, such as N -mixture models, requires the implementation of a rigorous monitoring protocol with several replicate survey occasions and no double counting that are hardly adaptable to field conditions. When the logistical, economic and ecological constraints are too strong to meet model assumptions, it may be possible to combine data from independent surveys into the modelling framework in order to understand population dynamics more reliably. Here, we present a state-space model with an error process modelled on the log scale to evaluate wintering waterfowl numbers in the Camargue, southern France, while taking a conditional probability of detection into consideration. Conditional probability of detection corresponds to estimation of a detection probability index, which is not a true probability of detection, but rather conditional on the difference to a particular baseline. The large number of sites (wetlands within the Camargue delta) and years monitored (44) provide significant information to combine both terrestrial and aerial surveys (which constituted spatially and temporally replicated counts) to estimate a conditional probability of detection, while accounting for false-positive counting errors and changes in observers over the study period. The model estimates abundance indices of wintering Common Teal, Mallard and Common Coot, all species abundant in the area. We found that raw counts were underestimated compared to the predicted population size. The model-based data integration approach as described here seems like a promising solution that takes advantage of as much as possible of the data collected from several methods when the logistic constraints do not allow the implementation of a permanent monitoring and analysis protocol that takes into account the detectability of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W4220816352,"Background Cholera continues to cause morbidity and mortality in developing countries, including Tanzania. Since August 2015, Tanzania Mainland has experienced cholera outbreaks affecting 26 regions and a 1.6% case fatality rate. The current study determined the virulence factors, genetic relatedness and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the Vibrio cholerae isolated from different regions in Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional study that involved the genetic characterization of V . cholerae isolates from eleven regions in Tanzania was carried out. There were 99 V . cholerae isolates collected between January 2016 and December 2017. The study perfomed a Multi-locus Variable-number tandem-repeat analysis for genetic relatedness and Mismatch Amplification Mutation Analysis polymerase chain reaction for analyzing toxin genes. All the isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Kirby Bauer disk diffusion method. Data were generally analyzed using Microsoft excel, where genetic relatedness was analyzed using eBurst software v3. Results All isolates were V . cholerae O1. Ogawa was the most predominant 97(98%) serotype. Isolates were genetically related with a small genetic diversity and were positive for ctxA , tcpA El Tor virulence genes. All isolates (100%) were sensitive to doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, tetracycline, ceftriaxone, and chloramphenicol, while 87.8% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. A high resistance rate (100%) was detected towards erythromycin, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, and ampicillin. Conclusion The V . cholerae O1 serotypes Ogawa, El Tor variant predominantly caused cholera outbreaks in Tanzania with strains clonally related regardless of the place and time of the outbreak. Most of the isolates were susceptible to the antibiotic regimen currently used in Tanzania. The high resistance rate detected for the other common antibiotics calls for continuous antimicrobial susceptibility testing during outbreaks."

The diameters, depths, wall slope, and rim heights of the resulting craters were measured. The ejecta curtain was characterized by the inclination angle of walls, base diameter, and expansion velocity. The mass of the transferred material and the depth of the impactor penetration were also determined. Additionally, the results were used to calculate dimensionless parameters commonly considered in crater studies (πV, π2 and α). The texture of the sand most clearly influenced the diameters of the craters, its effect could also be seen in the case of the distance covered by the ejected material. This information appears to be relevant for future research, providing some rationale to help assess in which aspects of the phenomenon the texture may be important."
https://openalex.org/W4221030397,"Directed cell migration arises from cells following a microenvironmental gradient (e.g. of a chemokine) or polarizing feature (e.g. a linear structure). However cells not only follow, but in many cases, also generate directionality cues by modifying their microenvironment. This bi-directional relationship is seen in the alignment of extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers ahead of invading cell masses. The forces generated by many migrating cells cause fiber alignment, which in turn promotes further migration in the direction of fiber alignment via contact guidance and durotaxis. While this positive-feedback relationship has been widely described for cells invading en masse, single cells are also able to align ECM fibers, as well as respond to contact guidance and durotaxis cues, and should therefore exhibit the same relationship. In this study, we directly tested this hypothesis by studying the migration persistence of individual HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells migrating in photocrosslinked collagen matrices with limited remodeling potential. Our results demonstrate that this positive-feedback relationship is indeed a fundamental aspect of cell migration in fibrillar environments. We observed that the cells' inability to align and condense fibers resulted in a decrease in persistence relative to cells in native collagen matrices and even relative to isotropic (glass) substrates. Further experiments involving 2D collagen and electrospun polymer scaffolds suggest that substrates composed of rigid, randomly oriented fibers reduce cells' ability to follow another directionality cue by forcing them to meander to follow the available adhesive area (i.e. fibers). Finally, our results demonstrate that the bi-directional relationship between cell remodeling and migration is not a ""dimensionality"" effect, but a fundamental effect of fibrous substrate structure."
https://openalex.org/W4221044928,"The ubiquitous use of public touchscreen user interfaces for commercial applications has created a credible risk for fomite-mediated disease transmission. This paper presents results from a stochastic simulation designed to assess this risk. The model incorporates a queueing network to simulate people flow and touchscreen interactions. It also describes an updated model for microbial transmission using an asymmetric gradient transfer assumption that incorporates literature reviewed empirical data concerning touch-transfer efficiency between fingers and surfaces. In addition to natural decay/die-off, pathogens are removed from the system by simulated cleaning / disinfection and personal-touching rates (e.g. face, dermal, hair and clothing). The dose response is implemented with an exponential moving average filter to model the temporal dynamics of exposure. Public touchscreens were shown to pose a considerable infection risk (∼3%) using plausible default simulation parameters. Sensitivity of key model parameters, including the rate of surface disinfection is examined and discussed. A distinctive and important advancement of this simulation was its ability to distinguish between infection risk from a primary contaminated source and that due to the re-deposition of pathogens onto secondary, initially uncontaminated touchscreens from sequential use. The simulator is easily configurable and readily adapted to more general fomite-mediated transmission modelling and may provide a valuable framework for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4221052466,"Multi-exposure fusion (MEF) is a technique that combines different snapshots of the same scene, captured with different exposure times, into a single image. This combination process (also known as fusion) is performed in such a way that the parts with better exposure of each input image have a stronger influence. Therefore, in the result image all areas are well exposed. In this paper, we propose a new method that performs MEF and noise removal. Rather than denoising each input image individually and then fusing the obtained results, the proposed strategy jointly performs fusion and denoising in the Discrete Cosinus Transform (DCT) domain, which leads to a very efficient algorithm. The method takes advantage of spatio-temporal patch selection and collaborative 3D thresholding. Several experiments show that the obtained results are significantly superior to the existing state of the art."
https://openalex.org/W4221117619,"Background In recent years, emerging evidence has highlighted the role of vitamin D as an iron absorption enhancer by suppressing hepcidin concentration, albeit with an unclear underlying mechanism. Dietary-based approach in improving iron status has been widely practised, however, there is a scarcity in randomized controlled trials (RCT) to elucidate the effect of vitamin D-fortified juice on iron status recovery. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of an 8-week vitamin D3-fortified fruit juice supplementation on iron status indicators in childbearing-aged women with marginally low iron stores. Methods In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, RCT, a total of 120 women aged between 19–40 with serum ferritin &lt; 20 μg/l and fulfilled the eligibility criteria will be randomized into consuming either vitamin D3-fortified fruit juices containing 4000 IU (100 mcg) (vitamin D) or placebo-fruit juices (placebo) daily for eight weeks. At every 4-week interval, 10 ml fasting blood sample, information on dietary habit and anthropometric measurement will be collected. A mixed model repeated-measures analysis of variance will be performed to determine the effect of the intervention and the interaction with time points for all iron and vitamin D status blood biomarkers. Discussion Vitamin D supplementation in food fortification as a novel iron absorption enhancer might be a future and relevant alternative management of iron deficiency as opposed to the oral iron therapy that has poor adherence. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov: registration number NCT04618289 , registration date October 28, 2020, protocol ID JKEUPM-2020-033."
