https://openalex.org/W2981552290,"Multicellular organisms have co-evolved with complex consortia of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, collectively referred to as the microbiota1. In mammals, changes in the composition of the microbiota can influence many physiologic processes (including development, metabolism and immune cell function) and are associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases2. Alterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours-such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses-that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders3. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiota influence neuronal activity and host behaviour remain poorly defined. Here we show that manipulation of the microbiota in antibiotic-treated or germ-free adult mice results in significant deficits in fear extinction learning. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines and reduced activity in cue-encoding neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, selective re-establishment of the microbiota revealed a limited neonatal developmental window in which microbiota-derived signals can restore normal extinction learning in adulthood. Finally, unbiased metabolomic analysis identified four metabolites that were significantly downregulated in germ-free mice and have been reported to be related to neuropsychiatric disorders in humans and mouse models, suggesting that microbiota-derived compounds may directly affect brain function and behaviour. Together, these data indicate that fear extinction learning requires microbiota-derived signals both during early postnatal neurodevelopment and in adult mice, with implications for our understanding of how diet, infection, and lifestyle influence brain health and subsequent susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2981890739,"Age-associated chronic inflammation (inflammageing) is a central hallmark of ageing1, but its influence on specific cells remains largely unknown. Fibroblasts are present in most tissues and contribute to wound healing2,3. They are also the most widely used cell type for reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, a process that has implications for regenerative medicine and rejuvenation strategies4. Here we show that fibroblast cultures from old mice secrete inflammatory cytokines and exhibit increased variability in the efficiency of iPS cell reprogramming between mice. Variability between individuals is emerging as a feature of old age5-8, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To identify drivers of this variability, we performed multi-omics profiling of fibroblast cultures from young and old mice that have different reprogramming efficiencies. This approach revealed that fibroblast cultures from old mice contain 'activated fibroblasts' that secrete inflammatory cytokines, and that the proportion of activated fibroblasts in a culture correlates with the reprogramming efficiency of that culture. Experiments in which conditioned medium was swapped between cultures showed that extrinsic factors secreted by activated fibroblasts underlie part of the variability between mice in reprogramming efficiency, and we have identified inflammatory cytokines, including TNF, as key contributors. Notably, old mice also exhibited variability in wound healing rate in vivo. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis identified distinct subpopulations of fibroblasts with different cytokine expression and signalling in the wounds of old mice with slow versus fast healing rates. Hence, a shift in fibroblast composition, and the ratio of inflammatory cytokines that they secrete, may drive the variability between mice in reprogramming in vitro and influence wound healing rate in vivo. This variability may reflect distinct stochastic ageing trajectories between individuals, and could help in developing personalized strategies to improve iPS cell generation and wound healing in elderly individuals."

Numerous vegetable crops are severely affected and chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) is the most dominant and widely distributed begomovirus in chilli (Capsicum annuum) throughout the Indian subcontinent. Recently, CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used as a means to reduce geminivirus replication in infected plants. However, this approach was shown to have certain limitations such as the evolution of escape mutants. In this study, we used a novel, multiplexed guide RNA (gRNA) based CRISPR-Cas9 approach that targets the viral genome at two or more sites simultaneously. This tactic was effective in eliminating the ChiLCV genome without recurrence of functional escape mutants. Six individual gRNA spacer sequences were designed from the ChiLCV genome and in vitro assays confirmed the cleavage behaviour of these spacer sequences. Multiplexed gRNA expression clones, based on combinations of the above-mentioned spacer sequences, were developed. A total of nine-duplex and two-triplex CRISPR-Cas9 constructs were made. The efficacy of these constructs was tested for inhibition of ChiLCV infection in Nicotiana benthamiana. Results indicated that all the constructs caused a significant reduction in viral DNA accumulation. In particular, three constructs (gRNA5+4, gRNA5+2 and gRNA1+2) were most effective in reducing the viral titer and symptoms. T7E1 assay and sequencing of the targeted viral genome did not detect any escape mutants. The multiplexed genome-editing technique could be an effective way to trigger a high level of resistance against begemoviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of demonstrating the effectiveness of a multiplexed gRNA-based plant virus genome editing to minimize and eliminate escape mutant formation."
https://openalex.org/W2981551022,"The purpose of this study was to present and biomechanically evaluate several variations of the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), achieved by altering the slope of the lower leg support and by asumming different hip flexion angles. Electromyographic and 2D kinematic measurements were conducted to analyse muscle activity (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, gluteus maximus, erector spine and lateral head of the gastrocnemius), knee and hip joint torques during 6 variations of NHE. The study involved 18 adults (24.9 ± 3.7 years) with previous experience in resistance training, but with little or no experience with NHE. Increasing the slope of the lower leg support from 0° (standard NHE) to 20° and 40° enabled the participants to perform the exercise through a larger range of motion, while achieving similar peak knee and hip torques. Instructions for increased hip flexion from 0° (standard NHE) to 25°, 50° and 75° resulted in greater peak knee and hip torque, although the participants were not able to maintain the hip angle at 50° nor 75°. Muscle activity decreased or remained similar in all modified variations compared to the standard NHE for all measured muscles. Our results suggest that using the presented variations of NHE might contribute to optimization of hamstring injury prevention and rehabilitation programs, by providing appropriate difficulty for the individual's strength level and also allow eccentric strengthening at longer hamstring lengths."
https://openalex.org/W2981607720,"Pathogenic T helper (Th)17 cells are key mediators of autoimmune diseases such as uveitis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). However, the contribution of microRNAs (miRs) to the intrinsic control of pathogenic Th17 cells in EAU remains largely unknown. Here, we have reported that miR-223-3p was significantly up-regulated in interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein-specific Th17 cells, and its expression was enhanced by IL-23-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling. Knockdown of miR-223-3p decreased the pathogenicity of Th17 cells in a T-cell transfer model of EAU. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-223-3p directly repressed the expression of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3), and FOXO3 negatively regulated pathogenic Th17 cell responses partially via suppression of IL-23 receptor expression. Thus, our results reveal an important role for miR-223-3p in autoreactive Th17 cell responses and suggest a potential therapeutic avenue for uveitis.-Wei, Y., Chen, S., Sun, D., Li, X., Wei, R., Li, X., Nian, H. miR-223-3p promotes autoreactive Th17 cell responses in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) by inhibiting transcription factor FOXO3 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2981746815,"Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is de novo production of glucose from endogenous carbon sources. Although it is a commonly studied pathway, particularly in disease, there is a lack of consensus about substrate preference. Moreover, primary hepatocytes are the current gold standard for in vitro liver studies, but no direct comparison of substrate preference at physiological fasting concentrations has been performed. We show that mouse primary hepatocytes prefer glycerol to pyruvate/lactate in glucose production assays and 13C isotope tracing studies at the high concentrations commonly used in the literature, as well as at more relevant fasting, physiological concentrations. In addition, when glycerol, pyruvate/lactate, and glutamine are all present, glycerol is responsible for over 75% of all glucose carbons labeled. We also found that glycerol can induce a rate-limiting enzyme of GNG, glucose-6-phosphatase. Lastly, we suggest that glycerol is a better substrate than pyruvate to test in vivo production of glucose in fasting mice. In conclusion, glycerol is the major carbon source for GNG in vitro and in vivo and should be compared with other substrates when studying GNG in the context of metabolic disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2981412464,"Acetaminophen (APAP) is widely used as an antifebrile and analgesic drug at recommended doses, whereas an overdose of APAP can cause severe liver damage. The molecular mechanisms underlying APAP-induced liver damage remain incompletely understood. Carbon monoxide (CO), an end-product of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 activity, can confer anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties in cellular models of toxicity via regulation of mitochondrial function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of CO on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and CO's relationship to regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial signaling using CO-releasing molecules or low concentrations of CO applied as pretreatment or posttreatment. Using genetic deletion or knockdown approaches in alpha mouse liver cells or primary hepatocytes, respectively, we investigated the role of HO-1 and the mitophagy regulator protein Parkin on APAP-induced expression of the ER stress-associated apoptosis regulator cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine (CCAAT)/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). We found that CO induced Parkin expression in hepatocytes via the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-α/activating transcription factor-4 signaling pathway. Additionally, CO gas inhalation significantly alleviated APAP-induced liver damage in vivo and correspondingly reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels as well as proinflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of CHOP in liver tissues while dramatically increasing hepatic HO-1 and Parkin expression. We found that the protective effects of CO on APAP-induced liver damage were mediated by down-regulation of CHOP at a transcriptional and post-translational level via induction of HO-1 and Parkin, respectively, and associated with decreases in reactive oxygen species production and JNK phosphorylation. We conclude that CO may represent a promising therapeutic agent for APAP-induced liver injury.-Chen, Y., Park, H.-J., Park, J., Song, H.-C., Ryter, S. W., Surh, Y.-J., Kim, U.-H., Joe, Y., Chung, H.

https://openalex.org/W2982144879,"Examining the potential differences in diet quality among socioeconomic status (SES) subgroups in Mexican adults may help to explain SES disparities in the burden of non-communicable diseases. We determined the association between SES, gender and diet quality among Mexican adults. We analyzed data from adults participating in the subsample with dietary information from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (n = 2,400), and developed the Mexican Diet Quality Index based on the Mexican Dietary Guidelines. We tested the interaction between sex and SES indicators using multivariable linear regression models. Sex was not a modifier; therefore, the analyses were carried out in the overall sample of men and women. The mean age was 42 (SE = 0.4) years, the total diet quality score was 38 (SE = 0.4), and a high percentage of men and women were classified with reading/writing skills or 3–9 years of school. A higher percentage of adults were classified with high versus medium or low assets index. In the multivariable model further adjusted for the assets index, for adults with education in the reading and/or 3–9 years of schooling and those with ≥10 years of school, there was a 3.7 and 5.8 points lower total diet quality score than with adults with no reading/writing skills (p < 0.05). Likewise, in multivariable model further adjusted for educational level, the total diet quality score was 2.5 points and 3.3 points lower in adults classified with medium and high assets index, respectively, versus low assets index (p < 0.05). The difference between individuals with medium and high assets index was not statistically significant. Although there is currently better diet quality among adults with low SES, this needs to continue to be monitored as Mexico progress through the nutrition transition."
https://openalex.org/W2981611633,"Background The European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists (EUSOMA), which aims to standardize the quality of patient care in Europe, has defined quality indicators (QIs) for breast cancer (BC) care to assess compliance to current care standards. These QIs are a useful tool to evaluate care organizations. Only population-based studies are able to assess health system performance in “real-life” situations. This population-based study aimed to describe compliance with several EUSOMA QIs overall and according to patient and organizational factors in France. Methods 1 560 adult women with primary invasive non-metastatic BC diagnosed in 2012 were randomly selected among all incident BC from 16 French geographical areas covered by cancer registries. Twelve EUSOMA QIs were selected regarding diagnosis, treatment and staging. Results The minimum standard as proposed by EUSOMA was met for nine QIs related to pre-operative definitive diagnosis, multidisciplinary discussion and treatment (single surgery, breast conserving surgery (BCS) for small BC (<3cm), radiotherapy after BCS or mastectomy for regional BC (pN≥2a), hormonotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab). Low compliance was observed for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and staging imaging. Adherence to guidelines was usually lower in older patients and in patients with comorbidities. Multidisciplinary discussion was positively related to adherence to guidelines for diagnosis, staging practices (SNLB, imaging) and systemic treatments. Compliance also varied by area of residence and by place of first treatment. Conclusion This study provides the first current, comprehensive overview of BC quality care at a population level in France. The guidelines were correctly applied in percentage satisfying the EUSOMA standards for the diagnosis and treatment of BC, although staging practices (SLNB, imaging) can be improved. These results highlight the need for continuous measurement of adherence to guidelines to improve BC care."

https://openalex.org/W2982216706,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is central to triglyceride metabolism. Severely compromised LPL activity causes familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which is associated with very high plasma triglyceride levels and increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Currently, no approved pharmacological intervention can acutely lower plasma triglycerides in FCS. Low yield, high aggregation, and poor stability of recombinant LPL have thus far prevented development of enzyme replacement therapy. Recently, we showed that LPL monomers form 1:1 complexes with the LPL transporter glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein–binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and solved the structure of the complex. In the present work, we further characterized the monomeric LPL/GPIHBP1 complex and its derivative, the LPL–GPIHBP1 fusion protein, with the goal of contributing to the development of an LPL enzyme replacement therapy. Fusion of LPL to GPIHBP1 increased yields of recombinant LPL, prevented LPL aggregation, stabilized LPL against spontaneous inactivation, and made it resistant to inactivation by the LPL antagonists angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) or ANGPTL4. The high stability of the fusion protein enabled us to identify LPL amino acids that interact with ANGPTL4. Additionally, the LPL–GPIHBP1 fusion protein exhibited high enzyme activity in in vitro assays. Importantly, both intravenous and subcutaneous administrations of the fusion protein lowered triglycerides in several mouse strains without causing adverse effects. These results indicate that the LPL–GPIHBP1 fusion protein has potential for use as a therapeutic for managing FCS. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is central to triglyceride metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2981408919,"Chickpea production may be seriously threatened by Fusarium wilt, a disease caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris. F. oxysporum race 5 is the most important race in the Mediterranean basin. Recently, the region responsible for resistance race 5 has been delimited within a region on chromosome 2 that spans 820 kb. To gain a better understanding of this genomic region, we used a transcriptomic approach based on quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression profiles of 22 selected candidate genes. We used a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing in their sensitivity to Fusarium race 5 (resistant vs susceptible) to monitor the transcriptional changes over a time-course experiment (24, 48, and 72 hours post inoculation, hpi). Qualitative differences occurred during the timing of regulation. A cluster of 12 genes were induced by the resistant NIL at 24 hpi, whereas a second cluster contained 9 genes induced by the susceptible NIL at 48 hpi. Their possible functions in the molecular defence of chickpea is discussed. Our study provides new insight into the molecular defence against Fusarium race 5 and demonstrates that development of NILs is a rich resource to facilitate the detection of candidate genes. The new genes regulated here may be useful against other Fusarium races."
https://openalex.org/W2981650176,"Purpose The objective of this article is to examine the factors associated with smoking of flavor capsule cigarettes in Chile, where the popularity of these products has increased dramatically, a trend increasingly observed across the world. Methods A representative poll of 851 smokers in Metropolitan Santiago de Chile, which comprises 40% of the country's total population, was implemented in mid-2017. Smokers were given a questionnaire that collected socio-demographic information and information on smoking patterns. Four discrete-choice models were estimated on the decision to smoke flavor capsule cigarettes to better understand the statistical relationships between traits of smokers and the consumption of flavor capsule cigarettes. Results The results of these models show that each year less in a smoker’s age increases the likelihood of preferring flavor capsule cigarettes by, on average, between 0.8 and 0.9 percentage points. If the smoker is a woman, the likelihood of preferring flavor capsule cigarettes increases between 13.4 and 13.5 percentage points. Results also reveal a positive relationship between the price paid and the consumption of flavor capsule cigarettes, indicating that these cigarettes tend to be more expensive. There is no statistical relationship between participation in the labor market and smoking these products. Conclusions Chile has the world’s highest prevalence of flavor capsule cigarette smoking, which is concentrated among young people (25 years and younger) and females. No relationship between socioeconomic status and use of these products is found, though there are indications that such relationship may exist, as they were at the time of study 14% more expensive, on average, than conventional non-flavored cigarettes. As in most countries, the tobacco industry appears to be deliberately promoting these products with the goal of halting or slowing the decline in cigarette consumption in Chile. Thus, to reduce cigarette consumption (especially among youth), restricting or forbidding cigarette flavorings of all types, including flavor capsules, would be an effective strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2981818673,"Research on canopy arthropods has progressed from species inventories to the study of their interactions and networks, enhancing our understanding of how hyper-diverse communities are maintained. Previous studies often focused on sampling individual tree species, individual trees or their parts. We argue that such selective sampling is not ideal when analyzing interaction network structure, and may lead to erroneous conclusions. We developed practical and reproducible sampling guidelines for the plot-based analysis of arthropod interaction networks in forest canopies. Our sampling protocol focused on insect herbivores (leaf-chewing insect larvae, miners and gallers) and non-flying invertebrate predators (spiders and ants). We quantitatively sampled the focal arthropods from felled trees, or from trees accessed by canopy cranes or cherry pickers in 53 0.1 ha forest plots in five biogeographic regions, comprising 6,280 trees in total. All three methods required a similar sampling effort and provided good foliage accessibility. Furthermore, we compared interaction networks derived from plot-based data to interaction networks derived from simulated non-plot-based data focusing either on common tree species or a representative selection of tree families. All types of non-plot-based data showed highly biased network structure towards higher connectance, higher web asymmetry, and higher nestedness temperature when compared with plot-based data. Furthermore, some types of non-plot-based data showed biased diversity of the associated herbivore species and specificity of their interactions. Plot-based sampling thus appears to be the most rigorous approach for reconstructing realistic, quantitative plant-arthropod interaction networks that are comparable across sites and regions. Studies of plant interactions have greatly benefited from a plot-based approach and we argue that studies of arthropod interactions would benefit in the same way. We conclude that plot-based studies on canopy arthropods would yield important insights into the processes of interaction network assembly and dynamics, which could be maximised via a coordinated network of plot-based study sites."
https://openalex.org/W2981864540,"The known diversity of tetrapods of the Devonian period has increased markedly in recent decades, but their fossil record consists mostly of tantalizing fragments1–15. The framework for interpreting the morphology and palaeobiology of Devonian tetrapods is dominated by the near complete fossils of Ichthyostega and Acanthostega; the less complete, but partly reconstructable, Ventastega and Tulerpeton have supporting roles2,4,16–34. All four of these genera date to the late Famennian age (about 365–359 million years ago)—they are 10 million years younger than the earliest known tetrapod fragments5,10, and nearly 30 million years younger than the oldest known tetrapod footprints35. Here we describe Parmastega aelidae gen. et sp. nov., a tetrapod from Russia dated to the earliest Famennian age (about 372 million years ago), represented by three-dimensional material that enables the reconstruction of the skull and shoulder girdle. The raised orbits, lateral line canals and weakly ossified postcranial skeleton of P. aelidae suggest a largely aquatic, surface-cruising animal. In Bayesian and parsimony-based phylogenetic analyses, the majority of trees place Parmastega as a sister group to all other tetrapods. Three-dimensionally preserved fossils of Parmastega aelidae, a newly described tetrapod from the earliest Famennian (Late Devonian) of Russia, provide detailed insights into the morphology and palaeobiology of the earliest tetrapods."
https://openalex.org/W2981866324,"Objectives In Malaysia, there is exponential growth of patients on dialysis. Dialysis treatment consumes a considerable portion of healthcare expenditure. Comparative assessment of their cost effectiveness can assist in providing a rational basis for preference of dialysis modalities. Methods A cost utility study of hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was conducted from a Ministry of Health (MOH) perspective. A Markov model was also developed to investigate the cost effectiveness of increasing uptake of incident CAPD to 55% and 60% versus current practice of 40% CAPD in a five-year temporal horizon. A scenario with 30% CAPD was also measured. The costs and utilities were sourced from published data which were collected as part of this study. The transitional probabilities and survival estimates were obtained from the Malaysia Dialysis and Transplant Registry (MDTR). The outcome measures were cost per life year (LY), cost per quality adjusted LY (QALY) and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the Markov model. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results LYs saved for HD was 4.15 years and 3.70 years for CAPD. QALYs saved for HD was 3.544 years and 3.348 for CAPD. Cost per LY saved was RM39,791 for HD and RM37,576 for CAPD. The cost per QALY gained was RM46,595 for HD and RM41,527 for CAPD. The Markov model showed commencement of CAPD in 50% of ESRD patients as initial dialysis modality was very cost-effective versus current practice of 40% within MOH. Reduction in CAPD use was associated with higher costs and a small devaluation in QALYs. Conclusions These findings suggest provision of both modalities is fiscally feasible; increasing CAPD as initial dialysis modality would be more cost-effective."

Available CFTR modulators provide only modest clinical benefits, so alternative therapeutic targets are being explored. The anion-conducting transporter solute carrier family 26 member 9 (SLC26A9) is a promising candidate, but its functional expression is drastically reduced in cells that express the most common CF-associated CFTR variant, F508del–CFTR, through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Here, we examined the metabolic stability and location of SLC26A9 and its relationship to CFTR. Compared with SLC26A9 levels in BHK cells expressing SLC26A9 alone or with WT–CFTR, co-expression of SLC26A9 with F508del–CFTR reduced total and plasma membrane levels of SLC26A9. Proteasome inhibitors increased SLC26A9 immunofluorescence in primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBEs) homozygous for F508del–CFTR but not in non-CF pHBEs, suggesting that F508del–CFTR enhances proteasomal SLC26A9 degradation. Apical SLC26A9 expression increased when F508del–CFTR trafficking was partially corrected by low temperature or with the CFTR modulator VX-809. The immature glycoforms of SLC26A9 and CFTR co-immunoprecipitated, consistent with their interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Transfection with increasing amounts of WT–CFTR cDNA progressively increased SLC26A9 levels in F508del–CFTR-expressing cells, suggesting that WT–CFTR competes with F508del–CFTR for SLC26A9 binding. Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous SLC26A9 and transfection of a 3HA-tagged construct into well-differentiated cells revealed that SLC26A9 is mostly present at tight junctions. We conclude that SLC26A9 interacts with CFTR in both the ER and Golgi and that its interaction with F508del–CFTR increases proteasomal SLC26A9 degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2981758025,"The aim of this study was to identify the acute effects of a differential-learning training program on football kicking performance and countermovement jump. Twenty youth Portuguese under-15 football players participated in this study. All players were exposed to two training approaches: i) traditional, in which the players performed a total of 36 kicks in a blocked and repetitive approach; and ii) differential learning, which consisted in the 36 kicks using differential variations in each kick. Football kicking impact and velocity were assessed using a Stalker radar gun, while the kicking accuracy was assessed by aggregating the total number of points achieved during 12 kicks into a goal, which was divided into quantifiable scoring zones. Lastly, leg power was measured using a countermovement jump. Measurements were performed at baseline, post-intervention, and following a 35-minute training match. The comparisons between the baseline and post-test revealed that the differential learning approach promoted a possibly ~5% increase in the countermovement jump (small effects) and a likely ~3% increase in the average velocity (small effects) when compared with the traditional training approach. From the accuracy perspective, there was a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-test and post-match in accurate kicks into zone 1 (centre of the goal) and a moderate decrease from the baseline to the post-match in accurate kicks into zone 5 (lateral zones at short height) in the differential intervention. In turn, a small increase in the accurate kicks into zones 4 and 6 (lateral zones of the goal and nearest to the bar, respectively) was found from the baseline to the post-match in the differential intervention. Overall, the differential learning intervention was more beneficial than a traditional training protocol with respect to acute improvements in countermovement jump performance, football kicking velocity and higher scoring zones kicking accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2982166763,"Cristae architecture is important for the function of mitochondria, the organelles that play the central role in many cellular processes. The mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) together with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) forms the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex (MIB), a large protein complex present in mammalian mitochondria that partakes in the formation and maintenance of cristae. We report here a new subunit of the mammalian MICOS/MIB complex, an armadillo repeat-containing protein 1 (ArmC1). ArmC1 localizes both to cytosol and mitochondria, where it associates with the outer mitochondrial membrane through its carboxy-terminus. ArmC1 interacts with other constituents of the MICOS/MIB complex and its amounts are reduced upon MICOS/MIB complex depletion. Mitochondria lacking ArmC1 do not show defects in cristae structure, respiration or protein content, but appear fragmented and with reduced motility. ArmC1 represents therefore a peripheral MICOS/MIB component that appears to play a role in mitochondrial distribution in the cell."

We hypothesize that alteration in platelet TLR mRNA expression is a result of inflammation driving coronary atherosclerosis and may represent an alternative platelet activation pathway in ACS. TLR2-, TLR4- and TLR9- mRNA-expression was determined in ACS patients and compared to patients with invasive exclusion of atherosclerotic lesions of coronary arteries. Methods A total of fifty-four patients were enrolled in this clinical retrospective cohort single centre study. Total RNA from sepharose-filtered highly purified platelets was isolated using acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction and transcribed to cDNA using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit. To determine absolute copy numbers of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 we used plasmid based quantitative PCR with normalisation to an internal control. Results We found that mRNA expression levels of TLR2 but not TLR 4 and 9 are up-regulated in platelets of patients with ACS when compared to patients without coronary atherosclerosis. Conclusion Our results suggest elevated TLR2 mRNA expression in platelets as a biomarker reflecting the underlying inflammation in ACS and possibly severity of coronary atherosclerosis. Platelet TLR2 may represent a link between inflammation and atherothrombosis in ACS."
https://openalex.org/W2981355273,"Aberrant expression of CD5 has been reported in 5-10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). CD5+ DLBCL had been recognized as an aggressive immunophenotypic subgroup of DLBCL in the 2008 WHO classification of haematolymphoid neoplasm; however, it was eliminated from the list of subgroups of DLBCLs in the revised 2016 classification. Nevertheless, there is much controversy regarding the clinical significance of CD5 expression, and many researchers still assert that this subgroup exhibits an extremely unfavorable prognosis with frequent treatment failure. We retrospectively investigated 405 DLBCLs recruited from three university hospitals in Korea from 1997 to 2013. The clinical profile, immunophenotype, and chromosomal structural alterations of the BCL2 and MYC genes were compared according to CD5 expression. A total of 29 cases of de novo CD5+ DLBCL were identified out of 405 in our series (7.4%). Clinicopathologic correlation was performed in all 29 CD5+ DLBCLs and 166 CD5- DLBCLs which were eligible for full clinical review and further pathologic examination. Compared with CD5- counterparts, CD5+ DLBCLs showed female preponderance, frequent bone marrow involvement, higher lactate dehydrogenase level, advanced Ann Arbor stages and poorer prognosis (all p<0.05). Pathologically, the expression of CD5 positively correlated with that of BCL2, MYC and Ki-67 (all p<0.05). Coexpression of BCL2 and MYC, which is referred to as a double-expressor, was relatively more common in CD5+ DLBCL, whereas translocation or amplification of these genes was very rare. in conclusion, the expression of CD5 is an independent poor prognostic factor of DLBCLs, and this subgroup displays unique clinicopathologic features. Although the exact mechanism remains uncertain, consistent activation of BCL2 and MYC by alternative pathways other than chromosomal translocation may contribute to the pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2982278272,"This qualitative research study explored the role of masculinity in men’s engagement in the HIV care continuum in Côte d’Ivoire. The researchers conducted 73 in-depth interviews and 28 focus group discussions with 227 Ivoirian men between November and December 2016 across three urban sites. Participants in the study expressed that fear was the primary barrier to HIV testing and treatment. These men described five value domains–health, sexuality, work and financial success, family, and social status. Men saw HIV as a direct threat to their agency and strength with respect to each of these value domains, thus shedding light on their reluctance to discover their HIV status through HIV testing. With this data, the researchers created the Masculine Values Framework, a descriptive framework of masculine values that can be applied to better understand the behavior men exhibit in Côte d’Ivoire in the face of HIV. The Masculine Values Framework offers practical guidance for developing gender-sensitive HIV-focused social and behavior change programming in Côte d’Ivoire and similar contexts to reach the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets."
https://openalex.org/W2982004408,"Background GlycA is a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy biomarker that predicts risk of disease from myriad causes. It is heterogeneous; arising from five circulating glycoproteins with dynamic concentrations: alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), haptoglobin (HP), transferrin (TF), and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (AACT). The contributions of each glycoprotein to the disease and mortality risks predicted by GlycA remain unknown. Methods We trained imputation models for AAT, AGP, HP, and TF from NMR metabolite measurements in 626 adults from a population cohort with matched NMR and immunoassay data. Levels of AAT, AGP, and HP were estimated in 11,861 adults from two population cohorts with eight years of follow-up, then each biomarker was tested for association with all common endpoints. Whole blood gene expression data was used to identify cellular processes associated with elevated AAT. Results Accurate imputation models were obtained for AAT, AGP, and HP but not for TF. While AGP had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed variation in imputed AAT levels was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases over the eight year follow-up period, including heart failure (meta-analysis hazard ratio = 1.60 per standard deviation increase of AAT, P-value = 1×10−10), influenza and pneumonia (HR = 1.37, P = 6×10−10), and liver diseases (HR = 1.81, P = 1×10−6). Transcriptional analyses revealed association of elevated AAT with diverse inflammatory immune pathways. Conclusions This study clarifies the molecular underpinnings of the GlycA biomarker’s associated disease risk, and indicates a previously unrecognised association between elevated AAT and severe disease onset and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2982048632,"The PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a major role in triacylglycerol synthesis and the control of phospholipid synthesis. For its catalytic function on the nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, Pah1 translocates to the membrane through its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Pah1 phosphorylation on multiple serine/threonine residues is complex and catalyzed by diverse protein kinases. In this work, we demonstrate that Pah1 is phosphorylated by the YCK1-encoded casein kinase I (CKI), regulating Pah1 catalytic activity and phosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis coupled with phosphopeptide mapping of the CKI-phosphorylated Pah1 indicated that it is phosphorylated mainly on multiple serine residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis and phosphorylation analysis of Pah1, we identified eight serine residues (i.e. Ser-114, Ser-475, Ser-511, Ser-602, Ser-677, Ser-705, Ser-748, and Ser-774) as the target sites of CKI. Of these residues, Ser-475 and Ser-511 were specific for CKI, whereas the others were shared by casein kinase II (Ser-705), Cdc28-cyclin B (Ser-602), Pho85-Pho80 (Ser-114, Ser-602, and Ser-748), protein kinase A (Ser-667 and Ser-774), and protein kinase C (Ser-677). CKI-mediated phosphorylation of Pah1 stimulated both its phosphatidate phosphatase activity and its subsequent phosphorylation by casein kinase II. However, the CKI-mediated phosphorylation of Pah1 strongly inhibited its subsequent phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80, protein kinase A, and protein kinase C. In a reciprocal analysis, Pah1 phosphorylation by Pho85-Pho80 inhibited subsequent phosphorylation by CKI. CKI-mediated Pah1 phosphorylation was also inhibited by a peptide containing the Pah1 residues 506-517, including the kinase-specific Ser-511 residue. These findings advance our understanding of how Pah1 catalytic activity and phosphorylation are regulated by multiple protein kinases."

Previous assessments have shown substantial differences in terms of model strictness and agreement, but EU-wide data on how leading products in the various national markets perform against these health-minded nutrition criteria are unavailable.To evaluate the nutritional composition of the pre-packaged food offer in selected categories sold at scale in the EU using criteria of two nutrient profile models intended to restrict food marketing to children.The nutrient profile models of the private-sector EU Pledge and of the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Europe were applied to a commercial database with sales and nutritional information of 2691 pre-packaged products from five product categories (breakfast cereals, ready meals, processed meat, processed seafood, and yoghurts) and 20 EU countries. This study describes the criteria not met, the product ineligibility rates, and the distances to the various criteria thresholds.Between 48% (EU Pledge) and 68% (WHO Europe) of the 2691 products analysed were found to be ineligible for marketing to children. The criteria thresholds most often not met were those for total sugars (in breakfast cereals, yoghurts), salt (in processed meat, processed seafood, ready meals), and fibre (in breakfast cereals). Total and saturated fat criteria also played a substantial role in rendering yoghurt products ineligible, and the energy criterion did so for ready meals.A large number of food products selling at scale in the EU do not meet the criteria of two EU-level nutrient profile models intended to restrict food marketing to children. Given the considerable market share of many such products, they are likely to be consumed widely and in some cases regularly, including by children, even without being marketed to them. Nutrient profile models could serve as benchmarking tools for monitoring and evaluating food product reformulation efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2981533231,"The efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) reprogramming is extremely low in terms of production of cloned animals. Here, we found that telomere rejuvenation is a critical event for SCNT reprogramming. Through small-molecule screening, we identified that melatonin significantly improved the in vitro and in vivo developmental competence of SCNT-derived embryos. Through use of embryonic biopsy, single-cell RNA sequencing, and quantitative FISH experiments, we revealed that melatonin not only attenuated the zygotic genome activation defect but also facilitated telomere elongation in the SCNT embryos. Further investigation indicated that melatonin inhibited heterochromatic epigenetic modification related to gene silencing including DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation. In addition, melatonin could increase the level of activation markers such as acetylated histone H3. This is the first study to characterize melatonin-treatment and telomere rejuvenation in SCNT-mediated reprogramming. Moreover, combinational use of melatonin-treated donor embryos and pseudopregnant recipients achieved synergistic enhancement of the production of cloned animals.-Yang, L., Liu, X., Song, L., Su, G., Di, A., Bai, C., Wei, Z., Li, G.

https://openalex.org/W2981788775,"Blue light is an identified risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularization, is a major complication of the wet form of this disease. We investigated how blue light affects VEGF expression and secretion using A2E-loaded retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, a cell model of AMD. Incubation of RPE cells with A2E resulted in a significant increase in VEGF mRNA and, intracellular and secreted VEGF protein levels, but not mRNA levels of VEGFR1 or VEGFR2. Blue light exposure of A2E-loaded RPE cells resulted in a decrease in VEGF mRNA and protein levels, but an increase in VEGFR1 levels. The toxicity of 440 nm light on A2E-loaded RPE cells was enhanced by VEGF supplementation. Our results suggest that age-related A2E accumulation may result in VEGF synthesis and release. This synthesis of VEGF, which enhances blue light toxicity for the RPE cells, is itself suppressed by blue light. Anti-VEGF therapy may therefore improve RPE survival in AMD."
https://openalex.org/W2982232515,"The aim of this study was to quantify the burden of avoidable pediatric hospital admissions for Ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSC) and to identify factors related to these preventable hospitalizations. The study was conducted by retrospectively reviewing all medical records of children admitted in a non-teaching 474-bed acute care hospital located in Catanzaro (Italy) for an avoidable hospitalization diagnosis. Two control clinical records involving children hospitalized for clinical conditions not classified as ACSC were randomly selected for each clinical record that included an ACSC. Among the 4293 pediatric hospitalizations, 451 (10.5%) were judged to be preventable. Of these, the most frequent discharge diagnoses were: dehydration (29.7%), pneumonia (17.7%), seizures (15.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12.9%).Children admitted for a preventable hospitalization were more likely to be females, to be younger, to be residents in the same province as the hospital and less likely to have had at least one Community-Based Pediatrician (CBP) access in the previous year and to have used the district health service. The burden of pediatric preventable hospitalizations found in this study is quite high, and the results show that there is still work that lies ahead on the way to improve interaction between hospital and community-based services."
https://openalex.org/W2981617315,"Psychosocial problems are common among people living with HIV (PLWH) and have been cross-sectionally associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We evaluated the longitudinal relationship between psychosocial status and HRQoL among PLWH during the first year after diagnosis.A consecutive sample of newly diagnosed PLWH was recruited from Changsha Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Hunan Province, China. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 1 year later. The measures used in this study included the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Survey (MOS-HIV), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the HIV/AIDS Stress Scale (SS-HIV) and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). The trajectories of depression from baseline to 1-year follow-up were categorized into four groups: never (PHQ-9 < 10 at two time points), new-onset (PHQ-9 < 10 at baseline & PHQ-9 ≥ 10 at follow-up), recovered (PHQ-9 ≥ 10 at baseline & PHQ-9 < 10 at follow-up) and persistent depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10 at two time points). In addition, the trajectories of stress and social support were classified by calculating the proportions of participants whose stress and social support scores changed between baseline and 1-year follow-up by more than 0.5 effect size in either direction. Generalized linear models were used to examine the potential role of baseline and changes in psychosocial status in predicting the HRQoL at 1 year, after adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.A total of 410 participants completed both the baseline and 1-year follow-up surveys. Higher stress levels at baseline predicted a lower HRQoL at 1 year, while baseline depression status and social support did not predict 1-year HRQoL scores. Compared to those who were never depressed at both baseline and follow-up, participants who experienced new-onset or persistent depression had lower HRQoL at 1 year. Additionally, the 1-year HRQoL score of participants who recovered from depression by follow-up was comparable to that of participants who were never depressed. Moreover, participants who experienced increases in stress levels by follow-up had lower HRQoL scores at 1 year than those with decreases in stress levels. Changes in social support did not predict 1-year HRQoL scores in this study.Assessing psychosocial status regularly and implementing effective interventions targeted at psychosocial problems may be particularly important for PLWH to improve their HRQoL. Among PLWH, special attention should be given to those with new-onset or persistent depression and those with high stress levels at the time of diagnosis and increased stress levels 1 year after the new HIV diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2981977889,"Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab and aflibercept in the treatment of diabetic macular edema in a real world study, and to compare the two treatments with each other. Methods Retrospective observational study of 213 eyes from 141 patients with diabetic macular edema was completed between June 2014 and June 2016. 122 were treated with ranibizumab intravitreal injection and 91 with aflibercept intravitreal injection, with a loading phase of 3 injections and a Pro Re Nata protocol. The drug was selected by the physician and fluorescein angiography was performed by physician`s criteria. Re-treatment was performed when a decline in BCVA, an increase of central macular thickness or an increase or persistence of intraretinal fluid in OCT was observed. The primary outcome was the mean change in best corrected visual acuity at 1 year, while central macular thickness, central macular volume, the number of injections and visits were evaluated as secondary outcomes. The correlation between BCVA at 4th month visit and BCVA at 12th month visit was also evaluated. Results The mean baseline best corrected visual acuity for the eyes treated with ranibizumab was 0.55 (+/- 0.35) logMAR, and with aflibercept it was 0.48 (+/- 0.29) (P = 0.109). Best corrected visual acuity improved in both groups, and at the end of the follow-up was 0.40 (+/- 0.35) in the ranibizumab group and 0.40 (+/- 0.29) in the aflibercept group (P = 0.864). Best corrected visual acuity at 4th month visit is correlated at a high value (R = 0.789) with the one at the end of the study. No differences were found in central macular thickness, central macular volume and glycosylated hemoglobin when adjusting with baseline values. The overall number of injections was 5.77 (+/- 2.01), being 5.56 (+/- 2.0) in the ranibizumab group and 6.07 (+/- 1.99) in the aflibercept group (P = 0.069). The main outcome determining final best corrected visual acuity was the baseline best corrected visual acuity (P<0.001). Conclusion There are no differences in efficacy between ranibizumab and aflibercept in diabetic macular edema treatment in this real world study."
https://openalex.org/W2982174782,"Previous studies have documented an intrinsic association between breast cancer (BC) and thyroid cancer (TC), but the clinical relevance of this relationship is not well defined. In the present study, we specifically investigated the impact of a history of TC on clinical outcomes of BC. We performed a population-based comparative analysis of tumor behaviors and BC-specific mortalities in 427,893 female patients with BC in the USA Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 9 database (1973-2013). In this cohort of subjects, 2,569 patients also had a history of differentiated TC (BC/TC), including BC diagnosed before TC (BC-1st) and BC diagnosed after TC (TC-1st), with the median follow-up time of 81 (IQR, 33-160) months. We found that, compared with matched BC-only patients, less aggressive BC tumor behaviors occurred in BC/TC patients, as exemplified by a distant metastasis rate of 7.0% in the former versus 3.3% in the latter (P<0.001). In BC/TC, BC-1st, and TC-1st patients versus their matched BC-only patients, BC-specific mortalities were 11.3% versus 21.0%, 9.9% versus 26.4%, and 12.4% versus 16.9%. These corresponded to hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of 0.47 (0.42-0.53), 0.31 (0.26-0.37), and 0.72 (0.61-0.84), respectively (all P<0.001), being lowest in BC-1st patients <50 years old [HR = 0.22 (0.16-0.31)], which remained significant after adjustment for clinicopathological and socioeconomic factors. Estrogen/progesterone receptor expression in BC tumors was significantly higher in patients with BC/TC than matched BC-only patients, providing evidence that BC in the former was biologically unique. Thus, a history of TC, particularly in younger BC-1st patients, may identify BC as a unique disease entity characterized by a decreased disease-specific mortality risk. The results have potentially important clinical and biological implications for BC in this special patient population and encourage further studies to confirm."
https://openalex.org/W2981442790,"Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the main receptor for nitric oxide (NO) and a central component of the NO-cGMP pathway, critical to cardiovascular function. NO binding to the N-terminal sensor domain in sGC enhances the cyclase activity of the C-terminal catalytic domain. Our understanding of the structural elements regulating this signaling cascade is limited, hindering structure-based drug design efforts that target sGC to improve the management of cardiovascular diseases. Conformational changes are thought to propagate the NO-binding signal throughout the entire sGC heterodimer, via its coiled-coil domain, to reorient the catalytic domain into an active conformation. To identify the structural elements involved in this signal transduction cascade, here we optimized a cGMP-based luciferase assay that reports on heterologous sGC activity in Escherichia coli and identified several mutations that activate sGC. These mutations resided in the dorsal flaps, dimer interface, and GTP-binding regions of the catalytic domain. Combinations of mutations from these different elements synergized, resulting in even greater activity and indicating a complex cross-talk among these regions. Molecular dynamics simulations further revealed conformational changes underlying the functional impact of these mutations. We propose that the interfacial residues play a central role in the sGC activation mechanism by coupling the coiled-coil domain to the active site via a series of hot spots. Our results provide new mechanistic insights not only into the molecular pathway for sGC activation but also for other members of the larger nucleotidyl cyclase family."

Protein kinases and phosphatases have been described early on as key regulatory elements of the phosphorylated state of proteins. Tight spatial and temporal regulation of protein kinase and phosphatase activities has to be achieved in the cell to ensure accurate signal transduction. We demonstrated previously that phosphorylation of a membrane protein can lead to its topological rearrangement. Additionally, we found that both the rate and extent of topological rearrangement upon phosphorylation are lipid charge– and lipid environment–dependent.

We also demonstrate that the phosphorylation-induced topological switch of a membrane protein can be reversed upon protein dephosphorylation, revealing a new regulatory role for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles. Furthermore, we determined that the rate of topological rearrangement reversal is correlated with phosphatase activity and is influenced by the membrane’s lipid composition, presenting new insights into the spatiotemporal control of the protein phosphorylation state.

Signals transduced by kinases depend on the extent and duration of substrate phosphorylation. Therefore, tight regulation of protein kinase and phosphatase activity in space and time has to be achieved in the cell to ensure accurate signal transduction. This is achieved through a diversity of mechanisms, such as compartmentalization of both the protein kinase and phosphatase (18Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Kinase- and phosphatase-anchoring proteins: harnessing the dynamic duo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 (12149635): E203-E20610.1038/ncb0802-e203Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There are many kinase- and phosphatase-binding proteins, and their role is to tether their enzyme-binding partners to cellular sublocalization, thus streamlining signal transduction by placing these enzymes in close and targeted proximity to their substrates. Two archetypical examples of this process are type 1 protein phosphatase–targeting subunits (19Cohen P. Cohen P.T. Protein phosphatases come of age.J. Biol.

Together, these findings led to the conclusion that signal transduction through the cell does not simply occur via protein diffusion (22Kholodenko B.N. Cell-signaling dynamics in time and space.Nat.

Protein phosphorylation regulates the activity, location, and properties of a protein in multiple and complex ways. The effects of phosphorylation on a protein include changes in structural properties through allosteric effects, modification of protein–protein binding properties, and disorder–order– and order–disorder–coupled transitions (26Nishi H. Shaytan A. Panchenko A.R. Physicochemical mechanisms of protein regulation by phosphorylation.Front. Genet. 2014; 5 (25147561): 270Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that phosphorylation of a membrane protein can trigger its topological switch, with rates of topological change occurring on a scale of seconds (27Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Karlstaedt A. Taegtmeyer H. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic lipid-dependent modulation of protein topology by posttranslational phosphorylation.J. Biol.

Our results demonstrated how posttranslational modifications may influence membrane protein topology in a lipid-dependent manner, both along the organelle trafficking pathway and at their final destination. The goal of this study was to test the effects of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles on the topological (re)orientation of a membrane protein. We therefore determined the effects of dephosphorylation on the reversibility of phosphorylation-induced topological switching of a membrane protein, the impact of kinase/phosphatase compartmentalization, the consequences of variable dephosphorylation rates, and the influence of membrane lipid composition on membrane protein topological inversion rates and yields. To tackle these questions, we used a model membrane protein (lactose permease; LacY reconstituted in proteoliposomes, where we can control the lipid composition, the occurrence of phosphorylation (kP, Fig. 1) and the location and rate of dephosphorylation (kUP1 when the phosphatase is located outside of the proteoliposomes and kUP2 when the phosphatase is located in the proteoliposomes). Our strategy enabled us to determine rates of membrane protein topological switches from correct to incorrect (kF1) and from incorrect to correct (kF2). We uncovered a new dynamic and regulatory role of posttranslational phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the structure and function of membrane proteins that is linked to the local lipid environment of the protein. Our findings further our understanding of the roles played by membrane lipids in membrane protein topology and present new insights into the mechanisms of cellular signaling through posttranslational modifications of membrane proteins. We first developed a FRET-based assay to monitor extramembrane domain (EMD) 3The abbreviations used are: EMDextramembrane domainNTN-terminalIAEDANS5-(2-iodoacetyl)-amino-ethyl-amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acidTMDtransmembrane domainSCAMTMDsubstituted cysteine accessibility method for determining TMD orientationPEphosphatidylethanolamineRTKreceptor tyrosine kinasePGphosphatidylglycerolCLcardiolipinMPB3-(N-maleimidopropionyl) biocytinOGoctyl glucoside. flipping of LacY in proteoliposomes induced by a post-reconstitution change in lipid composition (28Vitrac H.

V331C was labeled by 1,5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) in the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) bundle, whose topology is insensitive to the lipid environment. When assessing NT and C6 EMDs, high FRET indicates correct orientation, whereas low FRET reflects the inverted orientation. Controls demonstrated that the Trp/IAEDANS LacY derivatives behave identically to near-WT LacY with respect to topology inversion, as determined previously by the substituted cysteine accessibility method for determining TMD orientation (SCAMTMD). extramembrane domain N-terminal 5-(2-iodoacetyl)-amino-ethyl-amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid transmembrane domain substituted cysteine accessibility method for determining TMD orientation phosphatidylethanolamine receptor tyrosine kinase phosphatidylglycerol cardiolipin 3-(N-maleimidopropionyl) biocytin octyl glucoside. We previously established that changing the net charge of EMDs C2/C4/C6 from +2/+2/+2 to −2/−2/−2 of LacY leads to topological reorientation of the N-terminal six-TMD bundle of LacY accompanied by solvent exposure of TMD VII in PE-containing cells, whereas a change to −2/0/−2 did not result in inversion (29Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. A polytopic membrane protein displays a reversible topology dependent on membrane lipid composition.EMBO J. 2002; 21 (11980707): 2107-211610.1093/emboj/21.9.2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This observation led us to use two different LacY charge templates to test the effects of posttranslational phosphorylation on topology. Using LacY charge templates −2/0/−2 and −2/+2/+2, where we engineered either one or two phosphorylation sites in EMD C6, we established that the sensitivity of a given membrane protein to posttranslational phosphorylation topological reorientation correlates with its native EMD charge state and the level of phosphorylation to which it may be subjected (27Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Karlstaedt A. Taegtmeyer H. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic lipid-dependent modulation of protein topology by posttranslational phosphorylation.J. Biol.

To minimize complexity, we opted to focus on LacY templates containing a single engineered phosphorylation site and investigate the impact of a single phosphorylation event regarding the potential for a given template to reorient across the lipid bilayer. Because LacY does not contain any native phosphorylation sites, we engineered a phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylation site in EMD C6 of LacY derivatives containing the above FRET pairs. The C-terminal His6-tagged LacY derivative can be purified to homogeneity and reconstituted into liposomes of Escherichia coli native lipid composition as well as liposomes mimicking that of eukaryotic membranes. Addition of excess kinase resulted in flipping of the C6 EMD followed by slower flipping of the NT EMD on a time scale of seconds (27Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Karlstaedt A. Taegtmeyer H. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic lipid-dependent modulation of protein topology by posttranslational phosphorylation.J. Biol.

MacLean D.M. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic membrane protein topological switching upon changes in phospholipid environment.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here we determined whether this phosphorylation-induced topological switch is reversible upon dephosphorylation. First we tested the reversibility of the phosphorylation-induced topological switch at steady state in proteoliposomes composed of WT E. coli lipid composition and containing LacY exhibiting one engineered PDK1 phosphorylation site, a change in the net charge of EMDs C2/C4/C6 to −2/0/−2, and a diagnostic cysteine in EMD C6 of LacY lacking all other cysteine residues. To test the effect of dephosphorylation on EMD C6 topology, the λ protein phosphatase was encapsulated in the proteoliposomes. Phosphorylation of LacY was triggered by addition of PDK1 to the outside of the proteoliposomes. Kinase activity was inhibited after 30-min incubation at 20 °C by addition of 10 mm GSK 2334470 (Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) 1227911-45-6), a PDK1-specific inhibitor. Assessment of the LacY phosphorylation state allowed us to determine that the phosphorylation levels of LacY are lower in the presence of encapsulated phosphatase (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and that they can be entirely abrogated upon simultaneous inhibition of PDK1 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). We validated that addition of 10 mm GSK 2334470 leads to full inhibition of PDK1, as evidenced by the absence of LacY phosphorylation in the presence of GSK 2334470 (Fig. S1A). Additionally, we verified that the reversibility of LacY phosphorylation is solely due to the action of the encapsulated phosphatase. We conducted the same experiments as described above using the “nonflipping” −2/+2/+2 LacY template, which has been shown to maintain its correct topological orientation upon addition of one phosphate group (27Vitrac H. MacLean D.M. Karlstaedt A. Taegtmeyer H. Jayaraman V. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. Dynamic lipid-dependent modulation of protein topology by posttranslational phosphorylation.J. Biol.

No changes in LacY phosphorylation state were observed in the presence or absence of encapsulated phosphatase or upon PDK1 inhibition (Fig. S2A), indicating the absence of “leakage” of the phosphatase activity or spontaneous dephosphorylation. As expected, no change in LacY topology was observed under the various conditions tested (Fig. S2B). Next we tested whether phosphorylation impacted the overall topological orientation of LacY. SCAMTMD assessment of EMD C6 topology at steady state (Fig. 2B) further revealed that dephosphorylation of LacY impacted its overall topological orientation. Indeed, full LacY topological inversion was observed in the presence of kinase only (Fig. 2B, lane 2), whereas mixed topologies were observed with encapsulated phosphatase (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Phosphorylation of LacY followed by its full dephosphorylation led to complete reversal to correct the topology (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Together, our results indicate that the level of dephosphorylation correlates with the amount of correct EMD C6 topology, with the majority of the topological switch observed upon complete phosphorylation of LacY. This finding is of particular importance for proteins undergoing multisite phosphorylation events, where an increasing local phosphate content could tip the scale toward topological switch. Because these multiple phosphorylation sites tend to cluster around the same region in a protein (30Schweiger R. Linial M. Cooperativity within proximal phosphorylation sites is revealed from large-scale proteomics data.Biol. Direct. 2010; 5 (20100358): 610.1186/1745-6150-5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Freschi L. Osseni M. Landry C.R.

Next we tested whether the rate of the topological switch is influenced by the rate of LacY dephosphorylation and/or compartmentalization of kinase and phosphatase. To do so, we measured the rate of phosphorylation-induced topological switch using proteoliposomes made of WT E. coli lipids. We used a LacY template exhibiting an engineered PDK1 phosphorylation site, a change in the net charge of EMD C2/C4/C6 to −2/0/−2, and a Trp/IAEDANS FRET pair allowing real-time monitoring of EMD C6 topology. In all cases, phosphorylation of LacY was triggered by addition of PDK1 to the solution. Real-time measurements were conducted under two conditions: both kinase and phosphatase are located in the same compartment (outside of proteoliposomes), or kinase and phosphatase are located on opposite sides of the membrane (phosphatase encapsulated in the proteoliposomes). By varying the phosphatase:kinase ratio, we were able to modulate the rate of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Our data (Fig. 3) demonstrated that the nature of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle influences the phosphorylation-induced topological rearrangement of LacY. One-phase exponential decay kinetics (Fig. 3B) are observed when kinase and phosphatase are located in different compartments (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occurring on two different LacY topomers), whereas more complex two/three-phase decay kinetics (Fig. 3A) are observed when kinase and phosphatase are in the same compartment (phosphorylation and dephosphorylation occurring on the same LacY topomer before its topological switch). One possible explanation for these differences lies in the sequestration effects occurring when enzyme concentrations (kinase and phosphatase) become equal and/or higher than that of the substrate (LacY) (32Blüthgen N. Bruggeman F.J. Legewie S. Herzel H. Westerhoff H.V. Kholodenko B.N. Effects of sequestration on signal transduction cascades.FEBS J. 2006; 273 (16478465): 895-90610.1111/j.1742-4658.2006.05105.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, LacY may be bound to phosphatase more often when phosphatase content increases, therefore preventing its topological inversion and changing the dynamics of the phosphorylation-induced topological switch. Additionally, we determined that the rate of the phosphorylation-induced topological switch is inversely correlated with the dephosphorylation rate, as evidenced by decreasing rates of inversion when increasing amounts of phosphatase are present (Fig. 3C). As expected, LacY topological flipping rates decrease when both kinase and phosphatase are located in the same compartment (Fig. 3A). In this case, the LacY topological switch is in direct competition with LacY dephosphorylation (as depicted in the diagram in Fig. 3A). When kUP1 < kF1, then LacY flipping is favored, and decreases in FRET follow a one-phase (ratio 1:0, no phosphatase) or two-phase decay (ratios 1:1 and 1:2). When kUP1 > kF1 (ratios 1:5 to 1:50), then phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles are occurring faster than LacY flipping. However, after LacY has flipped, it becomes trapped in its inverted topology because of the absence of phosphatase in the proteoliposomes, thus explaining the progressive shift of this equilibrium toward inverted LacY over time, independent of kinase:phosphatase molar ratios. These results indicate that the phosphorylation-induced topological switch of a membrane protein is favored under conditions where kinase activity/concentration is higher than phosphatase activity/concentration and when both enzymes are present in the same subcellular location. The probability of this inversion decreases significantly with increasing phosphatase activity/concentration. The determination that topological flipping rates are also influenced by the presence of different content of encapsulated phosphatase (Fig. 3B) prompted us to investigate the real-time reversibility of the phosphorylation-induced topological switch upon dephosphorylation. To do so, we used the same experimental conditions as in Fig. 3B (outside kinase, encapsulated phosphatase) with a 1:1 kinase:phosphatase molar ratio. Real-time measurements of the LacY topological switch were conducted with and without addition of kinase inhibitor (GSK 2334470). The results presented in Fig. 4A indicate that, upon inhibition of LacY phosphorylation (200 s after triggering LacY phosphorylation by addition of external PDK1), the topological switch can be reversed (i.e. return to LacY correct topology), as shown previously in steady-state topology determination (Fig. 2), with the rate of reverse topological switch (kF2 as depicted in Fig. 4B, 0.00394 ± 0.00014 s−1) close to the rate of topological switch in the presence of kinase only (kF1 as depicted in Fig. 4B, 0.00462 ± 0.00007 s−1). To further investigate the relationship between dephosphorylation rate and topological switch reversal, we modulated the level of phosphatase enzymatic activity by coencapsulating λ protein phosphatase with various amounts of one of its known inhibitors, ATP (Fig. 5).

Its systematic affinities were studied through cladistic and Bayesian analyses that included representatives of Gonyleptoidea; it was determined to represent a new monotypic family, Otilioleptidae fam. nov., occupying a basal position within the clade Laminata. This species shows accentuated troglomorphic traits, typical for troglobitic harvestmen: elongated appendages, depigmentation, reduction of eyes and fading of scutal sulci. Additionally, it almost lacks sexual dimorphism, the distal portion of coxa IV is not completely fused to the stigmatic segment, and penis morphology is remarkably divergent with other Laminata; these features cannot be attributed to cave adaptation and may reflect early lineage divergence. Otilioleptes marcelae is the first troglobitic gonyleptoid known from a lava tube. The xeric environments around the cave (Patagonian ecoregion) and the paleoenvironmental history of the area suggest the relictual character of O. marcelae. Scattered evidence supports a long time evolutionary scenario and a presumable relationship with the Chilean opiliofauna (especially with genus Osornogyndes). A comparative overview of all known troglobitic gonyleptoids is provided. The urgent need to protect this new species and its unique cave environment is emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W2982286205,"The replication of human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes requires E1 and E2 proteins as the viral trans-factors and the replication origin, located in the URR, as a cis-element. The minimal requirements for an HPV replication origin vary among different virus types but always include one or more binding sites for the E2 protein. The requirements for an E1 binding site seem to vary among different HPV genera, with alpha-HPV11 and -18 minimal origins able to replicate without E1 binding site in contrast to beta-HPV8. In the present article, we analysed the sequence requirements for the beta-HPV5 minimal origin of replication. We show that the HPV5 URR is able to replicate in U2OS cells without the sequence proposed as an E1 binding site, albeit at lower levels than wt URR, given that three E2 binding sites are intact and both viral replication proteins are present. The lack of an absolute requirement of the E1 binding site for the origin of replication of HPV5 led us to analyse whether the viral E1 and E2 proteins from other HPV types are competent to support replication from this origin. Surprisingly, the E1 and E2 proteins from beta-HPV types support replication from the origin in contrast to proteins from alpha-HPV types 11, -16, or -18. Furthermore, the replication proteins E1 and E2 of these alpha-HPV types are unable to support the replication of HPV5 URR, even if the E1 binding site is intact. In light of these results, we performed a detailed analysis of the ability of different combinations of E1 and E2 proteins from various alpha- and beta-HPV types to support the replication of URR sequences from the respective HPV types in the U2OS cell line."

Here, we present a detailed molecular dynamics study of RNase-ligand binding involving 22 compounds, spanning nearly five orders of magnitude in affinity, and totaling 8.8 μs of sampling with the standard Amber parameters and an additional 8.8 μs of sampling with a modified potential. We show that short-lived, solvent-mediated bridging interactions are crucial to RNase-ligand binding. We characterize the behavior of bridging solvent molecules, uncovering a power-law dependence between the lifetime of a solvent bridge and the probability of its occurrence. We also demonstrate that from an energetic perspective, bridging solvent in RNase A-ligand binding behaves like part of the enzyme, rather than the ligands. Moreover, we describe an automated pipeline for the detection and processing of bridging interactions, and offer an independent assessment of the performance of the state-of-the-art fixed-charge force fields.

https://openalex.org/W2981622142,"Growing evidence has suggested that autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7) plays an important role in insulin signaling, but the mechanism of ATG7 in hepatic insulin sensitivity is not fully understood. The purpose of the present study is to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of ATG7 in obesity development. Serum and liver samples from mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) were evaluated for metabolic profile data and ATG expressions during obesity development. We found that compared with other ATGs, ATG7 expression increased earlier with lower hepatic insulin sensitivity in the 4-wk HFD-fed mice. For in vitro analyses, silencing ATG7 significantly up-regulated insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and down-regulated phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) in HepG2 cells. Replenishing PTEN to ATG7-silenced hepatocytes restored the phosphorylated Akt level. Furthermore, ATG7 silencing led to higher c-JUN expression, which transcriptionally reduced PTEN expression. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which ATG7 regulates Akt phosphorylation via the c-JUN/PTEN pathway at the early stage of HFD-induced metabolic disorder.-Zhao, D., Zhang, S., Wang, X., Gao, D., Liu, J., Cao, K., Chen, L., Liu, R., Liu, J., Long, J.

https://openalex.org/W2981869768,"MAF1 homolog, negative regulator of RNA polymerase III (MAF1) is a key repressor of RNA polymerase (pol) III–dependent transcription and functions as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is frequently down-regulated in primary human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). However, this reduction in MAF1 protein levels does not correlate with its transcript levels, indicating that MAF1 is regulated post-transcriptionally. Here, we demonstrate that MAF1 is a labile protein whose levels are regulated through the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. We found that MAF1 ubiquitination is enhanced upon mTOR complex 1 (TORC1)–mediated phosphorylation at Ser-75. Moreover, we observed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin 2 (CUL2) critically regulates MAF1 ubiquitination and controls its stability and subsequent RNA pol III–dependent transcription. Analysis of the phenotypic consequences of modulating either CUL2 or MAF1 protein expression revealed changes in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and altered sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Repression of RNA pol III–dependent transcription by chemical inhibition or knockdown of BRF1 RNA pol III transcription initiation factor subunit (BRF1) enhanced HCC cell sensitivity to doxorubicin, suggesting that MAF1 regulates doxorubicin resistance in HCC by controlling RNA pol III–dependent transcription. Together, our results identify the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and CUL2 as important regulators of MAF1 levels. They suggest that decreases in MAF1 protein underlie chemoresistance in HCC and perhaps other cancers and point to an important role for MAF1 and RNA pol III–mediated transcription in chemosensitivity and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4255260925,"Amphibians are the focus of a recent debate and public attention owing to the global decline in their populations worldwide. Amphibians are one of the most threatened and poorly known groups of vertebrates in several geographic areas, even though they play a central role in their own ecosystems. At different levels, amphibians make their contribution to proper ecosystem functioning. They act as regulators of the food web and nutrient cycling, and they also provide several valuable ecosystem services, e.g., as a food source and as animal models for lab research. In this sense, it seems clear that the maintenance of amphibian diversity should be one of the major goals for the several countries where their population decline is observed. However, we are still struggling with the very first step of this process, i.e., the correct identification of the amphibian species diversity. Over the past few decades, research on molecular identification of amphibians using DNA barcoding has encountered some difficulties related to high variability in the mitochondrial genome of amphibians, and a research gap is noticeable in the literature. We herein evaluated both COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for the molecular identification of frogs and tadpoles in a large fragment of the South American Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results suggest that both COI and 16S rRNA are informative markers for the molecular identification of the amphibian specimens with all specimens unambiguously identified at the species level.

https://openalex.org/W2982200160,"Individual variability is evident in behavior and physiology of animals. Determining whether behavior at intake may predict subsequent illness in the animal shelter may influence the management of dogs housed at animal shelters and reduce overall disease. While normally associated with mild disease and low mortality rates, respiratory disease nevertheless poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the stressful environment of animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether behavior at intake can predict subsequent occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease in dogs at animal shelters. In a correlational study, 84 dogs were assessed throughout their stay at a city animal shelter. The dogs were subjected to a behavioral assessment, 1 min in-kennel behavioral observations across two observation periods, and the collection of urinary cortisol:creatinine (C:C) ratio. The occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease was monitored through repeated clinical exams (rectal temperature and the occurrence of nasal and ocular discharge, and presence of coughing and sneezing). A basic PLS Path regression model revealed that time in the shelter (estimate = .53, p < .001), and sociability (estimate = .24, p < .001) and curiosity scores (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and anxiety scores, however, were not associated with illness. Urinary C:C, taken on the first full day, did not predict subsequent illness when accounting for time. Limitations included attrition of dogs, a small percentage receiving vaccinations, and continuous and non-systematic rotation of dogs in the kennels. Understanding if behavior can predict subsequent illness may improve shelter management practices, and in turn, result in improved live-release outcomes."

The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of a digital decision support tool with that of standard practice for informed consent and to examine whether the tool can improve decisional capacity for higher functioning individuals. Methods Participants (N = 89; mean age = 21.2 years) were allocated to the experimental group (consenting information provided via the digital decision support tool), or the comparison group (information provided via standard practice). Participants were assessed on four aspects of decisional capacity (Understanding, Appreciating, Reasoning, and Expressing a choice). We used regression analyses to test the impact of the tool on each outcome, repeating the analyses on the higher functioning subsample. Results No differences existed in any domain of decisional capacity for the sample in full. However, participants in the higher IQ subsample who used the tool scored better on Understanding after adjustment (β = 0.25, p = 0.04), but not on Appreciating or Reasoning. No differences by experimental group existed in the decision to join the hypothetical trial for the full sample or higher functioning subsample. Conclusions A decision support tool shows promise for individuals with fragile X syndrome with higher cognitive abilities. Future studies should examine the level of cognitive ability needed for sufficient understanding, whether these findings can be translated to other clinical populations, and the impact of the tool in larger trials and on trial retention."

However, to date no consensus has been reached about which type of eco-feedback is the most effective. We aim to test the efficacy of different feedback techniques by providing participants with personalised information about the annual monetary costs of their home's standby power usage (i.e., appliances that consume electricity despite not being actively used). Using a sample of 708 participants we tested the following feedback strategies: advice, disaggregation, loss vs gain framing, social norms, and collective information. We measured the impact of each of these feedback conditions on knowledge and intention to change behaviour, and compared them to a control condition. Using both frequentist and Bayesian analyses, we found that relative to the control condition all the feedback strategies led participants to report significant gains in knowledge. Yet, neither the additional knowledge gains, nor the feedback approach used significantly affected behavioural intentions. Consequently, the results suggest that while a wide range of feedback strategies emphasizing the financial impact of standby power consumption can effectively improve knowledge, this approach alone is insufficient in inciting intentions to change energy consumption behaviours."

Here we studied changes in the length and cross-sectional area of four ligaments and tendons, (anterior cruciate ligament, patellar tendon, medial collateral ligament, lateral collateral ligament) in the tibiofemoral joint of female Yorkshire pigs through high-field magnetic resonance imaging throughout growth. Tissue lengths increased by 4- to 5-fold from birth to late adolescence across the tissues while tissue cross-sectional area increased by 10–20-fold. The anterior cruciate ligament and lateral collateral ligament showed allometric growth favoring change in length over change in cross-sectional area while the patellar tendon and medial collateral ligament grow in an isometric manner. Additionally, changes in the length and cross-sectional area of the anterior cruciate ligament did not increase as much as in the other ligaments and tendon of interest. Overall, these findings suggest that musculoskeletal soft tissue morphometry can vary within tissues of similar structure and within a single joint during post-natal growth."

In this study, we analysed some important dimensions that can effectively contribute in predicting which contact a user is going to call at time t. We improved a state of the art algorithm, that uses frequency and recency by adding temporal information as an additional dimension for predicting future calls. The proposed algorithm performs better in overall analysis, but more significantly there was an improvement in the prediction of top contacts of a user as compared to the base algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2981423626,"Otolith microanalysis is often used to assess population age structure and growth of fishes during their early stages. Shoal Bass Micropterus cataractae is a recently described species of conservation concern and little is known regarding factors affecting their recruitment. In 2004, Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) and the US National Park Service (NPS) stocked Shoal Bass marked with oxytetracycline (OTC) in the Chattahoochee River near Atlanta, Georgia in an effort to restore this population, creating known-age fish to examine the effect of environment on daily age accuracy. We obtained samples of stocked juvenile (<150 mm) Shoal Bass from standard monitoring that occurred approximately 30-60 days after stocking in the Chattahoochee River to 1) validate daily rings for estimating age, hatch dates, and growth rates for stocked age-0 Shoal Bass, and 2) evaluate the effect of habitat (location) on age bias. Shoal Bass otoliths were examined for OTC marks and daily rings were counted in reference to OTC marks to assess age estimation accuracy. Age estimation accuracy ranged from -2 to -25 days and was influenced by the environment where Shoal Bass were captured, with greater inaccuracy in colder water temperatures. Fish collected from locations with colder temperatures displayed closer spacing of daily rings, potentially leading to greater underestimation of age. Growth rates of stocked Shoal Bass, corrected for age estimation error, ranged from 0.5 mm/day to 0.8 mm/day. This study demonstrates the effect of environmental variability on age inaccuracy and subsequent interpretation of results. Incorporating methods to assess age estimation accuracy is needed to understand interspecific differences in recruitment among black bass species in the variety of natural and human-modified environments they inhabit."
https://openalex.org/W2981733116,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment method used in psychiatry; however, its cardiac safety has not been clearly demonstrated. The aim of the study was evaluation of the ECT effects on the myocardium based on troponin T concentrations and the following ECG parameters: the spatial QRS-T angle (QRS-TA), QRS duration (QRSd) and the corrected QT interval (QTc).In the study 44 patients (12 female and 32 male) were enrolled diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 21) and major depressive disorders (n = 23), according to the DSM-IVR criteria. All cases were undergoing ECT procedures. The mean age of the patients was 36.9±16 years (range: 18-74). Resting ECG was recorded before performing ECG and 1 hour after. The spatial QRS-TA was reconstructed from 12-lead ECG using the inverse Dower method. Troponin T concentration was assessed before the procedure and 6 hours after ECT.No significant changes to troponin T concentrations were observed during the ECT series. The pre-ECT value of the spatial QRS-TA was 41.1±18.9°. The follow-up examinations did not reveal any significant increase of this parameter (p = 0.09) in any of the consecutive measurements. There were no significant changes in the QTc interval duration or the QRS complex duration demonstrated before the third, fifth and last procedure in the cycle (p>0.05). No significant changes to troponin T concentrations were observed during the ECT series.Our findings indicate a lack of negative ECT effects on the risk of adverse cardiovascular events measured by the spatial QRS-T angle and cardiac troponin T concentration."
