https://openalex.org/W1989378721,"In Thailand, male Pteroptyx malaccae fireflies, congregated in trees, flash in rhythmic synchrony with a period of about 560 ± 6 msec (at 28°C). Photometric and cinematographic records indicate that the range of flash coincidence is of the order of ± 20 msec. This interval is considerably shorter than the minimum eye-lantern response latency and suggests that the Pteroptyx synchrony is regulated by central nervous feedback from preceding activity cycles, as in the human ""sense of rhythm,"" rather than by direct contemporaneous response to the flashes of other individuals. Observations on the development of synchrony among Thai fireflies indoors, the results of experiments on phase-shifting in the American Photinus pyralis and comparisons with synchronization between crickets and between human beings are compatible with the suggestion."

https://openalex.org/W2022127498,"The enzymatic hydroxylation of 3,4-benzpyrene was not detected in human placentas obtained after childbirth from nonsmokers, whereas this enzyme activity was present in placentas obtained from individuals who smoked cigarettes. The degree of induction of benzpyrene hydroxylase caused by cigarette smoking varied in different individuals. Treatment of pregnant rats with benzpyrene increased the activity of this hydroxylase in the placenta."

https://openalex.org/W1979863482,"A protein fraction obtained by gel filtration of a 105,000g supernatant of rat liver catalyzes three reactions of the hepatocarcinogen N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide with nucleic acid. Cofactor requirements and isotopic studies suggest that the reactive intermediates involved may be N-2-fluorenylhydroxylamine, and phosphate and sulfate esters of N-hydroxy-2-fluorenylacetamide."

https://openalex.org/W1973399278,"Activity of creatine kinase and aldolase in serum increased in 14 of 16 patients with recent onset of a psychotic reaction, and in five of six patients treated with psychotomimetic drugs. There was either no increase of these enzymes or a slight increase in severely agitated (or depressed) non-psychotic hospitalized patients and chronic psychotic patients. The increase of the enzymes preceded the onset of the acute psychotic symptoms in at least three cases, was highest during the first 2 weeks of a psychotic episode, and sometimes recurred throughout the illness, particularly at times of stress. The creatine kinase in the serum is primarily of the muscle type."
https://openalex.org/W2028136509,"Protein synthesis was studied in the pyramidal nerve cells of the CA3 region in the hippocampus of rats uring a behavioral test involving transfer of handedness. A new electrophoretic technique was used for separation of 10(-7) to 10(-9) gram of protein and radiometric determination of the various protein fractions. After interventricular administration of (3)H-leucine, protein synthesis of two fast-moving fractions was significantly higher bilaterally in the hippocampus of the trained rats. There was also a trend to lateralization of the highest protein synthesis to the learning side."
https://openalex.org/W1967466431,"Analyses of the lipids in five species of blue-green algae show that the fatty acids are largely the C(16) and C(18) acids. The only alga that could be grown heterotrophically, Chlorogloea, formed the triply unsaturated C(18) acid in the light but only the doubly unsaturated C(18) acid in the dark. Examination of these results and the results of others suggest that, except for one species, the more highly unsaturated acids are found in the morphologically more complex algae. The fatty acid compositions of blue-green algae are different from the fatty acid composition of the other prokaryotic organisms, the bacteria. It is speculated that the diversity of the patterns of fatty acid composition among the blue-green algae could be of phylogenetic significance."

https://openalex.org/W2041384006,"In this limited space I have attempted to convey information regarding progress in discovering the nature of human intelligence. By intensive factor-analytic investigation, mostly within the past 20 years, the multifactor picture of intelligence has grown far beyond the expectations of those who have been most concerned. A comprehensive, systematic theoretical model known as the ""structure of intellect"" has been developed to put rationality into the picture. The model is a cubical affair, its three dimensions representing ways in which the abilities differ from one another. Represented are: five basic kinds of operation, four substantive kinds of information or ""contents,"" and six formal kinds of information or ""products,"" respectively. Each intellectual ability involves a unique conjunction of one kind of operation, one kind of content, and one kind of product, all abilities being relatively independent in a population, but with common joint involvement in intellectual activity. This taxonomic model has led to the discovery of many abilities not suspected before. Although the number of abilities is large, the 15 category constructs provide much parsimony. They also provide a systematic basis for viewing mental operations in general, thus suggesting new general psychological theory. The implications for future intelligence testing and for education are numerous. Assessment of intellectual qualities should go much beyond present standard intelligence tests, which seriously neglect important abilities that contribute to problem-solving and creative performance in general. Educational philosophy, curriculum-building, teaching procedures, and examination methods should all be improved by giving attention to the structure of intellect as the basic frame of reference. There is much basis for expecting that various intellectual abilities can be improved in individuals, and the procedures needed for doing this should be clear."
https://openalex.org/W2069911400,"Thermal polymers of arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan have melanocyte-stimulating activity. The fact that similar polymers lack such activity indicates that the effect is related to the specific amino acid residues. The active polymers are discussed as a model of an evolutionary precursor of contemporary melanocyte-stimulating hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2084688574,"A hybrid mouse-hamster cell line was developed from a mouse cell line which produces a high titer of interferon and is sensitive to its action, and a hamster cell line which produces little interferon and is relatively insensitive to its action. Parental cell lines demonstrated complete species specificity with respect to interferon production and action. The hybrid cells produced interferon (or interferons) effective when tested on the mouse cell line and primary hamster cells; the hybrids were sensitive to the action of both mouse and hamster interferons. Hybrid cells produced ten times more hamster interferon than the parent hamster cell line and were eight times more sensitive to hamster interferon than the parent hamster cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2014690990,The temperature dependence of the areas under the proton magnetic resonance spectra of unfractionated yeast transfer RNA in 1.0 molar NaCl is a consequence of salt-induced aggregation and does not constitute a monitor of the melting of secondary molecular structure. Such melting can be observed by following the widths of the resonances in the various regions of the spectra. Peaks attributable to dihydrouracil and the methyl groups of the methylated bases are detected in the spectra of unfractionated transfer RNA and alanine transfer RNA.
https://openalex.org/W2082561131,"The native mouse of the Peruvian coastal desert, near latitude 6 degrees S, can survive on dry seed without drinking water, it bears young in winter, and it burrows in sand. House mice (which abound in other adjoining deserts) also tolerate dehydration, and in some areas may displace the native mice."
https://openalex.org/W2045263773,"Tritiated water applied to the surface of soil in a tropical rain forest was found in free water of the litter and top 18 centimeters of soil as long as 7 months after the application. Plant roots, even in the high-rainfall environment of a tropical rain forest, therefore are exposed to tritiated water for considerable periods of time after release."

The results, when compared with normative developmental data, are more typical of younger ages than of the chronological ages of the subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2017762177,"Suspended particulates in Pittsburgh air were collected on glass-fiber filters. The specific surface areas of particulates brushed from the filter surface varied from 1.55 to 4.51 square meters per gram when measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method with nitrogen and krypton, after 8-hour degassing of the samples at 25 degrees C. Specific surfaces of the same samples varied from 4.3 to 8.00 square meters per gram after 4-hour degassing at 200 degrees C. Bulk densities and densities of samples were 0.49 to 0.64 and 2.0 to 2.6 grams per cubic centimeter, respectively. These data provide some basis for explanation of unpredictable responses reported after inhalation of mixtures of pollutant gases and particles by animals and man; they should also assist in interpretation of gas-solid phase reactions in the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1990621250,"The Lesser Antillean lizards Anolis trinitatis and Anolis aenous were both apparently introduced to Trinidad where they are hybridizing. The parental species have 36 and 34 chromosomes, respectively. Hybrids have 35 chromosomes. Meiosis in hybrids is abnormal. There is an accumulation of cells at metaphase I, and poor homolog pairing, characterized by a low frequency of chiasmata and numerous univalents."

https://openalex.org/W1983717629,Water is separated from brines by a semipermeable membrane. Water flows by osmosis across the membrane into a sealed chamber where it creates pressure. This pressure is transmitted by a water-immiscible liquid piston to a second chamber where it effects reverse osmosis. Water-removal rates are calculated.
https://openalex.org/W2037739295,"In tests on mice, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC) was superior to atropine sulfate as an antidote for some carbamate insecticides and nicotine; it did not produce the traumatic and sometimes fatal reactions caused by atropine sulfate, although injections of the two antidotes provided equal protection against lethal oral doses of the carbamates Zectran, NIA-10242, and Lannate. The effects of TEAC were not evaluated against the carbamates Sevin and Baygon because acute oral toxicity values could not be determined. Results with Matacil were inconclusive. Tetraethylammonium chloride was not an effective antidote against the organophosphate Parathion, but its use fully eliminates the effects of nicotine intoxication."
